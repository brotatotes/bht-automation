 Strengthened  (δυναμουμενο). Present passive participle of late verb δυναμοω (from δυναμις), to empower, "empowered with all power." In LXX and papyri and modern Greek. In N.T. only here and Hebrews 11:34 and MSS. in Ephesians 6:10 (W H in margin).According to the might of his glory  (κατα το κρατος της δοξης αυτου). Κρατος is old word for perfect strength (cf. κρατεω, κρατιλος). In N.T. it is applied only to God. Here his might is accompanied by glory (Shekinah).Unto all patience and longsuffering  (εις πασαν υπομονην κα μακροθυμιαν). See both together also in James 5:10; 2 Corinthians 6:4; 2 Corinthians 6:6; 2 Timothy 3:10. Hυπομονη is remaining under (υπομενω) difficulties without succumbing, while μακροθυμια is the long endurance that does not retaliate (Trench).
