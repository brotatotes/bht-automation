 Delivered  (ερυσατο). First aorist middle indicative of ρυομα, old verb, to rescue. This appositional relative clause further describes God the Father's redemptive work and marks the transition to the wonderful picture of the person and work of Christ in nature and grace in verses Colossians 1:14-20, a full and final answer to the Gnostic depreciation of Jesus Christ by speculative philosophy and to all modern efforts after a "reduced" picture of Christ. God rescued us out from (εκ) the power (εξουσιας) of the kingdom of darkness (σκοτους) in which we were held as slaves.Translated  (μετεστησεν). First aorist active indicative of μεθιστημ and transitive (not intransitive like second aorist μετεστη). Old word. See 1 Corinthians 13:2. Changed us from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light.Of the Son of his love  (του υιου της αγαπης αυτου). Probably objective genitive (αγαπης), the Son who is the object of the Father's love like αγαπητος (beloved) in Matthew 3:17. Others would take it as describing love as the origin of the Son which is true, but hardly pertinent here. But Paul here rules out the whole system of aeons and angels that the Gnostics placed above Christ. It is Christ's Kingdom in which he is King. He has moral and spiritual sovereignty.
