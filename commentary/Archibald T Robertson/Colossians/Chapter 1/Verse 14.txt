 In whom  (εν ω). In Christ as in Ephesians 1:7. This great sentence about Christ carries on by means of three relatives (εν ω Colossians 1:14, ος Colossians 1:15, ος Colossians 1:18) and repeated personal pronoun (αυτος), twice with οτ (Colossians 1:15; Colossians 1:19), thrice with κα (Colossians 1:17; Colossians 1:18; Colossians 1:20), twice alone (Colossians 1:16; Colossians 1:20).Our redemption  (την απολυτρωσιν). See on Romans 3:24 for this great word (Koine), a release on payment of a ransom for slave or debtor (Hebrews 9:15) as the inscriptions show (Deissmann, Light, etc., p. 327).The forgiveness of our sins  (την αφεσιν των αμαρτιων). Accusative case in apposition with απολυτρωσιν as in Ephesians 1:7 ( remission , sending away, αφεσις, after theredemption  απολυτρωσις, buying back). Only here we have αμαρτιων (sins, from αμαρτανω, to miss) while in Ephesians 1:7 we find παραπτωματων (slips, fallings aside, from παραπιπτω).
