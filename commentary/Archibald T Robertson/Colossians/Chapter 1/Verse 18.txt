 The head of the body  (η κεφαλη του σωματος). Jesus is first also in the spiritual realm as he is in nature (verses Colossians 1:18-20). Paul is fond of the metaphor of the body (σωμα) for believers of which body Christ is the head (κεφαλη) as seen already in 1 Corinthians 11:3; 1 Corinthians 12:12; 1 Corinthians 12:27; Romans 12:5. See further Colossians 1:24; Ephesians 1:22; Ephesians 4:2; Ephesians 4:15; Ephesians 5:30.The church  (της εκκλησιας) Genitive case in explanatory apposition with του σωματος. This is the general sense of εκκλησια, not of a local body, assembly, or organization. Here the contrast is between the realm of nature (τα παντα) in verses Colossians 1:15-17 and the realm of spirit or grace in verses Colossians 1:18-20. A like general sense of εκκλησια occurs in Ephesians 1:22; Ephesians 5:24-32; Hebrews 12:23. In Ephesians 2:11-22 Paul uses various figures for the kingdom of Christ (commonwealth πολιτεια, verse Colossians 1:12, one new man εις ενα καινον ανθρωπον, verse Colossians 1:15, one body εν εν σωματ, verse Colossians 1:16, family of God οικειο του θεου, verse Colossians 1:19, building or temple οικοδομη and ναος, verses Colossians 1:20-22).Who  (ος). Causal use of the relative, "in that he is."The beginning  (η αρχη). It is uncertain if the article (η) is genuine. It is absolute without it. Christ has priority in time and in power. See Revelation 3:14 for his relation as αρχη to creation and 1 Corinthians 15:20; 1 Corinthians 15:23 for απαρχη used of Christ and the resurrection and Acts 3:14 for αρχηγος used of him as the author of life and Hebrews 2:10 of Jesus and salvation and Colossians 1:12-2 of Jesus as the pioneer of faith.That in all things he might have the preeminence  (ινα γενητα εν πασιν αυτος πρωτευων). Purpose clause with ινα and the second aorist middle subjunctive of γινομα, "that he himself in all things (material and spiritual) may come to (γενητα, not η, be) hold the first place" (πρωτευων, present active participle of πρωτευω, old verb, to hold the first place, here only in the N.T.). Christ is first with Paul in time and in rank. See Revelation 1:5 for this same use of πρωτοτοκος with των νεκρων (the dead).
