 And you  (κα υμας). Accusative case in a rather loose sentence, to be explained as the object of the infinitive παραστησα in verse Colossians 1:22 (note repeated υμας there) or as the anticipated object of αποκατηλλαξεν if that be the genuine form in verse Colossians 1:22. It can be the accusative of general reference followed by anacoluthon. See similar idiom in Ephesians 2:1; Ephesians 2:12.Being in time past alienated  (ποτε οντας απηλλοτριωμενους). Periphrastic perfect passive participle (continuing state of alienation) of απαλλοτριοω, old word from Plato on, to estrange, to render αλλοτριος (belonging to another), alienated from God, a vivid picture of heathenism as in Romans 1:20-23. Only other N.T. examples in Ephesians 2:12; Ephesians 4:18. Ενεμιες (εξθρους). Old word from εχθος (hatred). Active sense here,hostile  as in Matthew 13:28; Romans 8:7, not passivehateful  (Romans 11:28).In your mind  (τη διανοια). Locative case. Διανοια (δια, νους), mind, intent, purpose. Old word. It is always a tragedy to see men use their minds actively against God.In your evil works  (εν τοις εργοις τοις πονηροις). Hostile purpose finds natural expression in evil deeds.
