 Not holding fast the Head  (ου κρατων την κεφαλην). Note negative ου, not μη, actual case of deserting Christ as the Head. The Gnostics dethroned Christ from his primacy (Colossians 1:18) and placed him below a long line of aeons or angels. They did it with words of praise for Christ as those do now who teach Christ as only the noblest of men. The headship of Christ is the keynote of this Epistle to the Colossians and the heart of Paul's Christology.From whom  (εξ ου). Masculine ablative rather than εξ ης (κεφαλης) because Christ is the Head. He develops the figure of the body of which Christ is Head (Colossians 1:18; Colossians 1:24).Being supplied  (επιχορηγουμενον). Present passive participle (continuous action) of επιχορηγεω, for which interesting verb see already 2 Corinthians 9:10; Galatians 3:5 and further 2 Peter 1:5.Knit together  (συνβιβαζομενον). Present passive participle also (continuous action) of συνβιβαζω, for which see Colossians 2:2.Through the joints  (δια των αφων). Late word αφη (from απτω, to fasten together), connections (junctura and nexus in the Vulgate).And bonds  (κα συνδεσμων). Old word from συνδεω, to bind together. Aristotle and Galen use it of the human body. Both words picture well the wonderful unity in the body by cells, muscles, arteries, veins, nerves, skin, glands, etc. It is a marvellous machine working together under the direction of the head.Increaseth with the increase of God  (αυξε την αυξησιν του θεου). Cognate accusative (αυξησιν) with the old verb αυξε.
