 Though  (ε κα). Not κα ε (even if).Yet  (αλλα). Common use of αλλα in the apodosis (conclusion) of a conditional or concessive sentence.Your order  (την ταξιν). The military line (from τασσω), unbroken, intact. A few stragglers had gone over to the Gnostics, but there had been no panic, no breach in the line.Steadfastness  (στερεωμα). From στερεοω (from στερεος) to make steady, and probably the same military metaphor as in ταξιν just before. The solid part of the line which can and does stand the attack of the Gnostics. See Acts 16:5 where the verb στερεοω is used with πιστις and 1 Peter 5:9 where the adjective στερεος is so used. In 2 Thessalonians 3:6; 2 Thessalonians 3:8; 2 Thessalonians 3:11 Paul speaks of his own ταξις (orderly conduct).
