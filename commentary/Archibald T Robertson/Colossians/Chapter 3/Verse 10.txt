 And have put on  (κα ενδυσαμενο). First aorist middle participle (in causal sense as before) of ενδυνω, old and common verb (Latin induo, English endue) for putting on a garment. Used of putting on Christ (Galatians 3:27; Romans 13:14).The new man  (τον νεον). "The new (young as opposed to old παλαιον) man" (though ανθρωπον is not here expressed, but understood from the preceding phrase). In Ephesians 4:24 Paul has ενδυσασθα τον καινον (fresh as opposed to worn out) ανθρωπον.Which is being renewed  (τον ανακαινουμενον). Present passive articular participle of ανακαινοω. Paul apparently coined this word on the analogy of ανανεομα. Ανακαινιζω already existed (Hebrews 6:6). Paul also uses ανακαινωσις (Romans 12:2; Titus 3:5) found nowhere before him. By this word Paul adds the meaning of καινος to that of νεος just before. It is a continual refreshment (καινος) of the new (νεος, young) man in Christ Jesus.Unto knowledge  (εις επιγνωσιν). "Unto full (additional) knowledge," one of the keywords in this Epistle.After the image  (κατ' εικονα). An allusion to Genesis 1:26; Genesis 1:28. The restoration of the image of God in us is gradual and progressive (2 Corinthians 3:18), but will be complete in the final result (Romans 8:29; 1 John 3:2).
