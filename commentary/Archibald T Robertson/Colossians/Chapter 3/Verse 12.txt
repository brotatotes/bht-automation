 Put on therefore  (ενδυσασθε ουν). First aorist middle imperative of ενδυνω (verse Colossians 3:10). He explains and applies (ουν therefore) the figure of "the new man" as "the new garment."As God's elect  (ως εκλεκτο του θεου). Same phrase in Romans 8:33; Titus 1:1. In the Gospels a distinction exists between κλητος and εκλεκτος (Matthew 24:22; Matthew 24:24; Matthew 24:31), but no distinction appears in Paul's writings. Here further described as "holy and beloved" (αγιο κα ηγαπημενο). The items in the new clothing for the new man in Christ Paul now gives in contrast with what was put off (Colossians 3:8). The garments include a heart of compassion (σπλαγχνα οικτιρμου, the nobler viscera as the seat of emotion as in Luke 1:78; Philippians 1:8), kindness (χρηστοτητα, as in Galatians 5:22), humility (ταπεινοφροσυνην, in the good sense as in Philippians 2:3), meekness (πραυτητα, in Galatians 5:23 and in Ephesians 4:2 also with ταπεινοφροσυνη), long-suffering (μακροθυμιαν, in Galatians 5:22; Colossians 1:11; James 5:10).
