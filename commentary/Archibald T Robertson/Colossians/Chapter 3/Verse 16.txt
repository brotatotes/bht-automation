 The word of Christ  (ο λογος του Χριστου). This precise phrase only here, though "the word of the Lord" in 1 Thessalonians 1:8; 1 Thessalonians 4:15; 2 Thessalonians 3:1. Elsewhere "the word of God." Paul is exalting Christ in this Epistle. Χριστου can be either the subjective genitive (the word delivered by Christ) or the objective genitive (the word about Christ). See 1 John 2:14.Dwell  (ενοικειτω). Present active imperative of ενοικεω, to make one's home, to be at home.In you  (εν υμιν). Not "among you."Richly  (πλουσιως). Old adverb from πλουσιος (rich). See 1 Timothy 6:17. The following words explain πλουσιως.In all wisdom  (εν παση σοφια). It is not clear whether this phrase goes with πλουσιως (richly) or with the participles following (διδασκοντες κα νουθετουντες, see Colossians 1:28). Either punctuation makes good sense. The older Greek MSS. had no punctuation. There is an anacoluthon here. The participles may be used as imperatives as in Romans 12:11; Romans 12:16.With psalms  (ψαλμοις, the Psalms in the Old Testament originally with musical accompaniment),hymns  (υμνοις, praises to God composed by the Christians like 1 Timothy 3:16),spiritual songs  (ωιδαις πνευματικαις, general description of all whether with or without instrumental accompaniment). The same song can have all three words applied to it.Singing with grace  (εν χαριτ αιδοντες). In God's grace (2 Corinthians 1:12). The phrase can be taken with the preceding words. The verb αιδω is an old one (Ephesians 5:19) for lyrical emotion in a devout soul.In your hearts  (εν ταις καρδιαις υμων). Without this there is no real worship "to God" (τω θεω). How can a Jew or Unitarian in the choir lead in the worship of Christ as Saviour? Whether with instrument or with voice or with both it is all for naught if the adoration is not in the heart.
