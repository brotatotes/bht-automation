 Obey your parents  (υπακουετε τοις γονευσιν). Old verb to listen under (as looking up), to hearken, to heed, to obey.In all things  (κατα παντα). This is the hard part for the child, not occasional obedience, but continual. Surely a Christian father or mother will not make unreasonable or unjust demands of the child. Nowhere does modern civilization show more weakness than just here. Waves of lawlessness sweep over the world because the child was not taught to obey. Again Paul argues that this is "in the Lord" (εν Κυριω).
