 Provoke not  (μη ερεθιζετε). Present imperative of old verb from ερεθω, to excite. Only twice in N.T., here in bad sense, in good sense in 2 Corinthians 9:2 (to stimulate). Here it means to nag and as a habit (present tense).That they be not discouraged  (ινα μη αθυμωσιν). Negative purpose (ινα μη) with the present subjunctive (continued discouragement) of αθυμεω, old verb, but only here in N.T., from αθυμος (dispirited, α privative, θυμος, spirit or courage). One does not have to read Jane Eyre or Oliver Twist to know something of the sorrows of childhood as is witnessed by runaway children and even child suicides.
