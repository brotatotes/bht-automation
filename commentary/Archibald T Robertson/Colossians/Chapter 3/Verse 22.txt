 Your masters according to the flesh  (τοις κατα σαρκα κυριοις). "Lords" really, but these Christian slaves (δουλο) had Christ as lord, but even so they were to obey their lords in the flesh.Not with eye-service  (μη εν οφθαλμοδουλιαις). Another Pauline word (here only and Ephesians 6:6), elsewhere only in Christian writers after Paul, an easy and expressive compound, service while the master's eye was on the slave and no longer.Men-pleasers  (ανθρωπαρεσκο). Late compound only in LXX and Paul (here and Ephesians 6:6).In singleness of heart  (εν απλοτητ καρδιας). So in Ephesians 6:5. Old and expressive word from απλους (simple, without folds). See 2 Corinthians 11:3.Fearing the Lord  (φοβουμενο τον Κυριον). Rather than the lords according to the flesh.
