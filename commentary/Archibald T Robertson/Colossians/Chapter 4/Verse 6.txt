 Seasoned with salt  (αλατ ηρτυμενος). The same verb αρτυω (old verb from αιρω, to fit, to arrange) about salt in Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34. Nowhere else in the N.T. Not too much salt, not too little.

Every teacher will sympathize with Paul's desire "that ye know how ye must answer each one" (ειδενα πως δε υμας εν εκαστω αποκρινεσθα). Who does know?
