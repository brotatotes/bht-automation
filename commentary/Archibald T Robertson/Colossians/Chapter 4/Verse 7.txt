 All my affairs  (τα κατ' εμε παντα). "All the things relating to me." The accusative case the object of γνωρισε. The same idiom in Acts 25:14; Philippians 1:2.Tychicus  (Τυχικος). Mentioned also in Ephesians 6:21 as the bearer of that Epistle and with the same verb γνωρισε (future active of γνωριζω) and with the same descriptive epithet as here (ο αγαπητος αδελφος κα πιστος διακονος εν Κυριω, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord) except that here we have also κα συνδουλος (and fellow-servant). Abbott suggests that Paul adds συνδουλος because he had used it of Epaphras in Colossians 1:7. Perhaps πιστος goes with both substantives and means faithful to Paul as well as to Christ.
