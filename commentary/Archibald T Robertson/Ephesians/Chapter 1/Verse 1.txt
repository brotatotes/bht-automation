 Of Christ Jesus  (Χριστου Ιησου). So B D, though Aleph A L have Ιησου Χριστου. Paul is named as the author and so he is. Otherwise the Epistle is pseudepigraphic.By the will of God  (δια θεληματος θεου). As in 1 Corinthians 1:1; 2 Corinthians 1:1; Romans 1:1.At Ephesus  (εν Εφεσω). In Aleph and B these words are inserted by later hands, though both MSS. give the title Προς Εφεσιους. Origen explains the words τοις αγιοις τοις ουσιν as meaning "the saints that are" (genuine saints), showing that his MSS. did not have the words εν Εφεσω. The explanation of the insertion of these words has already been given in the remarks on "The Destination" as one copy of the general letter that was preserved in Ephesus. It is perfectly proper to call it the Epistle to the Ephesians if we understand the facts.
