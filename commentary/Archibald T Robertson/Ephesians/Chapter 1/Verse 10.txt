 Unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times  (εις οικονομιαν του πληρωματος των καιρων). See Colossians 1:25 for οικονομιαν. In Galatians 4:4 "the fulness of the time" (το πληρωμα του χρονου) the time before Christ is treated as a unit, here as a series of epochs (καιρων). Cf. Mark 1:15; Hebrews 1:1. On πληρωμα see also Romans 11:26; Ephesians 3:19; Ephesians 4:13.To sum up  (ανακεφαλαιωσασθα). Purpose clause (amounting to result) with first aorist middle infinitive of ανακεφαλαιοω, late compound verb ανα and κεφαλαιοω (from κεφαλαιον, Hebrews 8:1, and that from κεφαλη, head), to head up all things in Christ, a literary word. In N.T. only here and Romans 13:9. For the headship of Christ in nature and grace see Colossians 1:15-20.
