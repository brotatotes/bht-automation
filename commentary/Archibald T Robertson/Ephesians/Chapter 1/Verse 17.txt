 The Father of glory  (ο πατηρ της δοξης). The God characterized by glory (the Shekinah, Hebrews 9:5) as in Acts 7:2; 1 Corinthians 2:8; 2 Corinthians 1:3; James 2:1.That--may give  (ινα--δωιη). In Colossians 1:9 ινα is preceded by αιτουμενο, but here the sub-final use depends on the general idea asking in the sentence. The form δωιη is a late Koine optative (second aorist active) for the usual δοιη. It occurs also in 2 Thessalonians 3:16; Romans 15:5; 2 Timothy 1:16; 2 Timothy 1:18 in the text of Westcott and Hort. Here B 63 read δω (like John 15:16) second aorist active subjunctive, the form naturally looked for after a primary tense (παυομα). This use of the volitive optative with ινα after a primary tense is rare, but not unknown in ancient Greek.A spirit of wisdom and revelation  (πνευμα σοφιας κα αποκαλυψεως). The Revised Version does not refer this use of πνευμα to the Holy Spirit (cf. Galatians 6:1; Romans 8:15), but it is open to question if it is possible to obtain this wisdom and revelation apart from the Holy Spirit.In the knowledge of him  (εν επιγνωσε αυτου). In the full knowledge of Christ as in Colossians.
