 Having the eyes of your heart enlightened  (πεφωτισμενους τους οφθαλμους της καρδιας υμων). A beautiful figure, the heart regarded as having eyes looking out toward Christ. But the grammar is difficult. There are three possible interpretations. One is an anacoluthon, the case of πεφωτισμενους being changed from the dative υμιν (to you) to the accusative because of the following infinitive like εκλεξαμενους (Acts 15:22) after αποστολοις. Another way of explaining it is to regard it as a tertiary predicate of δωιη, a loose expansion of πνευμα. The third way is to regard the construction as the accusative absolute, a rare idiom possible in Acts 26:3; 1 Corinthians 16:3; 1 Timothy 2:6. In this case, the participle merely agrees with τους οφθαλμους, not with υμιν, "the eyes of your heart having been enlightened." Otherwise τους οφθαλμους is the accusative retained after the passive participle.That ye may know  (εις το ειδενα). Final use of εις το and the infinitive (second perfect of οιδα) as in verse Ephesians 1:12. Note three indirect questions after ειδενα (what the hope τις η ελπις, what the riches τις ο πλουτος, and what the surpassing greatness κα τ το υπερβαλλον μεγεθος). When the Holy Spirit opens the eyes of the heart, one will be able to see all these great truths.In the saints  (εν τοις αγιοις). Our riches is in God, God's is in his saints.
