 Far above all rule  (υπερανω πασης αρχης). Late compound adverbial preposition (υπερ, ανω) with the ablative case. In N.T. only here and Hebrews 9:5. As in Colossians 1:16, so here Paul claims primacy for Jesus Christ above all angels, aeons, what not. These titles all were used in the Gnostic speculations with a graduated angelic hierarchy.World  (αιων). "Age." See this identical expression in Matthew 12:32 for the present time (Galatians 1:4; 1 Timothy 6:17) and the future life (Ephesians 2:7; Luke 20:35). Both combined in Mark 10:30; Luke 18:30.
