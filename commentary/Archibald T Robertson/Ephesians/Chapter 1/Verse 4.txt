 Even as he chose us in him  (καθως εξελεξατο ημας εν αυτω). First aorist middle indicative of εκλεγω, to pick out, to choose. Definitive statement of God's elective grace concerning believers in Christ.Before the foundation of the world  (προ καταβολης κοσμου). Old word from καταβαλλω, to fling down, used of the deposit of seed, the laying of a foundation. This very phrase with προ in the Prayer of Jesus (John 17:24) of love of the Father toward the Son. It occurs also in 1 Peter 1:20. Elsewhere we have απο (from) used with it (Matthew 25:34; Luke 11:50; Hebrews 4:3; Hebrews 9:26; Revelation 13:8; Revelation 17:8). But Paul uses neither phrase elsewhere, though he has απο των αιωνων (from the ages) in Ephesians 3:9. Here in Ephesians 1:3-14. Paul in summary fashion gives an outline of his view of God's redemptive plans for the race.That we should be  (εινα ημας). Infinitive of purpose with the accusative of general reference (ημας). See Colossians 1:22 for the same two adjectives and also κατενωπιον αυτου.
