 Having abolished  (καταργησας). First aorist active participle of καταργεω, to make null and void.The enmity  (την εχθραν). But it is very doubtful if την εχθραν (old word from εχθρος, hostile, Luke 23:12) is the object of καταργησας. It looks as if it is in apposition with to μεσοτοιχον and so the further object of λυσας. The enmity between Jew and Gentile was the middle wall of partition. And then it must be decided whether "in his flesh" (εν τη σαρκ αυτου) should be taken with λυσας and refer especially to the Cross (Colossians 1:22) or be taken with καταργησας. Either makes sense, but better sense with λυσας. Certainly "the law of commandments in ordinances (τον νομον των εντολων εν δογμασιν) is governed by καταργησας.That he might create  (ινα κτιση). Final clause with first aorist active subjunctive of κτιζω.The twain  (τους δυο). The two men (masculine here, neuter in verse Ephesians 2:14), Jew and Gentile.One new man  (εις ενα καινον ανθρωπον). Into one fresh man (Colossians 3:9-11) "in himself" (εν αυτω). Thus alone is it possible.Making peace  (ποιων ειρηνην). Thus alone can it be done. Christ is the peace-maker between men, nations, races, classes.
