 According to the course of this world  (κατα τον αιωνα του κοσμου τουτου). Curious combinations of αιων (a period of time), κοσμος (the world in that period). See 1 Corinthians 1:20 for "this age" and 1 Corinthians 3:9 for "this world."The prince of the power of the air  (τον αρχοντα της εξουσιας του αερος). Αηρ was used by the ancients for the lower and denser atmosphere and αιθηρ for the higher and rarer. Satan is here pictured as ruler of the demons and other agencies of evil. Jesus called him "the prince of this world" (ο αρχων του κοσμου τουτου, John 16:11).That now worketh  (του νυν ενεργουντος). Those who deny the existence of a personal devil cannot successfully deny the vicious tendencies, the crime waves, in modern men. The power of the devil in the lives of men does explain the evil at work "in the sons of disobedience" (εν τοις υιοις της απεθιας). In Ephesians 5:6 also. A Hebrew idiom found in the papyri like "sons of light" (1 Thessalonians 5:5).
