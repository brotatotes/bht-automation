 Each several building  (πασα οικοδομη). So without article Aleph B D G K L. Οικοδομη is a late word from οικος and δεμω, to build for building up (edification) as in Ephesians 4:29, then for the building itself as here (Mark 13:1). Ordinary Greek idiom here calls for "every building," not for "all the building" (Robertson, Grammar, p. 772), though it is not perfectly clear what that means. Each believer is called a ναος θεου (1 Corinthians 3:16). One may note the plural in Mark 13:1 (οικοδομα) of the various parts of the temple. Perhaps that is the idea here without precise definition of each οικοδομη. But there are examples of πας without the article where "all" is the idea as in πασης κτισεως (all creation) in Colossians 1:15.Fitly framed together  (συναρμολογουμενη). Double compound from συν and αρμολογος (binding, αρμος, joint and λεγω), apparently made by Paul and in N.T. only here and Ephesians 4:16. Architectural metaphor.Into a holy temple  (εις ναον αγιον). The whole structure with all the οικοδομα. Another metaphor for the Kingdom of God with which compare Peter's "spiritual house" (οικος πνευματικος) in which each is a living stone being built in (1 Peter 2:5).
