 Ye also are builded together  (κα υμεις συνοικοδομεισθε). Ye Gentiles also. Present passive indicative (continuous process) of common old verb συνοικοδομεω, to build together with others or out of varied materials as here. Only here in N.T. In 1 Peter 2:5 Peter uses οικοδομεισθε for the same process.For a habitation  (εις κατοικητηριον). Late word (LXX), in N.T. only here and Revelation 18:2. From κατοικεω, to dwell, as Ephesians 3:17. Possibly each of us is meant here to be the "habitation of God in the Spirit" and all together growing (αυξε) "into a holy temple in the Lord," a noble conception of the brotherhood in Christ.
