 We also all  (κα ημεις παντες). We Jews.Once lived  (ανεστραφημεν ποτε). Second aorist passive indicative of αναστρεφω, old verb, to turn back and forth, to live (2 Corinthians 1:12). Cf. ποτε περιεπατησατε, of the Gentiles in verse Ephesians 2:2.The desires  (τα θεληματα). Late and rare word except in LXX and N.T., from θελω, to will, to wish. Plural here "the wishes," "the wills" of the flesh like ταις επιθυμιαις της σαρκος just before. Gentiles had no monopoly of such sinful impulses.Of the mind  (των διανοιων). Plural again, "of the thoughts or purposes."Were by nature children of wrath  (ημεθα τεκνα φυσε οργης). This is the proper order of these words which have been the occasion of much controversy. There is no article with τεκνα. Paul is insisting that Jews as well as Gentiles ("even as the rest") are the objects of God's wrath (οργης) because of their lives of sin. See Romans 2:1-3 for the full discussion of this to Jews unpalatable truth. The use of φυσε (associative instrumental case of manner) is but the application of Paul's use of "all" (παντες) as shown also in Romans 3:20; Romans 5:12. See φυσε of Gentiles in Romans 2:14. The implication of original sin is here, but not in the form that God's wrath rests upon little children before they have committed acts of sin. The salvation of children dying before the age of responsibility is clearly involved in Romans 5:13.
