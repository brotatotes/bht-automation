 For by grace  (τη γαρ χαριτ). Explanatory reason. "By the grace" already mentioned in verse Ephesians 2:5 and so with the article.Through faith  (δια πιστεως). This phrase he adds in repeating what he said in verse Ephesians 2:5 to make it plainer. "Grace" is God's part, "faith" ours.And that  (κα τουτο). Neuter, not feminine ταυτη, and so refers not to πιστις (feminine) or to χαρις (feminine also), but to the act of being saved by grace conditioned on faith on our part. Paul shows that salvation does not have its source (εξ υμων, out of you) in men, but from God. Besides, it is God's gift (δωρον) and not the result of our work.
