 That ye faint not  (μη ενκακειν). Object infinitive with μη after αιτουμα. The infinitive (present active) ενκακειν is a late and rare word (see already Luke 18:1; 2 Thessalonians 3:13; 2 Corinthians 4:1; 2 Corinthians 4:16; Galatians 6:9) and means to behave badly in, to give in to evil (εν, κακος). Paul urges all his apostolic authority to keep the readers from giving in to evil because of his tribulations for them.Your glory  (δοξα υμων). As they could see.
