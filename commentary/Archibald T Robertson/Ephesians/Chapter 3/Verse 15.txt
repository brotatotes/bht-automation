 Every family  (πασα πατρια). Old word (πατρα is the usual form) from πατηρ, descent from a common ancestor as a tribe or race. Some take it here as = πατροτης, fatherhood, but that is most unlikely. Paul seems to mean that all the various classes of men on earth and of angels in heaven get the name of family from God the Father of all.
