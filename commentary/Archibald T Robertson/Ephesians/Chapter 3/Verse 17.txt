 That Christ may dwell  (κατοικησα τον Χριστον). Another infinitive (first aorist active) after ινα δω. Κατοικεω is an old verb to make one's home, to be at home. Christ (Χριστον accusative of general reference) is asked to make his home in our hearts. This is the ideal, but a deal of fixing would have to be done in our hearts for Christ.Being rooted and grounded in love  (εν αγαπη ερριζωμενο κα τεθεμελιωμενο). But it is not certain whether εν αγαπη should go with these participles or with the preceding infinitive κατοικησα (dwell). Besides, these two perfect passive participles (from ριζοω, old verb, in N.T. only here and Colossians 2:7, and from θεμελιοω, see also Colossians 1:23) are in the nominative case and are to be taken with ινα εξισχυσητε and are proleptically placed before ινα. Verse Ephesians 3:18 should really begin with these participles. Paul piles up metaphors (dwelling, rooted, grounded).
