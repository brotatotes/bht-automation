 And to know  (γνωνα τε). Second aorist active infinitive with εξισχυσητε.Which passeth knowledge  (την υπερβαλλουσαν της γνωσεως). Ablative case γνωσεως after υπερβαλλουσαν (from υπερβαλλω). All the same Paul dares to scale this peak.That ye may be filled with all the fulness of God  (ινα πληρωθητε εις παν το πληρωμα του θεου). Final clause again (third use of ινα in the sentence) with first aorist passive subjunctive of πληροω and the use of εις after it. One hesitates to comment on this sublime climax in Paul's prayer, the ultimate goal for followers of Christ in harmony with the injunction in Matthew 5:48 to be perfect (τελειο) as our heavenly Father is perfect. There is nothing that any one can add to these words. One can turn to Romans 8:29 again for our final likeness to God in Christ.
