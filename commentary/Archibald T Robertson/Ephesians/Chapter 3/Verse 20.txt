 That is able to do  (τω δυναμενω ποιησα). Dative case of the articular participle (present middle of δυναμα). Paul is fully aware of the greatness of the blessings asked for, but the Doxology ascribes to God the power to do them for us.Above all  (υπερ παντα). Not simply παντα, but υπερ beyond and above all.Exceedingly abundantly  (υπερεκπερισσου). Late and rare double compound (υπερ, εκ, περισσου) adverb (LXX, 1 Thessalonians 3:10; 1 Thessalonians 5:13; Ephesians 3:20). It suits well Paul's effort to pile Pelion on Ossa.That we ask  (ων αιτουμεθα). Ablative of the relative pronoun attracted from the accusative α to the case of the unexpressed antecedent τουτων. Middle voice (αιτουμεθα) "we ask for ourselves."Or think  (η νοουμεν). The highest aspiration is not beyond God's "power" (δυναμιν) to bestow.
