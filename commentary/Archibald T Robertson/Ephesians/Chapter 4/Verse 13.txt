 Till we all attain  (μεχρ καταντησωμεν ο παντες). Temporal clause with purpose idea with μεχρ and the first aorist active subjunctive of κατανταω, late verb, to come down to the goal (Philippians 3:11). "The whole" including every individual. Hence the need of so many gifts.Unto the unity of the faith  (εις την ενοτητα της πιστεως). "Unto oneness of faith" (of trust) in Christ (verse Ephesians 4:3) which the Gnostics were disturbing.And of the knowledge of the Son of God  (κα της επιγνωσεως του υιου του θεου). Three genitives in a chain dependent also on την ενοτητα, "the oneness of full (επι-) knowledge of the Son of God," in opposition to the Gnostic vagaries.Unto a full-grown man  (εις ανδρα τελειον). Same figure as in Ephesians 2:15 and τελειος in sense of adult as opposed to νηπιο (infants) in Ephesians 4:14.Unto the measure of the stature  (εις μετρον ηλικιας). So apparently ηλικια here as in Luke 2:52, not age (John 9:21). Boys rejoice in gaining the height of a man. But Paul adds to this idea "the fulness of Christ" (του πληρωματος του Χριστου), like "the fulness of God" in Ephesians 3:19. And yet some actually profess to be "perfect" with a standard like this to measure by! No pastor has finished his work when the sheep fall so far short of the goal.
