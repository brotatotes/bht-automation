 One God and Father of all  (εις θεος κα πατηρ παντων). Not a separate God for each nation or religion. One God for all men. See here the Trinity again (Father, Jesus, Holy Spirit).Who is over all  (ο επ παντων),and through all  (κα δια παντων),and in all  (κα εν πασιν). Thus by three prepositions (επι, δια, εν) Paul has endeavoured to express the universal sweep and power of God in men's lives. The pronouns (παντων, παντων, πασιν) can be all masculine, all neuter, or part one or the other. The last "in all" is certainly masculine and probably all are.
