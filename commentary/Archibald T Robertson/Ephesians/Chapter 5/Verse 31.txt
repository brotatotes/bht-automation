 For this cause  (αντ τουτου). "Answering to this" = ενεκεν τουτου of Genesis 2:24, in the sense of αντ seen in ανθ' ων (Luke 12:3). This whole verse is a practical quotation and application of the language to Paul's argument here. In Matthew 19:5 Jesus quotes Genesis 2:24. It seems absurd to make Paul mean Christ here by ανθρωπος (man) as some commentators do.
