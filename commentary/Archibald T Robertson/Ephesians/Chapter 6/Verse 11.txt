 Put on  (ενδυσασθε). Like Ephesians 3:12. See also Ephesians 4:24.The whole armour  (την πανοπλιαν). Old word from πανοπλος (wholly armed, from παν, οπλον). In N.T. only Luke 11:22; Ephesians 6:11; Ephesians 6:13. Complete armour in this period included "shield, sword, lance, helmet, greaves, and breastplate" (Thayer). Our "panoply." Polybius gives this list of Thayer. Paul omits the lance (spear). Our museums preserve specimens of this armour as well as the medieval coat-of-mail. Paul adds girdle and shoes to the list of Polybius, not armour but necessary for the soldier. Certainly Paul could claim knowledge of the Roman soldier's armour, being chained to one for some three years.That ye may be able to stand  (προς το δυνασθα υμας στηνα). Purpose clause with προς το and the infinitive (δυνασθα) with the accusative of general reference (υμας) and the second aorist active infinitive στηνα (from ιστημ) dependent on δυνασθα. Against (προς). Facing. Another instance of προς meaning "against" (Colossians 2:23).The wiles of the devil  (τας μεθοδιας του διαβολου). See already Ephesians 4:14 for this word. He is a crafty foe and knows the weak spots in the Christian's armour.
