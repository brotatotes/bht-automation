 For which I am an ambassador in chains  (υπερ ου πρεσβευω εν αλυσε). "For which mystery" of the gospel (verse Ephesians 6:19). Πρεσβευω is an old word for ambassador (from πρεσβυς, an old man) in N.T. only here and 2 Corinthians 5:20. Paul is now an old man (πρεσβυτης, Philemon 1:9) and feels the dignity of his position as Christ's ambassador though "in a chain" (εν αλυσε, old word αλυσις, from α privative and λυω, to loosen). Paul will wear a chain at the close of his life in Rome (2 Timothy 1:16).In it  (εν αυτω). In the mystery of the gospel. This is probably a second purpose (ινα), the first for utterance (ινα δοθη), this for boldness (ινα παρρησιασωμα, first aorist middle subjunctive, old word to speak out boldly). See 1 Thessalonians 2:2. See Colossians 4:4 for "as I ought."
