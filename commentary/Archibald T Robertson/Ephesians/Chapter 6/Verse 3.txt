 That it may be well with thee  (ινα ευ σο γενητα). From Exodus 20:12, "that it may happen to thee well."And thou mayest live long on the earth  (κα εση μακροχρονιος επ της γης). Here εση (second person singular future middle) takes the place of γενη in the LXX (second person singular second aorist middle subjunctive). Μακροχρονιος is a late and rare compound adjective, here only in N.T. (from LXX, Exodus 20:12).
