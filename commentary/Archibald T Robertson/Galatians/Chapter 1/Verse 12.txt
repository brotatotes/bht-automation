 Nor was I taught it  (ουτε εδιδαχθην). He did not receive it "from man" (παρα ανθρωπων, which shuts out both απο and δια of verse Galatians 1:1), whether Peter or any other apostle, nor was he taught it in the school of Gamaliel in Jerusalem or at the University of Tarsus. He "received" his gospel in one way, "through revelation of Jesus Christ" (δι' αποκαλυψεως Ιησου Χριστου). He used παρελαβον in 1 Corinthians 15:3 about the reception of his message from Christ. It is not necessary to say that he had only one (because of the aorist active παρελαβον, from παραλαμβανω, for it can very well be constative aorist) revelation (unveiling) from Christ. In fact, we know that he had numerous visions of Christ and in 1 Corinthians 11:23 he expressly says concerning the origin of the Lord's Supper: "I received (παρελαβον, again) from the Lord." The Lord Jesus revealed his will to Paul.
