 My manner of life  (την εμην αναστροφην). Late word in this sense from Polybius on from αναστρεφομα. In the older writers it meant literally "return" or "turning back." See 1 Peter 1:15. It is absent in this sense in the papyri though the verb is common.In the Jews' religion  (εν τω Ιουδαισμω). "In Judaism." The word in N.T. only here and next verse, already in II Macc. 2:21; 8:1; 14:38; IV Macc. 4:26. In these passages it means the Jewish religion as opposed to the Hellenism that the Syrian Kings were imposing upon the Jews. So later Justin Martyr (386 D) will use Χριστιανισμος for Christianity. Both words are made from verbs in -ιζω.Beyond measure  (καθ' υπερβολην). "According to excess" (throwing beyond, υπερβολη).I persecuted  (εδιωκον). Imperfect active, "I used to persecute" (see Galatians 1:7-9 for the facts).Made havock of it  (επορθουν αυτην). Customary action again, imperfect of old verb πορθεω, to lay waste, to sack. In N.T. only here, verse Galatians 1:23, and Acts 9:31 (used by Christians in Damascus of Saul after his conversion of his former conduct, the very word of Paul here). Paul heard them use it of him and it stuck in his mind.
