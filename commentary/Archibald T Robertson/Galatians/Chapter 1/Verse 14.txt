 I advanced  (προεκοπτον). Imperfect active again of προκοπτω, old verb, to cut forward (as in a forest), to blaze a way, to go ahead. In N.T. only here, Romans 13:12; 2 Timothy 2:16; 2 Timothy 3:9; 2 Timothy 3:13. Paul was a brilliant pupil under Gamaliel. See Philippians 3:4-6. He was in the lead of the persecution also.Beyond many of mine own age  (υπερ πολλους συνηλικιωτας). Later compound form for the Attic ηλικιωτης which occurs in Dion Hal. and inscriptions (from συν, with, and ηλικια, age). Paul modestly claims that he went "beyond" (υπερ) his fellow-students in his progress in Judaism.More exceedingly zealous  (περισσοτερως ζηλοτης). Literally, "more exceedingly a zealot." See on Acts 1:13; Acts 21:20; 1 Corinthians 14:12. Like Simon Zelotes.For the traditions of my fathers  (των πατρικων μου παραδοσεων). Objective genitive after ζηλοτης. Πατρικων only here in N.T., though old word from πατηρ (father), paternal, descending from one's father. For πατρωιος see Acts 22:3; Acts 22:14. Tradition (παραδοσις) played a large part in the teaching and life of the Pharisees (Mark 7:1-23). Paul now taught the Christian tradition (2 Thessalonians 2:15).
