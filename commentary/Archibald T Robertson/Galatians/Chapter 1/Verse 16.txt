 To reveal his Son in me  (αποκαλυψα τον υιον αυτου εν εμο). By "in me" (εν εμο) Paul can mean to lay emphasis on his inward experience of grace or he may refer objectively to the vision of Christ on the way to Damascus, "in my case." Paul uses εν εμο in this sense (in my case) several times (verse Galatians 1:24; 2 Corinthians 13:3; Philippians 1:30; 1 Timothy 1:16). Once (1 Corinthians 14:11) εν εμο is almost equivalent to the dative (to me). On the whole Lightfoot seems correct here in taking it to mean "in my case," though the following words suit either idea. Certainly Paul could not preach Christ among the Gentiles without the rich inward experience and in the objective vision he was called to that task.I conferred not with flesh and blood  (ου προσανεθεμην σαρκ κα αιματ). Second aorist middle indicative of προσανατιθημ, old verb, double compound (προσ, ανα), to lay upon oneself in addition, to betake oneself to another, to confer with, dative case as here. In N.T. only here and Galatians 2:6.
