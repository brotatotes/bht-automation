 Not sinners of the Gentiles  (ουκ εξ εθνων αμαρτωλο). The Jews regarded all Gentiles as "sinners" in contrast with themselves (cf. Matthew 26:45 "sinners" and Luke 18:32 "Gentiles"). It is not clear whether verses Galatians 2:15-21 were spoken by Paul to Peter or whether Paul is now simply addressing the Galatians in the light of the controversy with Peter. Burton thinks that he is "mentally addressing Peter, if not quoting from what he said to him."
