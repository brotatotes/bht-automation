 Being a Greek  (Hελλην ων). Concessive participle, though he was a Greek.Was compelled to be circumcised  (ηναγκασθη περιτμηθηνα). First aorist passive indicative of αναγκαζω and first aorist passive infinitive of περιτεμνω. Curiously enough some scholars interpret this language to mean that Paul voluntarily had Titus circumcised, instead of being compelled to do it, an impossible view in my opinion in the light of verse Galatians 2:5 and wholly inconsistent with the whole context. Paul means that he stood his ground against compulsion and all force.
