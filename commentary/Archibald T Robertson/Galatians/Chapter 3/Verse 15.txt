Literally, "Yet a man's covenant ratified." On Διαθηκη as both covenant and will see on Matthew 26:28; 1 Corinthians 11:25; 2 Corinthians 3:6; Hebrews 9:16. On κυροω, to ratify, to make valid, see on 2 Corinthians 2:8. Perfect passive participle here, state of completion, authoritative confirmation.Maketh it void  (αθετε). See on Galatians 2:21 for this verb. Both parties can by agreement cancel a contract, but not otherwise.Addeth thereto  (επιδιατασσετα). Present middle indicative of the double compound verb επιδιατασσομα, a word found nowhere else as yet. But inscriptions use διατασσομαι, διαταξισ, διαταγη, διαταγμα with the specialized meaning to "determine by testamentary disposition" (Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East, p. 90). It was unlawful to add (επ) fresh clauses or specifications (διαταξεις).
