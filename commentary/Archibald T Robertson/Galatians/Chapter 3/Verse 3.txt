 Are ye now perfected in the flesh?  (νυν σαρκ επιτελεισθε?). Rather middle voice as in 1 Peter 5:9, finishing of yourselves. There is a double contrast, between εναρξαμενο (having begun) and επιτελεισθε (finishing) as in 2 Corinthians 8:6; Philippians 1:6, and also between "Spirit" (πνευματ) and flesh (σαρκ). There is keen irony in this thrust.
