 Did ye suffer?  (επαθετε?). Second aorist active indicative of πασχω, to experience good or ill. But alone, as here, it often means to suffer ill (τοσαυτα, so many things). In North Galatia we have no record of persecutions, but we do have records for South Galatia (Acts 14:2; Acts 14:5; Acts 14:19; Acts 14:22).If it be indeed in vain  (ε γε κα εικη). On εικη see 1 Corinthians 15:2; Galatians 4:11. Paul clings to hope about them with alternative fears.
