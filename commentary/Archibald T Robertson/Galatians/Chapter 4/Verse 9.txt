 Now that ye have come to know God  (νυν δε γνοντες). Fine example of the ingressive second aorist active participle of γινωσκω, come to know by experience through faith in Christ.Rather to be known of God  (μαλλον δε γνωσθεντες υπο θεου). First aorist passive participle of the same verb. He quickly turns it round to the standpoint of God's elective grace reaching them (verse Galatians 4:6).How  (πως). "A question full of wonder" (Bengel). See Galatians 1:6.Turn ye back again?  (επιστρεφετε παλιν?). Present active indicative, "Are ye turning again?" See μετατιθεσθε in Galatians 1:6.The weak and beggarly rudiments  (τα ασθενη κα πτωχα στοιχεια). The same στοιχεια in verse Galatians 4:3 from which they had been delivered, "weak and beggarly," still in their utter impotence from the Pharisaic legalism and the philosophical and religious legalism and the philosophical and religious quests of the heathen as shown by Angus's The Religious Quests of the Graeco-Roman World. These were eagerly pursued by many, but they were shadows when caught. It is pitiful today to see some men and women leave Christ for will o' the wisps of false philosophy.Over again  (παλιν ανωθεν). Old word, from above (ανω) as in Matthew 27:51, from the first (Luke 1:3), then "over again" as here, back to where they were before (in slavery to rites and rules).
