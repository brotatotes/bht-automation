 Under the law  (υπο νομον). Instead of "under the flesh" as one might expect. See Galatians 3:2-6 for contrast between law and spirit. The flesh made the law weak (Romans 8:3; Hebrews 9:10; Hebrews 9:13). They are one and the same in result. See same idea in Romans 8:14. Note present tense of αγεσθε (if you are continually led by the Spirit). See verse Galatians 5:23.
