 Manifest  (φανερα). Opposed to "hidden" (κρυπτα). Ancient writers were fond of lists of vices and virtues. Cf. Stalker's sermons on The Seven Cardinal Virtues and The Seven Deadly Sins. There are more than seven in this deadly list in verses Galatians 5:19-21. He makes the two lists in explanation of the conflict in verse Galatians 5:17 to emphasize the command in verses Galatians 5:13. There are four groups in Paul's list of manifest vices: (I) Sensual sins like fornication (πορνεια, prostitution, harlotry), uncleanness (ακαθαρσια, moral impurity), lasciviousness (ασελγεια, wantonness), sexual vice of all kinds prevailed in heathenism. (2) Idolatry (ειδωλατρεια, worship of idols) and witchcraft (φαρμακεια from φαρμακον, a drug, the ministering of drugs), but the sorcerers monopolized the word for a while in their magical arts and used it in connection with idolatry. In N.T. only here and Revelation 18:23. See Acts 19:19 περιεργα, curious arts. (3) Personal relations expressed by eight words, all old words, sins of the spirit, like enmities (εξθρα, personal animosities), strife (ερις, rivalry, discord), jealousies (ζηλος or ζηλο, MSS. vary, our very word), wraths (θυμο, stirring emotions, then explosions), factions (εριθεια, from εριθος, day labourer for hire, worker in wool, party spirit), divisions (διχοστασια, splits in two, διχα and στασις), heresies (αιρεσεις, the very word, but really choosings from αιρεομα, preferences), envyings (φθονο, feelings of ill-will). Surely a lively list. (4)Drunkenness  (μεθα, old word and plural, drunken excesses, in N.T. only here and Luke 21:34; Romans 13:13), revellings (κωμο, old word also for drinking parties like those in honour of Bacchus, in N.T. only here and Romans 13:13; 1 Peter 4:3).And such like  (κα τα ομοια τουτοις). And the things like these (associative instrumental τουτοις after ομοια, like). It is not meant to be exhaustive, but it is representative.
