 From henceforth  (του λοιπου). Usually το λοιπον, the accusative of general reference, "as for the rest" (Philippians 3:1; Philippians 4:8). The genitive case (as here and Ephesians 6:10) means "in respect of the remaining time."The marks of Jesus  (τα στιγματα του Ιησου). Old word from στιζω, to prick, to stick, to sting. Slaves had the names or stamp of their owners on their bodies. It was sometimes done for soldiers also. There were devotees also who stamped upon their bodies the names of the gods whom they worshipped. Today in a round-up cattle are given the owner's mark. Paul gloried in being the slave of Jesus Christ. This is probably the image in Paul's mind since he bore in his body brandmarks of suffering for Christ received in many places (2 Corinthians 6:4-6; 2 Corinthians 11:23), probably actual scars from the scourgings (thirty-nine lashes at a time). If for no other reason, listen to me by reason of these scars for Christ and "let no one keep on furnishing trouble to me."
