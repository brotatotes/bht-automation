 That is taught  (ο κατηχουμενος). For this late and rare verb κατηχεω, see on Luke 1:4; Acts 18:25; 1 Corinthians 14:19. It occurs in the papyri for legal instruction. Here the present passive participle retains the accusative of the thing. The active (τω κατηχουντ) joined with the passive is interesting as showing how early we find paid teachers in the churches. Those who receive instruction are called on to "contribute" (better than "communicate" for κοινωνειτω) for the time of the teacher (Burton). There was a teaching class thus early (1 Thessalonians 5:12; 1 Corinthians 12:28; Ephesians 4:11; 1 Thessalonians 5:17).
