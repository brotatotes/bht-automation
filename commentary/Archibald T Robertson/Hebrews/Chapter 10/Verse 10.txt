 We have been sanctified  (ηγιασμενο εσμεν). Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of αγιαζω, to set apart, to sanctify. The divine will, unfulfilled in animal sacrifices, is realized in Christ's offering of himself. "He came to be a great High Priest, and the body was prepared for him, that by the offering of it he might put sinful men for ever into the perfect religious relation to God" (Denney, The Death of Christ, p. 234).
