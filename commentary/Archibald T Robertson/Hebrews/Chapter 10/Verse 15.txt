 And the Holy Ghost also beareth witness to us  (μαρτυρε δε ημιν κα το πνευμα το αγιον). Μαρτυρεω is common in Philo for Scripture quotation. The author confirms his interpretation of Psalms 40:7-9 by repeating from Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:31) what he had already quoted (Hebrews 8:8-12).After he hath said  (μετα το ειρηκενα). Accusative case after μετα of the articular infinitive perfect active, "after the having said."
