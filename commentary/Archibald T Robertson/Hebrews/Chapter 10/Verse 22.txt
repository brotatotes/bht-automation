 Let us draw near  (προσερχωμεθα). Present middle volitive subjunctive as in Hebrews 4:16 with which exhortation the discussion began. There are three exhortations in verses Hebrews 22:25 (Let us draw near, προσερχωμεθα, let us hold fast, κατεχωμεν, let us consider one another, κατανοωμεν αλληλους). Four items are added to this first exhortation.With a true heart  (μετα αληθινης καρδιας). With loyalty and fealty.In fulness of faith  (εν πληροφορια πιστεως). See Hebrews 6:11 for this very phrase.Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience  (ρεραντισμενο τας καρδιας απο συνειδησεως πονηρας). Perfect passive participle of ραντιζω with the accusative retained in the passive, an evident allusion to the sprinkling of blood in the old tabernacle (Hebrews 9:18-22) and the shedding of Christ's blood for the cleansing of our consciences (Hebrews 10:1-4). Cf. 1 Peter 1:2 for "the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ."Our body washed with pure water  (λελουσμενο το σωμα υδατ καθαρω). Perfect passive (or middle) of λουω, old verb to bathe, to wash. Accusative also retained if passive. Hυδατ can be either locative (in) or instrumental (with). See Ephesians 5:26; Titus 3:5 for the use of λουτρον. If the reference here is to baptism (quite doubtful), the meaning is a symbol (Dods) of the previous cleansing by the blood of Christ.
