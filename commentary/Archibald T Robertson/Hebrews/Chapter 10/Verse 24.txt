 Let us consider one another  (κατανοωμεν αλληλους). Present (keep on doing so) active volitive subjunctive of κατανοεω. The verb used about Jesus in Hebrews 3:1.To provoke  (εις παροξυσμον). Our very word "paroxysm," from παροξυνω (παρα, οξυνω from οξυς, sharp), to sharpen, to stimulate, to incite. So here in good sense (for incitement to), but in Acts 15:39 the word is used of irritation or contention as in the LXX and Demosthenes. Hippocrates uses it for "paroxysm" in disease (so in the papyri).Unto love and good works  (αγαπης κα καλων εργων). Objective genitive. So Paul seeks to stir up the Corinthians by the example of the Macedonians (2 Corinthians 8:1-7).
