 Which  (ητις). Your boldness of verse Hebrews 10:35.Recompense of reward  (μισθαποδοσιαν). Late double compound, like μισθαποδοτης (Hebrews 11:6), from μισθος (reward, wages) and αποδιδωμ, to give back, to pay (repay). In N.T. only here, Hebrews 2:2; Hebrews 11:26.Of patience  (υπομονης). Old word for remaining under trial (Luke 8:15). This was the call of the hour then as now.Having done the will of God  (το θελημα του θεου). This is an essential prerequisite to the exercise of patience and to obtain the promised blessing. There is no promise to those who patiently keep on doing wrong.That ye may receive the promise  (ινα κομισησθε την επαγγελιαν) Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist middle subjunctive of κομιζω, old verb to carry (Luke 7:37), in the middle to get back one's own (Matthew 25:27), to receive. See also Hebrews 11:39. Now the author is ready to develop this great idea of receiving the promise in Christ.
