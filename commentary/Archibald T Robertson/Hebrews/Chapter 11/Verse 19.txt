This was his solution of his difficult situation.God is able  (δυνατα ο θεος). God had given him Isaac in his old age. God can raise him from the dead. It was Abraham's duty to obey God.In a parable  (εν παραβολη). See already Hebrews 9:9 for παραβολη. Because of (οθεν, whence) Abraham's superb faith Isaac was spared and so he received him back (εκομισατο) as almost from the dead. This is the test that Abraham stood of which James speaks (James 2:23).
