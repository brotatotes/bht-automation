 Was translated  (μετετεθη). First aorist passive indicative of μετατιθημ, old verb to transpose, to change as in Hebrews 7:12; Acts 7:16.That he should not see death  (του μη ιδειν θανατον). Here again του with the infinitive usually expresses purpose, but in this case result is the idea as in Matthew 21:23; Romans 1:24; Romans 7:3, etc. (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1002).He was not found  (ουχ ηυρισκετο). Imperfect passive of ευρισκω from Genesis 5:24. Was still not found.Translated  (μετεθηκεν). First aorist active of same verb as μετετεθη just before.Translation  (μεταθεσεως). Substantive from the same verb μετατιθημ, used already in Hebrews 7:12 for change. See also Hebrews 12:27. Our very word "metathesis."He hath had witness borne him  (μεμαρτυρητα). Perfect passive indicative of μαρτυρεω, stands on record still, "he has been testified to."That he had been well-pleasing unto God  (ευαρεστηκενα τω θεω). Perfect active infinitive of ευαρεστεω, late compound from ευαρεστος (well-pleasing), in N.T. only in Hebrews 11:5; Hebrews 13:16. With dative case θεω. Quoted here from Genesis 5:22; Genesis 5:24. The word is common of a servant pleasing his master.
