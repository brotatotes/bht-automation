 Straight paths  (τροχιας ορθας). Track of a wheel (τροχος, James 3:6 from τρεχω, to run), here only in N.T. "Straight (ορθας) wheel tracks."Be not turned out of the way  (ινα μη εκτραπη). Negative final clause with ινα μη and second aorist passive of εκτρεπω, old verb to turn out, to twist, to put out of joint. So 1 Timothy 1:6. Vivid picture of concern for the lame (χωλον, as in Matthew 11:5). Graphic picture of concern for the weak, a good argument for prohibition also.
