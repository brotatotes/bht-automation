 Ye are not come  (ου προσεληλυθατε). Perfect active indicative of προσερχομα. There is no word here in the Greek for "a mount" like ορε in verses Hebrews 12:20; Hebrews 12:22 (and Exodus 19:12; Deuteronomy 4:11), but it is clearly understood since the dative participles agree with it unless they be taken as descriptive of πυρ ("a palpable and kindled fire " when πυρ would be the dative case after προσεληλυθατε).That might be touched  (ψηλαφωμενω). Present passive participle (dative case) of ψηλαφαω, old verb to handle, to touch (Luke 24:39).That burned with fire  (κεκαυμενω πυρ). Perfect passive participle of καιω, old verb to burn, with instrumental case πυρ (fire), unless the other view (above) is correct.
