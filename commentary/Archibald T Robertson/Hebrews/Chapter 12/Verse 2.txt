 Looking unto  (αφορωντες εις). Present active participle of αφοραω, old verb to look away, "looking away to Jesus." In N.T. only here and Philippians 2:23. Fix your eyes on Jesus, after a glance at "the cloud of witnesses," for he is the goal. Cf. Moses in Hebrews 11:26 (απεβλεπεν).The author  (τον αρχηγον). See Hebrews 2:10 for this word. "The pioneer of personal faith" (Moffatt).Perfecter  (τελειωτην). A word apparently coined by the writer from τελειοω as it has been found nowhere else. Vulgate has consummator.For the joy  (αντ της χαρας). Answering to, in exchange for (verse Hebrews 12:16), at the end of the race lay the joy "set before him" (προκειμενης αυτω), while here was the Cross (σταυρον) at this end (the beginning of the race) which he endured (υπεμεινεν, aorist active indicative of υπομενω),despising shame  (αισχυνης καταφρονησας). The cross at his time brought only shame (most shameful of deaths, "yea, the death of the cross" Philippians 2:8). But Jesus despised that, in spite of the momentary shrinking from it, and did his Father's will by submitting to it.Hath sat down  (κεκαθικεν). Perfect active indicative of καθιζω, and still is there (Hebrews 1:3).
