 See  (βλεπετε). Earnest word as in Hebrews 3:12. Driving home the whole argument of the Epistle by this powerful contrast between Mount Zion and Mount Sinai. The consequences are dreadful to apostates now, for Zion has greater terrors than Sinai, great as those were.That ye refuse not  (μη παραιτησησθε). Negative purpose with μη and the first aorist middle subjunctive of παραιτεομα, the same verb used in verse Hebrews 12:19 about the conduct of the Israelites at Sinai and also below.Him that speaketh  (τον λαλουντα). Present active articular participle of λαλεω as in verse Hebrews 12:24 (Jesus speaking by his blood).For if they did not escape  (ε γαρ εκεινο ουκ εξεφυγον). Condition of first class with ε and second aorist active indicative of εκφευγω, to escape. Direct reference to Sinai with use of the same verb again (παραιτησαμενο, when they refused).Him that warned  (τον χρηματιζοντα). That is Moses. For χρηματιζω see Hebrews 8:5; Hebrews 11:7.Much more we  (πολυ μαλλον ημεις). Argument from the less to the greater, πολυ, adverbial accusative case. The verb has to be supplied from the condition, "We shall not escape." Our chance to escape is far less, "we who turn away (αποστρεφομενο, middle participle, turn ourselves away from) the one from heaven (τον απ' ουρανων)," God speaking through his Son (Hebrews 1:2).
