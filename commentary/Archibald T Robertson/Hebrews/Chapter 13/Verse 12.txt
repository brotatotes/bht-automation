 Wherefore Jesus also  (διο κα Ιησους). The parallel is drawn between the O.T. ritual and the better sacrifice of Jesus already discussed (Hebrews 9:13-10). The purpose of Jesus is shown (ινα αγιαση, ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of αγιαζω, to sanctify), the means employed (δια του ιδιου αιματος, by his own blood), the place of his suffering (επαθεν, as in Hebrews 5:8) is also given (εξω της πυλης, outside the gate, implied in John 19:17) which phrase corresponds to "outside the camp" of verse Hebrews 13:11.
