 That I may be restored to you the sooner  (ινα ταχειον αποκατασταθω υμιν). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist passive subjunctive of αποκαθιστημ, an old double compound as in Matthew 12:13. What is meant by ταχειον (John 13:27; John 20:4) we do not know, possibly sickness. See verse Hebrews 13:23 also for ταχειον.
