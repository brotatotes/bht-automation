 The God of peace  (ο θεος της ειρηνης). God is the author and giver of peace, a Pauline phrase (6 times) as in 1 Thessalonians 5:23.Who brought again from the dead  (ο αναγαγων εκ νεκρων). Second aorist active articular participle of αναγω (cf. Romans 10:7), the only direct mention of the resurrection of Jesus in the Epistle, though implied often (Hebrews 1:3, etc.).That great shepherd of the sheep  (τον ποιμενα των προβατων τον μεγαν). This phrase occurs in Isaiah 63:11 except τον μεγαν which the author adds as in Hebrews 4:14; Hebrews 10:21. So here, "the shepherd of the sheep the great one."With the blood of the eternal covenant  (εν αιματ διαθηκης αιωνιου). This language is from Zechariah 9:11. The language reminds us of Christ's own words in Mark 14:24 (Matthew 26:28; Luke 22:20; 1 Corinthians 11:25) about "my blood of the covenant."
