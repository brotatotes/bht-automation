 Be ye free from the love of money  (αφιλαργυρος ο τροπος). No copula, but supply εστο: "Let your manner of life (τροπος, way, Matthew 23:37), be without love of money" (αφιλαργυρος, double compound), once found only in the N.T., here and 1 Timothy 3:3, but now several times--or the adverb αφιλαργυρως --in papyri and inscriptions (Deissmann, Light, etc., pp. 85f.). Alpha privative and φιλος and αργυρος. The N.T. is full of the peril of money on the character as modern life is also.Content with such things as ye have  (αρκουμενο τοις παρουσιν). Present passive participle of αρκεω, to suffice, to be content as in Luke 3:14. Cf. αυταρκης in Philippians 4:11. Here in the nominative plural with no substantive or pronoun (anacoluthon, as in 2 Corinthians 1:7) or the participle used as a principal verb as in Romans 12:16. "Contented with the present things" (τοις παρουσιν, associative instrumental case of τα παροντα, present active neuter plural participle of παρειμ, to be present or on hand).For himself hath said  (αυτος γαρ ειρηκεν). God himself as in Acts 20:33 of Christ. Perfect active indicative as in Hebrews 1:13; Hebrews 4:3; Hebrews 10:9. The quotation is a free paraphrase of Genesis 28:15; Deuteronomy 31:8; Joshua 1:5; 1 Chronicles 28:20. Philo (de Confus. Ling. 32) has it in this form, "a popular paraphrase" (Moffatt). Note the five negatives strengthening each other (ου μη with the second aorist active subjunctive ανω from ανιημ, to relate, as in Acts 16:26; ουδ' ου μη with second aorist active subjunctive εγκαταλιπω from εγκαταλειπω, to leave behind, as in Matthew 27:46; 2 Timothy 4:10). A noble promise in times of depression.
