 Be not carried away  (μη παραφερεσθε). Prohibition with μη and present passive imperative of παραφερω, old verb to lead along (Jude 1:12), to carry past (Mark 14:36), to lead astray as here.By divers and strange teachings  (διδαχαις ποικιλαις κα ξεναις). For ποικιλος (many coloured) see Hebrews 2:4. Ξενος for guest we have had in Hebrews 11:13, but here as adjective meaning unheard of (1 Peter 4:12) as in older Greek also. The new is not always wrong any more than the old is always right (Matthew 13:52). But the air was already full of new and strange teachings that fascinated many by their very novelty. The warning here is always needed. Cf. Galatians 1:6-9; 2 Timothy 3:16.That the heart be established by grace  (χαριτ βεβαιουσθα την καρδιαν). Present passive infinitive of βεβαιοω (from βαινω) to make stable with the instrumental case χαριτ (by grace) and the accusative of general reference (την καρδιαν). How true it is that in the atmosphere of so many windy theories only the heart is stable that has an experience of God's grace in Christ.That occupied themselves  (ο περιπατουντες). "That walked" in the ritualistic Jewish rules about meats.Were not profited  (ουκ ωφεληθησαν). First aorist passive indicative of ωφελεω, to help. Mere Jewish ceremonialism and ritualism failed to build up the spiritual life. It was sheer folly to give up Christ for Pharisaism or for Moses.
