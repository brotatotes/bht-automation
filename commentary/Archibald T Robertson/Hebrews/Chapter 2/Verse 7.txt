 Thou madest him a little lower  (ελαττωσας αυτον βραχυ τ). First aorist active of old verb ελαττοω from ελαττων (less), causative verb to lessen, to decrease, to make less, only here, and verse Hebrews 2:9 and John 3:30 in N.T. Βραχυ τ is accusative neuter of degree like 2 Samuel 16:1, "some little," but of time in Isaiah 57:17 (for a little while).Than the angels  (παρ' αγγελους). "Beside angels" like παρα with the accusative of comparison in Hebrews 1:4; Hebrews 1:9. The Hebrew here has Elohim which word is applied to judges in Psalms 82:1; Psalms 82:6 (John 10:34). Here it is certainly not "God" in our sense. In Psalms 29:1 the LXX translates Elohim by υο θεου (sons of God).Thou crownedst  (εστεφανωσας). First aorist active indicative of old verb, στεφανοω, to crown, in N.T. only here and 2 Timothy 2:5 The Psalmist refers to God's purpose in creating man with such a destiny as mastery over nature. The rest of verse Hebrews 2:7 is absent in B.
