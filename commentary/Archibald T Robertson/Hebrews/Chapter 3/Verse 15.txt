 While it is said  (εν τω λεγεσθα). Locative case with εν of the articular present passive infinitive of λεγω, "in the being said." Thus the author (cf. same phrase in Psalms 42:4) introduces the repeated quotation from verses Hebrews 3:7; Hebrews 3:8. Probably it is to be connected with κατασχωμεν, though it can be joined with παρακαλειτε in verse Hebrews 3:13 (treating Hebrews 3:14 as a parenthesis).
