 Who  (Τινες). Clearly interrogative, not indefinite (some).Did provoke  (παρεπικραναν). First aorist active indicative of παραπικρινω, apparently coined by the LXX like παραπικρασμος (verse Hebrews 3:15) to which it points, exasperating the anger of God.Nay, did not all  (αλλ' ου παντες). "A favourite device of the diatribe style" (Moffatt), answering one rhetorical question with another (Luke 17:8) as in verses Hebrews 3:17; Hebrews 3:18, There was a faithful minority mentioned by Paul (1 Corinthians 10:7).
