 And Moses  (κα Μωυσης μεν). "Now Moses indeed on his part" (μεν contrasted with δε).In  (εν). Moses was in "God's house" "as a servant" (ως θεραπων). Old word, in LXX, only here in N.T. and quoted from Numbers 12:7. Kin to the verb θεραπευω, to serve, to heal, and θεραπεια, service (Luke 9:11) and a group of servants (Luke 12:42).For a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken  (εις μαρτυριον των λαληθησομενων). Objective genitive of the articular future passive participle of λαλεω. It is not certain what it means whether the "testimony" (μαρτυριον) is to Moses or to God and whether it points on to Christ. In Hebrews 9:9 see παραβολη applied to the old dispensation as a symbol pointing to Christ and Christianity.But Christ  (Χριστος δε). In contrast with Moses (μεν in verse Hebrews 3:5).As a son  (ως υιος). Instead of a θεραπων (servant).Over his house  (επ τον οικον αυτου). The difference between επ and εν added to that between υιος and θεραπων. It is very neat and quite conclusive, especially when we recall the high place occupied by Moses in Jewish thought. In Acts 7:11 the Jews accused Stephen of speaking "blasphemous words against Moses and God" (putting Moses on a par with God).
