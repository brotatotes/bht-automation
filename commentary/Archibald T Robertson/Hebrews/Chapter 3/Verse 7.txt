 Wherefore  (διο). Probably this inferential conjunction (δια, ο, because of which) goes with μη σκληρυνητε (harden not) in verse Hebrews 3:8 rather than with βλεπετε (take heed) in verse Hebrews 3:12 unless the long quotation be considered a parenthesis. The long quotation in verses Hebrews 3:7-11 is from Psalms 95:7-11. After the quotation the author has "three movements" (Moffatt) in his discussion of the passage as applied to the Jewish Christians (Hebrews 3:12-19; Hebrews 4:1-10; Hebrews 4:11-13). The peril of apostasy as shown by the example of the Israelites is presented with vividness and power.As the Holy Ghost saith  (καθως λεγε το πνευμα το αγιον). Just this phrase nowhere else in the N.T., except Acts 21:11 (Agabus), though practically the same idea in Hebrews 9:8; Hebrews 10:15. In 1 Timothy 4:1 the adjective "Holy" is wanting as in Hebrews 3:2; Hebrews 3:3. But the writer quotes this Psalm as the Word of God and in Hebrews 4:7 attributes it to David.If ye shall hear  (εαν ακουσητε). Condition of third class with εαν and first aorist active subjunctive of ακουω.
