 Let us fear therefore  (φοβηθωμεν ουν). First aorist passive volitive subjunctive of φοβεομα, to be afraid. There is no break in the argument on Hebrews 4:95. This is a poor chapter division. The Israelites perished because of disbelief. We today face a real peril.Lest haply  (μη ποτε) Here with the present subjunctive (δοκε), but future indicative in Hebrews 3:12, after the verb of fearing. For the optative see 2 Timothy 2:25.A promise being left  (καταλειπομενης επαγγελιας). Genitive absolute of the present passive participle of καταλειπω, to leave behind. God's promise still holds good for us in spite of the failure of the Israelites.Should seem to have come short of it  (δοκε υστερηκενα). Perfect active infinitive of υστερεω, old verb from υστερος (comparative of root υδ like our out, outer, outermost), to be too late, to fail to reach the goal as here, common in the N.T. (Hebrews 11:37; Hebrews 12:15).
