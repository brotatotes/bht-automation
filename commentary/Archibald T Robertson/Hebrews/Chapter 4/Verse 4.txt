 Somewhere on this wise  (που ουτως). See Hebrews 2:6 for που τις for a like indefinite allusion to an Old Testament quotation. Here it is Genesis 2:2 (cf. Exodus 20:11; Exodus 31:17). Moffatt notes that Philo quotes Genesis 2:2 with the same "literary mannerism."Rested  (κατεπαυσεν). First aorist active indicative of καταπαυω, intransitive here, but transitive in verse Hebrews 4:8. It is not, of course, absolute rest from all creative activity as Jesus shows in John 5:17. But the seventh day of God's rest was still going on (clearly not a twenty-four hour day).
