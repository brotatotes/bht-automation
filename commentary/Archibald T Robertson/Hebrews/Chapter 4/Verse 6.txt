 It remaineth  (απολειπετα). Present passive indicative of απολειπω, old verb to leave behind, to remain over. So again in Hebrews 4:9; Hebrews 10:26. Here the infinitive clause (τινας εισελθειν εις αυτην) is the subject of απολειπετα. This left-over promise is not repeated, though not utilized by the Israelites under Moses nor in the highest sense by Joshua and David.Failed to enter in  (ουκ εισηλθον). "Did not enter in" (second aorist active indicative of εισερχομα). It is a rabbinical argument all along here, but the author is writing to Jews.
