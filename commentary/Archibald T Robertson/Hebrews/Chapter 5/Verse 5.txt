 So Christ also  (ουτως κα ο Χριστος). Just as with Aaron. Jesus had divine appointment as high priest also.To be made  (γενηθηνα). First aorist passive infinitive of γινομα.High priest  (αρχιερεα). Predicate accusative agreeing with εαυτον (himself) object of εδοξασεν.But he that spake unto him  (αλλ' ο λαλησας προς αυτον). Ellipsis of εδοξασεν to be supplied from preceding clause. God did glorify Jesus in appointing him priest as we see in Psalms 2:7 quoted already as Messianic (Hebrews 1:5). Jesus himself repeatedly claimed that the Father sent him on his mission to the world (John 5:30; John 5:43; John 8:54; John 17:5, etc.). Bruce holds that Christ's priesthood is co-eval with his Sonship. Davidson thinks it is merely suitable because he is Son. Clearly the Father nominated (Dods) the Son to the Messianic priesthood (John 3:16).
