 That ye be not sluggish  (ινα μη νωθρο γενησθε). Negative final clause with second aorist middle subjunctive of γινομα, "that ye become not sluggish (or dull of hearing)" as some already were (Hebrews 5:11).Imitators  (μιμητα). See 1 Thessalonians 1:6; 1 Thessalonians 2:14 for this word (our "mimic" in good sense). The writer wishes to hold and develop these sluggards through those who inherit the promises (see Hebrews 10:19-12), one of his great appeals later in ch. Hebrews 6:11 full of examples of "faith and long-suffering."
