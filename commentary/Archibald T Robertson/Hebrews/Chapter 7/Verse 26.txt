 Became us  (ημιν επρεπεν). Imperfect active indicative of πρεπω as in Hebrews 2:10, only there it was applied to God while here to us. "Such" (τοιουτος) refers to the Melchizedek character of Jesus as high priest and in particular to his power to help and save (Hebrews 2:17) as just explained in Hebrews 7:24 Moffatt notes that "it is generally misleading to parse a rhapsody" but the adjectives that follow picture in outline the qualities of the high priest needed by us.Holy  (οσιος). Saintly, pious, as already noted. Cf. Acts 2:24; Acts 13:35.Guileless  (ακακος). Without malice, innocent. In N.T. only here and Romans 16:18.Undefiled  (αμιαντος). Untainted, stainless. In the papyri. Not merely ritual purity (Leviticus 21:10-15), but real ethical cleanness.Separated from sinners  (κεχωρισμενος απο των αμαρτωλων). Perfect passive participle. Probably referring to Christ's exaltation (Hebrews 9:28).Made higher than the heavens  (υψηλοτερος των ουρανων γενομενος). "Having become higher than the heavens." Ablative case (ουρανων) after the comparative adjective (υψηλοτερος).
