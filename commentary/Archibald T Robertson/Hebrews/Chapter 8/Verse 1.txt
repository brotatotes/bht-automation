 In the things which we are saying  (επ τοις λεγομενοις). Locative case of the articular present passive participle of λεγω after επ as in Luke 5:5; Hebrews 11:4, "in the matter of the things being discussed."The chief point  (κεφαλαιον). Neuter singular of the adjective κεφαλαιος (from κεφαλη, head), belonging to the head. Vulgate capitulum, nominative absolute in old and common sense, the main matter (even so without the article as in Thucydides), "the pith" (Coverdale), common in the papyri as in Greek literature. The word also occurs in the sense of the sum total or a sum of money (Acts 22:28) as in Plutarch, Josephus, and also in the papyri (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary).Such an high priest  (τοιουτον αρχιερεα). As the one described in chapters Hebrews 4:16-7 and in particular Hebrews 7:26 (τοιουτος) Hebrews 7:27; Hebrews 7:28. But the discussion of the priestly work of Jesus continues through Hebrews 12:3. Τοιουτος is both retrospective and prospective. Here we have a summary of the five points of superiority of Jesus as high priest (Hebrews 8:1-6). He is himself a better priest than Aaron (τοιουτος in Hebrews 8:1 such as shown in Hebrews 4:16-7); he works in a better sanctuary (Hebrews 8:2; Hebrews 8:5); he offers a better sacrifice (Hebrews 8:3); he is mediator of a better covenant (Hebrews 8:6); his work rests on better promises (Hebrews 8:6); hence he has obtained a better ministry as a whole (Hebrews 8:6). In this resume (κεφελαιον) the author gives the pith (κεφαλαιον) of his argument, curiously enough with both senses of κεφαλαιον (pith, summary) pertinent. He will discuss the four points remaining thus: (1) the better covenant, Hebrews 8:7-13. (2) The better sanctuary, Hebrews 9:1-12. (3) The better sacrifice, Hebrews 9:13-10. (4) The better promises, Hebrews 10:19-12. One point (the better high priest, like Melchizedek) has already been discussed (Hebrews 4:16-7).Sat down  (εκαθισεν). Repetition of Hebrews 1:3 with του θρονου (the throne) added. This phrase prepares the way for the next point.
