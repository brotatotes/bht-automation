 Is appointed  (καθιστατα). As in Hebrews 5:1.To offer  (εις το προσφερειν). Articular infinitive accusative case with εις as is common while ινα προσφερη (ινα with present active subjunctive) for purpose in Hebrews 5:1, with δωρα τε κα θυσιας as there.It is necessary  (αναγκαιον). A moral and logical necessity (from αναγκη necessity) as seen in Acts 13:46; Philippians 1:24.This high priest also  (κα τουτον). "This one also," no word for high priest, accusative of general reference with the infinitive εχειν (have).Somewhat to offer  (τ ω προσενεγκη). Second aorist active subjunctive of προσφερω (verse Hebrews 8:3). Vulgate aliquid quod offerat. The use of the subjunctive in this relative clause is probably volitive as in Acts 21:16; Hebrews 12:28 (possibly here merely futuristic), but note ο προσφερε (present indicative) in Hebrews 9:7. See Robertson, Grammar, p. 955.
