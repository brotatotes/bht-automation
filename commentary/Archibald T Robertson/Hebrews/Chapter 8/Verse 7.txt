 That first covenant  (η πρωτη εκεινη). The word διαθηκη (covenant) is not expressed, but clearly meant by the feminine gender πρωτη.Faultless  (αμεμπτος). Old compound adjective for which see Luke 1:6; Philippians 2:15. The condition is second class and assumes that the old covenant was not "blameless," apparently a serious charge which he hastens to explain.For a second  (δευτερας). Objective genitive with διαθηκης understood. The conclusion with αν and the imperfect passive indicative (εζητειτο) is clearly a second-class condition. See a like argument in Hebrews 7:11.
