 Mediator of a new covenant  (διαθηκης καινης μεσιτης). See Hebrews 8:6 for this phrase with κρειττονος instead of καινης.A death having taken place  (θανατου γενομενου). Genitive absolute, referring to Christ's death.For the redemption  (εις απολυτρωσιν).Of the transgressions  (των παραβασεων). Really ablative case, "from the transgressions." See verse Hebrews 9:12, λυτρωσιν.Under the first covenant  (επ τη πρωτη διαθηκη). Here there is a definite statement that the real value in the typical sacrifices under the Old Testament system was in the realization in the death of Christ. It is Christ's death that gives worth to the types that pointed to him. So then the atoning sacrifice of Christ is the basis of the salvation of all who are saved before the Cross and since.That they may receive  (οπως λαβωσιν). Purpose clause (God's purpose in the rites and symbols) with οπως and the second aorist active subjunctive of λαμβανω.
