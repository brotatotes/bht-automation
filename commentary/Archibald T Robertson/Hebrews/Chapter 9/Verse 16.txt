 A testament  (διαθηκη). The same word occurs for covenant (verse Hebrews 9:15) and will (verse Hebrews 9:16). This double sense of the word is played upon also by Paul in Galatians 3:15. We say today "The New Testament" (Novum Testamentum) rather than " The New Covenant." Both terms are pertinent.That made it  (του διαθεμενου). Genitive of the articular second aorist middle participle of διατιθημ from which διαθηκη comes. The notion of will here falls in with κληρονομια (inheritance, 1 Peter 1:4) as well as with θανατος (death).Of force  (βεβαια). Stable, firm as in Hebrews 3:6; Hebrews 3:14.Where there hath been death  (επ νεκροις). "In the case of dead people." A will is only operative then.For doth it ever avail while he that made it liveth?  (επε μη ποτε ισχυε οτε ζη ο διαθεμενοσ;). This is a possible punctuation with μη ποτε in a question (John 7:26). Without the question mark, it is a positive statement of fact. Aleph and D read τοτε (then) instead of ποτε. The use of μη in a causal sentence is allowable (John 3:18, οτ μη).
