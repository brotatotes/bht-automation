 Let no one say  (μηδεις λεγετω). Present active imperative, prohibiting such a habit.When he is tempted  (πειραζομενος). Present passive participle of πειραζω, here in evil sense of tempt, not test, as in Matthew 4:1. Verses James 1:12-18 give a vivid picture of temptation.I am tempted of God  (απο θεου πειραζομα). The use of απο shows origin (απο with ablative case), not agency (υπο), as in Mark 1:13, of Satan. It is contemptible, but I have heard wicked and weak men blame God for their sins. Cf. Proverbs 19:3; Sirach 15:11f. Temptation does not spring "from God."Cannot be tempted with evil  (απειραστος κακων). Verbal compound adjective (alpha privative and πειραζω), probably with the ablative case, as is common with alpha privative (Robertson, Grammar, p. 516), though Moulton (Prolegomena, p. 74) treats it as the genitive of definition. The ancient Greek has απειρατος (from πειραω), but this is the earliest example of απειραστος (from πειραζω) made on the same model. Only here in the N.T. Hort notes απειρατος κακων as a proverb (Diodorus, Plutarch, Josephus) "free from evils." That is possible here, but the context calls for "untemptable" rather than "untempted."And he himself tempteth no man  (πειραζε δε αυτος ουδενα). Because "untemptable."
