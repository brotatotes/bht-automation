 But be ye  (γινεσθε δε). Rather, "But keep on becoming" (present middle imperative of γινομα).Doers of the word  (ποιητα λογου). Old word for agent (-της) from ποιεω to do as in James 4:11; Romans 2:13, but in Acts 17:28 our "poet" (long regarded as a "doer" or "maker").Hearers  (ακροατα). Old word for agent again from ακροαμα (to be a hearer), in N.T. only here and Romans 2:13.Deluding yourselves  (παραλογιζομενο εαυτους). Present middle (direct) participle of παραλογιζομα, to reckon aside (παρα) and so wrong, to cheat, to deceive. Redundant reflexive εαυτους with the middle. In N.T. only here and Colossians 2:4. Such a man does not delude anyone but himself.
