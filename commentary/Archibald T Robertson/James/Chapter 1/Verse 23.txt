Associative instrumental case after εοικεν as in James 1:6. Note ανδρ as in James 1:8 in contrast with γυναικ (woman), not ανθρωπω (general term for man).

"The face of his birth" (origin, lineage, nativity). For this use of γενεσις see James 3:6; Matthew 1:1; Matthew 1:18; Luke 1:13.In a mirror  (εν εσοπτρω). Old word (from εισ, οπτω) in N.T. only here and 1 Corinthians 13:12. The mirrors of the ancients were not of glass, but of polished metal (of silver or usually of copper and tin). See κατοπτριζομα in 2 Corinthians 3:18.
