 He that looketh into  (ο παρακυψας). First aorist active articular participle of παρακυπτω, old verb, to stoop and look into (John 20:5; John 20:11), to gaze carefully by the side of, to peer into or to peep into (1 Peter 1:12). Here the notion of beside (παρα) or of stooping (κυπτω) is not strong. Sometimes, as Hort shows, the word means only a cursory glance, but the contrast with verse James 1:24 seems to preclude that here.The perfect law  (νομον τελειον). For τελειον see James 1:17. See Romans 7:12 for Paul's idea of the law of God. James here refers to the word of truth (James 1:18), the gospel of grace (Galatians 6:2; Romans 12:2).The law of liberty  (τον της ελευθεριας). "That of liberty," explaining why it is "perfect" (James 2:12 also), rests on the work of Christ, whose truth sets us free (John 8:32; 2 Corinthians 3:16; Romans 8:2).And so continueth  (κα παραμεινας). First aorist active articular participle again of παραμενω, parallel with παρακυψας. Παραμενω is to stay beside, and see Philippians 1:25 for contrast with the simplex μενω.Being  (γενομενος). Rather, "having become" (second aorist middle participle of γινομα to become).Not a hearer that forgetteth  (ουκ ακροατης επιλησμονης). "Not a hearer of forgetfulness" (descriptive genitive, marked by forgetfulness). Επιλησμονη is a late and rare word (from επιλησμων, forgetful, from επιλανθομα, to forget, as in verse James 1:24), here only in N.T.But a doer that worketh  (αλλα ποιητης εργου). "But a doer of work," a doer marked by work (descriptive genitive εργου), not by mere listening or mere talk.In his doing  (εν τη ποιησε αυτου). Another beatitude with μακαριος as in James 1:12, like the Beatitudes in Matthew 5:3-12. Ποιησις is an old word (from ποιεω for the act of doing), only here in N.T.
