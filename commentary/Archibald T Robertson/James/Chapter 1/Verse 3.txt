 Knowing  (γινωσκοντες). Present active participle of γινωσκω (experimental knowledge, the only way of getting this view of "trials" as "all joy").The proof  (το δοκιμιον). Now known (Deissmann, Bible Studies, pp. 259ff.) from the papyri examples of δοκιμιος as an adjective in the same sense (good gold, standard gold) as δοκιμος proved or tested (James 1:12). The use of το δοκιμιον (neuter article with neuter single adjective) here and in 1 Peter 1:7, clearly means "the genuine element in your faith," not "crucible" nor "proving." Your faith like gold stands the test of fire and is approved as standard. James here, as in verse James 1:6; James 2:1; James 5:15, regards faith (πιστις) like Paul "as the very foundation of religion" (Mayor).Worketh  (κατεργαζετα). Present (durative) middle indicative of the compound verb with the perfective sense of κατα as in Philippians 2:12, which see.Patience  (υπομονην). Old and common word for remaining under (υπομενω), "staying power" (Ropes), as in Colossians 1:11.
