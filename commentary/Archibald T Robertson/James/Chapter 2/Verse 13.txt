 Without mercy  (ανελεος). Found here only save a doubtful papyrus example (ανελεως) for the vernacular ανιλεως and the Attic ανηλεης. For this principle of requital see Matthew 5:7; Matthew 6:14; Matthew 7:1; Matthew 18:33.Glorieth against  (κατακαυχατα). Present middle indicative of the old compound verb κατακαυχαομα, to exult over (down), in N.T. only here, James 3:14; Romans 11:18. Only mercy can triumph over justice with God and men. "Mercy is clothed with the divine glory and stands by the throne of God" (Chrysostom). See Romans 8:31-39; Matthew 9:13; Matthew 12:7.
