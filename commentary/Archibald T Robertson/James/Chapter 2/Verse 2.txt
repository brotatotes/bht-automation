 For  (γαρ). An illustration of the prohibition.If there come in  (εαν εισελθη). Condition of third class (supposable case) with εαν and second (ingressive) aorist active subjunctive of εισερχομα.Into your synagogue  (εις συναγωγην υμων). The common word for the gathering of Jews for worship (Luke 12:11) and particularly for the building where they met (Luke 4:15; Luke 4:20; Luke 4:28, etc.). Here the first is the probable meaning as it clearly is in Hebrews 10:25 (την επισυναγωγην εαυτων), where the longer compound occurs. It may seem a bit odd for a Christian church (εκκλησια) to be termed συναγωγη, but James is writing to Jewish Christians and this is another incidental argument for the early date. Epiphanius (Haer. XXX. 18) states that the Ebionites call their church συναγωγη, not εκκλησια. In the fourth century an inscription has συναγωγη for the meeting-house of certain Christians.A man with a gold ring  (ανηρ χρυσοδακτυλιος). "A gold-fingered man," "wearing a gold ring." The word occurs nowhere else, but Lucian has χρυσοχειρ (gold-handed) and Epictetus has χρυσους δακτυλιους (golden seal-rings). "Hannibal, after the battle of Cannae, sent as a great trophy to Carthage, three bushels of gold-rings from the fingers of Roman knights slain in battle" (Vincent).In fine clothing  (εν εσθητ λαμπρα). "In bright (brilliant) clothing" as in Luke 23:11; Acts 10:30; Revelation 18:41. In contrast with "vile clothing" (εν ρυπαρα εσθητ), "new glossy clothes and old shabby clothes" (Hort). Ρυπαρος (late word from ρυπος, filth, 1 Peter 3:21) means filthy, dirty. In N.T. only here and Revelation 22:11 (filthy).Poor man  (πτωχος). Beggarly mendicant (Matthew 19:21), the opposite of πλουσιος (rich).
