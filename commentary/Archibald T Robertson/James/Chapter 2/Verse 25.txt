 Rahab the harlot  (Ρααβ η πορνη). Her vicious life she left behind, but the name clung to her always. For our purposes the argument of James may seem stronger without the example of Rahab (Joshua 2:1-21; Joshua 6:17; Joshua 6:22-25; Matthew 1:5; Hebrews 11:31). It is even said in Jewish Midrash that Rahab married Joshua and became an ancestor of Jeremiah and Ezekiel.In that she received  (υποδεξαμενη). First aorist middle participle of υποδεχομα, to welcome.The messengers  (τους αγγελους). Original meaning of αγγελος (Matthew 11:10). In Hebrews 11:31 we have κατασκοπους (spies, scouts).Sent out  (εκβαλουσα). Second aorist active participle of εκβαλλω, to hurl out.Another way  (ετερα οδω). "By another way" (instrumental case), by a window instead of a door (Joshua 2:15).
