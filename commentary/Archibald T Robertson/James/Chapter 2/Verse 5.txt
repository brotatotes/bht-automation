 Did not God choose?  (ουχ ο θεος εξελεξατο;). Affirmative answer expected. First aorist middle (indirect, God chose for himself) indicative of εκλεγω, the very form used by Paul three times of God's choice in 1 Corinthians 1:27.As to the world  (τω κοσμω). The ethical dative of interest, as the world looks at it as in Acts 7:20; 1 Corinthians 1:18; 2 Corinthians 10:4; James 4:4. By the use of the article (the poor) James does not affirm that God chose all the poor, but only that he did choose poor people (Matthew 10:23-26; 1 Corinthians 1:26-28).Rich in faith  (πλουσιους εν πιστε). Rich because of their faith. As he has shown in James 1:9.Which he promised  (ης επεγγειλατο). Genitive of the accusative relative ην attracted to the case of the antecedent βασιλειας (the Messianic kingdom), the same verb and idea already in James 1:12 (επηγγειλατο). Cf. the beatitude of Jesus in Matthew 5:3 for the poor in spirit.
