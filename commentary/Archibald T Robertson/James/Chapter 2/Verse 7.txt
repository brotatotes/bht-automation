 Blaspheme  (βλασφημουσιν). Present active indicative of common verb βλασφημεω (from βλασφημος, speaking evil, βλαξ or βλαπτω and φημη), as in Luke 22:65.The honourable name  (το καλον ονομα). "The beautiful name."By the which ye were called  (το επικληθεν εφ' υμας). "The one called upon you" (first aorist passive articular participle of επικαλεω, to put a name upon, to give a surname to, as Acts 10:18). What name is that? Almost certainly the name of Christ as we see it in Acts 11:26; Acts 26:28; 1 Peter 4:14; 1 Peter 4:16. It was blasphemy to speak against Christ as some Jews and Gentiles were doing (Acts 13:45; Acts 18:6; Acts 26:11; 1 Corinthians 12:3; 1 Timothy 1:13). Cf. Acts 15:17.
