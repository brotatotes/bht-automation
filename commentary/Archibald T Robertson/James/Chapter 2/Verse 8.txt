 Howbeit  (μεντο). Probably not adversative here, but simply confirmatory, "if now," "if indeed," "if really." Common in Xenophon in this sense. See the contrast (δε) in verse James 2:9.If ye fulfil  (ε τελειτε). Condition of first class, assumed as true with ε and present active indicative of τελεω, old verb, to bring to completion, occurring in Romans 2:27 also with νομος (law). Jesus used πληροω in Matthew 4:17. James has τηρεω in James 2:10.The royal law  (νομον βασιλικον). Old adjective for royal, regal (from βασιλευς king), as of an officer (John 4:46). But why applied to νομος? The Romans had a phrase, lex regia, which came from the king when they had kings. The absence of the article is common with νομος (James 4:11). It can mean a law fit to guide a king, or such as a king would choose, or even the king of laws. Jesus had said that on the law of love hang all the law and the prophets (Matthew 22:40), and he had given the Golden Rule as the substance of the Law and the prophets (Matthew 7:12). This is probably the royal law which is violated by partiality (James 2:3). It is in accord with the Scripture quoted here (Leviticus 19:18) and ratified by Jesus (Luke 10:28).
