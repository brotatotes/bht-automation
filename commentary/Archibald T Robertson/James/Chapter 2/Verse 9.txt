 But if ye have respect of persons  (ε δε προσωπολημπτειτε). Condition of first class by contrast with that in verse James 2:8. For this verb (present active indicative), formed from προσωπον λαμβανω, here alone in the N.T., see in James 2:1. A direct reference to the partiality there pictured.Ye commit sin  (αμαρτιαν εργαζεσθε). "Ye work a sin." A serious charge, apparently, for what was regarded as a trifling fault. See Matthew 7:23, ο εργαζομενο την ανομιαν (ye that work iniquity), an apparent reminiscence of the words of Jesus there (from Psalms 6:8).Being convicted  (ελεγχομενο). Present passive participle of ελεγχω, to convict by proof of guilt (John 3:20; John 8:9; John 8:46; 1 Corinthians 14:24).As transgressors  (ως παραβατα). For this word from παραβαινω, to step across, to transgress, see Galatians 2:18; Romans 2:25; Romans 2:27. See this very sin of partiality condemned in Leviticus 19:15; Deuteronomy 1:17; Deuteronomy 16:19. To the law and to the testimony.
