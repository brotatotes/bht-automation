 Is sown in peace  (εν ειρηνη σπειρετα). Present passive indicative of σπειρω, to sow. The seed which bears the fruit is sown, but James catches up the metaphor of καρπος (fruit) from verse James 3:17. Only in peace is the fruit of righteousness found.For them that make peace  (τοις ποιουσιν ειρηνην). Dative case of the articular participle of ποιεω. See Ephesians 2:15 for this phrase (doing peace), and Colossians 1:20 for ειρηνοποιεω, of Christ, and Matthew 5:9 for ειρηνοποιο (peacemakers). Only those who act peaceably are entitled to peace.
