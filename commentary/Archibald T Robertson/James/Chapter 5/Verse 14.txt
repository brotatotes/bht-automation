 Is any among you sick?  (ασθενε τις εν υμιν;). Present active indicative of ασθενεω, old verb, to be weak (without strength), often in N.T. (Matthew 10:8).Let him call for  (προσκαλεσασθω). First aorist (ingressive) middle imperative of προσκαλεω. Note change of tense (aorist) and middle (indirect) voice. Care for the sick is urged in 1 Thessalonians 5:14 ("help the sick"). Note the plural here, "elders of the church, as in Acts 20:17; Acts 15:6; Acts 15:22; Acts 21:18; Philippians 1:1 (bishops).Let them pray over him  (προσευξασθωσαν επ' αυτον). First aorist middle imperative of προσευχομα. Prayer for the sick is clearly enjoined.Anointing him with oil  (αλειψαντες ελαιω). First aorist active participle of αλειφω, old verb, to anoint, and the instrumental case of ελαιον (oil). The aorist participle can be either simultaneous or antecedent with προσευξασθωσαν (pray). See the same use of αλειφω ελαιω in Mark 6:13. The use of olive oil was one of the best remedial agencies known to the ancients. They used it internally and externally. Some physicians prescribe it today. It is clear both in Mark 6:13 and here that medicinal value is attached to the use of the oil and emphasis is placed on the worth of prayer. There is nothing here of the pagan magic or of the later practice of "extreme unction" (after the eighth century). It is by no means certain that αλειφω here and in Mark 6:13 means "anoint" in a ceremonial fashion rather than "rub" as it commonly does in medical treatises. Trench (N.T. Synonyms) says: "Αλειφειν is the mundane and profane, χριειν the sacred and religious, word." At bottom in James we have God and medicine, God and the doctor, and that is precisely where we are today. The best physicians believe in God and want the help of prayer.
