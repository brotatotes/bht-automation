 Riches  (ο πλουτος). Masculine singular, but occasionally neuter το πλουτος in nominative and accusative (2 Corinthians 8:2). Apparently πλεοτος fulness (from πλεος full, πιμπλημ to fill). "Wealth."Are corrupted  (σεσηπεν). Second perfect active indicative of σηπω (root σαπ as in σαπρος, rotten), to corrupt, to destroy, here intransitive "has rotted." Only here in N.T. On the worthlessness of mere wealth see Matthew 6:19; Matthew 6:24.Were moth-eaten  (σητοβρωτα γεγονεν). "Have become (second perfect indicative of γινομα, singular number, though ιματια, neuter plural, treated collectively) moth-eaten" (σητοβρωτα, late and rare compound from σης, moth, Matthew 6:19 and βρωτος, verbal adjective of βιβρωσκω to eat John 6:13. This compound found only here, Job 13:28, Sibyll. Orac. Proem. 64). Rich robes as heirlooms, but moth-eaten. Vivid picture. Witness the 250 "lost millionaires" in the United States in 1931 as compared with 1929. Riches have wings.
