 Murmur not  (μη στεναζετε). Prohibition with μη and the present active imperative of στεναζω, old verb, to groan. "Stop groaning against one another," as some were already doing in view of their troubles. In view of the hope of the Second Coming lift up your heads.That ye be not judged  (ινα μη κριθητε). Negative purpose clause with ινα μη and the first aorist passive subjunctive of κρινω. As already indicated (James 2:12; James 4:12) and repeated in James 5:12. Reminiscence of the words of Jesus in Matthew 7:1.Standeth before the doors  (προ των θυρων εστηκεν). Perfect active indicative of ιστημ, "is standing now." Again like the language of Jesus in Matthew 24:33 (επ θυραις) and Mark 13:29. Jesus the Judge is pictured as ready to enter for the judgment.
