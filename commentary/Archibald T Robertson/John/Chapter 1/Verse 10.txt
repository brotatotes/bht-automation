 He was in the world  (εν τω κοσμω ην). Imperfect tense of continuous existence in the universe before the Incarnation as in verses John 1:1; John 1:2.Was made by him  (δι' αυτου εγενετο). "Through him." Same statement here of "the world" (ο κοσμος) as that made in verse John 1:3 of παντα.Knew him not  (αυτον ουκ εγνω). Second aorist active indicative of common verb γινοσκω, what Gildersleeve called a negative aorist, refused or failed to recognize him, his world that he had created and that was held together by him (Colossians 1:16). Not only did the world fail to know the Pre-incarnate Logos, but it failed to recognize him when he became Incarnate (John 1:26). Two examples in this sentence of John's fondness for κα as in verses John 1:1; John 1:4; John 1:5; John 1:14, the paratactic rather than the hypotactic construction, like the common Hebrew use of wav.
