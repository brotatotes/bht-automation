 For  (οτ). Correct text (Aleph B C D L) and not κα (and) of the Textus Receptus. Explanatory reason for verse John 1:14.Of his fulness  (εκ του πληρωματος). The only instance of πληρωμα in John's writings, though five times of Christ in Paul's Epistles (Colossians 1:19; Colossians 2:9; Ephesians 1:23; Ephesians 3:19; Ephesians 4:13). See Colossians 1:19 for discussion of these terms of the Gnostics that Paul employs for all the attributes of God summed up in Christ (Colossians 2:9) and so used here by John of the Incarnate Logos.We all  (ημεις παντες). John is facing the same Gnostic depreciation of Christ of which Paul writes in Colossians. So here John appeals to all his own contemporaries as participants with him in the fulness of the Logos.Received  (ελαβομεν). Second aorist active indicative of λαμβανω, a wider experience than beholding (εθεασαμεθα, verse John 1:14) and one that all believers may have.Grace for grace  (χαριν αντ χαριτος). The point is in αντ, a preposition disappearing in the Koine and here only in John. It is in the locative case of αντα (end), "at the end," and was used of exchange in sale. See Luke 11:11, αντ ιχθυος οφιν, "a serpent for a fish," Hebrews 12:2 where "joy" and "cross" are balanced against each other. Here the picture is "grace" taking the place of "grace" like the manna fresh each morning, new grace for the new day and the new service.
