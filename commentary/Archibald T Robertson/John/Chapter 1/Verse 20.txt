 And he confessed  (κα ωμολογησεν). The continued paratactic use of κα (and) and the first aorist active indicative of ομολογεω, old verb from ομολογος (ομον, λεγω, to say the same thing), to confess, in the Synoptics (Matthew 10:32) as here.And denied not  (κα ουκ ηρνησατο). Negative statement of same thing in Johannine fashion, first aorist middle indicative of αρνεομα, another Synoptic and Pauline word (Matthew 10:33; 2 Timothy 2:12). He did not contradict or refuse to say who he was.And he confessed  (κα ωμολογησεν). Thoroughly Johannine again in the paratactic repetition.I am not the Christ  (Εγω ουκ ειμ ο Χριστος). Direct quotation again with recitative οτ before it like our modern quotation marks. "I am not the Messiah," he means by ο Χριστος (the Anointed One). Evidently it was not a new question as Luke had already shown (Luke 3:15).
