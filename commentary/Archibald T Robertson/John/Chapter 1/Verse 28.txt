 In Bethany beyond Jordan  (εν Βηθανια περαν του Ιορδανου). Undoubtedly the correct text, not "in Bethabara" as Origen suggested instead of "in Bethany" of all the known Greek manuscripts under the mistaken notion that the only Bethany was that near Jerusalem.Was baptizing  (ην βαπτιζων). Periphrastic imperfect, common idiom in John.
