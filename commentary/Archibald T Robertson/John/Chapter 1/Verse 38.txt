 Turned  (στραφεις). Second aorist passive participle of στρεφω, vividly picturing the sudden act of Jesus on hearing their steps behind him.Beheld  (θεασαμενος). First aorist middle participle of θεαομα (verse John 1:32). Both participles here express antecedent action to λεγε (saith).Following  (ακολοθουντας). Present active participle of ακολουθεω (verse John 1:37). It was Christ's first experience of this kind and the two came from the Baptist to Jesus.What seek ye?  (Τ ζητειτε;). Not "whom" (τινα John 18:4; John 20:15), but "what purpose have you." The first words of Jesus preserved in this Gospel. See Luke 2:49; Matthew 3:15 for words spoken before this and Mark 1:15 for Mark's first report in the Galilean ministry.Rabbi  (Ραββε). Aramaic title for "Teacher" which John here translates by Διδασκαλε as he is writing late and for general readers. Luke, a Greek Christian, does not use it, but John recalls his first use of this term to Jesus and explains it. Matthew has it only in the greeting of Judas to the Master (Matthew 26:25; Matthew 26:49) and Mark once by Judas (Mark 14:45) and twice by Peter (Mark 9:5; Mark 11:21). John's Gospel has the disciples at first addressing Jesus by Rabbi while others address him by Κυριε (Lord or Sir) as in John 4:11; John 4:49; John 5:7. Peter uses Κυριε in John 6:68. In the end the disciples usually say Κυριε (John 13:6; John 13:25, etc.), but Mary Magdalene says Ραββουνε (John 20:16).Being interpreted  (μεθερμημευομενον). Present passive participle of μεθερμηνευω, late compound of μετα and ερμηνευω, to explain (John 1:42), old word from Hερμες, the god of speech (hermeneutics). John often explains Aramaic words (John 1:38; John 1:41; John 1:42; John 4:25; John 9:7, etc.).Where abidest thou?  (Που μενεισ;). They wished a place for quiet converse with Jesus.
