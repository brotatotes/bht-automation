 He findeth first  (ευρισκε ουτος πρωτον). "This one finds (vivid dramatic present) first" (προτων). Προτων (adverb supported by Aleph A B fam. 13) means that Andrew sought "his own brother Simon" (τον αδελφον τον ιδιον Σιμωνα) before he did anything else. But Aleph L W read πρωτος (nominative adjective) which means that Andrew was the first who went after his brother implying that John also went after his brother James. Some old Latin manuscripts (b, e, r apparently), have μανε for Greek πρω (early in the morning). Bernard thinks that this is the true reading as it allows more time for Andrew to bring Simon to Jesus. Probably πρωτον is correct, but even so John likely brought also his brother James after Andrew's example.We have found the Messiah  (Hευρηκαμεν τον Μεσσιαν). First aorist active indicative of ευρισκω. Andrew and John had made the greatest discovery of the ages, far beyond gold or diamond mines. The Baptist had told about him. "We have seen him."Which is  (ο εστιν). Same explanatory neuter relative as in verse John 1:38, "which word is." This Aramaic title Messiah is preserved in the N.T. only here and John 4:25, elsewhere translated into Χριστος, Anointed One, from χριω, to anoint. See on Matthew 1:1 for discussion.
