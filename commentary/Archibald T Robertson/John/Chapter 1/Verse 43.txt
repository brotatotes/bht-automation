 On the morrow  (τη επαυριον). The fourth of the days from verse John 1:19.He findeth Philip  (ευρισκε Φιλιππον). Vivid dramatic present as in John 1:41, though ηθελησεν (was minded, wished) is aorist active indicative. Apparently not an accidental finding, possibly due to the efforts of Andrew and Peter. Both Andrew and Philip have Greek names.Follow me  (ακολουθε μο). Present active imperative, a direct challenge to Philip. Often Jesus uses this verb to win disciples (Mark 2:14; Matthew 8:22; Matthew 9:21; Matthew 19:21; Luke 9:59; John 21:19). Already Jesus had four personal followers (Andrew and Simon, John and James). He has begun his work.
