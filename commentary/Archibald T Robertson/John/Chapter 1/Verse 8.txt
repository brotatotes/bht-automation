 He  (εκεινος). "That one," i.e. John. He was a light (John 5:35) as all believers are (Matthew 5:14), but not "the light" (το φως).But came  (αλλ'). No verb in the Greek, to be supplied by repeating ηλθεν of verse John 1:7. See similar ellipses in John 9:3; John 13:18; John 15:25. In Johannine fashion we have the final ινα clause of verse John 1:7 repeated.
