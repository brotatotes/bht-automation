 The shepherd of the sheep  (ποιμην εστιν των προβατων). No article with ποιμην, "a shepherd to the sheep." He comes in by the door with the sheep whom he leads. Old word is ποιμην, root meaning to protect. Jesus applies it to himself in verse John 10:16 and implies it here. It is used of Christ in 1 Peter 2:25; Hebrews 13:20. Paul applies it to ministers in Ephesians 4:11. Jesus uses the verb ποιμαινω, to shepherd, to Peter (John 21:16) and Peter uses it to other preachers (1 Peter 5:2) and Paul uses it for bishops (elders) in Acts 20:28. Our word pastor is simply Latin for shepherd. Christ is drawing a sharp contrast after the conduct of the Pharisees towards the blind man between himself and them.
