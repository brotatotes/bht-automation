 And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem  (εγενετο δε τα ενκαινια εν τοις Ιεροσολυμοις). But Westcott and Hort read τοτε (then) instead of δε (and) on the authority of B L W 33 and some versions. This is probably correct: "At that time came the feast of dedication in Jerusalem." Τοτε does not mean that the preceding events followed immediately after the incidents in John 10:1-21. Bernard brings chapter 9 up to this date (possibly also chapter 8) and rearranges chapter 10 in a purely arbitrary way. There is no real reason for this arrangement. Clearly there is a considerable lapse between the events in John 10:22-39 and John 10:1-21, possibly nearly three months (from just after tabernacles John 7:37 to dedication John 10:22). The Pharisees greet his return with the same desire to catch him. This feast of dedication, celebrated for eight days about the middle of our December, was instituted by Judas Maccabeus B.C. 164 in commemoration of the cleansing of the temple from the defilements of pagan worship by Antiochus Epiphanes (1Macc. 4:59). The word ενκαινια (εν, καινος, new) occurs here only in the N.T. It was not one of the great feasts and could be observed elsewhere without coming to Jerusalem. Jesus had apparently spent the time between tabernacles and dedication in Judea (Luke 10:1-13).Winter  (χειμων). Old word from χειμα (χεω, to pour, rain, or from χιων, snow). See Matthew 24:20.
