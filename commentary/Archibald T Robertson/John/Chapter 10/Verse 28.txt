 And I give unto them eternal life  (καγω διδωμ αυτοις ζωην αιωνιον). This is the gift of Jesus now to his sheep as stated in John 6:27; John 6:40 (cf. 1 John 2:25; 1 John 5:11).And they shall never perish  (κα ου μη απολωντα). Emphatic double negative with second aorist middle (intransitive) subjunctive of απολλυμ, to destroy. The sheep may feel secure (John 3:16; John 6:39; John 17:12; John 18:9).And no one shall snatch them out of my hand  (κα ουχ αρπασε τις αυτα εκ της χειρος μου). Jesus had promised this security in Galilee (John 6:37; John 6:39). No wolf, no thief, no bandit, no hireling, no demon, not even the devil can pluck the sheep out of my hand. Cf. Colossians 3:3 (Your life is hid together with Christ in God).
