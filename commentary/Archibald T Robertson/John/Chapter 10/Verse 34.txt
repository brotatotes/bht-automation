 Is it not written?  (ουκ εστιν γεγραμμενον;). Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of γραφω (as in John 2:17) in place of the usual γεγραπτα. "Does it not stand written?"In your law  (εν τω νομω υμων). From Psalms 82:6. The term νομος (law) applying here to the entire O.T. as in John 12:34; John 15:25; Romans 3:19; 1 Corinthians 14:21. Aleph D Syr-sin. omit υμων, but needlessly. We have it already so from Jesus in John 8:17. They posed as the special custodians of the O.T.I said  (οτ εγω ειπα). Recitative οτ before a direct quotation like our quotation marks. Ειπα is a late second aorist form of indicative with -α instead of -ον.Ye are gods  (θεο εστε). Another direct quotation after ειπα but without οτ. The judges of Israel abused their office and God is represented in Psalms 82:6 as calling them "gods" (θεο, elohim) because they were God's representatives. See the same use of elohim in Exodus 21:6; Exodus 22:9; Exodus 22:28. Jesus meets the rabbis on their own ground in a thoroughly Jewish way.
