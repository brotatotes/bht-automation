 When he hath put forth all his own  (οταν τα ιδια παντα εκβαλη). Indefinite temporal clause with οταν and the second aorist (effective) active subjunctive of εκβαλλω. No need of the futurum exactum idea, simply, "when he leads out all his own sheep." They are all out of the fold. He overlooks none. Εκβαλλω does mean "thrust out" if a reluctant sheep wishes to linger too long.He goeth before them  (εμπροσθεν αυτων πορευετα). Staff in hand he leads the way in front of the flock and they follow (ακολουθε) him. What a lesson for pastors who seek to drive the church like cattle and fail. The true pastor leads in love, in words, in deeds.
