 Again  (παλιν). Referring to John 1:28 (Bethany beyond Jordan). Παλιν does not mean that the other visit was a recent one.At the first  (το πρωτον). Adverbial accusative (extent of time). Same idiom in John 12:16; John 19:39. Here the identical language of John 1:28 is used with the mere addition of το πρωτον (οπου ην Ιωανης βαπτιζων, "where John was baptizing").And there he abode  (κα εμενεν εκε). Imperfect (continued) active of μενω, though some MSS. have the constative aorist active εμεινεν. Probably from here Jesus carried on the first part of the later Perean Ministry (Luke 13:22-16) before the visit to Bethany at the raising of Lazarus (John 11:1-44).
