 This parable  (ταυτην την παροιμιαν). Old word for proverb from παρα (beside) and οιμος, way, a wayside saying or saying by the way. As a proverb in N.T. in 2 Peter 2:22 (quotation from Proverbs 26:11), as a symbolic or figurative saying in John 16:25; John 16:29, as an allegory in John 10:6. Nowhere else in the N.T. Curiously enough in the N.T. παραβολη occurs only in the Synoptics outside of Hebrews 9:9; Hebrews 11:19. Both are in the LXX. Παραβολη is used as a proverb (Luke 4:23) just as παροιμια is in 2 Peter 2:22. Here clearly παροιμια means an allegory which is one form of the parable. So there you are. Jesus spoke this παροιμια to the Pharisees, "but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them" (εκεινο δε ουκ εγνωσαν τινα ην α ελαλε αυτοις). Second aorist active indicative of γινωσκω and note ην in indirect question as in John 2:25 and both the interrogative τινα and the relative α. "Spake" (imperfect ελαλε) should be "Was speaking or had been speaking."
