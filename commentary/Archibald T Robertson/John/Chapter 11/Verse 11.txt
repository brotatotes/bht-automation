 Is fallen asleep  (κεκοιμητα). Perfect passive indicative of κοιμαω, old verb to put to sleep. Common as a metaphor for death like our cemetery.I go  (πορευομα). Futuristic use of the present tense as in John 14:2.That I may awake him out of sleep  (ινα εξυπνισω αυτον). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of εξυπνιζω, a late compound (εξ, υπνος, sleep) for the older αφυπνιζω, here only in the N.T. See Job 14:12 where also it occurs along with κοιμαομα.
