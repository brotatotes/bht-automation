 About fifteen furlongs off  (ως απο σταδιων δεκαπεντε). The idiom of απο with the ablative for distance is like the Latin a millibus passum duobus (Caesar, Bell. Gall. ii. 7), but it (προ also, John 12:1) occurs already in the Doric and in the Koine often (Moulton, Proleg., p. 101; Robertson, Grammar, p. 110). See it again in John 21:8; Revelation 14:20.
