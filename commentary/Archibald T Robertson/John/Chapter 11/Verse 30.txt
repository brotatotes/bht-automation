 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town  (ουπω δε εληλυθε ο Ιησους εις την κωμην). Explanatory parenthesis with past perfect as in verse John 11:19. Martha had her interview while he was still coming (verse John 11:20) and left him (went off, απηλθεν, verse John 11:28) to hurry to Mary with the news. Why Jesus tarried still where he had met Martha we do not know. Westcott says, "as though He would meet the sisters away from the crowd of mourners."
