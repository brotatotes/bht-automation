 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping  (Ιησους ουν ως ειδεν αυτην κλαιουσαν). Proleptic position of "Jesus," "Jesus therefore when he saw." She was weeping at the feet of Jesus, not at the tomb.And the Jews also weeping  (κα τους Ιουδαιους κλαιοντας). Mary's weeping was genuine, that of the Jews was partly perfunctory and professional and probably actual "wailing" as the verb κλαιω can mean. Κλαιω is joined with αλαλαζω in Mark 5:38, with ολολυζω in James 5:1, with θορυβεω in Mark 5:39, with πενθεω in Mark 16:10. It was an incongruous combination.He groaned in the spirit  (ενεβριμησατο τω πνευματ). First aorist middle indicative of εμβριμαομα, old verb (from εν, and βριμη, strength) to snort with anger like a horse. It occurs in the LXX (Daniel 11:30) for violent displeasure. The notion of indignation is present in the other examples of the word in the N.T. (Mark 1:43; Mark 14:5; Matthew 9:30). So it seems best to see that sense here and in verse John 11:38. The presence of these Jews, the grief of Mary, Christ's own concern, the problem of the raising of Lazarus--all greatly agitated the spirit of Jesus (locative case τω πνευματ). He struggled for self-control.Was troubled  (εταραξεν εαυτον). First aorist active indicative of ταρασσω, old verb to disturb, to agitate, with the reflexive pronoun, "he agitated himself" (not passive voice, not middle). "His sympathy with the weeping sister and the wailing crowd caused this deep emotion" (Dods). Some indignation at the loud wailing would only add to the agitation of Jesus.
