 Not of himself  (αφ' εαυτου ουκ). Not wholly of himself, John means. There was more in what Caiaphas said than he understood. His language is repeated in John 18:14.Prophesied  (επροφητευσεν). Aorist active indicative of προφητευω. But certainly unconscious prophecy on his part and purely accidental. Caiaphas meant only what was mean and selfish.That Jesus should die  (οτ εμελλεν Ιησους αποθνησκειν). Imperfect active of μελλω in indirect discourse instead of the usual present retained after a secondary tense (επροφητευσεν) as sometimes occurs (see John 2:25).
