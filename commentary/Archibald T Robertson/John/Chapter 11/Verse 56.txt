 They sought therefore for Jesus  (εζητουν ουν τον Ιησουν). Imperfect active of ζητεω and common ουν of which John is so fond. They were seeking Jesus six months before at the feast of tabernacles (John 7:11), but now they really mean to kill him.As they stood in the temple  (εν τω ιερω εστηκοτες). Perfect active participle (intransitive) of ιστημ, a graphic picture of the various groups of leaders in Jerusalem and from other lands, "the knots of people in the Temple precincts" (Bernard). They had done this at the tabernacles (John 7:11-13), but now there is new excitement due to the recent raising of Lazarus and to the public order for the arrest of Jesus.That he will not come to the feast?  (οτ ου μη ελθη εις την εορτην;). The form of the question (indirect discourse after δοκειτε) assumes strongly that Jesus will not (ου μη, double negative with second aorist active ελθη from ερχομα) dare to come this time for the reason given in verse John 11:57.
