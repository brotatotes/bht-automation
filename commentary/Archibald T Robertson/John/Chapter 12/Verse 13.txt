 Took  (ελαβον). Second aorist active indicative of λαμβανω.The branches of the palm-trees  (τα βαια των φοινικων). Φοινιξ is an old word for palm-tree (Revelation 7:9 for the branches) and in Acts 27:12 the name of a city. Βαιον is apparently a word of Egyptian origin, palm branches, here only in N.T., but in the papyri and I Macc. 13:51. Here we have "the palm branches of the palm-trees." The use in 1 Macc. 13:51 (cf. II Macc. 10:7) is in the account of Simon's triumphal entry into Jerusalem. Bernard notes that to carry palms was a mark of triumphant homage to a victor or a king (Revelation 7:9). Palm-trees grew on the Mount of Olives (Mark 11:8) on the road from Bethany to Jerusalem. The crowds (one in front and one behind, Mark 11:9; Matthew 21:9; John 2:18) cut the branches as they came (Matthew 21:8).To meet him  (εις υπαντησιν αυτω). Literally,for a meeting  (υπαντησις, late word from the verb υπανταω, Matthew 8:28; John 11:20; John 11:30; John 12:18, in the papyri, but only here in the N.T.) with him" (αυτω, associative instrumental case after υπαντησιν as after the verb in verse John 12:18). It was a scene of growing excitement.And cried out  (κα εκραυγαζον). Imperfect active of κραυγαζω, old and rare verb (from κραυγη) as in Matthew 12:19; John 19:15.Hosannah  (Hωσαννα). Transliteration of the Hebrew word meaning "Save now." The LXX renders it by Σωσον δη (Save now).Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord  (ευλογημενος ο ερχομενος εν ονοματ κυριου). Perfect passive participle of ευλογεω. Quotation from Psalms 118:25, written, some think, for the dedication of the second temple, or, as others think, for the feast of tabernacles after the return (Ezra 3:1). It was sung in the processional recitation then as a welcome to the worshippers. Here the words are addressed to the Messiah as is made plain by the addition of the words, "even the king of Israel" (κα ο βασιλευς του Ισραηλ) as Nathanael called him (John 1:49). Jesus is here hailed by the multitudes as the long-looked for Messiah of Jewish hope and he allows them so to greet him (Luke 19:38-40), a thing that he prevented a year before in Galilee (John 6:14). It is probable that "in the name of the Lord" should be taken with "blessed" as in Deuteronomy 21:5; 2 Samuel 6:18; 1 Kings 22:16; 2 Kings 2:24. The Messiah was recognized by Martha as the Coming One (John 11:27) and is so described by the Baptist (Matthew 11:3). Mark (Mark 11:10) adds "the kingdom that cometh" while Luke (John 19:38) has "the king that cometh." "It was this public acclamation of Jesus as King of Israel or King of the Jews which was the foundation of the charge made against him before Pilate (John 18:33)" (Bernard).
