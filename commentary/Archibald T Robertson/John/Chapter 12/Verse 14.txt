 Found  (ευρων). Second aorist active participle of ευρισκω. Through the disciples, of course, as in Mark 11:2-6 (Matthew 21:2-3; Matthew 21:6; Luke 19:30).A young ass  (οναριον). Late diminutive of ονος, in Epictetus and the papyri (even the double diminitive, οναριδιον), only here in the N.T. See discussion of Matthew 21:5 where κα has been wrongly rendered "and" instead of "even." Rightly understood Matthew has Jesus riding only the colt like the rest.
