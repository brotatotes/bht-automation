 Loseth it  (απολλυε αυτην). The second paradox. Present active indicative of απολλυω. This great saying was spoken at various times as in Mark 8:35 (Matthew 16:25; Luke 9:24) and Mark 10:39 (Luke 17:33). See those passages for discussion of ψυχη (life or soul). For "he that hateth his life" (ο μισων την ψυχην αυτου) see the sharp contrasts in Luke John 14:26-35 where μισεω is used of father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, as well as one's own life. Clearly μισεω means "hate" when the issue is between Christ and the dearest things of life as happens when the choice is between martyrdom and apostasy. In that case one keeps his soul for eternal life by losing his life (ψυχη, each time) here. That is the way to "guard" (φυλαξε) life by being true to Christ. This is the second paradox to show Christ's philosophy of life.
