 My soul  (η ψυχη μου). The soul (ψυχη) here is synonymous with spirit (πνευμα) in John 13:21.Is troubled  (τεταρακτα). Perfect passive indicative of ταρασσω, used also in John 11:33; John 13:21 of Jesus. While John proves the deity of Jesus in his Gospel, he assumes throughout his real humanity as here (cf. John 4:6). The language is an echo of that in Psalms 6:4; Psalms 42:7. John does not give the agony in Gethsemane which the Synoptics have (Mark 14:35; Matthew 26:39; Luke 22:42), but it is quite beside the mark to suggest, as Bernard does, that the account here is John's version of the Gethsemane experience. Why do some critics feel called upon to level down to a dead plane every variety of experience in Christ's life?And what shall I say?  (κα τ ειπω;). Deliberative subjunctive which expresses vividly "a genuine, if momentary indecision" (Bernard). The request of the Greeks called up graphically to Jesus the nearness of the Cross.Father, save me from this hour  (πατερ, σωσον με εκ της ωρας ταυτης). Jesus began his prayers with "Father" (John 11:41). Dods thinks that this should be a question also. Westcott draws a distinction between εκ (out of) and απο (from) to show that Jesus does not pray to draw back from the hour, but only to come safely out of it all and so interprets εκ in Hebrews 5:7, but that distinction will not stand, for in John 1:44 εκ and απο are used in the same sense and in the Synoptics (Mark 14:35; Matthew 26:39; Luke 52:42) we have απο. If it holds here, we lose the point there. Here as in Gethsemane the soul of Jesus instinctively and naturally shrinks from the Cross, but he instantly surrenders to the will of God in both experiences.But for this cause came I unto this hour  (αλλα δια τουτο ηλθον εις την ωραν ταυτην). It was only a moment of human weakness as in Gethsemane that quickly passed. Thus understood the language has its natural meaning.
