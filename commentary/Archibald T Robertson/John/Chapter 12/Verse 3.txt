 A pound  (λιτραν). Latin libra, late Koine (Polybius, Plutarch) word with weight of 12 ounces, in N.T. only here and John 19:39. Mark (Mark 14:3) and Matthew (Matthew 26:7) have alabaster cruse.Of ointment of spikenard  (μυρου ναρδου πιστικης). "Of oil of nard." See already John 11:2 for μυρου (also Matthew 26:7). Nard is the head or spike of an East Indian plant, very fragrant. Occurs also in Mark 14:3. Πιστικης here and in Mark 14:3 probably means genuine (πιστικος, from πιστος, reliable). Only two instances in the N.T.Very precious  (πολυτιμου). Old compound adjective (πολυς, much, τιμη), in N.T. only here, Matthew 13:46; 1 Peter 1:7. Mark has πολυτελους (very costly). Matthew (Matthew 26:7) has here βαρυτιμου of weighty value (only N.T. instance).Anointed  (ηλειψεν). First aorist active indicative of αλειφω, old word (Mark 16:1).The feet  (τους ποδας). Mark (Mark 14:3) and Matthew (Matthew 26:7) have "his head." Why not both, though neither Gospel mentions both? The Latin MS. fuldensis and the Syriac Sinatic do give both head and feet here.Wiped  (εξεμαξεν). First aorist active indicative of εκμασσω, old verb to wipe off already in John 11:2; Luke 7:38; Luke 7:44.With her hair  (ταις θριξιν αυτης). Instrumental plural. It is this item that is relied on largely by those who identify Mary of Bethany with the sinful woman in Luke 7 and with Mary Magdalene. It is no doubt true that it was usually considered immodest for a woman to wear her hair loose. But it is not impossible that Mary of Bethany in her carefully planned love-offering for Jesus on this occasion was only glad to throw such a punctilio to the winds. Such an act on this occasion does not brand her a woman of loose character.Was filled with the odour of the ointment  (επληρωθη εκ της οσμης του μυρου). Effective first aorist passive of πληροω and a natural result.
