 Cried and said  (εκραξεν κα ειπεν). First aorist active indicative of κραζω, to cry aloud, and second aorist active of defective verb ερω, to say. This is probably a summary of what Jesus had already said as in verse John 12:36 John closes the public ministry of Jesus without the Synoptic account of the last day in the temple on our Tuesday (Mark 11:27-12; Matthew 21:23-23; Luke 20:1-21).Not on me, but on him  (ου εις εμε, αλλα εις τον). "Not on me only, but also on," another example of exaggerated contrast like that in verse John 12:30. The idea of Jesus here is a frequent one (believing on Jesus whom the Father has sent) as in John 3:17; John 5:23; John 5:30; John 5:43; John 7:16; John 8:42; John 13:20; John 14:1; Matthew 10:40; Luke 9:48.
