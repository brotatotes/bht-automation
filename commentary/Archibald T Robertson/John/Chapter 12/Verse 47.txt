 If any one  (εαν τις). Third-class condition with εαν and first aorist active subjunctive (ακουση) of ακουω and same form (φυλαξη) of φυλασσω with negative μη.But to save the world  (αλλ' ινα σωσω τον κοσμον). Purpose clause again (cf. ινα κρινω, just before) with ινα and first aorist active of sozo. Exaggerated contrast again, "not so much to judge, but also to save." See John 3:17 for same contrast. And yet Jesus does judge the world inevitably (John 8:15; John 9:39), but his primary purpose is to save the world (John 3:16). See close of the Sermon on the Mount for the same insistence on hearing and keeping (obeying) the words of Jesus (Matthew 7:24; Matthew 7:26) and also Luke 11:28.
