 He that is bathed  (ο λελουμενος). Perfect passive articular participle of λουω, to bathe the whole body (Acts 9:37).Save to wash his feet  (ε μη τους ποδας νιψασθα). Aleph and some old Latin MSS. have only νιψασθα, but the other words are genuine and are really involved by the use of νιψασθα (first aorist middle infinitive of νιπτω, to wash parts of the body) instead of λουσασθα, to bathe the whole body (just used before). The guest was supposed to bathe (λουω) before coming to a feast and so only the feet had to be washed (νιπτω) on removing the sandals.Clean  (καθαρος). Because of the bath. For καθαρος meaning external cleanliness see Matthew 23:26; Matthew 27:59 but in John 15:3 it is used for spiritual purity as here in "ye are clean" (καθαρο).Every whit  (ολος). All of the body because of the bath. For this same predicate use of ολος see John 9:34.But not all  (αλλ' ουχ παντες). Strongly put exception (ουχ). Plain hint of the treachery of Judas who is reclining at the table after having made the bargain with the Sanhedrin (Mark 14:11). A year ago Jesus knew that Judas was a devil and said to the apostles: "One of you is a devil" (John 6:64; John 6:70). But it did not hurt them then nor did they suspect each other then or now. It is far-fetched to make Jesus here refer to the cleansing power of his blood or to baptism as some do.
