 Ye  (υμεις). Emphatic.Call me  (φωνειτε με). "Address me." Φωνεω regular for addressing one with his title (John 1:48).Master  (Hο διδασκαλος). Nominative form (not in apposition with με accusative after φωνειτε), but really vocative in address with the article (called titular nominative sometimes) like Hο Κυριος κα ο θεος μου in John 20:28. "Teacher." See John 11:28 for Martha's title for Jesus to Mary.Lord  (Hο Κυριος). Another and separate title. In John 1:38 we have Διδασκαλε (vocative form) for the Jewish Ραββε and in John 9:36; John 9:38 Κυριε for the Jewish Mari. It is significant that Jesus approves (καλως, well) the application of both titles to himself as he accepts from Thomas the terms κυριος and θεος.For I am  (ειμ γαρ). Jesus distinctly claims here to be both Teacher and Lord in the full sense, at the very moment when he has rendered this menial, but symbolic, service to them. Here is a hint for those who talk lightly about "the peril of worshipping Jesus!"
