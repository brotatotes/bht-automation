 An example  (υποδειγμα). For the old παραδειγμα (not in N.T.), from υποδεικνυμ, to show under the eyes as an illustration or warning (Matthew 3:7), common in the papyri for illustration, example, warning, here only in John, but in James 5:10; 2 Peter 2:6; Hebrews 4:11; Hebrews 8:5; Hebrews 9:26. Peter uses τυπο (1 Peter 5:3) with this incident in mind. In Jude 1:7 δειγμα (without υπο) occurs in the sense of example.That ye also should do  (ινα κα υμεις ποιητε). Purpose clause with ινα and the present active subjunctive of ποιεω (keep on doing). Doing what? Does Jesus here institute a new church ordinance as some good people today hold? If so, it is curious that there is no record of it in the N.T. Jesus has given the disciples an object lesson in humility to rebuke their jealousy, pride, and strife exhibited at this very meal. The lesson of the "example" applies to all the relations of believers with each other. It is one that is continually needed.
