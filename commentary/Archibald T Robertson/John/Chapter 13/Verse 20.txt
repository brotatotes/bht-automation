 Whomsoever I send  (αν τινα πεμψω). More precisely, "If I send any one" (third-class condition, αν=εαν and τινα, indefinite pronoun accusative case, object of πεμψω, first aorist active subjunctive of πεμπω, to send). This use of ε τις or εαν τις (if any one) is very much like the indefinite relative οστις and ος αν (or εαν), but the idiom is different. In Mark 8:34 we have both ε τις θελε and ος εαν while in John 14:13 we find οτ αν and εαν τ (Robertson, Grammar, p. 956).
