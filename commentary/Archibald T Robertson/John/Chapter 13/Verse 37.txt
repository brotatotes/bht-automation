 "Why can I not follow thee even now?"  (δια τ ου δυναμα σο ακολουθειν αρτι;). The use of αρτ (right now, this minute) instead of νυν (at this time, verse John 13:36) illustrates the impatience of Peter.I will lay down my life for thee  (τεν ψυχην μου υπερ σου θησω). Future active indicative of τιθημ. Peter, like the rest, had not yet grasped the idea of the death of Christ, but, like Thomas (John 11:16), he is not afraid of danger. He had heard Christ's words about the good shepherd (John 10:11) and knew that such loyalty was the mark of a good disciple.
