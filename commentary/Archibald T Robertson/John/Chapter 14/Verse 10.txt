 Believest thou not?  (ου πιστευεισ;). Jesus had a right to expect greater faith from these men than from the blind man (John 9:35) or Martha (John 11:27). His words in John 14:1 are clearly needed. This oneness with the Father Jesus had already stated (John 10:38) as shown by his "words" (ρηματα) and his "works" (εργα). Cf. John 3:34; John 5:19; John 6:62.
