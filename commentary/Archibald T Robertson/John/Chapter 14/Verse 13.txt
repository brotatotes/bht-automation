 Whatsoever ye shall ask  (οτ αν αιτησητε). Indefinite relative clause with οτ (neuter accusative singular of οστις), αν and the aorist active subjunctive of αιτεω. This is an advance thought over verse John 14:12.In my name  (εν τω ονοματ μου). First mention of his "name" as the open sesame to the Father's will. See also John 14:26; John 15:16; John 16:23; John 16:24; John 16:26.That will I do  (τουτο ποιησω). The Father answers prayers (John 15:16; John 16:23), but so does the Son (here and verse John 14:14). The purpose (ινα clause with first aorist passive subjunctive of δοξαζω) is "that the Father may be glorified in the Son." Plead Christ's name in prayer to the Father.
