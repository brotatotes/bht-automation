 I will not leave  (ουκ αφησω). Future active of αφιημ, to send away, to leave behind.Desolate  (ορφανους). Old word (ορφος, Latin orbus), bereft of parents, and of parents bereft of children. Common in papyri of orphan children. In John 13:33 Jesus called the disciples τεκνια (little children), and so naturally the word means "orphans" here, but the meaning may be "helpless" (without the other Paraclete, the Holy Spirit). The only other N.T. example is in James 1:27 where it means "fatherless."I come  (ερχομα). Futuristic present as in verse John 14:3.
