 But ye behold me  (υμεις δε θεωρειτε με). Emphatic position of υμεις (ye) in contrast to the blind, unseeing world. Cf. John 13:33; John 16:10; John 16:16.Because I live, ye shall live also  (οτ εγω ζω κα υμεις ζησετε). This is our blessed guarantee of immortal, eternal life, the continued living of Jesus. He is the surety of a better covenant (Hebrews 7:22), the Risen Christ Jesus. He had said it before (John 6:57).
