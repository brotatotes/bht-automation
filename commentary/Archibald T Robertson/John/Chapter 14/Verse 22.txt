 Not Iscariot  (ουχ ο Ισκαριωτης). Judas Iscariot had gone (John 13:30), but John is anxious to make it clear that this Judas (common name, two apostles also named James) was not the infamous traitor. He is also called Thaddaeus or Lebbaeus (Mark 3:17; Matthew 10:3) and the brother (or son) of James (John 6:15; Acts 1:13). This is the fourth interruption of the talk of Jesus (by Peter, John 13:36; by Thomas, John 14:5; by Philip, John 14:8; by Judas, John 14:22).And not to the world  (κα ουχ τω κοσμω). Judas caught at the word εμφανιζω in verse John 14:21 as perhaps a Messianic theophany visible to all the world as at the judgment (John 5:27). He seems to suspect a change of plan on the part of Jesus (τ γεγονεν οτ=how has it happened that).
