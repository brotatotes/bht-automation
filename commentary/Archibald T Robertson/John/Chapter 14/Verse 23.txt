 If a man love me  (εαν τις αγαπα με). Condition of third class with εαν and present active subjunctive, "if one keep on loving me." That is key to the spiritual manifestation (εμφανιζω).We will come  (ελευσομεθα). Future middle of ερχομα and first person plural (the Father and I), not at the judgment, but here and now.And make our abode with him  (κα μονην παρ' αυτω ποιησομεθα). See verse John 14:2 for the word μονη (dwelling, abiding place). If the Holy Spirit "abides" (μενε, verse John 14:17) in you, that heart becomes a temple (ναος) of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 3:16), and so a fit dwelling place for the Father and the Son, a glorious and uplifting reality.
