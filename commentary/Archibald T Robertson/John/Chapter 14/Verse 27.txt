 My peace  (ειρηνην την εμην). This is Christ's bequest to the disciples before he goes, the shalom of the orient for greeting and parting, used by Jesus in his appearances after the resurrection (John 20:19; John 20:21; John 20:26) as in 2 John 1:3; 3 John 1:14, but here and in John 16:33 in the sense of spiritual peace such as only Christ can give and which his Incarnation offers to men (Luke 2:14).Neither let it be fearful  (μεδη δειλιατω). Added to the prohibition in verse John 14:1, only N.T. example of δειλιαω (rare word in Aristotle, in a papyrus of one condemned to death), common in LXX, like palpitating of the heart (from δειλος).
