 I go away, and I come  (υπαγω κα ερχομα), both futuristic presents (John 7:33; John 14:3; John 14:18).If ye loved me  (ε ηγαπατε με). Second-class condition with the imperfect active of αγαπαω referring to present time, implying that the disciples are not loving Jesus as they should.Ye would have rejoiced  (εχαρητε αν). Second aorist passive indicative of χαιρω with αν, conclusion of second-class condition referring to past time, "Ye would already have rejoiced before this" at Christ's going to the Father (verse John 14:12).Greater than I  (μειζων μου). Ablative case μου after the comparative μειζων (from positive μεγας). The filial relation makes this necessary. Not a distinction in nature or essence (cf. John 10:30), but in rank in the Trinity. No Arianism or Unitarianism here. The very explanation here is proof of the deity of the Son (Dods).
