 The true vine  (η αμπελος η αληθινη). "The vine the genuine." Assuming that the Lord's Supper had just been instituted by Jesus the metaphor of the vine is naturally suggested by "the fruit of the vine" (Mark 14:25; Matthew 26:29). Αμπελος in the papyri (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary) is sometimes used in the sense of ampelon (vineyard), but not so here. Jesus uses various metaphors to illustrate himself and his work (the light, John 8:12; the door, John 10:7; the shepherd, John 10:11; the vine, John 15:1). The vine was common in Palestine. See Psalms 80:8. "On the Maccabean coinage Israel was represented by a vine" (Dods). Jesus is the genuine Messianic vine.The husbandman  (ο γεωργος) as in Mark 12:1; James 5:7; 2 Timothy 2:6. cf. 1 Corinthians 3:9, θεου γεωργιον (God's field).
