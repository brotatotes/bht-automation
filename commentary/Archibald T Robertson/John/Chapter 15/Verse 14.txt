 If ye do  (εαν ποιητε). Condition of third class with εαν and the present active subjunctive, "if ye keep on doing," not just spasmodic obedience. Just a different way of saying what is in verse John 15:10. Obedience to Christ's commands is a prerequisite to discipleship and fellowship (spiritual friendship with Christ). He repeats it in the Great Commission (Matthew 28:20, ενετειλαμην, I commanded) with the very word used here (εντελλομα, I command).
