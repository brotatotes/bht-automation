 But I chose you  (αλλ' εγω εξελεξαμην υμας). First aorist middle indicative of εκλεγω. See this same verb and tense used for the choice of the disciples by Christ (John 6:70; John 13:18; John 15:19). Jesus recognizes his own responsibility in the choice after a night of prayer (Luke 6:13). So Paul was "a vessel of choice" (σκευος εκλογης, Acts 9:15). Appointed (εθηκα). First aorist active indicative (κ aorist) of τιθημ. Note three present active subjunctives with ινα (purpose clause) to emphasize continuance (υπαγητε, keep on going, φερητε, keep on bearing fruit, μενη, keep on abiding), not a mere spurt, but permanent growth and fruit-bearing.He may give  (δω). Second aorist active subjunctive of διδωμ with ινα (purpose clause). Cf. John 14:13 for the same purpose and promise, but with ποιησω (I shall do). See also John 16:23; John 16:26.
