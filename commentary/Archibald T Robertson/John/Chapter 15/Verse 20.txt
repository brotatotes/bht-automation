 Remember  (μνημονευετε). Present active imperative of μνημονευω, old verb from μνημων, in John again in John 16:4; John 16:21. See John 13:16 for this word.If they persecuted me  (ε εμε εδιωξαν). Condition of first class. They certainly did persecute (first aorist active of διωκω, to chase like a wild beast like the Latin persequor, our "persecute") Jesus (John 5:16). They will persecute those like Jesus. Cf. John 16:33; Mark 10:30; Luke 21:12; 1 Corinthians 4:12; 2 Corinthians 4:9; Galatians 4:29; 2 Timothy 3:12 for proof that this prophecy came true. But the alternative is true and is stated by Jesus with a like condition of the first class, "if they kept my word" (ε τον λογον μου ετηρησαν). The world does praise the word of Jesus, but dreads to follow it.
