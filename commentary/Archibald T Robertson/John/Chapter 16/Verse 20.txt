 Ye shall weep and lament  (κλαυσετε κα θρηνησετε). Future active of κλαιω and θρηνεω, both old words (for κλαιω see John 11:31, for θρηνεω see Matthew 11:17), both words used of the loud lamentations so common in the east.Shall rejoice  (χαρησετα). Second future passive of χαιρω in violent contrast. Picture the women on the way to the Cross (Luke 23:27, εκοπτοντο κα εθρηνουν, two descriptive imperfects) and Mary Magdalene by the tomb (John 20:11, κλαιουσα).Ye shall be sorrowful  (λυπηθησεσθε). First future passive of λυπεω, word for inward grief. See the change from sorrow to joy in John 20:14-16 when "they disbelieved for joy" (Luke 24:41). So violent was the reaction on the sudden appearance of Jesus.
