 And ye therefore now  (κα υμεις ουν νυν). See John 8:38 for like emphasis onye  (υμεις). The "sorrow" (λυπην) is like that of the mother in childbirth (real, but fleeting, with permanent joy following). The metaphor points, of course, to the resurrection of Jesus which did change the grief of the disciples to gladness, once they are convinced that Jesus has risen from the dead.But I will see you again  (παλιν δε οψομα υμας). Future middle of οραω, to see. In verses John 16:16; John 16:19 Jesus had said "ye shall see me" (οψεσθε με), but here we have one more blessed promise, "I shall see you," showing "that we are the objects of God's regard" (Westcott).Shall rejoice  (χαρησετα). Second future passive of χαιρω.Taketh away  (αιρε). Present active indicative, futuristic present, but B D have αρε the future active (shall take away). This joy is a permanent possession.
