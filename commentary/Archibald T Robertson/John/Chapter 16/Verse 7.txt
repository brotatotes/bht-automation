 It is expedient for you  (συμφερε υμιν). Present active indicative of συμφερω, old verb to bear together. See John 11:50 where the phrase is used by Caiaphas "for us," here "for you" (υμιν ethical dative).That I go away  (ινα εγω απελθω). Subject clause the subject of συμφερε, ινα and second aorist active subjunctive of απερχομα. The reason (γαρ) for this startling statement follows.If I go not away  (εαν μη απελθω). Third-class condition with εαν and the negative μη with απελθω as before.Will not come  (ου μη ελθη). Strong double negative with second aorist active subjunctive of ερχομα. The Holy Spirit was, of course, already at work in the hearts of men, but not in the sense of witnessing as Paraclete which could only take place after Jesus had gone back to the Father.But if I go  (εαν δε πορευθω). Third-class condition again (εαν and the first aorist passive subjunctive of πορευομα).I will send  (πεμψω). First person future as in John 16:15.
