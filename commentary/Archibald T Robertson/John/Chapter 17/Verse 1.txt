 Lifting up  (επαρας). First aorist active participle of επαιρω, old and common verb with οφθαλμους (eyes) as in John 4:35; John 6:5; John 11:41.Father  (Πατερ). Vocative form as in verses John 17:5; John 17:11; John 11:41, Christ's usual way of beginning his prayers. It is inconceivable that this real Lord's Prayer is the free composition of a disciple put into the mouth of Jesus. It is rather "the tenacious memory of an old man recalling the greatest days of his life" (Bernard), aided by the Holy Spirit promised for this very purpose (John 14:26; John 16:13). Jesus had the habit of prayer (Mark 1:35; Mark 6:46; Matthew 11:25; Luke 3:21; Luke 5:16; Luke 6:12; Luke 9:18; Luke 9:28; Luke 11:22; Luke 11:42; Luke 23:34; Luke 23:46; John 11:41; John 12:27). He prayed here for himself (John 17:1-5), for the disciples (John 17:6-19), for all believers (John 17:20-26). The prayer is similar in spirit to the Model Prayer for us in Matthew 6:9-13. The hour for his glorification has come as he had already told the disciples (John 13:31; John 12:23).Glorify thy Son  (δοξασον σου τον υιον). First aorist active imperative of δοξαζω, the only personal petition in this prayer. Jesus had already used this word δοξαζω for his death (John 13:31). Here it carries us into the very depths of Christ's own consciousness. It is not merely for strength to meet the Cross, but for the power to glorify the Father by his death and resurrection and ascension, "that the Son may glorify thee" (ινα ο υιος δοξαση σε). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive.
