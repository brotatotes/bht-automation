 I kept  (ετηρουν). Imperfect active of τηρεω, "I continued to keep."I guarded  (εφυλαξα). First aorist (constative) active of φυλασσω. Christ was the sentinel (φυλαξ, Acts 5:23) for them. Is he our sentinel now?But the son of perdition  (ε μη ο υιος της απωλειας). The very phrase for antichrist (2 Thessalonians 2:3). Note play on απωλετο, perished (second aorist middle indicative of απολλυμ). It means the son marked by final loss, not annihilation, but meeting one's destiny (Acts 2:25). A sad and terrible exception (Mark 14:21).The scripture  (η γραφη). It is not clear whether this is John's own comment or the word of Jesus. Not in John 18:9. The Scripture referred to is probably Psalms 41:9 quoted in John 13:18 with the same formula ινα πληρωθη which see there.
