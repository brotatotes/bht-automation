 That they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves  (ινα εχωσιν την χαραν την εμην πεπληρωμενην εν εαυτοις). Purpose clause with present active subjunctive of εχω, "that they may keep on having Christ's joy in their faithfulness realized in themselves." Πεπληρωμενην is the perfect passive participle of πληροω in the predicate position. For the use of πληροω with χαρα (joy) see John 15:11; John 16:24; Philippians 2:2.
