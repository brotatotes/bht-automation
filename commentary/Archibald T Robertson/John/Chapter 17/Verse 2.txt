 Authority over all flesh  (εξουσιαν πασης σαρκος). Σαρκος is objective genitive. Stupendous claim impossible for a mere man to make. Made already in Matthew 11:27; Luke 10:22 (Q, the Logia of Jesus, our earliest known document about Jesus) and repeated in Matthew 28:18 after his resurrection.That  (ινα). Secondary purpose with ινα δωσε (future active indicative) carrying on the idea of ινα δοξαση. See John 13:34; John 17:21 for ινα, καθωσ, ινα.Whatsoever  (παν ο). A peculiar classical Greek idiom, the collective use of the singular παν ο as in John 6:37; John 6:39 and ο in John 17:24 and the nominative absolute (nom. pendens) with αυτοις (to them), the dative plural explaining the construction. See Robertson, Grammar, p. 653.
