 Should know  (γινωσκωσιν). Present active subjunctive with ινα (subject clause), "should keep on knowing."Even Jesus Christ  (Ιησουν Χριστον). See John 1:17 for the only other place in John's Gospel where the words occur together. Coming here in the Lord's own prayer about himself they create difficulty, unless, as Westcott suggests, Χριστον be regarded as a predicate accusative, "Jesus as the Christ" (Messiah). Otherwise the words would seem to be John's parenthetical interpretation of the idea of Jesus. Lucke thinks that the solemnity of this occasion explains Jesus referring to himself in the third person. The knowledge of "the only true God" is through Jesus Christ (John 14:6-9).
