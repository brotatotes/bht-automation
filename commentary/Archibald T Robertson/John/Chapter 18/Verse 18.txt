 A fire of coals  (ανθρακιαν). Old word, in LXX, only here and John 21:9 in N.T. A heap of burning coals (ανθραξ, coal). Cf. our "anthracite." It was cold (ψυχος ην). "There was coldness." The soldiers had apparently returned to their barracks.Were warming themselves  (εθερμαινοντο). Direct middle imperfect indicative of θερμαινω (from θερμος). So as to θερμαινομενος about Peter. "Peter, unabashed by his lie, joined himself to the group and stood in the light of the fire" (Dods).
