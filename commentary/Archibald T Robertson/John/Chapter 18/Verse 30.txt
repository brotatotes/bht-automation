 If this man were not an evil-doer  (ε μη ην ουτος κακον ποιων). Condition (negative) of second class (periphrastic imperfect indicative), assumed to be untrue, with the usual apodosis (αν and aorist indicative, first aorist plural with κ). This is a pious pose of infallibility not in the Synoptics. They then proceeded to make the charges (Luke 23:2) as indeed John implies (John 18:31; John 18:33). Some MSS. here read κακοποιος (malefactor) as in 1 Peter 2:12; 1 Peter 2:14, with which compare Luke's κακουργος (John 23:32; so also 2 Timothy 2:9), both meaning evil-doer. Here the periphrastic present participle ποιων with κακον emphasizes the idea that Jesus was a habitual evil-doer (Abbott). It was an insolent reply to Pilate (Bernard).
