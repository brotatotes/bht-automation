 Again  (παλιν). Back into the palace where Pilate was before.Called  (εφωνησεν). First aorist active indicative of φωνεω. Jesus was already inside the court (verse John 18:28). Pilate now summoned him to his presence since he saw that he had to handle the case. The charge that Jesus claimed to be a king compelled him to do so (Luke 23:2).Art thou the King of the Jews?  (συ ε ο βασιλευς των Ιουδαιων;). This was the vital problem and each of the Gospels has the question (Mark 15:2; Matthew 27:1; Luke 23:3; John 18:33), though Luke alone (John 23:2) gives the specific accusation.Thou  (συ). Emphatic. Jesus did claim to be the spiritual king of Israel as Nathanael said (John 1:49) and as the ecstatic crowd hailed him on the Triumphal Entry (John 12:13), but the Sanhedrin wish Pilate to understand this in a civil sense as a rival of Caesar as some of the Jews wanted Jesus to be (John 6:15) and as the Pharisees expected the Messiah to be.
