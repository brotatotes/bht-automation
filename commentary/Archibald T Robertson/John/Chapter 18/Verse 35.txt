 Am I a Jew?  (μητ εγω Ιουδαιος ειμι;). Proud and fine scorn on Pilate's part at the idea that he had a personal interest in the question. Vehement negation implied. Cf. John 4:29 for μητ in a question. The gulf between Jew and Gentile yawns wide here.Nation  (εθνος as in John 11:48-52, rather than λαος, while both in John 11:50). For παρεδωκαν see verse John 18:30.What hast thou done?  (τ εποιησασ;). First aorist active indicative of ποιεω. Blunt and curt question. "What didst thou do?" "What is thy real crime?" John's picture of this private interview between Pilate and Jesus is told with graphic power.
