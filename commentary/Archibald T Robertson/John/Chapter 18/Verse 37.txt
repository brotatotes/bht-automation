 Art thou a king then?  (ουκουν βασιλευς ε συ;). Compound of ουκ and ουν and is clearly ironical expecting an affirmative answer, only here in the N.T., and in LXX only in A text in 2 Kings 5:23.Thou sayest that  (συ λεγεις οτ). In Matthew 27:11; Mark 15:2; Luke 23:3, συ λεγεις clearly means "yes," as συ ειπας (thou saidst) does in Matthew 26:64 (= "I am," εγω ειμ, in Mark 41:62). Hence here οτ had best be taken to mean "because": "Yes, because I am a king."Have I been born  (εγω γεγεννημα). Perfect passive indicative of γενναω. The Incarnation was for this purpose. Note repetition of εις τουτο (for this purpose), explained by ινα μαρτυρησω τη αληθεια (that I may bear witness to the truth), ινα with first aorist active subjunctive of μαρτυρεω. Paul (1 Timothy 6:13) alludes to this good confession when Christ bore witness (μαρτυρησαντος) before Pilate. Jesus bore such witness always (John 3:11; John 3:32; John 7:7; John 8:14; Revelation 1:5).
