 Fell to the ground  (επεσαν χαμα). Second aorist active indicative of πιπτω with first aorist ending (-αν). This recoil made them stumble. But why did they step back? Was it the former claim of Jesus ( I am , εγω ειμ) to be on an equality with God (John 8:58; John 13:19) or mere embarrassment and confusion or supernatural power exerted by Jesus? B adds Ιησους which must mean simply: "I am Jesus."
