 Thou wouldest have  (ουκ ειχες). Imperfect active indicative without αν, but apodosis of second-class condition as in John 15:22; John 15:24.Except it were given thee  (ε μη ην δεδομενον). Periphrastic past perfect indicative of διδωμ (a permanent possession).From above  (ανωθεν). From God (cf. John 3:3), the same doctrine of government stated by Paul in Romans 13:1. Pilate did not get his "authority" from the Sanhedrin, but from Caesar. Jesus makes God the source of all real "authority."Hath greater sin  (μειζονα αμαρτιαν εχε). The same idiom in John 9:41. Caiaphas has his authority from God also and has used Pilate for his own base end.
