 He delivered  (παρεδωκεν). Kappa aorist active of παραδιδωμ, the very verb used of the Sanhedrin when they handed Jesus over to Pilate (John 18:30; John 18:35). Now Pilate hands Jesus back to the Sanhedrin with full consent for his death (Luke 23:25).To be crucified  (ινα σταυρωθη). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist passive subjunctive of σταυροω. John does not give the dramatic episode in Matthew 27:24 when Pilate washed his hands and the Jews took Christ's blood on themselves and their children. But it is on Pilate also.
