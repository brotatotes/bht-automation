 Pilate wrote a title also  (εγραψεν κα τιτλον ο Πειλατος). Only John tells us that Pilate himself wrote it and John alone uses the technical Latin word titlon (several times in inscriptions), for the board with the name of the criminal and the crime in which he is condemned; Mark (Mark 15:26) and Luke (Luke 23:28) use επιγραφη (superscription). Matthew (Matthew 27:37) has simply αιτιαν (accusation). The inscription in John is the fullest of the four and has all in any of them save the words "this is" (ουτος εστιν) in Matthew 27:37.
