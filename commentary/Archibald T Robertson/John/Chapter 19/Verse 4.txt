 I bring him out to you  (αγω υμιν αυτον εξω). Vividly pictures Pilate leading Jesus out of the palace before the mob in front.That ye may know  (ινα γνωτε). Final clause with ινα and the second aorist active subjunctive of γινωσκω, "that ye may come to know," by this mockery the sincerity of Pilate's decision that Jesus is innocent (John 18:38). It is a travesty on justice and dignity, but Pilate is trying by a bit of humour to turn the mob from the grip of the Sanhedrin.
