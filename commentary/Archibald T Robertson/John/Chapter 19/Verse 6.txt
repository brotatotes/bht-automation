 Crucify him, crucify him  (σταυρωσον, σταυρωσον). First aorist active imperative of σταυροω for which verb see Matthew 29:19, etc. Here the note of urgency (aorist imperative) with no word for "him," as they were led by the chief priests and the temple police till the whole mob takes it up (Matthew 27:22).For I find no crime in him  (εγω γαρ ουχ ευρισκω). This is the third time Pilate has rendered his opinion of Christ's innocence (John 18:38; John 19:4). And here he surrenders in a fret to the mob and gives as his reason (γαρ, for) for his surrender the innocence of Jesus (the strangest judicial decision ever rendered). Perhaps Pilate was only franker than some judges!
