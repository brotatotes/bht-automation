 Whence art thou?  (ποθεν ε συ;). Pilate knew that Jesus was from Galilee (Luke 23:6). He is really alarmed. See a like question by the Jews in John 8:25.Gave him no answer  (αποκρισιν ουκ εδωκεν αυτω). See same idiom in John 1:22. Αποκρισις (old word from αποκρινομα) occurs also in Luke 2:47; Luke 20:26. The silence of Jesus, like that before Caiaphas (Mark 14:61; Matthew 26:63) and Herod (Luke 23:9), irritates the dignity of Pilate in spite of his fears.
