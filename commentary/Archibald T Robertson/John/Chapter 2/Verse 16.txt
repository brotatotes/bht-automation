 Take these things hence  (Αρατε ταυτα εντευθεν). First aorist active imperative of αιρω. Probably the doves were in baskets or cages and so had to be taken out by the traders.Make not my Father's house a house of merchandise  (μη ποιειτε τον οικον του πατρος μου οικον εμποριου). "Stop making," it means, μη and the present active imperative. They had made it a market-house (εμποριου, here only in N.T., old word from εμπορος, merchant, one who goes on a journey for traffic, a drummer). Note the clear-cut Messianic claim here (My Father as in Luke 2:49). Jerome says: "A certain fiery and starry light shone from his eyes and the majesty of Godhead gleamed in His face."
