 Remembered  (εμνησθησαν). First aorist passive indicative of μιμνησκω, to remind, "were reminded." Westcott notes the double effect of this act as is true of Christ's words and deeds all through John's Gospel. The disciples are helped, the traders are angered.That it is written  (οτ γεγραμμενον εστιν). Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of γραφω retained in indirect discourse (assertion).The zeal of thine house  (ο ζηλος του οικου σου). Objective genitive. "The zeal for thy house."Shall eat me up  (καταφαγετα με). Future middle indicative of κατεσθιω, defective verb, to eat down ("up" we say), perfective use of κατα-. This future φαγομα is from the second aorist εφαγον. It is a quotation from Psalms 69:9, frequently quoted in the N.T.
