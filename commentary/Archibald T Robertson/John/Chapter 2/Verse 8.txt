 Draw out now  (Αντλησατε νυν). First aorist active imperative of αντλεω, from ο αντλος, bilge water, or the hold where the bilge water settles (so in Homer). The verb occurs in John 4:7; John 4:15, for drawing water from the well, and Westcott so interprets it here, but needlessly so, since the servants seem bidden to draw from the large water-jars now full of water. Apparently the water was still water when it came out of the jars (verse John 2:9), but was changed to wine before reaching the guests. The water in the jars remained water.Unto the ruler of the feast  (τω αρχιτρικλινω). Dative case. The τρικλινος was a room (οικος) with three couches (κλινη) for the feast. The αρχιτρικλινος was originally the superintendent of the dining-room who arranged the couches and tasted the food, not the toast-master (συμποσιαρχης).And they bare it  (ο δε ηνεγκαν). Second aorist active indicative of φερω. Apparently not knowing at first that they bore wine.
