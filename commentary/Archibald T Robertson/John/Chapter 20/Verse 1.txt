 Now on the first day of the week  (τη δε μια των σαββατων). Locative case of time when. Both Mark (Mark 16:2) and Luke (Luke 24:1) have this very idiom of the cardinal τη μια, instead of the usual ordinal τη πρωτη (first), an idiom common in the papyri and in the modern Greek (Robertson, Grammar, p. 671). In all three instances also we have the genitive plural των σαββατων for "the week" as in Acts 20:7. The singular σαββατον also occurs for "the week" as in Luke 18:12; Mark 16:9.Cometh Mary Magdalene  (Μαρια η Μαγδαληνη ερχετα). Vivid historical present. Mary Magdalene is not to be confounded with Mary of Bethany.While it was yet dark  (σκοτιας ετ ουσης). Genitive absolute. For σκοτια see John 6:17; Matthew 10:27. Mark (Mark 16:2) says the sun was risen on their actual arrival. She started from the house while still dark.Taken away  (ηρμενον). Perfect passive participle of αιρω, predicate accusative in apposition with τον λιθον.
