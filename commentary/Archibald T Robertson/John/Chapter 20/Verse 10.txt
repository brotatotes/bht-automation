 Unto their own home  (προς αυτους). "To themselves." Luke (Luke 24:12) has προς αυτον about Peter ("to his home"). This use of the reflective pronoun for home (literally, "to themselves"), like the French chez eux, occurs in Josephus (Ant. VII. 4, 6). John had taken the mother of Jesus to his home (John 19:27) and so he now hurried home to tell her the glorious news as he believed.
