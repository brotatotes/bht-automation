 Mary  (Μαριαμ). Aramaic form in Aleph B W, though Μαρια in John 19:25. Clearly the old familiar tone of Jesus was in the pronunciation of her name.Rabboni  (Ραββουνε). Aramaic again for Διδασκαλε (Teacher), "my Teacher." In N.T. only here and Mark 10:51 though practically the same as Ραββ. See John 11:28 for "the Teacher" (Rabbi). These two simple words tell the great fact that Christ is risen and Mary has seen him. One says little in really great moments.
