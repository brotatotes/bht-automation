 Stooping and looking in  (παρακυψας). Originally to stoop and look, but in the LXX (Genesis 26:8; Judges 5:28; 1 Kings 6:4, etc.) and the papyri rather just to peep in and so Field (Ot. Norv.) urges here. See also verse John 20:11; Luke 24:12 (the verse bracketed by Westcott and Hort). For οθονια (linen cloth) see John 19:40.Lying  (κειμενα). Present middle participle of κειμα, predicative accusative. John notices this fact at once. If the body had been removed, these clothes would have gone also. John's timid nature made him pause (yet, μεντο, however).
