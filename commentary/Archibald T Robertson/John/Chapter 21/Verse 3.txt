 I go a fishing  (υπαγω αλιευειν). The present active infinitive αλιευειν expresses purpose as often. It is a late verb from αλιευς (fisherman) and occurs in Jeremiah 16:16, in Philo, Plutarch, and one papyrus. Peter's proposal was a natural one. He had been a fisherman by practice and they were probably waiting in Galilee for the appointed meeting with Christ on the mountain. Andrew and Peter, James and John were fishermen also. Peter's proposition met a ready response from all.They took  (επιασαν). First aorist active indicative of πιαζω, Doric form for πιεζω, to catch.
