 That whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life  (ινα πας ο πιστευων εν αυτω εχη ζωην αιωνιον). Final use of ινα with present active subjunctive of εχω, that he may keep on having eternal life (a frequent phrase in John, always in John αιωνιος occurs with ζωη, 16 times in the Gospel, 6 in 1John, ageless or endless life, beginning now and lasting forever). It is more than endless, for it is sharing in the life of God in Christ (John 5:26; John 17:3; 1 John 5:12). So here εν αυτω (in him) is taken with εχη rather than with πιστευων. The interview with Nicodemus apparently closes with verse John 3:15. In verses John 3:16-21 we have past tenses constantly as is natural for the reflection of John, but unnatural for Jesus speaking. There are phrases like the Prologue (verse John 3:19; John 1:9-11). "Only begotten" does not occur elsewhere in the words of Jesus, but is in John 1:14; John 1:18; 1 John 4:9. John often puts in explanatory comments (John 1:16-18; John 12:37-41).
