 For so  (ουτως γαρ). This use of γαρ is quite in John's style in introducing his comments (John 2:25; John 4:8; John 5:13, etc.). This "Little Gospel" as it is often called, this "comfortable word" (the Anglican Liturgy), while not a quotation from Jesus is a just and marvellous interpretation of the mission and message of our Lord. In verses John 3:16-21 John recapitulates in summary fashion the teaching of Jesus to Nicodemus.Loved  (ηγαπησεν). First aorist active indicative of αγαπαω, the noble word so common in the Gospels for the highest form of love, used here as often in John (John 14:23; John 17:23; 1 John 3:1; 1 John 4:10) of God's love for man (cf. 2 Thessalonians 2:16; Romans 5:8; Ephesians 2:4). In John 21:15 John presents a distinction between αγαπαω and φιλεω. Αγαπαω is used also for love of men for men (John 13:34), for Jesus (John 8:42), for God (1 John 4:10).The world  (τον κοσμον). The whole cosmos of men, including Gentiles, the whole human race. This universal aspect of God's love appears also in 2 Corinthians 5:19; Romans 5:8.That he gave  (ωστε εδωκεν). The usual classical construction with ωστε and the indicative (first aorist active) practical result, the only example in the N.T. save that in Galatians 2:13. Elsewhere ωστε with the infinitive occurs for actual result (Matthew 13:32) as well as purpose (Matthew 10:1), though even this is rare.His only begotten Son  (τον υιον τον μονογενη). "The Son the only begotten." For this word see on John 1:14; John 1:18; John 3:18. The rest of the sentence, the purpose clause with ινα-εχη precisely reproduces the close of John 3:15 save that εις αυτον takes the place of εν αυτω (see John 1:12) and goes certainly with πιστευων (not with εχη as εν αυτω in verse John 3:15) and the added clause "should not perish but" (μη απολητα αλλα, second aorist middle subjunctive, intransitive, of απολλυμ, to destroy). The same contrast between "perish" and "eternal life" (for this world and the next) appears also in John 10:28. On "perish" see also John 17:12.
