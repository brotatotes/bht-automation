 That doeth ill  (ο φαυλα πρασσων). The word φαυλος means first worthless and then wicked (usually so in N.T.) and both senses occur in the papyri. In John 5:29 see contrast between αγαθα ποιεω (doing good things) and φαυλα πρασσω (practising evil things).Hateth the light  (μισε το φως). Hence talks against it, ridicules Christ, Christianity, churches, preachers, etc. Does it in talk, magazines, books, in a supercilious tone of sheer ignorance.Cometh not to the light  (ουκ ερχετα προς το φως). The light hurts his eyes, reveals his own wickedness, makes him thoroughly uncomfortable. Hence he does not read the Bible, he does not come to church, he does not pray. He goes on in deeper darkness.Lest his works should be reproved  (ινα μη ελεγχθη τα εργα αυτου). Negative final clause (ινα μη) with first aorist passive subjunctive of ελεγχω, old word to correct a fault, to reprove, to convict. See also John 8:46; John 16:8. To escape this unpleasant process the evil man cuts out Christ.
