 Sir  (Κυριε). Not yet "Lord" for her. See verse John 4:11.This water  (τουτο το υδωρ). This peculiar kind of water. She did not grasp the last phrase "unto life eternal," and speaks half ironically of "this water."That I thirst not  (ινα μη διψω). Final clause with ινα, alluding to the words of Jesus, water that will prevent thirst.Neither come  (μηδε διερχωμα). Carrying on the negative purpose with present middle subjunctive, "nor keep on coming" as she has to do once or twice every day. She is evidently puzzled and yet attracted.
