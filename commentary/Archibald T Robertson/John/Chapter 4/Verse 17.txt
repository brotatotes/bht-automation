 I have no husband  (ουκ εχω ανδρα). The Greek ανηρ means either "man" or "husband." She had her "man," but he was not a legal "husband." Her language veils her deceit.Thou saidst well  (καλως ειπες). Jesus saw through the double sense of her language and read her heart as he only can do, a supernatural gift of which John often speaks (John 1:48; John 2:24; John 5:20).For thou hast had five husbands  (πεντε γαρ ανδρας εσχες). "For thou didst have five men." Second aorist (constative) active indicative of εχω.Is not thy husband  (ουκ εστιν σου ανηρ). In the full and legal sense of ανηρ, not a mere "man."This hast thou said truly  (τουτο αληθες ειρηκας). "This a true thing thou hast said." Note absence of article with αληθες (predicate accusative). Perfect active indicative ειρηκας here, not aorist ειπες (verse John 4:17).
