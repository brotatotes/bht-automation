 Left Judea  (αφηκεν την Ιουδαιαν). Unusual use of αφιημ. First (Καππα) aorist active indicative. Originally the word means to send away, to dismiss, to forsake, to forgive, to allow. Jesus uses it in this sense in John 16:28. Evidently because Jesus did not wish to bring the coming conflict with the Pharisees to an issue yet. So he mainly avoids Jerusalem and Judea now till the end. Each time hereafter that Jesus appears in Jerusalem and Judea before the last visit there is an open breach with the Pharisees who attack him (John 5:1-47; John 7:14-10; John 10:22-42; John 11:17-53).Again into Galilee  (παλιν εις την Γαλιλαιαν). Reference to John 2:1-12. The Synoptics tell nothing of this early work in Perea (John 1:19-51), Galilee, or Judea (John 2:13-4). John supplements their records purposely.
