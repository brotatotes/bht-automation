 Say not ye?  (Ουχ υμεις λεγετε;). It is not possible to tell whether Jesus is alluding to a rural proverb of which nothing is known about there being four months from seedtime to harvest (a longer time than four months in fact) or whether he means that it was then actually four months to harvest. In the latter sense, since harvest began about the middle of April, it would be December when Jesus spoke.There are yet four months  (ετ τετραμηνος εστιν). The use of ετ (yet) and the fact that the space between seedtime and harvest is longer than four months (τετρα, Aeolic for τεσσαρα, and μην, month) argue against the proverb idea.And then cometh the harvest  (κα ο θερισμος ερχετα). "And the harvest (θερισμος, from θεριζω, rare in Greek writers) comes." The possible Iambic verse here is purely accidental as in John 5:14.Lift up your eyes  (επαρατε τους οφθαλμους υμων). First aorist active imperative of επαιρω. Deliberate looking as in John 6:5 where θεαομα also is used as here.Fields  (χωρας). Cultivated or ploughed ground as in Luke 21:21.White  (λευκα). Ripened grain like grey hair (Matthew 5:36).Already unto harvest  (προς θερισμον ηδη). Probably ηδη (already) goes with verse John 4:36. The Samaritans could already be seen approaching and they were the field "white for harvest." This is the meaning of Christ's parable. If it is the spring of the year and Christ can point to the ripened grain, the parable is all the plainer, but it is not dependent on this detail. Recall the parable of the sower in John 4:13.
