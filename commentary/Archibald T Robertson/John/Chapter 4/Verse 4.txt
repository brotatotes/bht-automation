 He must needs pass through Samaria  (Εδε δε αυτον διερχεσθα δια της Σαμαριας). Imperfect indicative of the impersonal verb δε with subject infinitive (διερχεσθα) and accusative of general reference (αυτον). Note repetition of δια. It was only necessary to pass through Samaria in going directly north from Judea to Galilee. In coming south from Galilee travellers usually crossed over the Jordan and came down through Perea to avoid the hostility of the Samaritans towards people who passed through their land to go to Jerusalem. Jesus once met this bitterness on going to the feast of tabernacles (Luke 9:51-56).
