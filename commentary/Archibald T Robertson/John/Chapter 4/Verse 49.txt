 Sir  (Κυριε). See John 1:38.Come down  (καταβηθ). Second aorist active imperative, tense and tone of urgency. Ερε μψ χιλδ διε (πριν αποθανειν το παιδιον μου). Regular idiom with πριν in positive clause, second aorist active infinitive of αποθνησκω and accusative of general reference, "before dying as to my child." Bengel notes that he only thought Jesus had power before death as even Martha and Mary felt at first (John 11:21; John 11:32). But the father's heart goes out to Jesus.
