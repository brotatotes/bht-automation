 Thy son liveth  (ο υιος σου ζη). "Thy son is living," and will not now die, Jesus means. Words too good and gracious to be true. His son is healed without Jesus even going to Capernaum, "absent treatment" so to speak, but without the cure being absent.Believed the word  (επιστευσεν τω λογω). Instantaneous faith (aorist active indicative), trusted the word (dative case λογω).Went his way  (επορευετο). Inchoative imperfect middle, "started on his way," acted on his faith.
