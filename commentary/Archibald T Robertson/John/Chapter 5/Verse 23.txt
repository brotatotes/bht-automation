 That all may honour the Son  (ινα παντες τιμωσιν τον υιον). Purpose clause with ινα and present active subjunctive of τιμαω (may keep on honouring the Son).He that honoureth not the Son  (ο μη τιμων τον υιον). Articular present active participle of τιμαω with negative μη. Jesus claims here the same right to worship from men that the Father has. Dishonouring Jesus is dishonouring the Father who sent him (John 8:49; John 12:26; John 15:23; 1 John 2:23). See also Luke 10:16. There is small comfort here for those who praise Jesus as teacher and yet deny his claims to worship. The Gospel of John carries this high place for Christ throughout, but so do the other Gospels (even Q, the Logia of Jesus) and the rest of the New Testament.
