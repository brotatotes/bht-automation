 Hath eternal life  (εχε ζωην αιωνιον). Has now this spiritual life which is endless. See John 3:36. In verses John 5:24; John 5:25 Jesus speaks of spiritual life and spiritual death. In this passage (John 5:21-29) Jesus speaks now of physical life and death, now of spiritual, and one must notice carefully the quick transition. In Revelation 20:14 we have the phrase "the second death" with which language compare Revelation 20:4-6.But hath passed out of death into life  (αλλα μεταβεβηκεν εκ του θανατου εις την ζωην). Perfect active indicative of μεταβαινω, to pass from one place or state to another. Out of spiritual death into spiritual life and so no judgement (κρισις).
