 In himself  (εν εαυτω). The Living God possesses life wholly in himself and so he has bestowed this power of life to the Son as already stated in the Prologue of the Logos (John 1:3). For "gave" (εδωκεν, timeless aorist active indicative) see also John 3:35; John 17:2; John 17:24. The particles "as" (ωσπερ) and "so" (ουτως) mark here the fact, not the degree (Westcott).
