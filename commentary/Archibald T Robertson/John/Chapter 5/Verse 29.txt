 Unto the resurrection of life  (εις αναστασιν ζωης). Αναστασις is an old word (Aeschylus) from ανιστημ, to raise up, to arise. This combination occurs nowhere else in the N.T. nor does "the resurrection of judgement" (εις αναστασιν κρισεως), but in Luke 14:14 there is the similar phrase "in the resurrection of the just" (εν τη αναστασε των δικαιων). Only there note both articles. Here without the articles it can mean "to a resurrection of life" and "to a resurrection of judgement," though the result is practically the same. There are two resurrections as to result, one to life, one to judgement. See both in Daniel 12:2.
