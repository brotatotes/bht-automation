 Twelve baskets  (δωδεκα κοφινους). One for each of the apostles. What about the lad? Stout wicker baskets (coffins, Wycliff) in distinction from the soft and frail σφυριδες used at the feeding of the four thousand (Mark 8:8; Matthew 15:37). Here all the Gospels (Mark 6:43; Matthew 14:20; Luke 9:17; John 6:13) use κοφινο. The same distinction between κοφινο and σφυριδες is preserved in the allusion to the incidents by Jesus in Mark 8:19; Mark 8:20; Matthew 16:9; Matthew 16:10.Unto them that had eaten  (τοις βεβρωκοσιν). Articular perfect active participle (dative case) of βιβρωσκω, old verb to eat, only here in N.T., though often in LXX.
