 Saw the sign which he did  (ιδοντες α εποιησεν σημεια). "Signs" oldest MSS. have. This sign added to those already wrought (verse John 6:2). Cf. John 2:23; John 3:2.They said  (ελεγον). Inchoative imperfect, began to say.Of a truth  (αληθως). Common adverb (from αληθης) in John (John 7:40).The prophet that cometh  (ο προφητης ο ερχομενος). There was a popular expectation about the prophet of Deuteronomy 18:15 as being the Messiah (John 1:21; John 11:27). The phrase is peculiar to John, but the idea is in Acts (John 3:22; John 7:37). The people are on the tiptoe of expectation and believe that Jesus is the political Messiah of Pharisaic hope.
