 Be not afraid  (μη φοβεισθε). Prohibition with μη and present middle imperative of φοβεομα. So in Mark 6:50 (Matthew 14:27). John does not tell that the disciples thought Jesus was an apparition (Mark 6:49; Matthew 14:26), nor does he give the account of Peter walking on the water (Matthew 14:28-31).
