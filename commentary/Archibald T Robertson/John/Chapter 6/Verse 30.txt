 For a sign  (σημειον). Predicate accusative, as a sign, with τ (what). As if the sign of the day before was without value. Jesus had said that they did not understand his signs (verse John 6:26).That we may see, and believe thee  (ινα ιδωμεν κα πιστευσωμεν). Purpose clause with ινα and the second aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of οραω and the first aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of πιστευω, "that we may come to see and come to have faith in thee." It is hard to have patience with this superficial and almost sneering mob.What workest thou?  (Τ εργαζηι;). They not simply depreciate the miracle of the day before, but set up a standard for Jesus.
