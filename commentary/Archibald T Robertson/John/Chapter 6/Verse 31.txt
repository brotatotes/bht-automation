 Ate the manna  (το μαννα εφαγον). The rabbis quoted Psalms 72:16 to prove that the Messiah, when he comes, will outdo Moses with manna from heaven. Jesus was claiming to be the Messiah and able to give bread for eternal life (verse John 6:27). Lightfoot (Biblical Essays, p. 152) says: "The key to the understanding of the whole situation is an acquaintance with the national expectation of the greater Moses." They quote to Jesus Exodus 16:15 (of. Numbers 11:7; Numbers 21:5; Deuteronomy 8:3). Their plea is that Moses gave us bread "from heaven" (εκ του ουρανου). Can Jesus equal that deed of Moses?
