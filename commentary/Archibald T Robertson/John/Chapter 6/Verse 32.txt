 It was not Moses that gave you  (ου Μωυσης εδωκεν υμιν). "Not Moses gave you." Blunt and pointed denial (aorist active indicative of διδωμ) that Moses was the giver of the bread from heaven (the manna). Moses was not superior to Christ on this score.But my Father  (αλλ ο πατηρ μου). Not "our Father," but same claim as in John 5:17. Which caused so much anger in Jerusalem.Gives  (διδωσιν). Present active indicative, not aorist (εδωκεν). Continual process.The true bread out of heaven  (τον αρτον εκ του ουρανου τον αληθινον). "The bread out of heaven" as the manna and more "the genuine bread" of which that was merely a type. On αληθινος see John 1:9; John 4:23.
