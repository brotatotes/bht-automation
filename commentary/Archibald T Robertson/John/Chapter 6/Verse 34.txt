 Lord  (Κυριε). Used now instead of Rabbi (25) though how much the people meant by it is not clear.Evermore give us this bread  (παντοτε δος ημιν τον αρτον τουτον). Second aorist active imperative second singular like δος in Matthew 6:11 (urgent petition). What kind of bread do they mean? The Jewish commentaries and Philo speak of the manna as typifying heavenly bread for the soul. Paul in 1 Corinthians 10:3 seems to refer to the manna as "spiritual food." Like the woman at the well (John 4:15) they long "always" to have "this bread," a perpetual supply. It is probably to this crowd as the water in John 4:15 was to the woman.
