 That of all that which  (ινα παν ο). Literally, "That all which" (see verse John 6:37 for παν ο), but there is a sharp anacoluthon with παν left as nominativus pendens.I should lose nothing  (μη απολεσω εξ αυτου). Construed with ινα, "that I shall not lose anything of it." Απολεσω, from απολλυμ, can be either future active indicative or first aorist active subjunctive as is true also of αναστησω (from ανιστημ), "I shall raise up."At the last day  (τη εσχατη εμερα). Locative case without εν. Only in John, but four times here (John 6:39; John 6:40; John 6:44; John 6:54) "with the majesty of a solemn refrain." In John 7:37 it is the last day of the feast of tabernacles, but in John 11:24; John 12:48 of the day of judgment as here. Christ is the Agent of the general resurrection in John 5:28 as in 1 Corinthians 15:22 while here only the resurrection of the righteous is mentioned.
