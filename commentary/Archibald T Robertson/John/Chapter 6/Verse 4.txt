 The feast of the Jews  (η εορτη των Ιουδαιων). Here used of the passover (το πασχα) as in John 7:2 of the tabernacles. This is probably the third passover in Christ's ministry (John 2:13 and one unmentioned unless John 5:1 be it). In John 2:13, here, and John 11:55 (the last one) the adverb εγγυς (near) is used. John is fond of notes of time. Jesus failed to go to this passover because of the hostility in Jerusalem (John 7:1).
