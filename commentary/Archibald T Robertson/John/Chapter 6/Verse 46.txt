 This one has seen the Father  (ουτος εωρακεν τον πατερα). Perfect active indicative of οραω. With the eyes no one has seen God (John 1:18) save the Son who is "from God" in origin (John 1:1; John 1:14; John 7:29; John 16:27; John 17:8). The only way for others to see God is to see Christ (John 14:9).
