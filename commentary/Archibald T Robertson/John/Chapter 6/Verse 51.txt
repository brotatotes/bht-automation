 The living bread  (ο αρτος ο ζων). "The bread the living." Repetition of the claim in John 6:35; John 6:41; John 6:48, but with a slight change from ζωης to ζων (present active participle of ζαω). It is alive and can give life. See John 4:10 for living water. In Revelation 1:17 Jesus calls himself the Living One (ο ζων).For ever  (εις τον αιωνα). Eternally like αιωνιον with ζωην in John 6:47.I shall give  (εγω δωσω). Emphasis on εγω (I). Superior so to Moses.Is my flesh  (η σαρξ μου εστιν). See on John 1:14 for σαρξ the Incarnation. This new idea creates far more difficulty to the hearers who cannot grasp Christ's idea of self-sacrifice.For the life of the world  (υπερ της του κοσμου ζωης). Over, in behalf of, υπερ means, and in some connexions instead of as in John 11:50. See John 1:30 for the Baptist's picture of Christ as the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. See also John 3:17; John 4:42; 1 John 3:16; Matthew 20:28; Galatians 3:13; 2 Corinthians 5:14; Romans 5:8. Jesus has here presented to this Galilean multitude the central fact of his atoning death for the spiritual life of the world.
