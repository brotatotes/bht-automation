 In the synagogue  (εν συναγωγη). Definite like our in church, though article absent. Only use of the word in John except John 18:20. "Among the ruins at Tell Hum, the probable site of Capernaum, have been found among the remains of a synagogue a block of stone perhaps the lintel, carved with a pot of manna, and with a pattern of vine leaves and clusters of grapes" (Vincent).
