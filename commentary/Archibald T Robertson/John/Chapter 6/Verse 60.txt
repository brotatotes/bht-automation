 A hard saying  (σκληρος). "This saying is a hard one." Old adjective, rough, harsh, dried hard (from σκελλω, to dry), probably the last saying of Jesus that he was the bread of life come down from heaven and they were to eat him. It is to be hoped that none of the twelve joined the many disciples in this complaint.Hear it  (αυτου ακουειν). Or "hear him," hear with acceptation. For ακουω with the genitive see John 10:3; John 10:16; John 10:27.
