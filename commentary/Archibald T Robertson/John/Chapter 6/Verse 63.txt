 That quickeneth  (το ζωοποιουν). Articular present active participle of ζωοποιεω for which see John 5:21. For the contrast between πνευμα (spirit) and σαρξ (flesh) see already John 3:6.The words  (τα ρηματα). Those in this discourse (I have just spoken, λελαληκα), for they are the words of God (John 3:34; John 8:47; John 17:8). No wonder they "are spirit and are life" (πνευμα εστιν κα ζωη εστιν). The breath of God and the life of God is in these words of Jesus. Never man spoke like Jesus (John 7:46). There is life in his words today.
