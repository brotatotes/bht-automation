 Much murmuring  (γογγυσμος πολυς). This Ionic onomatopoetic word is from γογγυζω for which verb see John 6:41; John 6:61; John 7:32, for secret displeasure (Acts 6:1) or querulous discontent (Philippians 2:14).Among the multitudes  (εν τοις οχλοις). "The multitudes" literally, plural here only in John. These different groups were visitors from Galilee and elsewhere and were divided in their opinion of Jesus as the Galileans had already become (John 6:66).A good man  (αγαθος). Pure in motive. See Mark 10:17; Romans 5:7 (absolute sense of God). Superior to δικαιος. Jesus had champions in these scattered groups in the temple courts.Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray  (ου, αλλα πλανα τον οχλον). Sharp clash in the crowd. Present active indicative of πλαναω, to go astray (Matthew 18:12), like our "planets," to lead others astray (Matthew 24:4; Matthew 24:5; Matthew 24:11, etc.). In the end the rulers will call Jesus "that deceiver" (εκεινος ο πλανος, Matthew 27:63). The Jewish leaders have a following among the crowds as is seen (John 7:31).
