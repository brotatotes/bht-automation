 Howbeit  (μεντο). See John 4:27 for this compound particle (μεν, το), by way of exception, but yet.Spake  (ελαλε). Imperfect active of λαλεω, "was speaking," picturing the whispering or secret talk ( no man openly , ουδεις παρρησια). Best MSS. do not have εν here with παρρησια (locative or instrumental case of manner) as in John 7:26; John 10:24; John 11:54, but εν genuine in John 7:4; Colossians 2:15. This adverbial use of παρρησια is common enough (Mark 8:37).For fear of the Jews  (δια τον φοβον των Ιουδαιων). Objective genitive. The crowds really feared the Jewish leaders and evidently did not wish to involve Jesus or themselves. See the same phrase and attitude on the part of the disciples in John 19:38; John 20:19.
