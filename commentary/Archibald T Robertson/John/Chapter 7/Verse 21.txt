 One work  (εν εργον). Direct allusion to the healing of the impotent man when in Jerusalem before (John 5:1). He had wrought others before (John 2:23; John 4:45), but this one on the Sabbath caused the rulers to try to kill Jesus (John 5:18). Some wondered then, others had murder in their hearts. This crowd here is ignorant.
