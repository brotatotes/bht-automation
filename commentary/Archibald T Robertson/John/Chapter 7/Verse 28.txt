 And I am not come of myself  (κα απ' εμαυτου ουκ εληλυθα). Κα here="and yet." Jesus repeats the claim of verse John 7:17 and also in John 5:30; John 8:28; John 12:49; John 14:10.Whom ye know not  (ον υμεις ουκ οιδατε). Jesus passes by a controversy over the piece of popular theology to point out their ignorance of God the Father who sent him. He tersely agrees that they know something of him. Jesus says of these Jews that they know not God as in John 8:19; John 8:55.
