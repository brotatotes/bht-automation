 They sought therefore  (εζητουν ουν). Imperfect active of ζητεω, inchoative or conative, they began to seek. Either makes sense. The subject is naturally some of the Jerusalemites (Westcott) rather than some of the leaders (Bernard).To take him  (αυτον πιασα). First aorist active infinitive, Doric form from πιαζω, from the usual πιεζω, occasionally so in the papyri, but πιαζω always in N.T. except Luke 6:38.And  (κα). Here = "but."Laid his hand  (επεβαλεν την χειρα). Second aorist active indicative of επιβαλλω, to cast upon. Old and common idiom for arresting one to make him a prisoner (Matthew 26:50). See repetition in verse John 7:44.His hour  (η ωρα αυτου). In John 13:1 we read that "the hour" had come, but that was "not yet" (ουπω). "John is at pains to point out at every point that the persecution and death of Jesus followed a predestined course" (Bernard), as in John 2:4; John 7:6; John 7:8; John 8:10; John 10:39; John 13:1, etc.Was not yet come  (ουπω εληλυθε). Past perfect active of ερχομα, as John looks back on the story.
