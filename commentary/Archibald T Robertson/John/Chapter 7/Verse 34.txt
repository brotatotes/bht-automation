 And shall not find me  (κα ουχ ευρησετε με). Future active indicative of ευρισκω. Jesus had said: "Seek and ye shall find" (Matthew 7:7), but this will be too late. Now they were seeking (verse John 7:30) to kill Jesus, then they will seek deliverance, but too late.Where I am  (οπου ειμ εγω). No conflict with verse John 7:33, but the essential eternal spiritual home of Christ "in absolute, eternal being and fellowship with the Father" (Vincent).Ye cannot come  (υμεις ου δυνασθε ελθειν). This fellowship was beyond the comprehension of these hostile Jews. See the same idea in John 7:36 by the Jews; John 8:21 to the Jews and then to the disciples with the addition of "now" (αρτ, John 13:33, νυν in John 13:36).
