 Which  (ου). Genitive by attraction of the relative ο (accusative singular object of λαμβανειν) to the case of του πνευματος (the Spirit) the antecedent. But it is purely grammatical gender (neuter ο because of πνευμα) which we do not have in English. Even here one should say "whom," not which, of the Spirit of God.Were to receive  (εμελλον λαμβανειν). Imperfect active of μελλω with the present active infinitive λαμβανειν, to receive, one of the three constructions with μελλω (present, aorist, or future infinitive). Literally, "whom they were about to receive," a clear reference to the great pentecost.For the Spirit was not yet given  (ουπω γαρ ην πνευμα). No verb for "given" in the Greek. The reference is not to the existence of the Spirit, but to the dispensation of the Spirit. This same use of ειμ like παρειμ (to be present) appears in Acts 19:2 of the Spirit's activity. John, writing at the close of the century, inserts this comment and interpretation of the language of Jesus as an allusion to the coming of the Holy Spirit at pentecost (the Promise of the Father).Because Jesus was not yet glorified  (οτ Ιησους ουπω εδοξασθη). Reason for the previous statement, the pentecostal outpouring following the death of Jesus here called "glorified" (εδοξασθη, first aorist passive indicative of δοξαζω), used later of the death of Jesus (John 12:16), even by Jesus himself (John 12:23; John 13:31).
