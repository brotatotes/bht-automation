 In secret  (εν κρυπτω). See Matthew 6:4; Matthew 6:6 for this phrase.Openly  (εν παρρησια). "In public" (παν, ρησις, telling it all). See on Matthew 8:32. Common in John (John 7:13; John 7:26; John 10:24; John 16:25; John 16:29; John 18:20; here again contrasted with εν κρυπτω). It is wise advice in the abstract that a public teacher must allow inspection of his deeds, but the motive is evil. They might get Jesus into trouble. Ιφ θου δοεστ θεσε θινγς (ε ταυτα ποιεις). This condition of the first class assumes the reality of the deeds of Jesus, but the use of the condition at all throws doubt on it all as in Matthew 4:3; Matthew 4:6.Manifest thyself  (φανερωσον σεαυτον). First aorist active imperative of φανεροω.To the world  (τω κοσμω). Not just to "thy disciples," but to the public at large as at the feast of tabernacles. See John 8:26; John 14:22 for this use of κοσμος.
