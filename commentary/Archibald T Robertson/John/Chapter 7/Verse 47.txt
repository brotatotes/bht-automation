 Are ye also led astray?  (Μη κα υμεις πεπλανησθε;). The Pharisees took the lead in this scornful sneer at the officers. The use of μη formally expects a negative answer as in John 4:29, but the Pharisees really believed it. See also John 6:67. The verb form is perfect passive indicative of πλαναω, for which see verse John 7:12 with perhaps an allusion to that phase of opinion.
