 For even his brethren did not believe on him  (ουδε γαρ ο αδελφο αυτου επιστευον εις αυτον). Literally, "For not even were his brothers believing on him." Imperfect tense of πιστευω with sad picture of the persistent refusal of the brothers of Jesus to believe in his Messianic assumptions, after the two rejections in Capernaum (Luke 4:16-31; Mark 6:1-6; Matthew 13:54-58), and also after the blasphemous accusation of being in league with Beelzebub when the mother and brothers came to take Jesus home (Mark 3:31-35; Matthew 12:46-50; Luke 8:19-21). The brothers here are sarcastic.
