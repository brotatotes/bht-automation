 My time is not yet come  (ο καιρος ο εμος ουπω παρεστιν). Only use with verse John 7:8 of καιρος in this Gospel, elsewhere χρονος (John 5:6) or more often ωρα (John 2:4) "the predestined hour" (Bernard). Here καιρος is the fitting or proper occasion for Christ's manifesting himself publicly to the authorities as Messiah as in verse John 7:8. At the feast of tabernacles Jesus did make such public claims (John 7:29; John 7:33; John 8:12; John 8:28; John 8:38; John 8:42; John 8:58). Παρεστιν is present active indicative of παρειμ, old compound, to be by, to be present. The brothers of Jesus had the regular Jewish obligation to go up to the feast, but the precise day was a matter of indifference to them.
