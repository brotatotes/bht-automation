 After the flesh  (κατα την σαρκα). According to the standards of the flesh (2 Corinthians 5:16). The Baptist had said: "There stands one among you whom ye know not" (John 1:26). The Light of the World had come, but they loved darkness rather than light (John 3:19), because the god of this age had blinded their thoughts so that they could not see the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ who is the image of God (2 Corinthians 4:4).
