 Again  (παλιν). Probably παλιν (again) in verse John 8:12 refers to a day after the feast is over since the last day is mentioned in John 7:37. So then here again we probably move on to another day still beyond that in verse John 8:12.And ye shall seek me  (κα ζητησετε με). As in John 7:34, "the search of despair" (Bernard), seeking for the Messiah when it is too late, the tragedy of Judaism today (John 1:11).And ye shall die in your sin  (κα εν τη αμαρτια υμων αποθανεισθε). Future middle indicative of αποθνησκω which is the emphatic word here (cf. Ezekiel 3:18; Ezekiel 18:18; Proverbs 24:9). Note singular αμαρτια (sin) here, but plural αμαρτιαις (sins) when the phrase is repeated in verse John 8:24 (sin in its essence, sin in its acts).Ye cannot come  (υμεις ου δυνασθε ελθειν). Precise language of John 7:34 to the Jews and to the apostles in John 13:33.
