 Is with me  (μετ' εμου εστιν). The Incarnation brought separation from the Father in one sense, but in essence there is complete harmony and fellowship as he had already said (John 8:16) and will expand in John 17:21-26.He hath not left me alone  (ουκ αφηκεν με μονον). First aorist active indicative of αφιημ. "He did not leave me alone." However much the crowds and the disciples misunderstood or left Jesus, the Father always comforted and understood him (Mark 6:46; Matthew 14:23; John 6:15).That are pleasing to him  (τα αρεστα αυτω). This old verbal adjective, from αρεσκω, to please, in N.T. only here, Acts 6:2; Acts 12:3; 1 John 3:32. The joy of Jesus was in doing the will of the Father who sent him (John 4:34).
