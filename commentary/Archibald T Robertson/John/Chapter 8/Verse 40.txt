See this use of νυν δε after a condition of second class without αν in John 16:22; John 16:24.This did not Abraham  (τουτο Αβρααμ ουκ εποιησεν). Blunt and pointed of their unlikeness to Abraham.A man that hath told you the truth  (ανθρωπον ος τεν αληθειαν υμιν λελαληκα). Ανθρωπον (here=person, one) is accusative case in apposition withme  (με) just before.
