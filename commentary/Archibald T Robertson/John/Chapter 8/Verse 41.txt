 Ye do the works of your father  (υμεις ποιειτε τα εργα του πατρος υμων). Who is not Abraham and not God as Jesus plainly indicates.We were not born of fornication  (ημεις εκ πορνειας εγεννηθημεν). First aorist passive indicative of γενναω. This they said as a proud boast. Jesus had admitted that they were physical (Deuteronomy 23:2) descendants of Abraham (John 8:37), but now denies that they are spiritual children of Abraham (like Paul in Romans 9:7). Πορνεια is from πορνος (harlot) and that from περνημ, to sell, a woman who sells her body for sexual uses. It is vaguely possible that in this stern denial the Pharisees may have an indirect fling at Jesus as the bastard son of Mary (so Talmud).We have one Father, even God  (ενα πατερα εχομεν τον θεον). No "even" in the Greek, "One Father we have, God." This in direct reply to the implication of Jesus (verse John 8:38) that God was not their spiritual Father.
