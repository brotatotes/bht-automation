 My speech  (την λαλιαν την εμην) andmy word  (τον λογον τον εμον). Perhaps λαλια, old word from λαλος (talk), means here more manner of speech than just story (John 4:42), while λογος refers rather to the subject matter. They will not listen (ου δυνασθε ακουειν) to the substance of Christ's teaching and hence they are impatient with the way that he talks. How often that is true.
