 I have not a demon  (εγω δαιμονιον ουκ εχω). This Jesus says calmly, passing by the reference to the Samaritans as beneath notice.My Father  (τον πατερα μου). As in John 2:16. He is not mad in claiming to honour God (cf. John 7:18). They were insulting the Father in insulting him (cf. John 5:23). On ατιμαζω (α privative and τιμαω, to dishonour) see Luke 20:11.
