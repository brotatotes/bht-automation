 But I seek not mine own glory  (εγω δε ου ζητω την δοξαν μου). As they did not seek the glory of God (John 5:44; John 8:4).And judgeth  (κα κρινων). The Father judges between you and me, though the Son is the Judge of mankind (John 5:22). "It is only the δοξα (glory) that comes from God that is worth having" (Bernard).
