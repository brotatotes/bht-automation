 Tempting him  (πειραζοντες αυτον). Evil sense of this present active participle of πειραζω, as so often (Mark 8:11; Mark 10:2, etc.).That they might have whereof to accuse him  (ινα εχωσιν κατηγορειν αυτου). Purpose clause with ινα and present active subjunctive of εχω. This laying of traps for Jesus was a common practice of his enemies (Luke 11:16, etc.). Note present active infinitive of κατηγορεω (see Matthew 12:10 for the verb) to go on accusing (with genitive αυτου). It was now a habit with these rabbis.Stooped down  (κατω κυψας). First aorist active participle of κυπτω, old verb to bow the head, to bend forward, in N.T. only here and verse John 8:8; Mark 1:7. The use of κατω (down) gives a vivid touch to the picture.With his finger  (τω δακτυλω). Instrumental case of δακτυλος for which see Matthew 23:4.Wrote on the ground  (κατεγραφεν εις την γην). Imperfect active of καταγραφω, old compound, here only in N.T., to draw, to delineate, to write down, apparently inchoative, began to write on the sand as every one has done sometimes. The only mention of writing by Jesus and the use of καταγραφω leaves it uncertain whether he was writing words or drawing pictures or making signs. If we only knew what he wrote! Certainly Jesus knew how to write. And yet more books have been written about this one who wrote nothing that is preserved than any other person or subject in human history. There is a tradition that Jesus wrote down the names and sins of these accusers. That is not likely. They were written on their hearts. Jesus alone on this occasion showed embarrassment over this woman's sin.
