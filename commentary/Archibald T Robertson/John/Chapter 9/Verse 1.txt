 As he passed by  (παραγων). Present active participle of παραγω, old verb to go along, by, or past (Matthew 20:30). Only example in this Gospel, but in 1 John 2:8; 1 John 2:17. The day was after the stirring scenes in chapter 8, but not at the feast of dedication as Westcott argues. That comes three months later (John 10:22).From his birth  (εκ γενετης). Ablative case with εκ of old word from γενω, γινομα. Here alone in N.T., but the phrase τυφλος εκ γενετης is common in Greek writers. Probably a well-known character with his stand as a beggar (verse John 9:5).
