 The man that is called Jesus  (ο ανθρωπος ο λεγομενος Ιησους). He does not yet know Jesus as the Messiah the Son of God (John 9:36).I received sight  (ανεβλεψα). First aorist active indicative of αναβλεπω, old verb to see again, to recover sight, not strictly true of this man who had never seen. He got back sight that he had never had. Originally the verb means to look up (Matthew 14:19).
