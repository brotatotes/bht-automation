 I told you even now  (ειπον υμιν ηδη). In verses John 9:15; John 9:17; John 9:25.Would ye also become his disciples?  (Μη κα υμεις θελετε αυτου μαθητα γενεσθαι;). Negative answer formally expected, but the keenest irony in this gibe. Clearly the healed man knew from the use of "also" (κα) that Jesus had some "disciples" (μαθητα, predicate nominative with the infinitive γενεσθα) and that the Pharisees knew that fact. "Do ye also (like the Galilean mob) wish, etc." See John 7:45-52. It cut to the bone.
