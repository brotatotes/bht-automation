 They reviled him  (ελοιδορησαν αυτον). First aorist active indicative of λοιδορεω, old verb from λοιδορος (reviler, 1 Corinthians 5:11), in N.T. only here, Acts 23:4; 1 Corinthians 4:12; 1 Peter 2:23.Thou art his disciple  (συ μαθητης ε εκεινου). Probably a fling in εκεινου (of that fellow). He had called him a prophet (John 9:17) and became a joyful follower later (John 9:36-38).But we are disciples of Moses  (ημεις δε του Μωυσεως εσμεν μαθητα). This they said with proud scorn of the healed beggar. All orthodox rabbis so claimed.
