 If this man were not from God  (ε μη ην ουτος παρα θεου). Negative condition of second class with imperfect indicative. Assuming that Jesus is not "from God" (παρα θεου) as some argued in John 9:16, "he could do nothing" (ουκ ηδυνατο ποιειν ουδεν). Conclusion of the second-class condition with imperfect indicative (double augment in ηδυνατο) without αν as is usual in conditions of possibility, propriety, obligation (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 920,1014). The man has scored with terrific power in his use of Scripture and logic.
