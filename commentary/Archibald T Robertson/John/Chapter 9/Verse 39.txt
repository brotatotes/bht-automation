 For judgement  (εις κριμα). The Father had sent the Son for this purpose (John 3:17). This world (κοσμος) is not the home of Jesus. The κριμα (judgement), a word nowhere else in John, is the result of the κρισις (sifting) from κρινω, to separate. The Father has turned over this process of sifting (κρισις) to the Son (John 5:22). He is engaged in that very work by this miracle.They which see not  (ο μη βλεποντες). The spiritually blind as well as the physically blind (Luke 4:18; Isaiah 42:18). Purpose clause with ινα and present active subjunctive βλεπωσιν (may keep on seeing). This man now sees physically and spiritually.And that they which see may become blind  (κα ο βλεποντες τυφλο γενωντα). Another part of God's purpose, seen in Matthew 11:25; Luke 10:21, is the curse on those who blaspheme and reject the Son. Note ingressive aorist middle subjunctive of γινομα and predicate nominative. Hο βλεποντες are those who profess to see like these Pharisees, but are really blind. Blind guides they were (Matthew 23:16). Complacent satisfaction with their dim light.
