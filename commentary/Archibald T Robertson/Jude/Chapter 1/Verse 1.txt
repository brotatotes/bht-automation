 Servant  (δουλος). Precisely as James (James 1:1), only James added κυριου (Lord).Brother of James  (αδελφος Ιακωβου). Thus Jude identifies himself. But not the "Judas of James" (Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13).To them that are called  (τοισ--κλητοις). But this translation (treating κλητοις as a substantive like Romans 1:6; 1 Corinthians 1:24) is by no means certain as two participles come in between τοις and κλητοις. Κλητοις may be in the predicate position (being called), not attributive. But see 1 Peter 1:1.Beloved in God the Father  (εν θεω πατρ ηγαπημενοις). Perfect passive participle of αγαπαω, but no precise parallel to this use of εν with αγαπαω.Kept for Jesus Christ  (Ιησου Χριστω τετηρημενοις). Perfect passive participle again with dative, unless it is the instrumental, "kept by Jesus Christ," a quite possible interpretation.
