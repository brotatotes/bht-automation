 Michael the archangel  (ο Μιχαελ ο αρχαγγελος). Michael is mentioned also in Daniel 10:13; Daniel 10:21; Daniel 12:1; Revelation 12:7. Αρχαγγελος in N.T. occurs only here and 1 Thessalonians 4:16, but in Daniel 10:13; Daniel 10:20; Daniel 12:1.Contending with the devil  (τω διαβολω διακρινομενος). Present middle participle of διακρινω, to separate, to strive with as in Acts 11:2. Dative case διαβολω.When he disputed  (οτε διελεγετο). Imperfect middle of διαλεγομα as in Mark 9:34.Concerning the body of Moses  (περ του Μωυσεως σωματος). Some refer this to Zechariah 3:1, others to a rabbinical comment on Deuteronomy 34:6. There is a similar reference to traditions in Acts 7:22; Galatians 3:19; Hebrews 2:2; 2 Timothy 3:8. But this explanation hardly meets the facts.Durst not bring  (ουκ ετολμησεν επενεγκειν). "Did not dare (first aorist active indicative of τολμαω), to bring against him" (second aorist active infinitive of επιφερω).A railing accusation  (κρισιν βλασφημιας). "Charge of blasphemy" where 2 Peter 2:11 has "βλασφημον κρισιν." Peter also has παρα κυριω (with the Lord), not in Jude.The Lord rebuke thee  (επιτιμησα σο κυριος). First aorist active optative of επιτιμαω, a wish about the future. These words occur in Zechariah 3:1-10 where the angel of the Lord replies to the charges of Satan. Clement of Alex. (Adumb. in Ep. Judae) says that Jude quoted here the Assumption of Moses, one of the apocryphal books. Origen says the same thing. Mayor thinks that the author of the Assumption of Moses took these words from Zechariah and put them in the mouth of the Archangel Michael. There is a Latin version of the Assumption. Some date it as early as B.C. 2, others after A.D. 44.
