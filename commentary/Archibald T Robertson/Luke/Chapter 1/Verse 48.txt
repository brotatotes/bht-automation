 The low estate  (την ταπεινωσιν). The bride of a carpenter and yet to be the mother of the Messiah. Literal sense here as in Luke 1:52.Shall call me blessed  (μακαριουσιν με). So-called Attic future of an old verb, to felicitate. Elisabeth had already given her a beatitude (μακαρια, Luke 1:45). Another occurs in Luke 11:27. But this is a very different thing from the worship of Mary (Mariolatry) by Roman Catholics. See my The Mother of Jesus: Her Problems and Her Glory.
