 Delivered  (ρυσθεντας). First aorist passive participle of an old verb, ρυομα. The accusative case appears, where the dative could have been used to agree with ημιν, because of the infinitive λατρευειν (verse Luke 1:74)to serve  (from latros , for hire). But Plato uses the word of service for God so that the bad sense does not always exist.
