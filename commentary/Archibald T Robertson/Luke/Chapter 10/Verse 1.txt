 Appointed  (ανεδειξεν). First aorist active indicative of αναδεικνυμ, an old verb, not only common, but in LXX. In the N.T. only here and Acts 1:24. Cf. αναδειξις in Luke 1:80. To show forth, display, proclaim, appoint.Seventy others  (ετερους εβδομηκοντα κα). The "also" (κα) and the "others" point back to the mission of the Twelve in Galilee (Luke 9:1-6). Some critics think that Luke has confused this report of a mission in Judea with that in Galilee, but needlessly so. What earthly objection can there be to two similar missions? B D Syr. Cur. and Syr. Sin. have "seventy-two." The seventy elders were counted both ways and the Sanhedrin likewise and the nations of the earth. It is an evenly balanced point.Two and two  (ανα δυο). For companionship as with the Twelve though Mark 6:7 has it δυο (vernacular idiom). B K have here ανα δυο, a combination of the idiom in Mark 6:7 and that here.He himself was about to come  (ημελλεν αυτος ερχεσθα). Imperfect of μελλω with present infinitive and note αυτος. Jesus was to follow after and investigate the work done. This was only a temporary appointment and no names are given, but they could cover a deal of territory.
