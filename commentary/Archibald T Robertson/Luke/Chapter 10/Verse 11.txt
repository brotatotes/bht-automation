 Even the dust  (κα τον κονιορτον). Old word from κονις, dust, and ορνυμ, to stir up. We have seen it already in Matthew 10:14; Luke 9:5. Dust is a plague in the east. Shake off even that.Cleaveth  (κολληθεντα). First aorist passive participle of κολλαω, to cling as dust and mud do to shoes. Hence the orientals took off the sandals on entering a house.We wipe off  (απομασσομεθα). Middle voice of an old verb απομασσω, to rub off with the hands. Nowhere else in the N.T. But εκμασσω, occurs in Luke 7:38; Luke 7:44.Against you  (Hυμιν). Fine example of the dative of disadvantage (the case of personal interest, the dative).
