 In that same house  (εν αυτη τη οικια). Literally, in the house itself, not "in the same house" (εν τη αυτη οικια), a different construction.

"The things from them."For the labourer is worthy of his hire  (αξιος γαρ ο εργατης του μισθου αυτου). In Matthew 10:10 we have της τροφης αυτου (his food). 1 Timothy 5:18 has this saying quoted as scripture. That is not impossible if Luke wrote by A.D. 62.
