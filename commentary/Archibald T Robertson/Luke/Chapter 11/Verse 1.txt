 As he was praying in a certain place  (εν τω εινα αυτον εν τοπω τιν προσευχομενον). Characteristically Lukan idiom: εν with articular periphrastic infinitive (εινα προσευχομενον) with accusative of general reference (αυτον).That . Not in the Greek, asyndeton (κα εγενετο ειπεν).When he ceased  (ως επαυσατο). Supply προσευχομενος (praying), complementary or supplementary participle.Teach us  (διδαξον ημας). Jesus had taught them by precept (Matthew 6:7-15) and example (Luke 9:29). Somehow the example of Jesus on this occasion stirred them to fresh interest in the subject and to revival of interest in John's teachings (Luke 5:33). So Jesus gave them the substance of the Model Prayer in Matthew, but in shorter form. Some of the MSS. have one or all of the phrases in Matthew, but the oldest documents have it in the simplest form. See on Matthew 6:7-15 for discussion of these details (Father, hallowed, kingdom, daily bread, forgiveness, bringing us into temptation). In Matthew 6:11 "give" is δος (second aorist active imperative second singular, a single act) while here Luke 11:3 "give" is διδου (present active imperative, both from διδωμ) and means, "keep on giving." So in Luke 11:4 we have "For we ourselves also forgive" (κα γαρ αυτο αφιομεν), present active indicative of the late ω verb αφιω while Matthew 6:12 has "as we also forgave" (ως κα ημεις αφηκαμεν), first aorist (κ aorist) active of αφιημ. So also where Matthew 6:12 has "debts" (τα οφειληματα) Luke 11:4 has "sins" (τας αμαρτιας). But the spirit of each prayer is the same. There is no evidence that Jesus meant either form to be a ritual. In both Matthew 6:13; Luke 11:4 μη εισενεγκηις occurs (second aorist subjunctive with μη in prohibition, ingressive aorist). "Bring us not" is a better translation than "lead us not." There is no such thing as God enticing one to sin (James 1:13). Jesus urges us to pray not to be tempted as in Luke 22:40 in Gethsemane.
