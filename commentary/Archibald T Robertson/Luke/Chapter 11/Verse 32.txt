 At the preaching of Jonah  (εις το κηρυγμα Ιωνα). Note this use of εις as in Matthew 10:41; Matthew 12:41. Luke inserts the words about the Queen of the South (Luke 11:31) in between the discussion of Jonah (verses Luke 11:29; Luke 11:32). Both Σολομωνος (Luke 11:31) and Ιωνα (verse Luke 11:32) are in the ablative case after the comparative πλειον (more,something more ).
