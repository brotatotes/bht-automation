 Now as he spake  (εν δε τω λαλησα). Luke's common idiom, εν with the articular infinitive (aorist active infinitive) but it does not mean "after he had spoken" as Plummer argues, but simply "in the speaking," no time in the aorist infinitive. See Luke 3:21 for similar use of aorist infinitive with εν.Asketh  (ερωτα). Present active indicative, dramatic present. Request, not question.To dine  (οπως αριστηση). Note οπως rather than the common ινα. Aorist active subjunctive rather than present, for a single meal. The verb is from αριστον (breakfast). See distinction between αριστον and δειπνον (dinner or supper) in Luke 14:12. It is the morning meal (breakfast or lunch) after the return from morning prayers in the synagogue (Matthew 22:4), not the very early meal called ακρατισμα. The verb is, however, used for the early meal on the seashore in John 21:12; John 21:15.With him  (παρ' αυτω). By his side.Sat down to meat  (ανεπεσεν). Second aorist active indicative of αναπιπτω, old verb, to recline, to fall back on the sofa or lounge. No word here for "to meat."
