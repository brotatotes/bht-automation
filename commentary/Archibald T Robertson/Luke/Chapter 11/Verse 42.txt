 Tithe  (αποδεκατουτε). Late verb for the more common δεκατευω. So in Matthew 23:23. Take a tenth off (απο-). Rue (πηγανον). Botanical term in late writers from πηγνυμ, to make fast because of its thick leaves. Here Matthew 23:23 has "anise."Every herb  (παν λαχανον). General term as in Mark 4:32. Matthew has "cummin."Pass by  (παρερχεσθε). Present middle indicative of παρερχομα, common verb, to go by or beside. Matthew 23:23 has "ye have left undone" (αφηκατε). Luke here has "love" (αγαπην), not in Matthew.Ought  (εδε). As in Matthew. Imperfect of a present obligation, not lived up to just like our "ought" (οwεδ, not paid). Παρεινα, as in Matthew, the second aorist active infinitive of αφιημ. to leave off. Common verb. Luke does not have the remark about straining out the gnat and swallowing the camel (Matthew 23:34). It is plain that the terrible exposure of the scribes and Pharisees in Luke 11:23 in the temple was simply the culmination of previous conflicts such as this one.
