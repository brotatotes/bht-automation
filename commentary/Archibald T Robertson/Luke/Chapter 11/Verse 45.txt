 Thou reproachest us also  (κα ημας υβριζεις). Because the lawyers (scribes) were usually Pharisees. The verb υβριζω is an old one and common for outrageous treatment, a positive insult (so Luke 18:32; Matthew 22:6; Matthew 22:14; Matthew 22:5; 1 Thessalonians 2:2). So Jesus proceeds to give the lawyers three woes as he had done to the Pharisees.
