 Ye took away the key of knowledge  (ηρατε την κλειδα της γνωσεως). First aorist active indicative of αιρω, common verb. But this is a flat charge of obscurantism on the part of these scribes (lawyers), the teachers (rabbis) of the people. They themselves (αυτο) refused to go into the house of knowledge (beautiful figure) and learn. They then locked the door and hid the key to the house of knowledge and hindered (εκωλυσατε, effective aorist active) those who were trying to enter (τους εισερχομενους, present participle, conative action). It is the most pitiful picture imaginable of blind ecclesiastics trying to keep others as blind as they were, blind leaders of the blind, both falling into the pit.
