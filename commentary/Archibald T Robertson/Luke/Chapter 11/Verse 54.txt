 Laying wait for him  (ενεδρευοντες αυτον). An old verb from εν and εδρα, a seat, so to lie in ambush for one. Here only and Acts 23:21 in the N.T. Vivid picture of the anger of these rabbis who were treating Jesus as if he were a beast of prey.To catch something out of his mouth  (θηρευσα το εκ του στοματος αυτου). An old Greek verb, though here only in the N.T., from θηρα (cf. Romans 11:9), to ensnare, to catch in hunting, to hunt. These graphic words from the chase show the rage of the rabbis toward Jesus. Luke gives more details here than in Luke 20:45-47; Matthew 23:1-7, but there is no reason at all why Jesus should not have had this conflict at the Pharisee's breakfast before that in the temple in the great Tuesday debate.
