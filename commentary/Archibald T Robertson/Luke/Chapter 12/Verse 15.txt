 From all covetousness  (απο πασης πλεονεξιας). Ablative case. From every kind of greedy desire for more (πλεον, more, εξια, from εχω, to have) an old word which we have robbed of its sinful aspects and refined to mean business thrift.In the abundance of the things which he possesseth  (εν τω περισσευειν τιν εκ των υπαρχοντων αυτω). A rather awkward Lukan idiom: "In the abounding (articular infinitive) to one out of the things belonging (articular participle) to him."
