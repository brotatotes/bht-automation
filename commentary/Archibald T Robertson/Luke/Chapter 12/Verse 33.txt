 Sell that ye have  (Πωλησατε τα υπαρχοντα υμων). Not in Matthew. Did Jesus mean this literally and always? Luke has been charged with Ebionism, but Jesus does not condemn property as inherently sinful. "The attempt to keep the letter of the rule here given (Acts 2:44; Acts 2:45) had disastrous effects on the church of Jerusalem, which speedily became a church of paupers, constantly in need of alms (Romans 15:25; Romans 15:26; 1 Corinthians 16:3; 2 Corinthians 8:4; 2 Corinthians 9:1)" (Plummer).Purses which wax not old  (βαλλαντια μη παλαιουμενα). So already βαλλαντιον in Luke 10:4. Late verb παλαιοω from παλαιος, old, to make old, declare old as in Hebrews 8:13, is passive to become old as here and Hebrews 1:11.That faileth not  (ανεκλειπτον). Verbal from α privative and εκλειπω, to fail. Late word in Diodorus and Plutarch. Only here in the N.T. or LXX, but in papyri. "I prefer to believe that even Luke sees in the words not a mechanical rule, but a law for the spirit" (Bruce).Draweth near  (εγγιζε). Instead of Matthew 6:19 "dig through and steal."Destroyeth  (διαφθειρε). Instead of "doth consume" in Matthew 6:19.
