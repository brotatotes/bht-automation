 The thief  (ο κλεπτης). The change here almost makes a new parable to illustrate the other, the parable of the housebreaking (verses Luke 12:39; Luke 12:40) to illustrate the parable of the waiting servants (Luke 12:35-38). This same language appears in Matthew 24:43. "The Master returning from a wedding is replaced by a thief whose study it is to come to the house he means to plunder at an unexpected time" (Bruce). The parallel in Matthew 24:43-51 with Luke 12:39-46 does not have the interruption by Peter.He would have watched  (εγρηγορησεν αν). Apodosis of second-class condition, determined as unfulfilled, made plain by use of αν with aorist indicative which is not repeated with ουκ αφηκεν (first aorist active indicative of αφιημ, κ aorist), though it is sometimes repeated (Matthew 24:43).
