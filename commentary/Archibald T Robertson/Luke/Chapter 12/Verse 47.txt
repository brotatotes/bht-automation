 Which knew  (ο γνους). Articular participle (second aorist active, punctiliar and timeless). The one who knows. So as to μη ετοιμασας η ποιησας (does not make ready or do).Shall be beaten with many stripes  (δαρησετα πολλας). Second future passive of δερω, to skin, to beat, to flay (see on Matthew 21:35; Mark 12:3; Mark 12:5). The passive voice retains here the accusative πολλας (supply πληγας, present in Luke 10:30). The same explanation applies to ολιγας in verse Luke 12:48.
