 A grain of mustard seed  (κοκκω σιναπεως). Either the sinapis nigra or the salvadora persica, both of which have small seeds and grow to twelve feet at times. The Jews had a proverb: "Small as a mustard seed." Given by Mark 4:30-32; Matthew 13:31 in the first great group of parables, but just the sort to be repeated.Cast into his own garden  (εβαλεν εις κηπον εαυτου). Different from "earth" (Mark) or "field" (Matthew.)" Κηπος, old word for garden, only here in the N.T. and John 19:1; John 19:26; John 19:41.Became a tree  (εγενετο εις δενδρον). Common Hebraism, very frequent in LXX, only in Luke in the N.T., but does appear in Koine though rare in papyri; this use of εις after words like ginomai. It is a translation Hebraism in Luke.Lodged  (κατεσκηνωσεν). Mark and Matthew have κατασκηνοιν infinitive of the same verb, to make tent (or nest).
