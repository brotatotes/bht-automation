 Strive  (αγωνιζεσθε). Jesus makes short shrift of the question. He includes others (present middle plural of αγωνιζομα, common verb, our agonize). Originally it was to contend for a prize in the games. The kindred word αγωνια occurs of Christ's struggle in Gethsemane (Luke 22:44). The narrow gate appears also in Matthew 7:13, only there it is an outside gate (πυλης) while here it is the entrance to the house, "the narrow door" (θυρας).
