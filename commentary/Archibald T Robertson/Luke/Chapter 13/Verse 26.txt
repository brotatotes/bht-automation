 Shall ye begin  (αρξεσθε). Future middle, though Westcott and Hort put αρξησθε (aorist middle subjunctive of αρχομα) and in that case a continuation of the αφ' ου construction. It is a difficult passage and the copyists had trouble with it.In thy presence  (ενωπιον σου). As guests or hosts or neighbours some claim, or the master of the house. It is grotesque to claim credit because Christ taught in their streets, but they are hard run for excuses and claims.
