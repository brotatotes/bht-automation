 That fox  (τη αλωπεκ ταυτη). This epithet for the cunning and cowardice of Herod shows clearly that Jesus understood the real attitude and character of the man who had put John the Baptist to death and evidently wanted to get Jesus into his power in spite of his superstitious fears that he might be John the Baptist redivivus. The message of Jesus means that he is independent of the plots and schemes of both Herod and the Pharisees. The preacher is often put in a tight place by politicians who are quite willing to see him shorn of all real power.Cures  (ιασεις). Old word, but in the N.T. only here and Acts 4:22; Acts 4:30.I am perfected  (τελειουμα). Present passive indicative of τελειοω, old verb from τελειος, to bring to perfection, frequent in the N.T. Used in Hebrews 2:10 of the Father's purpose in the humanity of Christ. Perfect humanity is a process and Jesus was passing through that, without sin, but not without temptation and suffering. It is the prophetic present with the sense of the future.
