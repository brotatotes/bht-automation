 Sit down  (αναπεσε). Second aorist active imperative of αναπιπτω, to fall up or back, to lie back or down. Late Greek word for ανακλινω (cf. κατακλινω in verse Luke 14:8).He that hath bidden thee  (ο κεκληκως σε). Perfect active participle as in verse Luke 14:12 (τω κεκληκοτ) with which compare ο καλεσας in verse Luke 14:9 (first aorist active participle).He may say  (ερε). The future indicative with ινα does occur in the Koine (papyri) and so in the N.T. (Robertson, Grammar, p. 984).Go up higher  (προσαναβηθ). Second aorist active imperative second singular of προσαναβαινω, an old double compound verb, but here only in the N.T. Probably, "Come up higher," because the call comes from the host and because of προς.
