 Both ... and  (τε ... κα). United in the complaint.Murmured  (διεγογγυζον). Imperfect active of διαγογγυζω, late Greek compound in the LXX and Byzantine writers. In the N.T. only here and Luke 19:7. The force of δια here is probably between or among themselves. It spread (imperfect tense) whenever these two classes came in contact with Jesus. As the publicans and the sinners were drawing near to Jesus just in that proportion the Pharisees and the scribes increased their murmurings. The social breach is here an open yawning chasm.This man  (ουτος). A contemptuous sneer in the use of the pronoun. They spoke out openly and probably pointed at Jesus.Receiveth  (προσδεχετα). Present middle indicative of the common verb προσδεχομα. In Luke 12:36 we had it for expecting, here it is to give access to oneself, to welcome like υπεδεξατο of Martha's welcome to Jesus (Luke 10:38). The charge here is that this is the habit of Jesus. He shows no sense of social superiority to these outcasts (like the Hindu "untouchables" in India).And eateth with them  (κα συνεσθιε αυτοις). Associative instrumental case (αυτοις) after συν- in composition. This is an old charge (Luke 5:30) and a much more serious breach from the standpoint of the Pharisees. The implication is that Jesus prefers these outcasts to the respectable classes (the Pharisees and the scribes) because he is like them in character and tastes, even with the harlots. There was a sting in the charge that he was the "friend" (φιλος) of publicans and sinners (Luke 7:34).
