 The best robe  (στολην την πρωτην). Στολη is an old word for a fine stately garment that comes down to the feet (from στελλο, to prepare, equip), the kind worn by kings (Mark 16:5; Luke 22:46). Literally, "a robe the first." But not the first that you find, but the first in rank and value, the finest in the house. This in contrast with his shabby clothes.A ring  (δακτυλιον). Common in classical writers and the LXX, but here only in the N.T. From δακτυλος, finger. See χρυσοδακτυλιος in James 2:2.Shoes  (υποδηματα). Sandals, "bound under." Both sandals and ring are marks of the freeman as slaves were barefooted.
