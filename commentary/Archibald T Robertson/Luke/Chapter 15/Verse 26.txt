 Servants  (παιδων). Not δουλο (bondslaves) as in verse Luke 15:22. The Greeks often used παις for servant like the Latin puer. It could be either a hired servant (μισθιος, verse Luke 15:17) or slave (δουλος).He inquired  (επυνθανετο). Imperfect middle, inquired repeatedly and eagerly.What these things might be  (τ αν ειη ταυτα). Not "poor" Greek as Easton holds, but simply the form of the direct question retained in the indirect. See the direct form as the apodosis of a condition of the fourth class in Acts 17:18. In Acts 10:17 we have the construction with αν ειη of the direct retained in the indirect question. So also in Luke 1:62: See Robertson, Grammar, p. 1044.
