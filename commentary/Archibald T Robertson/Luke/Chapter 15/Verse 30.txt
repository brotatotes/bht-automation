 This thy son  (ο υιος σου ουτος). Contempt and sarcasm. He does not say: "This my brother."Came  (ηλθεν). He does not even say, came back or came home.Devoured  (καταφαγων). We say, "eaten up," but the Greek has, "eaten down" (perfective use of κατα-). Suggested by the feasting going on.With harlots  (μετα πορνων). This may be true (verse Luke 15:13), but the elder son did not know it to be true. He may reflect what he would have done in like case.
