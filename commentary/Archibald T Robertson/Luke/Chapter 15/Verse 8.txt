 Ten pieces of silver  (δραχμας δεκα). The only instance in the N.T. of this old word for a coin of 65.5 grains about the value of the common δηναριυς (about eighteen cents), a quarter of a Jewish shekel. The double drachma (διδραχμον) occurs in the N.T. only in Matthew 17:24. The root is from δρασσομα, to grasp with the hand (1 Corinthians 3:19), and so a handful of coin. Ten drachmas would be equal to nearly two dollars, but in purchasing power much more.Sweep  (σαρο). A late colloquial verb σαροω for the earlier σαιρω, to clear by sweeping. Three times in the N.T. (Luke 11:25; Luke 15:8; Matthew 12:44). The house was probably with out windows (only the door for light and hence the lamp lit) and probably also a dirt floor. Hence Bengel says: non sine pulvere. This parable is peculiar to Luke.
