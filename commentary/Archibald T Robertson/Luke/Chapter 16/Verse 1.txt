 Unto the disciples  (κα προς τους μαθητας). The three preceding parables in chapter 15 exposed the special faults of the Pharisees, "their hard exclusiveness, self-righteousness, and contempt for others" (Plummer). This parable is given by Luke alone. The κα (also) is not translated in the Revised Version. It seems to mean that at this same time, after speaking to the Pharisees (chapter 15), Jesus proceeds to speak a parable to the disciples (Luke 16:1-13), the parable of the Unjust Steward. It is a hard parable to explain, but Jesus opens the door by the key in verse Luke 16:9.Which had a steward  (ος ηιχεν οικονομον). Imperfect active, continued to have. Steward is house-manager or overseer of an estate as already seen in Luke 12:42.Was accused  (διεβληθη). First aorist indicative passive, of διαβαλλω, an old verb, but here only in the N.T. It means to throw across or back and forth, rocks or words and so to slander by gossip. The word implies malice even if the thing said is true. The word διαβολος (slanderer) is this same root and it is used even of women, she-devils (1 Timothy 3:11).That he was wasting  (ως διασκορπιζων). For the verb see on Luke 15:13. The use of ως with the participle is a fine Greek idiom for giving the alleged ground of a charge against one.His goods  (τα υπαρχοντα αυτου). "His belongings," a Lukan idiom.
