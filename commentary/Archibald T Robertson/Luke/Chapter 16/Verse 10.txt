 Faithful in a very little  (πιστος εν ελαχιστω). Elative superlative. One of the profoundest sayings of Christ. We see it in business life. The man who can be trusted in a very small thing will be promoted to large responsibilities. That is the way men climb to the top. Men who embezzle in large sums began with small sums. Verses Luke 16:10-13 here explain the point of the preceding parables.
