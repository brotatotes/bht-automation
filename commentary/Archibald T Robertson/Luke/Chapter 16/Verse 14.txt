 Who were lovers of money  (φιλαργυρο υπαρχοντες). Literally, being lovers of money. Φιλαργυρο is an old word, but in the N.T. only here and 2 Timothy 3:2. It is from φιλος and αργυρος.Heard  (ηκουον). Imperfect active, were listening (all the while Jesus was talking to the disciples (verses Luke 16:1-13).And they scoffed at him  (κα εξεμυκτηριζον). Imperfect active again of εκμυκτηριζω. LXX where late writers use simple verb. In the N.T. only here and Luke 23:35. It means to turn out or up the nose at one, to sneer, to scoff. The Romans had a phrase, naso adunco suspendere, to hang on the hooked nose (the subject of ridicule). These money-loving Pharisees were quick to see that the words of Jesus about the wise use of money applied to them. They had stood without comment the three parables aimed directly at them (the lost sheep, the lost coin, the lost son). But now they do not remain quiet while they hear the fourth parable spoken to the disciples. No words were apparently spoken, but their eyes, noses, faces were eloquent with a fine disdain.
