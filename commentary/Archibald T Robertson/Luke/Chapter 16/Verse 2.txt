 What is this that I hear?  (τ τουτο ακουω;). There are several ways of understanding this terse Greek idiom. The Revised Version (above) takes τ to be equal to τ εστιν τουτο ο ακουω; That is a possible use of the predicate τουτο. Another way is to take τ to be exclamatory, which is less likely. Still another view is that τ is " Why": "Why do I hear this about thee?" See Acts 14:15 where that is the idiom employed.Render  (αποδος). Second aorist active imperative of αποδιδωμ, Give back (and at once).The account  (τον λογον). The reckoning or report. Common use of λογος.Stewardship  (οικονομιας). Same root as οικονομος (steward). This demand does not necessarily mean dismissal if investigation proved him innocent of the charges. But the reason given implies that he is to be dismissed:Thou canst no longer  (ου γαρ δυνη).
