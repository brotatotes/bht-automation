 Through the midst of Samaria and Galilee  (δια μεσον Σαμαριας κα Γαλιλαιας). This is the only instance in the N.T. of δια with the accusative in the local sense of "through." Xenophon and Plato use δια μεσου (genitive). Jesus was going from Ephraim (John 11:54) north through the midst of Samaria and Galilee so as to cross over the Jordan near Bethshean and join the Galilean caravan down through Perea to Jerusalem. The Samaritans did not object to people going north away from Jerusalem, but did not like to see them going south towards the city (Luke 9:51-56).
