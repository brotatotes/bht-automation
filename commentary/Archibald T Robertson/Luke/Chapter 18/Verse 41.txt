 What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?  (Τ σο θελεις ποιησω;). Same idiom in Mark 10:51; Matthew 20:32 which see, the use of θελω without ινα with aorist subjunctive (or future indicative). See same references also for ινα αναβλεψω "that I may see again" without verb before ινα. Three uses of αναβλεπω here (verses Luke 18:41; Luke 18:42; Luke 18:43).
