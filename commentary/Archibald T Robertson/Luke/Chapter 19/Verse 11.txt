 He added and spake  (προσθεις ειπεν). Second aorist active participle of προστιθημ with ειπεν. It is a Hebrew idiom seen also in Luke 20:1 he added to send (προσεθετο πεμψα) and in Acts 12:3 "he added to seize" (προσεθετο συλλαβειν). This undoubted Hebraism occurs in the N.T. in Luke only, probably due to the influence of the LXX on Luke the Greek Christian.To appear  (αναφαινεσθα). Present passive infinitive of an old verb to be made manifest, to be shown up. In the N.T. only here and Acts 21:3.
