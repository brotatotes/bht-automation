 To take to himself a kingdom  (λαβειν εαυτω βασιλειαν). Second aorist active infinitive of λαμβανω with the dative reflexive εαυτω where the middle voice could have been used. Apparently this parable has the historical basis of Archelaus who actually went from Jerusalem to Rome on this very errand to get a kingdom in Palestine and to come back to it. This happened while Jesus was a boy in Nazareth and it was a matter of common knowledge.
