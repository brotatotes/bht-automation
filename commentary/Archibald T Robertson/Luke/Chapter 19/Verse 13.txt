 Trade ye herewith till I come  (πραγματευσασθε εν ω ερχομα). First aorist middle imperative of πραγματευομα, an old verb from πραγμα, business. Here only in the N.T. Westcott and Hort in their text read πραγματευσασθα, first aorist middle infinitive (-α and -ε were pronounced alike). The infinitive makes it indirect discourse, the imperative direct.While I am coming  is what εν ω ερχομα really means.
