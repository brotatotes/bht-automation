 At the descent  (προς τη καταβασε). Epexegetic of "drawing nigh." They were going by the southern slope of the Mount of Olives. As they turned down to the city, the grand view stirred the crowd to rapturous enthusiasm. This was the first sight of the city on this route which is soon obscured in the descent. The second view bursts out again (verse Luke 19:41). It was a shout of triumph from the multitude with their long pent-up enthusiasm (verse Luke 19:11), restrained no longer by the parable of the pounds.For all the mighty works which they had seen  (περ πασων ειδον δυναμεων). Neat Greek idiom, incorporation of the antecedent (δυναμεων) into the relative clause and attraction of the case of the relative from the accusative ας to the genitive ων. And note "all." The climax had come, Lazarus, Bartimaeus, and the rest.
