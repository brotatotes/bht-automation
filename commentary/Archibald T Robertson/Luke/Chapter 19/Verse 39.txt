 Some of the Pharisees  (τινες των Φαρισαιων). Luke seems to imply by "from the multitude" (απο του οχλου) that these Pharisees were in the procession, perhaps half-hearted followers of the mob. But John 12:19 speaks of Pharisees who stood off from the procession and blamed each other for their failure and the triumph of Jesus. These may represent the bolder spirits of their same group who dared to demand of Jesus that he rebuke his disciples.
