 Shall dash to the ground  (εδαφιουσιν). Attic future of εδαφιζω, to beat level, to raze to the ground, a rare verb from εδαφος, bottom, base, ground (Acts 22:7), here alone in the N.T.Because  (ανθ' ων). "In return for which things."Thou knewest not  (ουκ εγνως). Applying the very words of the lament in the condition in verse Luke 19:42. This vivid prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem is used by those who deny predictive prophecy even for Jesus as proof that Luke wrote the Gospel after the destruction of Jerusalem. But it is no proof at all to those who concede to Jesus adequate knowledge of his mission and claims.
