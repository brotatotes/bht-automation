 Murmured  (διεγογγυζοντο). Imperfect middle of this compound onomatopoetic word δια-γογγυζω. In Luke 5:30 we have the simple γογγυζω, a late word like the cooing doves or the hum of bees. This compound with δια- is still rarer, but more expressive.To lodge  (καταλυσα). Jesus was the hero of this crowd from Galilee on their way to the passover. But here he had shocked their sensibilities and those of the people of Jericho by inviting himself to be the guest of this chief publican and notorious sinner who had robbed nearly everybody in the city by exorbitant taxes.
