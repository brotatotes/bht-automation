 I bring you good tidings of great joy  (ευαγγελιζομα υμιν χαραν μεγαλην). Wycliff, "I evangelize to you a great joy." The active verb ευαγγελιζω occurs only in late Greek writers, LXX, a few papyri examples, and the N.T. The middle (deponent) appears from Aristophanes on. Luke and Paul employ both substantive ευαγγελιον and verb ευαγγελιζω very frequently. It is to Paul's influence that we owe their frequency and popularity in the language of Christendom (George Milligan, The Epistles to the Thessalonians, p. 143). The other Gospels do not have the verb save Matthew 11:5 and that in a quotation (Isaiah 61:1).
