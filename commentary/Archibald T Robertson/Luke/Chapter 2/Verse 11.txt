Ις βορν (ετεχθη). First aorist passive indicative from τικτω. Was born.Saviour  (σωτηρ). This great word is common in Luke and Paul and seldom elsewhere in the N.T. (Bruce). The people under Rome's rule came to call the emperor "Saviour" and Christians took the word and used it of Christ. See inscriptions (Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East, p. 344).Christ the Lord  (Χριστος Κυριος). This combination occurs nowhere else in the N.T. and it is not clear what it really means. Luke is very fond of Κυριος (Lord ) where the other Gospels have Jesus. It may mean "Christ the Lord," "Anointed Lord," "Messiah, Lord," "The Messiah, the Lord," "An Anointed One, a Lord," or "Lord Messiah." It occurs once in the LXX (Lamentations 4:20) and is in Ps. of Sol. 17:36. Ragg suggests that our phrase "the Lord Jesus Christ" is really involved in "A Saviour (Jesus) which is Christ the Lord." See on Matthew 1:1 for Christ and Matthew 21:3 for Lord.
