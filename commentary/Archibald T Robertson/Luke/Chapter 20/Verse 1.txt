 On one of the days  (εν μια των ημερων). Luke's favourite way of indicating time. It was the last day of the temple teaching (Tuesday). Luke 20:1-19 is to be compared with Mark 11:27-12; Matthew 21:23-46.There came upon him  (επεστησαν). Second aorist active indicative, ingressive aorist of εφιστημ, old and common verb, stood up against him, with the notion of sudden appearance. These leaders (cf. Luke 19:47) had determined to attack Jesus on this morning, both Sadducees (chief priests) and Pharisees (scribes), a formal delegation from the Sanhedrin.
