 To lay hands on him  (επιβαλειν επ' αυτον τας χειρας). Second aorist active infinitive of επιβαλλω, an old verb and either transitively as here or intransitively as in Mark 4:37. Vivid picture here where Mark 12:12; Matthew 21:46 has "to seize" (κρατησα).In that very hour  (εν αυτη τη ωρα). Luke's favourite idiom, in the hour itself. Not in Mark or Matthew and shows that the Sanhedrin were angry enough to force the climax then.And they feared  (κα εφοβηθησαν). Adversative use of κα = but they feared. Hence they refrained.For they perceived  (εγνωσαν γαρ). The reason for their rage. Second aorist active indicative of γινωσκω.Against them  (προς αυτους). As in Mark 12:12. The cap fitted them and they saw it.
