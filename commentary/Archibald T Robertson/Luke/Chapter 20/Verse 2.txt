 Tell us  (ειπον ημιν). Luke adds these words to what Mark and Matthew have. Second aorist active imperative for the old form ειπε and with ending -ον of the first aorist active. Westcott and Hort punctuate the rest of the sentence as an indirect question after ειπον, but the Revised Version puts a semicolon after "us" and retains the direct question. The Greek manuscripts have no punctuation.
