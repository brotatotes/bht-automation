 Equal unto the angels  (ισαγγελο). A rare and late word from ισος, equal, and αγγελος. Only here in the N.T. Mark and Matthew have "as angels" (ως αγγελο). Angels do not marry, there is no marriage in heaven.Sons of God, being sons of the resurrection  (υιο θεου της αναστασεως υιο οντες). This Hebraistic phrase, "sons of the resurrection" defines "sons of God" and is a direct answer to the Sadducees.
