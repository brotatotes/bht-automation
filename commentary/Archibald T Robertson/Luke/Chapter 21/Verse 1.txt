 And he looked up  (Αναβλεψας δε). He had taken his seat, after the debate was over and the Sanhedrin had slunk away in sheer defeat, "over against the treasury" (Mark 12:41). The word for "treasury" (γαζοφυλακιον) is a compound of γαζα (Persian word for royal treasury) and φυλακη guard or protection. It is common in the LXX, but in the N.T. only here and Mark 12:41; Mark 12:43; John 8:20. Jesus was watching (Mark 12:41) the rich put in their gifts as a slight diversion from the intense strain of the hours before.
