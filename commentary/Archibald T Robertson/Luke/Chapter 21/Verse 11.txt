 Famines and pestilences  (λοιμο κα λιμο). Play on the two words pronounced just alike in the Koine (itacism).And terrors  (φοβηθρα τε). The use of τε ... τε in this verse groups the two kinds of woes. This rare word φοβηθρα is only here in the N.T. It is from φοβεω, to frighten, and occurs only in the plural as here.
