 But before all these things  (προ δε τουτων παντων). In Mark 13:8; Matthew 24:8 these things are termed "the beginning of travail." That may be the idea here. Plummer insists that priority of time is the point, not magnitude.Bringing you  (απαγομενους). Present passive participle from απαγω, an old verb to lead off or away. But here the participle is in the accusative plural, not the nominative like παραδιδοντες (present active participle, delivering you up), agreeing with υμας not expressed the object of παραδιδοντες, "you being brought before or led off." "A technical term in Athenian legal language" (Bruce).
