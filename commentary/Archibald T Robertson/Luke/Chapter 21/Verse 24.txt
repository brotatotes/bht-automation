 Edge of the sword  (στοματ μαχαιρης). Instrumental case of στοματ which means "mouth" literally (Genesis 34:26). This verse like the close of verse Luke 21:22 is only in Luke. Josephus (War, VI. 9.3) states that 1,100,000 Jews perished in the destruction of Jerusalem and 97,000 were taken captive. Surely this is an exaggeration and yet the number must have been large.Shall be led captive  (αιχμαλωτισθησοντα). Future passive of αιχμαλωτιζω from αιχμη, spear and αλωτος (αλισκομα). Here alone in the literal sense in the N.T.Shall be trodden under foot  (εστα πατουμενη). Future passive periphrastic of πατεω, to tread, old verb.Until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled  (αχρ ου πληρωθωσιν καιρο εθνων). First aorist passive subjunctive with αχρ ου like εως ου. What this means is not clear except that Paul in Romans 11:25 shows that the punishment of the Jews has a limit. The same idiom appears there also with αχρ ου and the aorist subjunctive.
