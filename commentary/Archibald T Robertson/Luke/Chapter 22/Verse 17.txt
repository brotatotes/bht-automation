 He received a cup  (δεξαμενος ποτηριον). This cup is a diminutive of ποτηρ. It seems that this is still one of the four cups passed during the passover meal, though which one is uncertain. It is apparently just before the formal introduction of the Lord's Supper, though he gave thanks here also (ευχαριστησας). It is from this verb ευχαριστεω (see also verse Luke 22:19) that our word Eucharist comes. It is a common verb for giving thanks and was used also for "saying grace" as we call it.
