 Which is given for you  (το υπερ υμων διδομενον). Some MSS. omit these verses though probably genuine. The correct text in 1 Corinthians 11:24 has "which is for you," not "which is broken for you." It is curious to find the word "broken" here preserved and justified so often, even by Easton in his commentary on Luke, p. 320.In remembrance of me  (εις την εμην αναμνησιν). Objective use of the possessive pronoun εμην, not the subjective.This do  (τουτο ποιειτε). Present active indicative, repetition, keep on doing this.
