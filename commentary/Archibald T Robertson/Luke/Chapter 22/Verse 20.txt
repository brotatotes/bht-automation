 After the supper  (μετα το δειπνησα). Preposition μετα and the accusative articular infinitive. The textual situation here is confusing, chiefly because of the two cups (verses Luke 22:17; Luke 22:20). Some of the documents omit the latter part of verse Luke 22:19 and all of verse Luke 22:20. It is possible, of course, that this part crept into the text of Luke from 1 Corinthians 11:24. But, if this part is omitted, Luke would then have the order reversed, the cup before the bread. So there are difficulties whichever turn one takes here with Luke's text whether one cup or two cups.The New Covenant  (ε καινη διαθηκη). See on Matthew 26:28; Mark 14:24 for "covenant." Westcott and Hort reject "new" there, but accept it here and in 1 Corinthians 11:25. See on Luke 5:38 for difference between καινη and νεα. "The ratification of a covenant was commonly associated with the shedding of blood; and what was written in blood was believed to be indelible" (Plummer).Poured out  (εκχυννομενον). Same word in Mark 14:24; Matthew 26:28 translated "shed." Late form present passive participle of εκχυννω of εκχεω, to pour out.
