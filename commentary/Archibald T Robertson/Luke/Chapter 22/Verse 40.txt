 At the place  (επ του τοπου). The place of secret prayer which was dear to Jesus.Pray that ye enter not into temptation  (προσευχεσθε μη εισελθειν εις πειρασμον). "Keep on praying not to enter (ingressive aorist infinitive, not even once) into temptation." It is real "temptation" here, not just "trial." Jesus knew the power of temptation and the need of prayer. These words throw a light on the meaning of his language in Matthew 6:13. Jesus repeats this warning in verse Luke 22:46.
