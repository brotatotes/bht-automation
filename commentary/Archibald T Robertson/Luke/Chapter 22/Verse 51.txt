 Suffer us thus far  (εατε εως τουτου). Present active imperative of εαω, to allow. But the meaning is not clear. If addressed to Peter and the other disciples it means that they are to suffer this much of violence against Jesus. This is probably the idea. If it is addressed to the crowd, it means that they are to excuse Peter for his rash act.He touched his ear and healed him  (αψαμενος του οτιου ιασατο αυτον). Whether Jesus picked up the piece of the ear and put it back is not said. He could have healed the wound without that. This miracle of surgery is given alone by Luke.
