 In the light  (προς το φως). Facing (προς) the light, for the fire gave light as well as heat. Mark 14:65 has "warming himself in the light," John (John 18:18; John 18:25) "warming himself."Looking steadfastly  (ατενισασα). Favourite word in Luke (Luke 4:20, etc.) for gazing steadily at one.This man also  (κα ουτος). As if pointing to Peter and talking about him. The other Gospels (Mark 14:67; Matthew 26:69; John 18:25) make a direct address to Peter. Both could be true, as she turned to Peter.
