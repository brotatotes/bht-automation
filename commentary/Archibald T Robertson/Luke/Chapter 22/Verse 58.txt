 After a little while another  (μετα βραχυ ετερος). Matthew 26:71 makes it after Peter had gone out into the porch and mentions a maid as speaking as does Mark 14:69, while here the "other" (ετερος) is a man (masculine gender). It is almost impossible to co-ordinate the three denials in the four accounts unless we conceive of several joining in when one led off. This time Peter's denial is very blunt, "I am not."
