 The day of unleavened bread came  (ηλθεν η ημερα των αζυμων). The day itself came, not simply was drawing nigh (verse Luke 22:1).Must be sacrificed  (εδε θυεσθα). This was Nisan 14 which began at sunset. Luke is a Gentile and this fact must be borne in mind. The lamb must be slain by the head of the family (Exodus 12:6). The controversy about the day when Christ ate the last passover meal has already been discussed (Matthew 26:17; Mark 14:12). The Synoptics clearly present this as a fact. Jesus was then crucified on Friday at the passover or Thursday (our time) at the regular hour 6 P.M. (beginning of Friday). The five passages in John (Luke 13:1; Luke 13:27; Luke 18:28; Luke 19:14; Luke 19:31) rightly interpreted teach the same thing as shown in my Harmony of the Gospels for Students of the Life of Christ (pp.279-284).
