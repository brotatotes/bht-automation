 Art thou the Son of God?  (Συ ουν ε ο υιος του θεου;). Note how these three epithets are used as practical equivalents. They ask about "the Messiah." Jesus affirms that he is the Son of Man and will sit at the right hand of the power of God. They take this to be a claim to be the Son of God (both humanity and deity). Jesus accepts the challenge and admits that he claims to be all three (Messiah, the Son of man, the Son of God).Ye say  (Hυμεις λεγετε). Just a Greek idiom for "Yes" (compare "I am" in Mark 14:62 with "Thou has said" in Matthew 26:64).
