 Peter and John  (Πετρον κα Ιωανην). Mark 14:13 has only "two" while Matthew 26:17 makes the disciples take the initiative. The word passover in this context is used either of the meal, the feast day, the whole period (including the unleavened bread). "Eat the passover" can refer to the meal as here or to the whole period of celebration (John 18:28).
