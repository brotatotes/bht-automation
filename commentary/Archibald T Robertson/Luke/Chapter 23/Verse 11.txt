First aorist active participle from εξουθενεω, to count as nothing, to treat with utter contempt, as zero.Arraying him in gorgeous apparel  (περιβαλων εσθητα λαμπραν). Second aorist active participle of περιβαλλω, to fling around one. Λαμπραν is brilliant, shining as in James 2:2, so different from the modest dress of the Master. This was part of the shame.
