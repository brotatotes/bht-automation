 Chastise  (παιδευσας). First aorist active participle of παιδευω, to train a child (παις), and then, as a part of the training, punishment. Our English word chasten is from the Latin castus, pure, chaste, and means to purify (cf. Hebrews 12:6). Perhaps Pilate may have split a hair over the word as Wycliff puts it: "I shall deliver him amended." But, if Jesus was innocent, Pilate had no doubt to "chastise" him to satisfy a mob. Verse Luke 23:17 is omitted by Westcott and Hort as from Mark 15:6; Matthew 27:15.
