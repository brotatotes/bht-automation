 The sun's light failing  (του ηλιου εκλειποντος). Genitive absolute of the present active participle of εκλειπω, an old verb, to leave out, omit, pass by, to fail, to die. The word was used also of the eclipse of the sun or moon. But this was impossible at this time because the moon was full at the passover. Hence many documents change this correct text to "the sun was darkened" (εσκοτισθη ο ηλιος) to obviate the difficulty about the technical eclipse. But the sun can be darkened in other ways. In a London fog at noon the street lights are often turned on. The Revised Version translates it correctly, "the sun's light failing." Leave the darkness unexplained.In the midst  (μεσον). In the middle. Mark 15:38; Matthew 27:51 have "in two" (εις δυο).
