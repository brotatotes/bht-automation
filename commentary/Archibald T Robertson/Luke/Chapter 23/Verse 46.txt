 Father  (Πατερ). Jesus dies with the words of Psalms 31:5 on his lips.Gave up the ghost  (εξεπνευσεν). First aorist active indicative of εκπνεω, to breathe out, to expire, old word, but in the N.T. only here and Mark 15:37; Mark 15:39. There is no special reason for retaining "ghost" in the English as both Matthew 27:50 (yielded up his spirit, αφηκεν το πνευμα) and John 19:30 (gave up his spirit, παρεδωκεν το πνευμα) use πνευμα which is the root of εκπνεω, the verb in Mark and Luke.
