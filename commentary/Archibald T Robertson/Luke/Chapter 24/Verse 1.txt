 At early dawn  (ορθρου βαθεος). Genitive of time. Literally, at deep dawn. The adjective βαθυς (deep) was often used of time. This very idiom occurs in Aristophanes, Plato, et cetera. John 20:1 adds "while it was yet dark." That is, when they started, for the sun was risen when they arrived (Mark 16:2).Which they had prepared  (α ητοιμασαν). Mark 16:1 notes that they bought other spices after the sabbath was over besides those which they already had (Luke 23:56).
