 They communed  (ωμιλουν). Imperfect active of ομιλεω, old and common verb (from ομιλος, in company with). In the N.T. only here (and verse Luke 24:15) and Acts 20:11; Acts 24:26. Our word homiletics is derived from this word for preaching was at first largely conversational in style and not declamatory.
