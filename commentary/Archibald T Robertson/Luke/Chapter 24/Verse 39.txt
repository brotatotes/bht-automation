 Myself  (αυτος). Jesus is patient with his proof. They were convinced before he came into the room, but that psychological shock had unnerved them all.Handle  (ψηλαφησατε). This very word is used in 1 John 1:1 as proof of the actual human body of Jesus. It is an old verb for touching with the hand.Flesh and bones  (σαρκα κα οστεα). At least this proves that he is not just a ghost and that Jesus had a real human body against the Docetic Gnostics who denied it. But clearly we are not to understand that our resurrection bodies will have "flesh and bones." Jesus was in a transition state and had not yet been glorified. The mystery remains unsolved, but it was proof to the disciples of the identity of the Risen Christ with Jesus of Nazareth.
