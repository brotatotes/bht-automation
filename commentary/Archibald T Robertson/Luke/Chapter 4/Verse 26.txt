 Unto Zarephath  (εις Σαρεπτα). The modern village Surafend on the coast road between Tyre and Sidon.Unto a woman that was a widow  (προς γυναικα χηραν). Literally, unto a woman a widow (like our vernacular widow woman). This is an illustration of the proverb from the life of Elijah (1 Kings 17:8; 1 Kings 17:9). This woman was in the land of Sidon or Phoenicia, a heathen, where Jesus himself will go later.
