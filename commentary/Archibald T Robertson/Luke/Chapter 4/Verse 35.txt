 Had thrown him down in the midst  (ριψαν αυτον εις το μεσον). First aorist (effective) participle of ριπτω, an old verb with violent meaning, to fling, throw, hurl off or down.Having done him no hurt  (μηδεν βλαψαν αυτον). Luke as a physician carefully notes this important detail not in Mark. Βλαπτω, to injure, or hurt, occurs in the N.T. only here and in Mark 16:18, though a very common verb in the old Greek.
