 When the sun was setting  (δυνοντος του ηλιου). Genitive absolute and present participle (δυνω, late form of δυω) picturing the sunset scene. Even Mark 1:32 has here the aorist indicative εδυσεν (punctiliar active). It was not only cooler, but it was the end of the sabbath when it was not regarded as work (Vincent) to carry a sick person (John 5:10). And also by now the news of the cure of the demoniac of Peter's mother-in-law had spread all over the town.Had  (ειχον). Imperfect tense including all the chronic cases.With divers diseases  (νοσοις ποικιλαις). Instrumental case. For "divers" say "many coloured" or "variegated." See on Matthew 4:24; Mark 1:34.Brought  (ηγαγον). Constative summary second aorist active indicative like Matthew 8:16, προσενεγκαν, where Mark 1:32 has the imperfect εφερον, brought one after another.He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them  (ο δε εν εκαστω αυτων τας χειρας επιτιθεις εθεραπευεν αυτους). Note the present active participle επιτιθεις and the imperfect active εθεραπευεν, picturing the healing one by one with the tender touch upon each one. Luke alone gives this graphic detail which was more than a mere ceremonial laying on of hands. Clearly the cures of Jesus reached the physical, mental, and spiritual planes of human nature. He is Lord of life and acted here as Master of each case as it came.
