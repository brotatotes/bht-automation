 Led him  (ηγαγεν). Aorist active indicative of αγω. Matthew 4:5 has παραλαμβανε (dramatic present).The wing of the temple  (το πτερυγιον του ιερου). See on Matthew 4:5. It is not easy to determine precisely what it was.From hence  (εντευθεν). This Luke adds to the words in Matthew, which see.To guard thee  (του διαφυλαξα σε). Not in Matthew 4:6 quoted by Satan from Psalms 91:11; Psalms 91:12. Satan does not misquote this Psalm, but he misapplies it and makes it mean presumptuous reliance on God. This compound verb is very old, but occurs here alone in the N.T. and that from the LXX. Luke repeats οτ (recitative οτ after γεγραπτα, is written) after this part of the quotation.
