 Two boats  (πλοια δυο). Some MSS. have πλοιαρια, little boats, but πλοια was used of boats of various sizes, even of ships like νηες.The fishermen  (ο αλεεις). It is an old Homeric word that has come back to common use in the Koine. It means "sea-folk" from αλς, sea.Were washing  (επλυνον). Imperfect active, though some MSS. have aorist επλυναν. Vincent comments on Luke's use of five verbs for washing: this one for cleaning, απομασσω for wiping the dust from one's feet (Luke 10:11), εκμασσω of the sinful woman wiping Christ's feet with her hair (Luke 7:38; Luke 7:44), απολουω of washing away sins (symbolically, of course) as in Acts 22:16, and λουω of washing the body of Dorcas (Acts 9:37) and the stripes of the prisoners (Acts 16:33). On "nets" see on Matthew 4:20; Mark 1:18.
