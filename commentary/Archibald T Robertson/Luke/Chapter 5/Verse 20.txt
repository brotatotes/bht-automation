 Their faith  (την πιστιν αυτων). In all three Gospels.Man  (ανθρωπε). Mark and Matthew have "child" or "Son" (τεκνον). Are forgiven (αφεωντα). This Doric form of the perfect passive indicative is for the Attic αφειντα. It appears also in Luke 5:23; Luke 7:47; Luke 7:48; John 20:23; 1 John 2:12. Mark 2:6; Matthew 9:2 have the present passive αφιεντα. Possibly this man's malady was due to his sin as is sometimes true (John 5:14). The man had faith along with that of the four, but he was still a paralytic when Jesus forgave his sins.
