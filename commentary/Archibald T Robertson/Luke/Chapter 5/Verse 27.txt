 A publican named Levi  (τελωνεν ονοματ Λευειν). Mark 2:13 has also "The son of Alphaeus" while Matthew 9:9 calls him "Matthew." He had, of course, both names. All three use the same words (επ το τελωνιον) for the place of toll. See discussion of publican  (τελωνης) on Matthew 9:9. All three Gospels give the command of Jesus, Follow me  (ακολουθε).
