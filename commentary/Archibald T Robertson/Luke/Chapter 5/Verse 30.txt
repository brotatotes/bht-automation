 The Pharisees and their scribes  (ο Φαρισαιο κα ο γραμματεις αυτων). Note article with each substantive and the order, not "scribes and Pharisees," but "the Pharisees and the scribes of them" (the Pharisees). Some manuscripts omit "their," but Mark 2:16 (the scribes of the Pharisees) shows that it is correct here. Some of the scribes were Sadducees. It is only the Pharisees who find fault here.Murmured  (εγογγυζον). Imperfect active. Picturesque onomatopoetic word that sounds like its meaning. A late word used of the cooing of doves. It is like the buzzing of bees, like τονθορρυζω of literary Greek. They were not invited to this feast and would not have come if they had been. But, not being invited, they hang on the outside and criticize the disciples of Jesus for being there. The crowd was so large that the feast may have been served out in the open court at Levi's house, a sort of reclining garden party.The publicans and sinners  (των τελωνων κα αμαρτωλων). Here Luke is quoting the criticism of the critics. Note one article making one group of all of them.
