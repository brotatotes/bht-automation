 Leap for joy  (σκιρτησατε). Old verb and in LXX, but only in Luke in the N.T. (here and Luke 1:41; Luke 1:44). It answers to Matthew's (Matthew 5:12) "be exceeding glad."Did  (εποιουν). Imperfect active, the habit of "their fathers" (peculiar to both here). Matthew 5:12 has "persecuted." Thus they will receive a prophet's reward (Matthew 1:41).
