 But I say unto you that hear  (Αλλα υμιν λεγω τοις ακουουσιν). There is a contrast in this use of αλλα like that in Matthew 5:44. This is the only one of the many examples given by Luke 6:5 of the sharp antithesis between what the rabbis taught and what Jesus said. Perhaps that contrast is referred to by Luke. If necessary, αλλα could be coordinating or paratactic conjunction as in 2 Corinthians 7:11 rather than adversative as apparently here. See Matthew 5:43 Love of enemies is in the O.T., but Jesus ennobles the word, αγαπαω, and uses it of love for one's enemies.
