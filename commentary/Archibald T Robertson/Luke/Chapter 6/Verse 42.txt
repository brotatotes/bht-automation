 Canst thou say  (δυνασα λεγειν). Here Matthew 7:4 has wilt thou say  (ερεις).Beholdest not  (ου βλεπων). Matthew 7:4 has "lo" (ιδου).Thou hypocrite  (υποκριτα). Contrast to the studied politeness of "brother" (αδελφε) above. Powerful picture of blind self-complacence and incompetence, the keyword to argument here.
