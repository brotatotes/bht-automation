 Is known  (γινωσκετα). The fruit of each tree reveals its actual character. It is the final test. This sentence is not in Matthew 7:17-20, but the same idea is in the repeated saying (Matthew 7:16; Matthew 7:20): "By their fruits ye shall know them," where the verbepignosesthe  means full knowledge. The question in Matthew 7:16 is put here in positive declarative form. The verb is in the plural for "men" or "people," συλλεγουσιν. See on Matthew 7:16.Bramble bush  (βατου). Old word, quoted from the LXX in Mark 12:26; Luke 20:37 (from Exodus 3:6) about the burning bush that Moses saw, and by Stephen (Acts 7:30; Acts 7:35) referring to the same incident. Nowhere else in the N.T. "Galen has a chapter on its medicinal uses, and the medical writings abound in prescriptions of which it is an ingredient" (Vincent).Gather  (τρυγωσιν). A verb common in Greek writers for gathering ripe fruit. In the N.T. only here and Revelation 14:18.Grapes  (σταφυλην). Cluster of grapes.
