 On another sabbath  (εν ετερω σαββατω). This was a second (ετερον, as it often means), but not necessarily the next, sabbath. This incident is given by all three synoptics (Mark 3:1-6; Matthew 12:9-14; Luke 6:6-11). See Matt. and Mark for details. Only Luke notes that it was on a sabbath. Was this because Luke as a physician had to meet this problem in his own practise?Right hand  (η δεξια). This alone in Luke, the physician's eye for particulars.
