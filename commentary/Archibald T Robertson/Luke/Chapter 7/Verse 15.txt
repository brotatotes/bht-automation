 Sat up  (ανεκαθισεν). First aorist active indicative. The verb in the N.T. only here and Acts 9:40. Medical writers often used it of the sick sitting up in bed (Hobart, Med. Lang. of St. Luke, p. 11). It is objected that the symmetry of these cases (daughter of Jairus raised from the death-bed, this widow's son raised from the bier, Lazarus raised from the tomb) is suspicious, but no one Gospel gives all three (Plummer).Gave him to his mother  (εδωκεν αυτον τη μητρ αυτου). Tender way of putting it. "For he had already ceased to belong to his mother" (Bengel). So in Luke 9:42.
