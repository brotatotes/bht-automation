 What things ye have seen and heard  (α ειδετε κα ηκουσατε). In Matthew 11:4, present tense "which ye do hear and see." Rest of verse Luke 7:22; Luke 7:23 as in Matthew 11:4-6, which see for details. Luke mentions no raisings from the dead in verse Luke 7:21, but the language is mainly general, while here it is specific. Σκανδαλιζομα used here has the double notion of to trip up and to entrap and in the N.T. always means causing to sin.
