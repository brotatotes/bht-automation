 Went with them  (επορευετο συν αυτοις). Imperfect indicative middle. He started to go along with them.Now  (ηδη). Already like Latin jam. In 1 Corinthians 4:8 νυν ηδη like jam nunc.Sent friends  (επεμψεν φιλους). This second embassy also, wanting in Matthew's narrative. He "puts the message of both into the mouth of the centurion himself" (Plummer). Note saying (λεγων), present active singular participle, followed by direct quotation from the centurion himself.Trouble not thyself  (Μη σκυλλου). Present middle (direct use) imperative of σκυλλω, old verb originally meaning to skin, to mangle, and then in later Greek to vex, trouble, annoy. Frequent in the papyri in this latter sense.For I am not worthy that  (ου γαρ ικανος ειμ ινα). The same word ικανος, not αξιος, as in Matthew 8:8, which see for discussion, from ικω, ικανω, to fit, to reach, be adequate for. Hινα in both places as common in late Greek. See Matthew 8:8 also for "roof" (στεγην, covering).
