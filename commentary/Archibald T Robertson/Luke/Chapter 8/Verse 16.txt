 When he hath lighted a lamp  (λυχνον αψας). It is a portable lamp (λυχνον) that one lights (αψας aorist active participle of απτω, to kindle, fasten to, light).With a vessel  (σκευε, instrumental case of σκευος). Here Mark 4:21 has the more definite figure "under the bushel" as has Matthew 5:15.Under the bed  (υποκατω κλινης). Here Mark 4:21 has the regular υπο την κλινην instead of the late compound υποκατω. Ragg notes that Matthew distributes the sayings of Jesus given here by Luke 8:16-18; Mark 4:21-25 concerning the parable of the lamp and gives them in three separate places (Matthew 5:15; Matthew 10:26; Matthew 13:12). That is true, but it does not follow that Mark and Luke have bunched together separate sayings or that Matthew has scattered sayings delivered only on one occasion. One of the slowest lessons for some critics to learn is that Jesus repeated favourite sayings on different occasions and in different groupings just as every popular preacher and teacher does today. See on Mark 4:21 for further discussion of the lamp and stand.May see the light  (Βλεπωσιν το φως). In Matthew 5:16 Jesus has it "may see your good works." The purpose of light is to let one see something else, not the light. Note present subjunctive (βλεπωσιν), linear action "Jesus had kindled a light within them. They must not hide it, but must see that it spreads to others" (Plummer). The parable of the lamp throws light on the parable of the sower.
