 How ye hear  (πως ακουετε). The manner of hearing. Mark 4:24 has "what ye hear" (τ ακουετε), the matter that is heard. Both are supremely important. Some things should not be heard at all. Some that are heard should be forgotten. Others should be treasured and practised.For whosoever hath  (Hος αν γαρ εχη). Present active subjunctive of the common verb εχω which may mean "keep on having" or "acquiring." See on Mark 4:25 for discussion.Thinketh he hath  (δοκε εχειν), or seems to acquire or to hold . Losses in business illustrate this saying as when we see their riches take wings and fly away. So it is with hearing and heeding. Self-deception is a common complaint.
