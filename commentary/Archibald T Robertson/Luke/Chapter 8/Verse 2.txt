 Which had been healed  (α ησαν τεθεραπευμενα). Periphrastic past perfect passive, suggesting that the healing had taken place some time before this tour. These women all had personal grounds of gratitude to Jesus.From whom seven devils (demons) had gone out  (αφ' ης δαιμονια επτα εξεληλυθε). Past perfect active third singular for the δαιμονια are neuter plural. This first mention of Mary Magdalene describes her special cause of gratitude. This fact is stated also in Mark 16:9 in the disputed close of the Gospel. The presence of seven demons in one person indicates special malignity (Mark 5:9). See Matthew 17:45 for the parable of the demon who came back with seven other demons worse than the first. It is not known where Magdala was, whence Mary came.
