 Had spent all her living upon physicians  (εις ιατρους προσαναλωσασα ολον τον βιον). First aorist active participle of an old verb προσαναλισκω, only here in the N.T. But Westcott and Hort reject this clause because it is not in B D Syriac Sinaitic. Whether genuine or not, the other clause in Mark 5:26 certainly is not in Luke: "had suffered many things of many physicians." Probably both are not genuine in Luke who takes care of the physicians by the simple statement that it was a chronic case:could not be healed of any  (ουκ ισχυσεν απ' ουδενος θεραπευθηνα). He omitted also what Mark has: "and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse."
