 From the ruler of the synagogue's house  (παρα του αρχισυναγωγου). The word "house" is not in the Greek here as in Mark 5:35 where απο is used rather than παρα, as here. But the ruler himself had come to Jesus (Luke 8:41) and this is the real idea. Trouble not (μηκετ σκυλλε). See on Luke 7:6 for this verb and also Mark 5:35; Matthew 9:36.
