 Rejected  (αποδοκιμασθηνα). First aorist passive infinitive of αποδοκιμαζω, to reject after trial.The third day  (τη τριτη ημερα). Locative case of time as in Matthew 16:21. Here in the parallel passage Mark 8:31 has "after three days" (μετα τρεις ημερας) in precisely the same sense. That is to say, "after three days" is just a free way of saying "on the third day" and cannot mean "on the fourth day" if taken too literally. For discussion of this plain prediction of the death of Christ with various details see discussion on Matthew 16:21; Mark 8:31. It was a melancholy outlook that depressed the disciples as Mark and Matthew show in the protest of Peter and his rebuke.
