 Were heavy with sleep  (ησαν βεβαρημενο υπνω). Periphrastic past perfect of βαρεω, a late form for the ancient βαρυνω (not in N.T. save Textus Receptus in Luke 21:34). This form, rare and only in passive (present, aorist, perfect) in the N.T., is like βαρυνω, from βαρυς, and that from βαρος, weight, burden (Galatians 6:2). Hυπνω is in the instrumental case. They had apparently climbed the mountain in the early part of the night and were now overcome with sleep as Jesus prolonged his prayer. Luke alone tells of their sleep. The same word is used of the eyes of these three disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane (Matthew 26:43) and of the hearts of many (Luke 21:34).But when they were fully awake  (διαγρηγορησαντες δε). First aorist active participle of this late (Herodian) and rare compound verb (here alone in the N.T.), διαγρηγορεω (Luke is fond of compounds with δια). The simple verb γρηγορεω (from the second perfect active εγρηγορα) is also late, but common in the LXX and the N.T. The effect of δια can be either to remain awake in spite of desire to sleep (margin of Revised Version) or to become thoroughly awake (ingressive aorist tense also) as Revised Version has it. This is most likely correct. The Syriac Sinaitic has it "When they awoke." Certainly they had been through a strain.His glory  (την δοξαν αυτου). See also verse Luke 9:26 in the words of Jesus.
