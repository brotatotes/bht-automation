 Sink into your ears  (Θεσθε υμεις εις τα ωτα υμων). Second aorist imperative middle of τιθημ, common verb. "Do you (note emphatic position) yourselves (whatever others do) put into your ears." No word like "sink" here. The same prediction here as in Mark 9:31; Matthew 17:22 about the Son of man only without mention of death and resurrection as there, which see for discussion.
