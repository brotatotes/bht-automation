 Sent messengers  (απεστειλεν αγγελους). As a precaution since he was going to Jerusalem through Samaria. The Samaritans did not object when people went north from Jerusalem through their country. He was repudiating Mount Gerizim by going by it to Jerusalem. This was an unusual precaution by Jesus and we do not know who the messengers ( angels ) were.To make ready for him  (ως ετοιμασα αυτω). Hως is correct here, not ωστε. The only examples of the final use of ως with the infinitive in the N.T. are this one and Hebrews 7:9 (absolute use). In Acts 20:24 Westcott and Hort read ως τελειωσω and put ως τελειωσα in the margin (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1091).
