 Saw this  (ιδοντες). Second aorist active participle of οραω. Saw the messengers returning.We bid  (θελεις ειπωμεν). Deliberative subjunctive ειπωμεν after θελεις without ινα, probably two questions, Dost thou wish? Shall we bid? Perhaps the recent appearance of Elijah on the Mount of Transfiguration reminded James and John of the incident in 2 Kings 1:10-12. Some MSS. add here "as Elijah did." The language of the LXX is quoted by James and John, these fiery Sons of Thunder. Note the two aorist active infinitives (καταβηναι, αναλωσα, the first ingressive, the second effective).
