 A certain man  (τις). Matthew 8:19 calls him "a scribe." Luke 9:57-60; Matthew 8:19-22, but not in Mark and so from Q or the Logia.Wherever you go  (οπου εαν απερχη) is the present middle subjunctive with the indefinite relative adverb εαν, common Greek idiom. See on Matthew for "holes," "nests," "Son of man." The idiom "where to lay his head" (που την κεφαλην κλινη) is the same in both, the deliberative subjunctive retained in the indirect question. "Jesus knows the measure of the scribe's enthusiasm" (Plummer). The wandering life of Jesus explains this statement.
