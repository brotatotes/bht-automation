 All that was done  (τα γινομενα παντα). Present middle participle, "all that was coming to pass."He was much perplexed  (διηπορε). Imperfect active of διαπορεω, to be thoroughly at a loss, unable to find a way out (δια, α privative, πορος, way), common ancient verb, but only in Luke's writings in the N.T.Because it was said  (δια το λεγεσθα). Neat Greek idiom, the articular passive infinitive after δια. Three reports came to the ears of Herod as Luke has it, each introduced by οτ (that) in indirect discourse: "By some" (υπο τινων), "by some" (υπο τινων δε), "by others" (αλλων δε, υπο not here expressed, but carried over). The verbs in the indirect discourse here (verses Luke 9:7; Luke 9:8) are all three aorists (ηγερθη first passive; εφανη second passive; ανεστη second active), not past perfects as the English has them.
