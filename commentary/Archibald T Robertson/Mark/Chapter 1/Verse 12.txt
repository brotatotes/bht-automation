 Driveth him forth  (αυτον εκβαλλε). Vivid word, bolder than Matthew's "was led up" (ανηχθη) and Luke's "was led" (ηγετο). It is the same word employed in the driving out of demons (Mark 1:34; Mark 1:39). Mark has here "straightway" where Matthew has "then" (see on verse Mark 1:9). The forty days in the wilderness were under the direct guidance of the Holy Spirit. The entire earthly life of Jesus was bound up with the Holy Spirit from his birth to his death and resurrection.
