 What have we to do with thee?  (τ ημιν κα σοι?) The same idiom in Matthew 8:29. Ethical dative. Nothing in common between the demon and Jesus. Note "we." The man speaks for the demon and himself, double personality. The recognition of Jesus by the demons may surprise us since the rabbis (the ecclesiastics) failed to do so. They call Jesus "The Holy One of God" (ο αγιος του θεου). Hence the demon feared that Jesus was come to destroy him and the man in his power. In Matthew 8:29 the demon calls Jesus "Son of God." Later the disciples will call Jesus "The Holy One of God" (John 6:69). The demon cried out aloud (ανεκραξεν, late first aorist form, ανεκραγεν, common second aorist) so that all heard the strange testimony to Jesus. The man says "I know" (οιδα), correct text, some manuscripts "we know" (οιδαμεν), including the demon.
