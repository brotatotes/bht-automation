 Clothed with camel's hair  (ενδεδυμενος τριχας καμηλου). Matthew (Matthew 3:4) has it a garment (ενδυμα) of camel's hair. Mark has it in the accusative plural the object of the perfect passive participle retained according to a common Greek idiom. It was, of course, not camel's skin, but rough cloth woven of camel's hair. For the locusts and wild honey, see on Matthew 3:4. Dried locusts are considered palatable and the wild honey, or "mountain honey" as some versions give it (μελ αγριον), was bountiful in the clefts of the rocks. Some Bedouins make their living yet by gathering this wild honey out of the rocks.
