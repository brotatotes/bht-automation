 He took them in his arms  (εναγκαλισαμενος). A distinct rebuke to the protest of the over-particular disciples. This word already in Mark 9:36. In Luke 2:28 we have the full idiom, to receive into the arms (εις τας αγκαλας δεχεσθα). So with tender fondling Jesus repeatedly blessed (κατευλογε, imperfect), laying his hands upon each of them (τιθεις, present participle). It was a great moment for each mother and child.
