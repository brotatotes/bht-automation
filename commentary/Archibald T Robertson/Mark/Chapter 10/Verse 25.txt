 Needle's eye  (τρυμαλιας ραφιδος). See on Matthew 19:24 for discussion. Luke uses the surgical needle, βελονης. Matthew has the word ραφις like Mark from ραπτω, to sew, and it appears in the papyri. Both Matthew and Luke employ τρηματος for eye, a perforation or hole from τιτραω, to bore. Mark's word τρυμαλιας is from τρυω, to wear away, to perforate. In the LXX and Plutarch.
