 No man eat fruit from thee henceforward forever  (Μηκετ εις τον αιωνα εκ σου μηδεις καρπον φαγο). The verb φαγο is in the second aorist active optative. It is a wish for the future that in its negative form constitutes a curse upon the tree. Matthew 21:19 has the aorist subjunctive with double negative ου μηκετ γενητα, a very strong negative prediction that amounts to a prohibition. See on Matthew. Jesus probably spoke in the Aramaic on this occasion.And his disciples heard it  (κα ηκουον ο μαθητα αυτου). Imperfect tense, "were listening to it," and evidently in amazement, for, after all, it was not the fault of the poor fig tree that it had put out leaves. One often sees peach blossoms nipped by the frost when they are too precocious in the changeable weather. But Jesus offered no explanation at this time.
