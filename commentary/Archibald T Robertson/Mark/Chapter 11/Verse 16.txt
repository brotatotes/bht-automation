 Through the temple  (δια του ιερου). The temple authorities had prohibited using the outer court of the temple through the Precinct as a sort of short cut or by-path from the city to the Mount of Olives. But the rule was neglected and all sorts of irreverent conduct was going on that stirred the spirit of Jesus. This item is given only in Mark. Note the use of ινα after ηφιε (imperfect tense) instead of the infinitive (the usual construction).
