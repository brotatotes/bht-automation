 Whensoever ye stand  (οταν στηκετε). Late form of present indicative στηκω, from perfect stem εστηκα. In LXX. Note use of οταν as in Mark 11:19. Jesus does not mean by the use of "stand" here to teach that this is the only proper attitude in prayer.That your Father also may forgive you  (ινα κα ο πατηρ αφη υμιν). Evidently God's willingness to forgive is limited by our willingness to forgive others. This is a solemn thought for all who pray. Recall the words of Jesus in Matthew 6:12; Matthew 6:14.
