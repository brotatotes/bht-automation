 Knowing their hypocrisy  (ειδως αυτων την υποχρισιν). Matthew 22:18 has "perceived their wickedness" (γνους την πονηριαν αυτων) while Luke 20:23 says, "perceived their craftiness" (κατανοησας αυτων την πανουργιαν). Each of these words throws a flash-light on the spirit and attitude of these young men. They were sly, shrewd, slick, but they did not deceive Jesus with their pious palaver. See on Matthew for further details.
