 Beware of the scribes  (βλεπετε απο των γραμματεων). Jesus now turns to the multitudes and to his disciples (Matthew 23:1) and warns them against the scribes and the Pharisees while they are still there to hear his denunciation. The scribes were the professional teachers of the current Judaism and were nearly all Pharisees. Mark (Mark 14:38-40) gives a mere summary sketch of this bold and terrific indictment as preserved in Mark 12:23 in words that fairly blister today. Luke 20:45-47 follows Mark closely. See Matthew 8:15 for this same use of βλεπετε απο with the ablative. It is usually called a translation-Hebraism, a usage not found with βλεπω in the older Greek. But the papyri give it, a vivid vernacular idiom. "Beware of the Jews" (βλεπε σατον απο των Ιουδαιων, Berl. G. U. 1079. A.D. 41). See Robertson, Grammar, p. 577. The pride of the pompous scribes is itemized by Mark:To walk in long robes  (στολαις),stoles , the dress of dignitaries like kings and priests.Salutations in the marketplaces  (ασπασμους εν ταις αγοραις), where the people could see their dignity recognized.
