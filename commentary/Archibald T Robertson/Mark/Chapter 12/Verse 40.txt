 Devour widows' houses  (ο κατεσθοντες τας οικιας των χηρων). New sentence in the nominative. Terrible pictures of civil wrong by graft grabbing the homes of helpless widows. They inveigled widows into giving their homes to the temple and took it for themselves.For a pretence make long prayers  (προφασε μακρα προσευχομενο). Προφασε instrumental case of the same word (προφημ) from which prophet comes, but here pretext, pretence of extra piety while robbing the widows and pushing themselves to the fore. Some derive it from προφαινω, to show forth.Greater  (περισσοτερον). More abundant condemnation. Some comfort in that at any rate.
