 Beating some and killing some  (ους μεν δεροντεσ, ους δε αποκτεννυντες). This distributive use of the demonstrative appears also in Matthew 21:35 in the singular (ον μεν, ον δε, ον δε). Originally δερω in Homer meant to skin, flay, then to smite, to beat. Αποκτεννυντες is a μ form of the verb (αποκτεννυμ) and means to kill off.
