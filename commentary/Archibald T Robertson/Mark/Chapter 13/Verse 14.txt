 Standing where he ought not  (εστηκοτα οπου ου δε). Matthew 24:15 has "standing in the holy place" (εστος εν τοπο αγιω), neuter and agreeing with βδελυγμα (abomination), the very phrase applied in 1Macc. 1:54 to the altar to Zeus erected by Antiochus Epiphanes where the altar to Jehovah was. Mark personifies the abomination as personal (masculine), while Luke 21:20 defines it by reference to the armies (of Rome, as it turned out). So the words of Daniel find a second fulfilment, Rome taking the place of Syria (Swete). See on Matthew 24:15 for this phrase and the parenthesis inserted in the words of Jesus ("Let him that readeth understand"). See also on Matthew 24:16-25 for discussion of details in Mark 13:14-22.
