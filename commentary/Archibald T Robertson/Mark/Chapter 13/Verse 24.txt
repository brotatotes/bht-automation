 The sun shall be darkened  (ο ελιος σκοτισθησετα). Future passive indicative. These figures come from the prophets (Isaiah 13:9; Ezekiel 32:7; Joel 2:1; Joel 2:10; Amos 8:9; Zephaniah 1:14-16; Zechariah 12:12). One should not forget that prophetic imagery was not always meant to be taken literally, especially apocalyptic symbols. Peter in Acts 2:15-21 applies the prophecy of Joel about the sun and moon to the events on the day of Pentecost. See on Matthew 24:29-31 for details of verses Mark 13:24-27.
