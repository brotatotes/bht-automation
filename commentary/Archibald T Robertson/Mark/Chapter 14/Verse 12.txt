 When they sacrificed the passover  (οτε το πασχα εθυον). Imperfect indicative, customary practice. The paschal lamb (note πασχα) was slain at 6 P.M., beginning of the fifteenth of the month (Exodus 12:6), but the preparations were made beforehand on the fourteenth (Thursday). See on Matthew 26:17 for discussion of "eat the passover."
