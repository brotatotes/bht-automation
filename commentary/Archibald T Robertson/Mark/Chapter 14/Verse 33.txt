 Greatly amazed and sore troubled  (εκθαμβεισθα κα αδημονειν). Matthew 26:37 has "sorrowful and sore troubled." See on Matt. about αδημονειν. Mark alone uses εξθαμβεισθα (here and in Mark 9:15). There is a papyrus example given by Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary. The verb θαμβεω occurs in Mark 10:32 for the amazement of the disciples at the look of Jesus as he went toward Jerusalem. Now Jesus himself feels amazement as he directly faces the struggle in the Garden of Gethsemane. He wins the victory over himself in Gethsemane and then he can endure the loss, despising the shame. For the moment he is rather amazed and homesick for heaven. "Long as He had foreseen the Passion, when it came clearly into view its terror exceeded His anticipations" (Swete). "He learned from what he suffered," (Hebrews 5:8) and this new experience enriched the human soul of Jesus.
