 Their witness agreed not together  (ισα α μαρτυρια ουκ ησαν). Literally, the testimonies were not equal. They did not correspond with each other on essential points.Many were bearing false witness  (εψευδομαρτυρουν, imperfect, repeated action)against him . No two witnesses bore joint testimony to justify a capital sentence according to the law (Deuteronomy 19:15). Note imperfects in these verses (Mark 14:55-57) to indicate repeated failures.
