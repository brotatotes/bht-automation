 To them that stood by  (τοις παρεστωσιν). This talk about Peter was overheard by him. "This fellow (ουτος) is one of them." So in verse Mark 14:70 the talk is directly to Peter as in Matthew 26:73, but in Luke 22:59 it is about him. Soon the bystanders (ο παρεστωτες) will join in the accusation to Peter (verse Mark 14:70; Matthew 26:73), with the specially pungent question in John 18:26 which was the climax. See on Matthew 26:69-75 for discussion of similar details.
