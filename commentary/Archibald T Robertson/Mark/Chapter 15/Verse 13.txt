 Crucify him  (Σταυρωσον αυτον). Luke 23:21 repeats the verb. Matthew 27:22 has it, "Let him be crucified." There was a chorus and a hubbub of confused voices all demanding crucifixion for Christ. Some of the voices beyond a doubt had joined in the hallelujahs to the Son of David in the triumphal entry. See on Matthew 27:23 for discussion of Mark 15:14.
