 The sixth hour  (ωρας εκτης). That is, noon (Jewish time), as the third hour was nine A.M. (Mark 15:25). See on Matthew 27:45 for discussion. Given also by Luke 23:44. Mark gives the Aramaic transliteration as does B in Matthew 27:45, which see for discussion.Forsaken  (εγκατελιπες). Some MSS. give ωνειδισας (reproached). We are not able to enter into the fulness of the desolation felt by Jesus at this moment as the Father regarded him as sin (2 Corinthians 5:21). This desolation was the deepest suffering. He did not cease to be the Son of God. That would be impossible.
