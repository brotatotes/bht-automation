 She  (εκεινη). Only instance of this pronoun (=ιλλα) absolutely in Mark, though a good Greek idiom. (See John 19:35.) See also verses Mark 16:11; Mark 16:20.Went  (πορευθεισα). First aorist passive participle. Common word for going, but in Mark so far only in Mark 9:30 in the uncompounded form. Here also in verses Mark 16:12; Mark 16:15.Them that had been with him  (τοις μετ' αυτου γενομενοις). This phrase for the disciples occurs here alone in Mark and the other Gospels if the disciples (μαθητα) are meant. All these items suggest another hand than Mark for this closing portion.As they mourned and wept  (πενθουσιν κα κλαιουσιν). Present active participles in dative plural agreeing with τοις ... γενομενοις and describing the pathos of the disciples in their utter bereavement and woe.
