 After these things  (μετα ταυτα). Only here in Mark. Luke tells us that it was on the same day (Luke 24:13).In another form  (εν ετερα μορφη). It was not a μεταμορφωσις or transfiguration like that described in Mark 9:2. Luke explains that their eyes were holden so that they could not recognize Jesus (Luke 24:16). This matchless story appears in full in Luke 24:13-32.
