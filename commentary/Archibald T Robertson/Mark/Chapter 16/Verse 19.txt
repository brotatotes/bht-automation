 Was received up into heaven  (ανελημπθη εις τον ουρανον). First aorist passive indicative. Luke gives the fact of the Ascension twice in Gospel (Luke 24:50) and Acts 1:9-11. The Ascension in Mark took place after Jesus spoke to the disciples, not in Galilee (Mark 16:15-18), nor on the first or second Sunday evening in Jerusalem. We should not know when it took place nor where but for Luke who locates it on Olivet (Luke 24:50) at the close of the forty days (Acts 1:3) and so after the return from Galilee (Matthew 28:16).Sat down at the right hand of God  (εκαθισεν εκ δεξιων του θεου). Swete notes that the author "passes beyond the field of history into that of theology," an early and most cherished belief (Acts 7:55; Romans 8:34; Ephesians 1:20; Colossians 3:1; Hebrews 1:3; Hebrews 8:1; Hebrews 10:12; Hebrews 12:2; 1 Peter 3:22; Revelation 3:21).
