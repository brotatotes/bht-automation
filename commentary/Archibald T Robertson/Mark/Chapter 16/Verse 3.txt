 Who shall roll us away the stone?  (Τις αποκυλισε ημιν τον λιθον;). Alone in Mark. The opposite of προσκυλιω in Mark 15:46. In verse Mark 16:4 rolled back  (ανεκεκυλιστα, perfect passive indicative) occurs also. Both verbs occur in Koine writers and in the papyri. Clearly the women have no hope of the resurrection of Jesus for they were raising the problem (ελεγον, imperfect) as they walked along.
