 By the seaside  (παρα την θαλασσαν). A pretty picture of Jesus walking by the sea and a walk that Jesus loved (Mark 1:16; Matthew 4:18). Probably Jesus went out from the crowd in Peter's house as soon as he could. It was a joy to get a whiff of fresh air by the sea. But it was not long till all the crowd began to come to Jesus (ηρχετο, imperfect) and Jesus was teaching them (εδιδασκεν, imperfect). It was the old story over again, but Jesus did not run away.
