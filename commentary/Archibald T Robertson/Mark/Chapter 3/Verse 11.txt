 Whensoever they beheld him  (οταν αυτον εθεωρουν). Imperfect indicative with οταν of repeated action. They kept falling down before him (προσεπιπτον) and crying, (εκραζον) and he kept charging or rebuking (επιτιμα) them, all imperfects. The unclean spirits (demons) recognize Jesus as the Son of God, as before. Jesus charged them not to make him known as he had also done before. He did not wish this testimony. It was a most exciting ordeal and is given only by Mark. Note non-final use of ινα.
