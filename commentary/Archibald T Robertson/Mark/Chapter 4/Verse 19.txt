 The lusts of other things  (α περ τα λοιπα επιθυμια). All the passions or longings, sensual, worldly, "pleasures of this life" (ηδονων του βιου) as Luke has it (Luke 8:14), the world of sense drowning the world of spirit. The word επιθυμια is not evil in itself. One can yearn (this word) for what is high and holy (Luke 22:15; Philippians 1:23).
