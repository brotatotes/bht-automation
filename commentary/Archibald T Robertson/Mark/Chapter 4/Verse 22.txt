 Save that it should be manifested  (εαν μη ινα φανερωθη). Note εαν μη and ινα. Luke 8:17 has itthat shall not be made manifest  (ο ου φανερον γενησετα). Here in Mark it is stated that the temporary concealment is for final manifestation and a means to that end. Those who are charged with the secret at this time are given the set responsibility of proclaiming it on the housetops after Ascension (Swete). The hidden (κρυπτον) and thesecret  (αποκρυφον) are to be revealed in due time.
