 Even that which he hath  (κα ο εχε). Luke 8:18 haseven that which he thinketh that he hath or seemeth to have  (κα ο δοκε εχειν). It is possible that εχε here has the notion of acquiring. The man who does not acquire soon loses what he thinks that he has. This is one of the paradoxes of Jesus that repay thought and practice.
