 But privately to his disciples he expounded all things  (κατ' ιδιαν δε τοις ιδιοις μαθηταις επελυεν παντα). To his own (ιδιοις) disciples in private, in distinction from the mass of the people Jesus was in the habit (imperfect tense, επελυεν) ofdisclosing , revealing, all things (παντα) in plain language without the parabolic form used before the crowds. This verb επιλυω occurs in the N.T. only here and in Acts 19:39 where the town-clerk of Ephesus says of the troubles by the mob: "It shall be settled in the regular assembly" (εν τη εννομω εκκλησια επιλυθησετα). First future passive indicative from επιλυω. The word means to give additional (επ) loosening (λυω), so to explain, to make plainer, clearer, even to the point of revelation. This last is the idea of the substantive in 2 Peter 1:20 where even the Revised Version has it: "No prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation" (πασα προφητεια γραφης ιδιας επιλυσεως ου γινετα). Here the use of γινετα (comes) with the ablative case (επιλυσεως) and the explanation given in verse 2 Peter 1:21 shows plainly that disclosure or revelation to the prophet is what is meant, not interpretation of what the prophet said. The prophetic impulse and message came from God through the Holy Spirit. In private the further disclosures of Jesus amounted to fresh revelations concerning the mysteries of the kingdom of God.
