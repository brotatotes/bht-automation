 Out of the boat  (εκ του πλοιου). Straightway (ευθυς) Mark says, using the genitive absolute (εξελθοντος αυτου) and then repeating αυτω associative instrumental after απηντησεν. The demoniac greeted Jesus at once. Mark and Luke 9:27 mention only one man while Matthew notes two demoniacs, perhaps one more violent than the other. Each of the Gospels has a different phrase. Mark has "a man with an unclean spirit" (εν πνευματ ακαθαρτω), Matthew 8:28 "two possessed with demons" (δυο δαιμονιζομενο), Luke 8:27 "one having demons" (τις εχων δαιμονια). Mark has many touches about this miracle not retained in Matthew and Luke. See on Matthew 8:28.
