 Had suffered many things of many physicians  (πολλα παθουσα υπο πολλων ιατρων). A pathetic picture of a woman with a chronic case who had tried doctor after doctor.Had spent all that she had  (δαπανησασα τα παρ' αυτης παντα). Having spent the all from herself, all her resources. For the idiom with παρα see Luke 10:7; Philippians 4:18. The tragedy of it was that she "was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse" (μηδεν ωφεληθεισα αλλα μαλλον εις το χειρον ελθουσα). Her money was gone, her disease was gaining on her, her one chance came now with Jesus. Matthew says nothing about her experience with the doctors and Luke 8:43 merely says that she "had spent all her living upon physicians and could not be healed of any," a plain chronic case. Luke the physician neatly takes care of the physicians. But they were not to blame. She had a disease that they did not know how to cure. Vincent quotes a prescription for an issue of blood as given in the Talmud which gives one a most grateful feeling that he is not under the care of doctors of that nature. The only parallel today is Chinese medicine of the old sort before modern medical schools came.
