 She felt in her body  (εγνω τω σωματ). She knew, the verb means. She said to herself,I am healed  (ιαμα). Ιατα retains the perfect passive in the indirect discourse. It was a vivid moment of joy for her. The plague (μαστιγος) or scourge was a whip used in flagellations as on Paul to find out his guilt (Acts 22:24, cf. Hebrews 11:26). It is an old word that was used for afflictions regarded as a scourge from God. See already on Mark 3:10.
