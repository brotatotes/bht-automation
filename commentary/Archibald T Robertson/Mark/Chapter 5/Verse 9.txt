 My name is Legion  (Λεγιων ονομα μο). So Luke 8:30, but not Matthew. Latin word (legio). A full Roman legion had 6,826 men. See on Matthew 26:53. This may not have been a full legion, for Mark 5:13 notes that the number of hogs was "about two thousand." Of course, a stickler for words might say that each hog had several demons.
