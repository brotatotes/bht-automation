 For a testimony unto them  (εις μαρτυριον αυτοις). Not in Matthew. Luke 9:5 has "for a testimony against them" (εις μαρτυριον επ αυτους). The dative αυτοις in Mark is the dative of disadvantage and really carries the same idea as επ in Luke. The dramatic figure ofshaking out  (εκτιναξατε, effective aorist imperative, Mark and Matthew),shaking off  (αποτινασσετε, present imperative, Luke).
