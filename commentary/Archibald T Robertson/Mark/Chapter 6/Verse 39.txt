 By companies  (συμποσια συμποσια). Distribution expressed by repetition as in Mark 6:7 (δυο δυο) instead of using ανα or κατα. Literally our word symposium and originally a drinking party, Latin convivium, then the party of guests of any kind without the notion of drinking. So in Plutarch and the LXX (especially I Macca.).Upon the green grass  (επ τω χλωρω χορτω). Another Markan touch. It was passover time (John 6:4) and the afternoon sun shone upon the orderly groups upon the green spring grass. See on Matthew 14:15. They may have been seated like companies at tables, open at one end.
