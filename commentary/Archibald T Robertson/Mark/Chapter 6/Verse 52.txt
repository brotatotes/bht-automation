 For they understood not  (ου γαρ συνηκαν). Explanation of their excessive amazement, viz., their failure to grasp the full significance of the miracle of the loaves and fishes, a nature miracle.

Today some men have such intellectual hardness or denseness that they cannot believe that God can or would work miracles, least of all nature miracles.
