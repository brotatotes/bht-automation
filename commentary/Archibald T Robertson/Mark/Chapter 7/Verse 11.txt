 Corban  (κορβαν ο εστιν δωρον). See on Matthew 15:5. Mark preserves the Hebrew word for a gift or offering to God (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9), indeclinable here, meaninggift  (δωρον), but declinable κορβανας in Matthew 27:6, meaning sacred treasury. The rabbis ( but ye say , υμεις δε λεγετε) actually allowed the mere saying of this word by an unfaithful son to prevent the use of needed money for the support of father or mother. It was a home thrust to these pettifogging sticklers for ceremonial punctilios. They not only justified such a son's trickery, but held that he was prohibited from using it for father or mother, but he might use it for himself.
