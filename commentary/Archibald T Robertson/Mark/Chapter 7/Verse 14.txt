 And he called to him the multitude again  (κα προσκαλεσαμενος παλιν τον οχλον). Aorist middle participle, calling to himself. The rabbis had attacked the disciples about not washing their hands before eating. Jesus now turned the tables on them completely and laid bare their hollow pretentious hypocrisy to the people.Hear me all of you and understand  (ακουσατε μου παντες κα συνιετε). A most pointed appeal to the people to see into and see through the chicanery of these ecclesiastics. See on Matthew 15:11 for discussion.
