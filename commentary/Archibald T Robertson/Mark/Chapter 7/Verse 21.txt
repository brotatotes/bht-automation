 Evil thoughts  (ο διαλογισμο ο κακο). These come out of the heart (εκ της καρδιας), the inner man, and lead to the dreadful list here given like the crimes of a modern police court:fornications  (πορνεια, usually of the unmarried),adulteries  (μοιχαια, of the married),thefts  (κλοπα, stealings),covetings  (πλεονεξια, craze for more and more),murders  (φονο, growing out of the others often),wickednesses  (πονηρια, from πονος, toil, then drudge, bad like our knave, serving boy like German Knabe, and then criminal),deceit  (δολος, lure or snare with bait),lasciviousness  (ασελγεια, unrestrained sex instinct),evil eye  (οφθαλμος πονηρος) or eye that works evil and that haunts one with its gloating stare,railing  (βλασφημια, blasphemy, hurtful speech),pride  (υπερηφανια, holding oneself above others, stuck up),foolishness  (αφροσυνη, lack of sense), a fitting close to it all.
