 Tare him grievously  (συνεσπαραξεν αυτον). Luke 9:42 has both ερρηξεν (dashed down, like Mark 9:18, ρησσε) and συνεσπαραξεν (convulsed). This compound with συν- (together with), strengthens the force of the verb as in συνπνιγω (Mark 4:7) and συντηρεω (Mark 6:20). The only other instance of this compound verb known is in Maximus Tyrius (second century B.C.).Wallowed  (εκυλιετο). Imperfect passive, was rolled. A pitiful sight. Late form of the old κυλινδω.
