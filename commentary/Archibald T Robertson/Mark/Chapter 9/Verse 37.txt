 One of such little children  (εν των τοιουτων παιδιων). Matthew 18:5 has "one such little child" and Luke 9:48 "this little child." It was an object lesson to the arrogant conceit of the twelve apostles contending for primacy. They did not learn this lesson for they will again wrangle over primacy (Mark 10:33-45; Matthew 20:20-28) and they will be unable to comprehend easily what the attitude of Jesus was toward children (Mark 10:13-16; Matthew 19:13-15; Luke 8:15-17). The child was used as a rebuke to the apostles.
