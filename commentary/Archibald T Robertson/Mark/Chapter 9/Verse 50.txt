 Have salt in yourselves  (εχετε εν εαυτοις αλα). Jesus had once called them the salt of the earth (Matthew 5:13) and had warned them against losing the saltness of the salt. If it is αναλον, nothing canseason  (αρτυω) it and it is of no use to season anything else. It is like an exploded shell, a burnt-out crater, a spent force. This is a warning for all Christians.
