 Beelzebub  (βεεζεβουλ according to B, βεελζεβουλ by most Greek MSS., βεελζεβουβ by many non-Greek MSS.). The etymology of the word is also unknown, whether "lord of a dwelling" with a pun on "the master of the house" (οικοδεσποτην) or "lord of flies" or "lord of dung" or "lord of idolatrous sacrifices." It is evidently a term of reproach. "An opprobrious epithet; exact form of the word and meaning of the name have given more trouble to commentators than it is all worth" (Bruce). See Matthew 12:24.
