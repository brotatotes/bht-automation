 Fear them not therefore  (μη ουν φοβηθητε αυτους). Repeated in verses Matthew 10:28 and Matthew 10:31 (μη φοβεισθε present middle imperative here in contrast with aorist passive subjunctive in the preceding prohibitions). Note also the accusative case with the aorist passive subjunctive, transitive though passive. See same construction in Luke 12:5. In Matthew 10:28 the construction is with απο and the ablative, a translation Hebraism as in Luke 12:4 (Robertson, Grammar of the Greek N.T. in the Light of Historical Research, p. 577).
