 Shall deny me  (αρνησητα με). Aorist subjunctive here with οστις, though future indicative ομολογησε above. Note accusative here (case of extension), saying "no" to Christ, complete breach. This is a solemn law, not a mere social breach, this cleavage by Christ of the man who repudiates him, public and final.
