 In the name of a prophet  (εις ονομα προφητου). "Because he is a prophet" (Moffatt). In an Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 37 (A.D. 49) we find ονοματ ελευθερου in virtue of being free-born. "He that receiveth a prophet from no ulterior motive, but simply qua prophet (ut prophetam, Jer.) would receive a reward in the coming age equal to that of his guest" (McNeile). The use of εις here is to be noted. In reality εις is simply εν with the same meaning. It is not proper to say that εις has always to be translated "into." Besides these examples of εις ονομα in verses Matthew 10:41 and Matthew 10:43 see Matthew 12:41 εις το κηρυγμα Ιωνα (see Robertson's Grammar, p. 593).Unto one of these little ones  (ενα των μικρων τουτων). Simple believers who are neither apostles, prophets, or particularly righteous, just "learners," "in the name of a disciple" (εις ονομα μαθητου). Alford thinks that some children were present (cf. Matthew 18:2-6).
