 The lost sheep  (τα προβατα τα απολωλοτα). The sheep, the lost ones. Mentioned here first by Matthew. Jesus uses it not in blame, but in pity (Bruce). Bengel notes that Jesus says "lost" more frequently than "led astray." "If the Jewish nation could be brought to repentance the new age would dawn" (McNeile).
