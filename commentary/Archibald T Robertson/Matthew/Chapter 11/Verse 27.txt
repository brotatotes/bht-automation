 All things have been delivered unto me of my Father  (παντα μο παρεδοθη υπο του πατρος μου). This sublime claim is not to be whittled down or away by explanations. It is the timeless aorist like εδοθη in Matthew 28:18 and "points back to a moment in eternity, and implies the pre-existence of the Messiah" (Plummer). The Messianic consciousness of Christ is here as clear as a bell. It is a moment of high fellowship. Note επιγινωσκε twice for "fully know." Note also βουλητα =wills, is willing. The Son retains the power and the will to reveal the Father to men.
