 Take my yoke upon you and learn of me  (αρατε τον ζυγον μου εφ'υμας κα μαθετε απ'εμου). The rabbis used yoke for school as many pupils find it now a yoke. The English word "school" is Greek for leisure (σχολη). But Jesus offers refreshment (αναπαυσιν) in his school and promises to make the burden light, for he is a meek and humble teacher. Humility was not a virtue among the ancients. It was ranked with servility. Jesus has made a virtue of this vice. He has glorified this attitude so that Paul urges it (Philippians 2:3), "in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself." In portions of Europe today people place yokes on the shoulders to make the burden easier to carry. Jesus promises that we shall find the yoke kindly and the burden lightened by his help. "Easy" is a poor translation of χρηστος. Moffatt puts it "kindly." That is the meaning in the Septuagint for persons. We have no adjective that quite carries the notion of kind and good. The yoke of Christ is useful, good, and kindly. Cf. Song of Solomon 1:10.
