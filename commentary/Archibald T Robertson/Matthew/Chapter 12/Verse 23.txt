 Is this the Son of David?  (μητ ουτος εστιν ο υιος Δαυειδ?). The form of the question expects the answer "no," but they put it so because of the Pharisaic hostility towards Jesus. The multitudes "were amazed" or "stood out of themselves" (εξισταντο), imperfect tense, vividly portraying the situation. They were almost beside themselves with excitement.
