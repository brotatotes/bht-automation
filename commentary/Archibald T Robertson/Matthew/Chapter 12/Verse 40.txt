 The whale  (του κητους). Sea-monster, huge fish. In Jonah 2:1 the LXX has κητε μεγαλω. "Three days and three nights" may simply mean three days in popular speech. Jesus rose "on the third day" (Matthew 16:21), not "on the fourth day." It is just a fuller form for "after three days" (Mark 8:31; Mark 10:34).
