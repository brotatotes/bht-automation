 Choke the word  (συνπνιγε τον λογον). We had απεπνιξαν (choked off) in Matthew 13:7. Here it is συνπνιγε (choke together), historical present and singular with both subjects lumped together. "Lust for money and care go together and between them spoil many an earnest religious nature" (Bruce), "thorns" indeed. The thorns flourish and the character sickens and dies, choked to death for lack of spiritual food, air, sunshine.
