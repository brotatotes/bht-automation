 I will utter  (ερευξομα). To cast forth like a river, to gurgle, to disgorge, the passion of a prophet. From Psalms 19:2; Psalms 78:2. The Psalmist claims to be able to utter "things hidden from the foundation of the world" and Matthew applies this language to the words of Jesus. Certain it is that the life and teaching of Jesus throw a flood of light on the purposes of God long kept hidden (κεκρυμμενα).
