 Walking upon the sea  (περιπατων επ την θαλασσαν). Another nature miracle. Some scholars actually explain it all away by urging that Jesus was only walking along the beach and not on the water, an impossible theory unless Matthew's account is legendary. Matthew uses the accusative (extension) with επ in verse Matthew 14:25 and the genitive (specifying case) in Matthew 14:26.
