 Put forward  (προβιβασθεισα). See Acts 19:33 for a similar verb (προβαλοντων), "pushing forward." Here (Acts) the Textus Receptus uses προβιβαζω. "It should require a good deal of 'educating' to bring a young girl to make such a grim request" (Bruce).Here  (ωδε). On the spot. Here and now.In a charger  (επ πινακ). Dish, plate, platter. Why the obsolete "charger"?
