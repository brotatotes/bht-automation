 Gain  (κερδηση) andprofit  (ζημιωθη). Both aorist subjunctives (one active, the other passive) and so punctiliar action, condition of third class, undetermined, but with prospect of determination.

As an exchange, accusative in apposition with τ. The soul has no market price, though the devil thinks so. "A man must give, surrender, his life, and nothing less to God; no ανταλλαγμα is possible" (McNeile). This word ανταλλαγμα occurs twice in the Wisdom of Sirach: "There is no exchange for a faithful friend" (6:15); "There is no exchange for a well-instructed soul" (26:14).
