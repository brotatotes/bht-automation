 Little faith  (ολιγοπιστιαν). A good translation. It was less than "a grain of mustard seed" (κοκκον σιναπεως). See Matthew 13:31 for this phrase. They had no miracle faith. Bruce holds "this mountain" to be the Mount of Transfiguration to which Jesus pointed. Probably so. But it is a parable. Our trouble is always with "this mountain" which confronts our path. Note the form μεταβα (μετα and βηθ).
