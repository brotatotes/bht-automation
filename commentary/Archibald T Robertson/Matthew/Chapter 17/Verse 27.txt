 Lest we cause them to stumble  (ινα μη σκανδαλισωμεν αυτους). He does not wish to create the impression that he and the disciples despise the temple and its worship. Aorist tense (punctiliar single act) here, though some MSS. have present subjunctive (linear). "A hook" (αγκιστρον). The only example in the N.T. of fishing with a hook. From an unused verb αγκιζω, to angle, and that from αγκος, a curve (so also αγκαλη the inner curve of the arm, Luke 2:38).First cometh up  (τον αναβαντα πρωτον ιχθυν). More correctly, "the first fish that cometh up."A shekel  (στατηρα). Greek stater = four drachmae, enough for two persons to pay the tax.For me and thee  (αντ εμου κα σου). Common use of αντ in commercial transactions, "in exchange for." Here we have a miracle of foreknowledge. Such instances have happened. Some try to get rid of the miracle by calling it a proverb or by saying that Jesus only meant for Peter to sell the fish and thus get the money, a species of nervous anxiety to relieve Christ and the Gospel of Matthew from the miraculous. "All the attempts have been in vain which were made by the older Rationalism to put a non-miraculous meaning into these words" (B. Weiss). It is not stated that Peter actually caught such a fish though that is the natural implication. Why provision is thus only made for Peter along with Jesus we do not know.
