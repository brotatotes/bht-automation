 In my name  (επ τω ονοματ μου). For "one such little child" (ανψ βελιεςερ ιν Χριστ) Luke (Luke 9:48) has "this little child" as a representative or symbol. "On the basis or ground of my name," "for my sake." Very much like εις ονομα in Matthew 10:41 which does not differ greatly from εν ονοματ (Acts 10:48).
