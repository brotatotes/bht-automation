 To Bethany  (εις Βηθανιαν). House of depression or misery, the Hebrew means. But the home of Martha and Mary and Lazarus there was a house of solace and comfort to Jesus during this week of destiny. Helodged there  (ηυλισθη εκε) whether at the Bethany home or out in the open air. It was a time of crisis for all.
