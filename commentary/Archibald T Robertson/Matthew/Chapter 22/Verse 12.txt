 Not having a wedding-garment  (μη εχων ενδυμα γαμου). Μη is in the Koine the usual negative with participles unless special emphasis on the negative is desired as in ουκ ενδεδυμενον. There is a subtle distinction between μη and ου like our subjective and objective notions. Some hold that the wedding-garment here is a portion of a lost parable separate from that of the Wedding Feast, but there is no evidence for that idea. Wunsche does report a parable by a rabbi of a king who set no time for his feast and the guests arrived, some properly dressed waiting at the door; others in their working clothes did not wait, but went off to work and, when the summons suddenly came, they had no time to dress properly and were made to stand and watch while the others partook of the feast.
