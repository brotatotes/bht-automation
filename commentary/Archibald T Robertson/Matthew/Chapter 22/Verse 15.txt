 Went  (πορευθεντες). So-called deponent passive and redundant use of the verb as in Matthew 9:13: "Go and learn."Took counsel  (συμβουλιον ελαβον). Like the Latin consilium capere as in Matthew 12:14.Ensnare in his talk  (παγιδευσωσιν εν λογω). From παγις, a snare or trap. Here only in the N.T. In the LXX (1 Kings 28:9; Ecclesiastes 9:12; Test. of Twelve Patriarchs, Joseph 7:1). Vivid picture of the effort to trip Jesus in his speech like a bird or wild beast.
