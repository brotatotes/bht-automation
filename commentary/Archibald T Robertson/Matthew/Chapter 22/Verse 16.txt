 Their disciples  (τους μαθητας αυτων). Students, pupils, of the Pharisees as in Mark 2:18. There were two Pharisaic theological seminaries in Jerusalem (Hillel, Shammai).The Herodians  (των Hερωιδιανων). Not members of Herod's family or Herod's soldiers, but partisans or followers of Herod. The form in -ιανος is a Latin termination like that in Χριστιανος (Acts 11:26). Mentioned also in Mark 3:6 combining with the Pharisees against Jesus.The person of men  (προσωπον ανθρωπων). Literally, face of men. Paying regard to appearance is the sin of partiality condemned by James (James 2:1; James 2:9) when προσωπολημψια, προσωπολημπτειν are used, in imitation of the Hebrew idiom. This suave flattery to Jesus implied "that Jesus was a reckless simpleton" (Bruce).
