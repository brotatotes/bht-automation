 Fill ye up  (πληρωσατε). The keenest irony in this command has been softened in some MSS. to the future indicative (πληρωσετε). "Fill up the measure of your fathers; crown their misdeeds by killing the prophet God has sent to you. Do at last what has long been in your hearts. The hour is come" (Bruce).
