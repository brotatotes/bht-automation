 Zachariah son of Barachiah  (Ζαχαριου υιου Βαραχιου). Broadus gives well the various alternatives in understanding and explaining the presence of "son of Barachiah" here which is not in Luke 11:51. The usual explanation is that the reference is to Zachariah the son of Jehoiada the priest who was slain in the court of the temple (2 Chronicles 24:20). How the words, "son of Barachiah," got into Matthew we do not know. A half-dozen possibilities can be suggested. In the case of Abel a reckoning for the shedding of his blood was foretold (Genesis 4:10) and the same thing was true of the slaying of Zachariah (2 Chronicles 24:22).
