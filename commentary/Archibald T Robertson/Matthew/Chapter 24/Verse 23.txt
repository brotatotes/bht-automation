 Lo, here is the Christ, or here  (ιδου ωδε ο Χριστος η ωδε). The false prophets (Matthew 24:11) create the trouble and now false Christs (ψευδο-Χριστο, verse Matthew 24:24) offer a way out of these troubles. The deluded victims raise the cries of "Lo, here," when these false Messiahs arise with their panaceas for public ills (political, religious, moral, and spiritual).
