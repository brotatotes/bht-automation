 See that ye be not troubled  (ορατε μη θροεισθε). Asyndeton here with these two imperatives as Mark 8:15 ορατε βλεπετε (Robertson, Grammar, p. 949). Look out for the wars and rumours of wars, but do not be scared out of your wits by them. Θροεω means to cry aloud, to scream, and in the passive to be terrified by an outcry. Paul uses this very verb (μηδε θροεισθα) in 2 Thessalonians 2:2 as a warning against excitement over false reports that he had predicted the immediate second coming of Christ.But the end is not yet  (αλλ' ουπω εστιν το τελος). It is curious how people overlook these words of Jesus and proceed to set dates for the immediate end. That happened during the Great War and it has happened since.
