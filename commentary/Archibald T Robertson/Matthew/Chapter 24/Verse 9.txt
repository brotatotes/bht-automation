For tribulation (θλιψιν see Matthew 13:21), a word common in the Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypse for the oppression (pressure) that the Christians received.For my name's sake  (δια το ονομα μου). The most glorious name in the world today, but soon to be a byword of shame (Acts 5:41). The disciples would count it an honour to be dishonoured for the Name's sake.
