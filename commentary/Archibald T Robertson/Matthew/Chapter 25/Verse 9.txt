 Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you  (μηποτε ου μη αρκεσε ημιν κα υμιν). There is an elliptical construction here that is not easy of explanation. Some MSS. Aleph A L Z have ουκ instead of ου μη. But even so μη ποτε has to be explained either by supplying an imperative like γινεσθω or by a verb of fearing like φοβουμεθα (this most likely). Either ουκ or ου μη would be proper with the futuristic subjunctive αρκεσε (Moulton, Prolegomena, p. 192; Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1161,1174). "We are afraid that there is no possibility of there being enough for us both." This is a denial of oil by the wise virgins because there was not enough for both. "It was necessary to show that the foolish virgins could not have the consequences of their folly averted at the last moment" (Plummer). It is a courteous reply, but it is decisive. The compound Greek negatives are very expressive, μηποτε--ου μη.
