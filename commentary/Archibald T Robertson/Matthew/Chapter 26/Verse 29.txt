 When I drink it new with you  (οταν αυτο πινω μεθ' υμων καιμον). This language rather implies that Jesus himself partook of the bread and the wine, though it is not distinctly stated. In the Messianic banquet it is not necessary to suppose that Jesus means the language literally, "the fruit of the vine." Deissmann (Bible Studies, pp. 109f.) gives an instance of γενημα used of the vine in a papyrus 230 B.C. The language here employed does not make it obligatory to employ wine rather than pure grape juice if one wishes the other.
