 Watch and pray  (γρηγορειτε κα προσευχεσθε). Jesus repeats the command of verse Matthew 26:38 with the addition of prayer and with the warning against the peril of temptation. He himself was feeling the worst of all temptations of his earthly life just then. He did not wish then to enter such temptation (πειρασμον, here in this sense, not mere trial). Thus we are to understand the prayer in Matthew 6:13 about leading (being led) into temptation. Their failure was due to weakness of the flesh as is often the case.Spirit  (πνευμα) here is the moral life (ιντελλεχτ, wιλλ, εμοτιονς) as opposed to the flesh (cf. Isaiah 31:3; Romans 7:25).Except I drink it  (εαν μη αυτο πιω). Condition of the third class undetermined, but with likelihood of determination, whereasif this cannot pass away  (ε ου δυνατα τουτο παρελθειν) is first-class condition, determined as fulfilled, assumed to be true. This delicate distinction accurately presents the real attitude of Jesus towards this subtle temptation.
