 Washed his hands  (απενιψατο τας χειρας). As a last resort since the hubbub (θορυβος) increased because of his vacillation. The verb απονιπτω means to wash off and the middle voice means that he washed off his hands for himself as a common symbol of cleanliness and added his pious claim with a slap at them.I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man  (orthis blood );see ye to it . (Αθωιος ειμ απο του αιματος του δικαιου τουτου or του αιματος τουτου as some manuscripts have it, υμεις οψεσθε.) The Jews used this symbol (Deuteronomy 21:6; Psalms 26:6; Psalms 73:13). Plummer doubts if Pilate said these words with a direct reference to his wife's message (Matthew 26:19), but I fail to see the ground for that scepticism. The so-called Gospel of Peter says that Pilate washed his hands because the Jews refused to do so.
