 His accusation  (την αιτιαν αυτου). The title (τιτλος, John 19:19) or placard of the crime (the inscription, ε επιγραφη) which was carried before the victim or hung around his neck as he walked to execution was now placed above (επ' ανω) the head of Jesus on the projecting piece (χρυξ ιμμυρυς). This inscription gave the name and home,Jesus of Nazareth , and the charge on which he was convicted,the King of the Jews  and the identification,This is . The four reports all give the charge and vary in the others. The inscription in full was: This is Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews. The three languages are mentioned only by John (John 19:20), Latin for law, Hebrew (Aramaic) for the Jews, Greek for everybody. The accusation (charge, cause, αιτια) correctly told the facts of the condemnation.
