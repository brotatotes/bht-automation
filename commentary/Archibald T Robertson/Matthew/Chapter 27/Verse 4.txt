 See thou to it  (συ οψη). Judas made a belated confession of his sin in betraying innocent blood to the Sanhedrin, but not to God, nor to Jesus. The Sanhedrin ignore the innocent or righteous blood (αιμα αθωιον or δικαιον) and tell Judas to look after his own guilt himself. They ignore also their own guilt in the matter. The use of συ οψη as a volitive future, an equivalent of the imperative, is commoner in Latin (tu videris) than in Greek, though the Koine shows it also. The sentiment is that of Cain (Grotius, Bruce).
