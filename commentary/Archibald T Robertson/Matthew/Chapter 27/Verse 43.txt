 Let him deliver him now  (ρυσασθω νυν). They add the word "now" to Matthew 27:21; Matthew 22:8. That is the point of the sneer at Christ's claim to be God's son thrown in his teeth again and at the willingness and power of God to help his "son." The verb θελω here may meanlove  as in the Septuagint (Psalms 18:20; Psalms 41:12) or "cares for" (Moffatt), "gin he cares ocht for him" (Braid Scots).
