 Into the treasury  (εις τον κορβαναν). Josephus (War II. 9,4) uses this very word for the sacred treasury. Korban is Aramaic for gift (δωρον) as is plain in Mark 7:11. The price of blood (blood-money) was pollution to the treasury (Deuteronomy 23:18). So they took the money out and used it for a secular purpose. The rabbis knew how to split hairs about Korban (Mark 7:1-23; Matthew 15:1-20), but they balk at this blood-money.
