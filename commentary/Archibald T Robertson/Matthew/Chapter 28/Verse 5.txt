 Unto the women  (ταις γυναιξιν). According to John, Mary Magdalene had left to go and tell Peter and John of the supposed grave robbery (John 20:1). But the other women remained and had the interview with the angel (or men, Luke) about the empty tomb and the Risen Christ.Jesus the Crucified  (Ιησουν τον εσταυρωμενον). Perfect passive participle, state of completion. This he will always be. So Paul will preach as essential to his gospel "and this one crucified" (κα τουτον εσταυρωμενον, 1 Corinthians 2:2).
