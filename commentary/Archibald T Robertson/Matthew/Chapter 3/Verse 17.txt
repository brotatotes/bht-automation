 A voice out of the heavens  (φωνη εκ των ουρανων). This was the voice of the Father to the Son whom he identifies as His Son, "my beloved Son." Thus each person of the Trinity is represented (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) at this formal entrance of Jesus upon his Messianic ministry. John heard the voice, of course, and saw the dove. It was a momentous occasion for John and for Jesus and for the whole world. The words are similar to Psalms 2:7 and the voice at the Transfiguration (Matthew 17:5). The good pleasure of the Father is expressed by the timeless aorist (ευδοκησα).
