 Dwelt in Capernaum  (Κατωικησεν εις Καφαρναουμ). He went first to Nazareth, his old home, but was rejected there (Luke 4:16-31). In Capernaum (probably the modern Τελλ Hυμ) Jesus was in a large town, one of the centres of Galilean political and commercial life, a fishing mart, where many Gentiles came. Here the message of the kingdom would have a better chance than in Jerusalem with its ecclesiastical prejudices or in Nazareth with its local jealousies. So Jesus "made his home" (κατωικησεν) here.
