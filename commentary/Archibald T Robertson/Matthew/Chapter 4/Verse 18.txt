 Casting a net into the sea  (βαλλαντας αμφιβληστρον εις την θαλασσαν). The word here for net is a casting-net (compare αμφιβαλλω in Mark 1:16, casting on both sides). The net was thrown over the shoulder and spread into a circle (αμφ). In Matthew 4:20 and Matthew 4:21 another word occurs for nets (δικτυα), a word used for nets of any kind. The large drag-net (σαγηνη) appears in Matthew 13:47.
