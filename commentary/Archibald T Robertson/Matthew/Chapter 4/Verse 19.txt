 Fishers of men  (αλεεις ανθρωπων). Andrew and Simon were fishers by trade. They had already become disciples of Jesus (John 1:35-42), but now they are called upon to leave their business and to follow Jesus in his travels and work. These two brothers promptly (ευθεως) accepted the call and challenge of Jesus.
