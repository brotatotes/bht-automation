 Went about in all Galilee  (περιηγεν εν ολη τη Γαλιλαια). Literally Jesus "was going around (imperfect) in all Galilee." This is the first of the three tours of Galilee made by Jesus. This time he took the four fishermen whom he had just called to personal service. The second time he took the twelve. On the third he sent the twelve on ahead by twos and followed after them. He was teaching and preaching the gospel of the kingdom in the synagogues chiefly and on the roads and in the streets where Gentiles could hear. Healing all manner of diseases and all manner of sickness  (θεραπευων πασαν νοσον κα πασαν μαλακιαν). The occasional sickness is called μαλακιαν, the chronic or serious disease νοσον.
