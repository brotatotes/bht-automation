 All these things will I give thee  (ταυτα σο παντα δωσω). The devil claims the rule of the world, not merely of Palestine or of the Roman Empire. "The kingdoms of the cosmos" (Matthew 4:8) were under his sway. This word for world brings out the orderly arrangement of the universe while η οικουμενη presents the inhabited earth. Jesus does not deny the grip of the devil on the world of men, but the condition (εαν and aorist subjunctive, second class undetermined with likelihood of determination), was spurned by Jesus. As Matthew has it Jesus is plainly to "fall down and worship me" (πεσων προκυνησηις μο), while Luke (Luke 4:7) puts it, "worship before me" (ενωπιον εμου), a less offensive demand, but one that really involved worship of the devil. The ambition of Jesus is thus appealed to at the price of recognition of the devil's primacy in the world. It was compromise that involved surrender of the Son of God to the world ruler of this darkness. "The temptation was threefold: to gain a temporal, not a spiritual, dominion; to gain it at once; and to gain it by an act of homage to the ruler of this world, which would make the self-constituted Messiah the vice-regent of the devil and not of God" (McNeile).
