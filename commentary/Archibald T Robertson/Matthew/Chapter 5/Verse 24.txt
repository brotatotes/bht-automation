 First be reconciled  (πρωτον διαλλαγηθ). Second aorist passive imperative. Get reconciled (ingressive aorist, take the initiative). Only example of this compound in the New Testament where usually καταλλασσω occurs. Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, p. 187, New Ed.) gives a papyrus example second century A.D. A prodigal son, Longinus, writes to his mother Nilus: "I beseech thee, mother, be reconciled (διαλαγητ) with me." The boy is a poor speller, but with a broken heart he uses the identical form that Jesus does. "The verb denotes mutual concession after mutual hostility, an idea absent from καταλλασσω" (Lightfoot). This because of δια (two, between two).
