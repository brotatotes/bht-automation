 A writing of divorcement  (αποστασιον), "a divorce certificate" (Moffatt), "a written notice of divorce" (Weymouth). The Greek is an abbreviation of βιβλιον αποστασιου (Malachi 19:7; Mark 10:4). Vulgate has here libellum repudii. The papyri use συγγραφη αποστασιου in commercial transactions as "a bond of release" (see Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary, etc.) The written notice (βιβλιον) was a protection to the wife against an angry whim of the husband who might send her away with no paper to show for it.
