 An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth  (οφθαλμον αντ οφθαλμου κα οδοντα αντ οδοντος). Note αντ with the notion of exchange or substitution. The quotation is from Exodus 21:24; Deuteronomy 19:21; Leviticus 24:20. Like divorce this jus talionis is a restriction upon unrestrained vengeance. "It limited revenge by fixing an exact compensation for an injury" (McNeile). A money payment is allowed in the Mishna. The law of retaliation exists in Arabia today.
