 Shall compel thee  (αγγαρευσε). The Vulgate has angariaverit. The word is of Persian origin and means public couriers or mounted messengers (αγγαρο) who were stationed by the King of Persia at fixed localities, with horses ready for use, to send royal messages from one to another. So if a man is passing such a post-station, an official may rush out and compel him to go back to another station to do an errand for the king. This was called impressment into service. This very thing was done to Simon of Cyrene who was thus compelled to carry the cross of Christ (Matthew 27:32, ηγγαρευσαν).
