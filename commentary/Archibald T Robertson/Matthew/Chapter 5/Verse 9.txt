 The peacemakers  (ο ειρηνοποιο). Not merely "peaceable men" (Wycliff) but "makkers up o' strife" (Braid Scots). It is hard enough to keep the peace. It is still more difficult to bring peace where it is not. "The perfect peacemaker is the Son of God (Ephesians 2:14)" (McNeile). Thus we shall be like our Elder Brother.
