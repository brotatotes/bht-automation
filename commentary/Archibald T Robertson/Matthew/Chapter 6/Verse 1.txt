 Take heed  (προσεχετε). The Greek idiom includes "mind" (νουν) which is often expressed in ancient Greek and once in the Septuagint (Job 7:17). In the New Testament the substantive νους is understood. It means to "hold the mind on a matter," take pains, take heed. "Righteousness" (δικαιοσυνην) is the correct text in this verse. Three specimens of the Pharisaic "righteousness" are given (alms, prayer, fasting).To be seen  (θεαθηνα). First aorist passive infinitive of purpose. Our word theatrical is this very word, spectacular performance.With your Father  (παρα τω πατρ υμων). Literally "beside your Father," standing by his side, as he looks at it.
