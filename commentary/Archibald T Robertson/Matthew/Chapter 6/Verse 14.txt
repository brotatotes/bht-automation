 Trespasses  (παραπτωματα). This is no part of the Model Prayer. The word "trespass" is literally "falling to one side," a lapse or deviation from truth or uprightness. The ancients sometimes used it of intentional falling or attack upon one's enemy, but "slip" or "fault" (Galatians 6:1) is the common New Testament idea. Παραβασις (Romans 5:14) is a positive violation, a transgression, conscious stepping aside or across.
