 A scribe  (εις γραμματευς). One (εις)="a," indefinite article. Already a disciple as shown by "another of the disciples" (ετερος των μαθητων) in Matthew 8:21. He calls Jesus "Teacher" (διδασκαλε), but he seems to be a "bumptious" brother full of self-confidence and self-complacency. "Even one of that most unimpressionable class, in spirit and tendency utterly opposed to the ways of Jesus" (Bruce). Yet Jesus deals gently with him.
