 That ye may know  (ινα ειδητε). Jesus accepts the challenge in the thoughts of the scribes and performs the miracle of healing the paralytic, who so far only had his sins forgiven, to prove his Messianic power on earth to forgive sins even as God does. The word εξουσια may mean either power or authority. He had both as a matter of fact. Note same word in Matthew 9:8.Then saith he to the sick of the palsy  (τοτε λεγε τω παραλυτικω). These words of course, were not spoken by Jesus. Curiously enough Matthew interjects them right in the midst of the sayings of Jesus in reply to the scorn of the scribes. Still more remarkable is the fact that Mark (Mark 2:10) has precisely the same words in the same place save that Matthew has added τοτε, of which he is fond, to what Mark already had. Mark, as we know, largely reports Peter's words and sees with Peter's eyes. Luke has the same idea in the same place without the vivid historical present λεγε (ειπεν τω παραλελυμενωι) with the participle in place of the adjective. This is one of the many proofs that both Matthew and Luke made use of Mark's Gospel each in his own way.Take up thy bed  (αρον σου την κλινην). Pack up at once (aorist active imperative) the rolled-up pallet.
