 If then thou countest me a partner  (ε ουν με εχεις κοινωνον). As I assume that you do, condition of the first class.Receive him as myself  (προσλαβου αυτον ως εμε). "Take him to thyself (indirect second aorist middle of προσλαμβανω as in Acts 18:26) as myself." Surpassing delicacy and consummate tact. These words sound the death-knell of human slavery wherever the spirit of Christ is allowed to have its way.

Paul wrote these words with wisdom and courage and sincerity.
