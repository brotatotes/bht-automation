 Write  (εγραψα). Epistolary aorist.With mine hand  (τη εμη χειρ). Instrumental case and a note of hand that can be collected. See 2 Thessalonians 3:17; 1 Corinthians 16:21; Colossians 4:18.I will repay it  (εγω αποτισω). Future active indicative of αποτινω (αποτιω) to pay back, to pay off. The more usual word was αποδωσω. This is Paul's promissory note. Deissmann (Light, etc., p. 331) notes how many of the papyri are concerning debts.That I say not  (ινα μη λεγω). Neat idiom as in 2 Corinthians 9:4, delicately reminding Philemon that Paul had led him also to Christ.Thou owest to me even thine own self besides  (κα σεαυτον μο προσοφειλεις). Old verb, only here in N.T., Paul using the verb οφειλω of verse Philemon 1:18 with προς added. He used every available argument to bring Philemon to see the higher ground of brotherhood in Christ about Onesimus.
