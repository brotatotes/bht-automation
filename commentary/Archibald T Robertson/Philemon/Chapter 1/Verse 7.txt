 I had  (εσχον). Ingressive second aorist active indicative of εχω, not ειχομην as the Textus Receptus has it. Paul refers to his joy when he first heard the good news about Philemon's activity (verse Philemon 1:5).The hearts  (τα σπλαγχνα). See Philippians 1:8 for this use of this word for the nobler viscera (heart, lungs, liver) and here for the emotional nature.Have been refreshed  (αναπεπαυτα). Perfect passive indicative of old compound verb αναπαυω as in Matthew 11:28, a relief and refreshment whether temporary (Mark 6:31) or eternal (Revelation 14:13).
