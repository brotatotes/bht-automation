 If this is the fruit of my work  (τουτο μο καρπος εργου). There is no ε (if) here in the Greek, but τουτο (this) seems to be resumptive and to repeat the conditional clause just before. If so, κα just after meansthen  and introduces the conclusion of the condition. Otherwise τουτο introduces the conclusion and κα meansand .I wot not  (ου γνωριζω). "I know not." It seems odd to preserve the old English word "wot" here. But it is not clear that γνωριζω (old causative verb from γινωσκω) means just to know. Elsewhere in the N.T., as in Luke 2:15; Romans 9:22, it means to make known, to declare. The papyri examples mean to make known. It makes perfectly good sense to take its usual meaning here, "I do not declare what I shall choose."
