 If  (ε). Paul uses four conditions in this verse, all of the first class, assuming the condition to be true.Comfort  (παρακλησις). Rather, "ground of appeal to you in Christ." See 1 Corinthians 1:10; Ephesians 4:1.Consolation  (παραμυθιον). Old word from παραμυθεομα, persuasive address, incentive.Of love  (αγαπης). Objective genitive, "in love" (undefined as in Philippians 2:1).Fellowship  (κοινωνια). Partnership in the Holy Spirit "whose first fruit is love" (Galatians 5:22).Any tender mercies  (τις σπλαγχνα). Common use of this word for the nobler ςισχερα and so for the higher emotions. But τις is masculine singular and σπλαγχνα is neuter plural. Lightfoot suggests an error of an early transcriber or even of the amanuensis in writing ε τις instead of ε τινα.
