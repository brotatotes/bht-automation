 Not as in my presence only  (μη ως εν τη παρουσια μονον). B and a few other MSS. omit ως. The negative μη goes with the imperative κατεργαζεσθε (work out), not with υπηκουσατε (obeyed) which would call for ουχ.Much more  (πολλω μαλλον). They are not to render eye-service only when Paul is there, but much more when he is away.Work out  (κατεργαζεσθε). Perfective use of κατα (down) in composition, work on to the finish. This exhortation assumes human free agency in the carrying on the work of one's salvation.With fear and trembling  (μετα φοβου κα τρομου). "Not slavish terror, but wholesome, serious caution" (Vincent). "A nervous and trembling anxiety to do right" (Lightfoot). Paul has no sympathy with a cold and dead orthodoxy or formalism that knows nothing of struggle and growth. He exhorts as if he were an Arminian in addressing men. He prays as if he were a Calvinist in addressing God and feels no inconsistency in the two attitudes. Paul makes no attempt to reconcile divine sovereignty and human free agency, but boldly proclaims both.
