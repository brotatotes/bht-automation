 As lights in the world  (ως φωστηρες εν κοσμω). As luminaries like the heavenly bodies. Christians are the light of the world (Matthew 5:14) as they reflect the light from Christ (John 1:4; John 8:12), but here the word is not φως (light), but φωστηρες (luminaries, stars). The place for light is the darkness where it is needed.Holding forth  (επεχοντες). Present active participle of επεχω. Probably not connected with the preceding metaphor in φωστηρες. The old meaning of the verb επεχω is to hold forth or to hold out (the word of life as here). The context seems to call for "holding fast." It occurs also with the sense of attending to (Acts 3:5).That I may have  (εμο). Ethical dative, "to me as a ground of boasting."
