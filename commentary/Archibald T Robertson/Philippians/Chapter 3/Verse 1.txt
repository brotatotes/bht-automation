 Finally  (το λοιπον). Accusative of general reference, literally, "as for the rest." So again in Philippians 4:8. It (or just λοιπον) is a common phrase towards the close of Paul's Epistles (2 Thessalonians 3:1; 2 Corinthians 13:11). In Ephesians 6:10 we have του λοιπου (genitive case). But Paul uses the idiom elsewhere also as in 1 Corinthians 7:29; 1 Thessalonians 4:1 before the close of the letter is in sight. It is wholly needless to understand Paul as about to finish and then suddenly changing his mind like some preachers who announce the end a half dozen times.To write the same things  (τα αυτα γραφειν). Present active articular infinitive, "the going on writing the same things." What things? He has just used χαιρετε (go on rejoicing) again and he will repeat it in Philippians 4:4. But in verse Philippians 3:2 he uses βλεπετε three times. At any rate Paul, as a true teacher, is not afraid of repetition.Irksome  (οκνηρον). Old adjective from οκνεω, to delay, to hesitate. It is not tiresome to me to repeat what is "safe" (ασφαλες) for you. Old adjective from α privative and σφαλλω, to totter, to reel. See Acts 21:34.
