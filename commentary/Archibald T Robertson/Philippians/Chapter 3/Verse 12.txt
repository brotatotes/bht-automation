 Not that  (ουχ οτ). To guard against a misunderstanding as in John 6:26; John 12:6; 2 Corinthians 1:24; Philippians 4:11; Philippians 4:17.I have already obtained  (ηδη ελαβον). Rather, "I did already obtain," constative second aorist active indicative of λαμβανω, summing up all his previous experiences as a single event.Or am already made perfect  (η ηδη τετελειωμα). Perfect passive indicative (state of completion) of τελειοω, old verb from τελειος and that from τελος (end). Paul pointedly denies that he has reached a spiritual impasse of non- development. Certainly he knew nothing of so-called sudden absolute perfection by any single experience. Paul has made great progress in Christlikeness, but the goal is still before him, not behind him.But I press on  (διωκω δε). He is not discouraged, but encouraged. He keeps up the chase (real idea in διωκω, as in 1 Corinthians 14:1; Romans 9:30; 1 Timothy 6:11).If so be that  (ε κα). "I follow after." The condition (third class, ει--καταλαβω, second aorist active subjunctive of καταλαμβανω) is really a sort of purpose clause or aim. There are plenty of examples in the Koine of the use of ε and the subjunctive as here (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1017), "if I also may lay hold of that for which (εφ' ω, purpose expressed by επ) I was laid hold of (κατελημφθην, first aorist passive of the same verb καταλαμβανω) by Christ Jesus." His conversion was the beginning, not the end of the chase.
