 By that same rule let us walk  (τω αυτω στοιχειν) Aleph A B do not have κανον (rule). Besides στοιχειν is the absolute present active infinitive which sometimes occurs instead of the principal verb as in Romans 12:15. Paul means simply this that, having come thus far, the thing to do is to go "in the same path" (τω αυτω) in which we have been travelling so far. A needed lesson for Christians weary with the monotony of routine in religious life and work.
