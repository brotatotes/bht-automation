Instrumental case, though the dative case as the object of λατρευω makes good sense also (worshipping the Spirit of God) or even the locative (worshipping in the Spirit of God).No  (ουκ). Actual condition rather than μη with the participle.In the flesh  (εν σαρκ). Technical term in Paul's controversy with the Judaizers (2 Corinthians 11:18; Galatians 6:13). External privileges beyond mere flesh.
