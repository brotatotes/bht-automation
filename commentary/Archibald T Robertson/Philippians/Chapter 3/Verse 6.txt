 As touching zeal  (κατα ζηλος). So the old MSS. treating ζηλος as neuter, not masculine. He was a zealot against Christianity, "persecuting the church" (διωκων την εκκλησιαν). He was the ringleader in the persecution from the death of Stephen till his own conversion (Acts 8:1-9).Found blameless  (γενομενος αμεμπτος). "Having become blameless" (Galatians 1:14). He knew and practised all the rules of the rabbis. A marvellous record, scoring a hundred in Judaism.
