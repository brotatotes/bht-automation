 Yea, verily, and  (αλλα μεν ουν γε κα). Five particles before Paul proceeds (yea, indeed, therefore, at least, even), showing the force and passion of his conviction. He repeats his affirmation with the present middle indicative (ηγουμα), "I still count all things loss for the excellency of the knowledge (το υπερεχον, the surpassingness, neuter articular participle of υπερεχω, Philippians 2:3) of Christ Jesus my Lord."Dung  (σκυβαλα). Late word of uncertain etymology, either connected with σκωρ (dung) or from ες κυνας βαλλω, to fling to the dogs and so refuse of any kind. It occurs in the papyri. Here only in the N.T.That I may gain Christ  (ινα Χριστον κερδησω). First aorist active subjunctive of κερδαω, Ionic form for κερδαινω with ινα in purpose clause. Paul was never satisfied with his knowledge of Christ and always craved more fellowship with him.
