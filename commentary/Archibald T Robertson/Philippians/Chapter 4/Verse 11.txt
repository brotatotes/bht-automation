 In respect of want  (καθ' υστερησιν). Late and rare word from υστερεω, to be behind or too late, only here and Mark 12:44 in N.T.I have learned  (εμαθον). Simply, "I did learn" (constative second aorist active indicative of μανθανω, to learn, looking at his long experience as a unit.In whatsoever state I am  (εν οις ειμ). "In what things (circumstances) I am."To be content  (αυταρκης εινα). Predicate nominative with the infinitive of the old adjective αυταρκης (from αυτος and αρκεω, to be self-sufficient), self-sufficing. Favourite word with the Stoics, only here in N.T., though αυταρκεια occurs in 2 Corinthians 9:8; 1 Timothy 6:6. Paul is contented with his lot and he learned that lesson long ago. Socrates said as to who is wealthiest: "He that is content with least, for αυταρκεια is nature's wealth."
