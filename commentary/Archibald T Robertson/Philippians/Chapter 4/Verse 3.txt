 True yokefellow  (γνησιε συνζυγε). All sorts of suggestions have been made here, one that it was Lydia who is termed Paul's wife by the word συνζυγε. Unfortunately for that view γνησιε is masculine vocative singular. Some have suggested it as a proper name though it is not found in the inscriptions, but the word does occur as an appellative in one. Lightfoot even proposes Epaphroditus, the bearer of the Epistle, certainly a curious turn to take to address him. After all it matters little that we do not know who the peacemaker was.Help these women  (συνλαμβανου αυταις). Present middle imperative of συνλαμβανω, to seize (Matthew 26:55), to conceive (Luke 1:24), then to take hold together with one (associative instrumental case), to help as here (Luke 5:7). "Take hold with them."They laboured with me  (συνηθλησαν μο). First aorist active indicative of συναθλεω (for which see Philippians 1:27) with associative instrumental case (μο).With Clement also  (μετα κα Κλημεντος). There is no evidence that he was Clement of Rome as the name is common.In the book of life  (εν βιβλω ζωης). The only instance of this expression in the N.T. outside of the Apocalypse (Philippians 3:5; Philippians 13:8; Philippians 17:8, etc.). Hence real Christians in spite of their bickerings.
