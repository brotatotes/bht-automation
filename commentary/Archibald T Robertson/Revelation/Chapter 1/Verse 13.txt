 One like unto a son of man  (ομοιον υιον ανθρωπου). Note accusative here with ομοιον (object of ειδον) as in Revelation 14:14 and not the associative-instrumental as is usual (Revelation 1:15; Revelation 4:3; Revelation 4:6). Charles holds that ομοιον here has the sense of ως (as) and compares Revelation 4:6; Revelation 22:1 for proof. The absence of the article here shows also (Charles) that the idea is not "like the Son of man" for Christ is the Son of man. He is like "a son of man," but not a man.Clothed  (ενδεδυμενον). Perfect passive participle of ενδυω, accusative case agreeing with ομοιον.A garment down to the foot  (ποδηρη). Old adjective ποδηρης (from πους, foot, and αιρω), here only in N.T., accusative singular retained with the passive participle as often with verbs of clothing. Supply χιτωνα or εσθητα (garment).Girt about  (περιεζωσμενον). Perfect passive participle of περιζωννυμ, accusative singular agreeing with ομοιον.At the breasts  (προς τοις μαστοις). Old word for breasts of a woman (Luke 11:27; Luke 23:29) and nipples of a man, as here. High girding like this was a mark of dignity as of the high priest (Josephus, Ant. III. 7. 2). For προς with the locative see Mark 5:11.With a golden girdle  (ζωνην χρυσαν). Accusative case again retained with the passive participle (verb of clothing). Note also χρυσαν (vernacular Koine) rather than the old form, χρυσην.
