 Behold, he cometh with the clouds  (ιδου ερχετα μετα των νεφελων). Futuristic present middle indicative of ερχομα, a reminiscence of Daniel 7:13 (Theodotion). "It becomes a common eschatological refrain" (Beckwith) as in Mark 13:26; Mark 14:62; Matthew 24:30; Matthew 26:64; Luke 21:27. Compare the manifestation of God in the clouds at Sinai, in the cloudy pillar, the Shekinah, at the transfiguration" (Vincent).Shall see  (οψετα). Future middle of οραω, a reminiscence of Zechariah 12:10 according to the text of Theodotion (Aquila and Symmachus) rather than the LXX and like that of Matthew 24:30 (similar combination of Daniel and Zechariah) and Revelation 26:64. This picture of the victorious Christ in his return occurs also in Revelation 14:14; Revelation 14:18-20; Revelation 19:11-21; Revelation 20:7-10.And they which  (κα οιτινες). "And the very ones who," Romans and Jews, all who shared in this act.Pierced  (εξεκεντησαν). First aorist active indicative of εκκεντεω, late compound (Aristotle, Polybius, LXX), from εκ and κεντεω (to stab, to pierce), in N.T., only here and John 19:37, in both cases from Zechariah 12:10, but not the LXX text (apparently proof that John used the original Hebrew or the translation of Theodotion and Aquila).Shall mourn  (κοψοντα). Future middle (direct) of κοπτω, old verb, to cut, "they shall cut themselves," as was common for mourners (Matthew 11:17; Luke 8:52; Luke 23:27). From Zechariah 12:12. See also Revelation 18:9.Tribes  (φυλα). Not just the Jewish tribes, but the spiritual Israel of Jews and Gentiles as in Revelation 7:4-8. No nation had then accepted Christ as Lord and Saviour, nor has any yet done so.
