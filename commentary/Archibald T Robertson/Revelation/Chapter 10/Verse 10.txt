 I took--and ate it up  (ελαβον--κα κατεφαγον αυτο). Second aorist active indicatives of the same verbs to show John's prompt obedience to the command. The order of the results is here changed to the actual experience (sweet in the mouth, bitter in the belly). The simplex verb εφαγον (I ate) is now used, not the compound κατεφαγον (I ate up).
