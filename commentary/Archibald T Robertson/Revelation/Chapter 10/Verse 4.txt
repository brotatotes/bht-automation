 I was about to write  (ημελλον γραφειν). Imperfect active of μελλω (double augment as in John 4:47; John 12:33; John 18:32) and the present (inchoative) active infinitive of γραφω, "I was on the point of beginning to write," as commanded in Revelation 1:11; Revelation 1:19.Seal up  (σφραγισον). Aorist active imperative of σφραγιζω, tense of urgency, "seal up at once."And write them not  (κα μη αυτα γραψηις). Prohibition with μη and the ingressive aorist active subjunctive of γραφω, "Do not begin to write." It is idle to conjecture what was in the utterances. Compare Paul's silence in 2 Corinthians 12:4.
