 Sware  (ωμοσεν). First aorist indicative of ομνυω to swear.By him that liveth  (εν τω ζωντ). This use of εν after ομνυω instead of the usual accusative (James 5:12) is like the Hebrew (Matthew 5:34; Matthew 5:36). "The living one for ages of ages" is a common phrase in the Apocalypse for God as eternally existing (Revelation 1:18; Revelation 4:9; Revelation 4:10; Revelation 15:7). This oath proves that this angel is not Christ.Who created  (ος εκτισεν). First aorist active indicative of κτιζω, a reference to God's creative activity as seen in Genesis 1:1; Exodus 20:11; Isaiah 37:16; Isaiah 42:5; Psalms 33:6; Psalms 145:6, etc.That there shall be time no longer  (οτ χρονος ουκετ εστα). Future indicative indirect discourse with οτ. But this does not mean that χρονος (time), Einstein's "fourth dimension" (added to length, breadth, height), will cease to exist, but only that there will be no more delay in the fulfillment of the seventh trumpet (verse Revelation 10:7), in answer to the question, "How long?" (Revelation 6:10).
