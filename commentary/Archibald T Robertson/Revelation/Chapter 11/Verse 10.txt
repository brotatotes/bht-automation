 They that dwell upon the earth  (ο κατοικουντες επ της γης). Present active articular participle of κατοικεω, "an Apocalyptic formula" (Swete) for the non-Christian world (Revelation 3:10; Revelation 6:10; Revelation 8:13; Revelation 13:8; Revelation 13:12; Revelation 13:14; Revelation 17:8).Rejoice  (χαιρουσιν). Present active indicative of χαιρω.Over them  (επ' αυτοις). Locative (or dative) case with επ as in Revelation 10:11.Make merry  (ευφραινοντα). Present middle indicative of ευφραινω, old verb (ευ, φρην, jolly mind), as in Luke 15:32; Revelation 12:12; Revelation 18:20. Jubilant jollification over the cessation of the activity of the two prophets.They shall send gifts to one another  (δωρα πεμψουσιν αλληλοις). Future active of πεμπω with dative αλληλοις. Just as we see it done in Esther 9:19; Esther 9:22; Nehemiah 8:10; Nehemiah 8:12.Tormented  (εβασανισαν). First aorist active indicative of βασανιζω, for which see Revelation 9:5. This is the reason (οτ) of the fiendish glee of Jew and Gentile, who no longer will have to endure the prophecies (Revelation 11:3) and dread miracles (Revelation 11:5) of these two prophets. "Such a sense of relief is perhaps not seldom felt today by bad men when a preacher of righteousness or a signal example of goodness is removed" (Swete).
