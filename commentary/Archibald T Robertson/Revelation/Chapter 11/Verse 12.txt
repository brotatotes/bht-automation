 Saying  (λεγουσης). Present active predicate participle of λεγω, feminine genitive agreeing with φωνης, though some MSS. have the accusative φωνην λεγουσαν, either construction being proper after ηκουσαν (they heard). There is a little evidence for ηκουσα like Revelation 12:10 (24 times in the book). Cf. John 5:28.Come up hither  (αναβατε ωδε). Second aorist active imperative of αναβαινω. The ascension of these two witnesses is in full view of their enemies, not just in the presence of a few friends as with Christ (Acts 1:9).They went up  (ανεβησαν). Second aorist active indicative of αναβαινω.In the cloud  (εν τη νεφελη). As Jesus did (Acts 1:9) and like Elijah (2 Kings 2:11). Their triumph is openly celebrated before their enemies and is like the rapture described by Paul in 1 Thessalonians 4:17.
