 There followed  (εγενοντο). "There came to pass." There was silence in heaven upon the opening of the seventh seal (Revelation 8:1), but here "great voices." Perhaps the great voices are the ζωα of Revelation 4:6; Revelation 5:8.Saying  (λεγοντες). Construction according to sense; λεγοντες, masculine participle (not λεγουσα), though φωνα, feminine. John understood what was said.Is become  (εγενετο). "Did become," prophetic use of the aorist participle, already a fact. See εγενετο in Luke 19:9.The kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ  (του κυριου ημων κα του Χριστου αυτου). Repeat η βασιλεια from the preceding. God the Father is meant here by κυριου (Lord), as αυτου (his) shows. This is the certain and glorious outcome of the age-long struggle against Satan, who wields the kingdom of the world which he offered to Christ on the mountain for one act of worship. But Jesus scorned partnership with Satan in the rule of the world, and chose war, war up to the hilt and to the end. Now the climax has come with Christ as Conqueror of the kingdom of this world for his Father. This is the crowning lesson of the Apocalypse.He shall reign  (βασιλευσε). Future active of βασιλευω. God shall reign, but the rule of God and of Christ is one as the kingdom is one (1 Corinthians 15:27). Jesus is the Lord's Anointed (Luke 2:26; Luke 9:20).
