 I will give  (δωσω). Future active of διδωμ. The speaker may be God (Beckwith) or Christ (Swete) as in Revelation 2:13; Revelation 21:6 or his angel representative (Revelation 22:7; Revelation 22:12). The idiom that follows is Hebraic instead of either the infinitive after διδωμ as in Revelation 2:7; Revelation 3:21; Revelation 6:4; Revelation 7:2; Revelation 13:7; Revelation 13:15; Revelation 16:8 or ινα with the subjunctive (Revelation 9:5; Revelation 19:8) we have κα προφητευσουσιν (and they shall prophesy).Unto my two witnesses  (τοις δυσιν μαρτυσιν μου). Dative case after δωσω. The article seems to point to two well-known characters, like Elijah, Elisha, but there is no possible way to determine who they are. All sorts of identifications have been attempted.Clothed  (περιβλημενους). Perfect passive participle of περιβαλλω as often before (Revelation 7:9; Revelation 7:13; Revelation 10:1, etc.). But Aleph A P Q here read the accusative plural in -ους, while C has the nominative in -ο. Charles suggests a mere slip for the nominative, but Hort suggests a primitive error in early MSS. for the dative περιβεβλεμενοις agreeing with μαρτυσιν.In sackcloth  (σακκους). Accusative retained with this passive verb as in Revelation 7:9; Revelation 7:13. See Revelation 6:12 for σακκος and also Matthew 3:4. The dress suited the message (Matthew 11:21).
