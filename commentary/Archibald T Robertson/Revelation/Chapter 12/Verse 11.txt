 They overcame him  (αυτο ενικησαν). First aorist active indicative of νικαω, the verb used by Jesus of his own victory (John 16:33) and about him (Revelation 3:21; Revelation 5:5). "The victory of the martyrs marks the failure of Satan's endeavours" (Swete).Because of the blood of the Lamb  (δια το αιμα του αρνιου). As in Revelation 1:5; Revelation 5:6; Revelation 5:9; Revelation 7:14. The blood of Christ is here presented by δια as the ground for the victory and not the means, as by εν in Revelation 1:5; Revelation 5:9. Both ideas are true, but δια with the accusative gives only the reason. The blood of Christ does cleanse us from sin (John 1:29; 1 John 1:7). Christ conquered Satan, and so makes our victory possible (Luke 11:21; Hebrews 2:18). "Thus the Lamb is the true συνηγορος (like Michael) of the New Israel, its παρακλητος προς τον πατερα (1 John 2:1)" (Swete).Because of the Word of their testimony  (δια τον λογον της μαρτυριας αυτων). The same use of δια, "because of their testimony to Jesus" as in John's own case in Revelation 1:9. These martyrs have been true to their part.They loved not their life even unto death  (ουκ ηγαπησαν τεν ψυχην αυτων αχρ θανατου). First aorist active indicative of αγαπαω. They did resist "unto blood" (μεχρις αιματος Hebrews 12:4) and did not put their own lives before loyalty to Christ. There is a direct reference to the words of Jesus in John 12:25 as illustrated also in Mark 8:35; Matthew 10:39; Matthew 16:25; Luke 9:24; Luke 17:33. Paul's own example is pertinent (Acts 21:13; Philippians 1:20). Jesus himself had been "obedient unto death" (Philippians 2:8). These martyrs seem to be still alive on earth, but their heroism is proleptically pictured.
