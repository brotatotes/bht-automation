 Therefore  (δια τουτο). "For this reason" as in Revelation 7:15; Revelation 18:8 (15 times in John's Gospel, Charles notes). It points back to verse Revelation 12:10.Rejoice  (ευφραινεσθε). Present middle imperative of ευφραινω as in Revelation 11:10; Revelation 18:20.O heavens  (ο ουρανο). Plural here alone in the Apocalypse, though common elsewhere in the N.T. Satan is no longer in the heavens.They that dwell therein  (ο εν αυτοις σκηνουντες). Present active articular participle of σκηνοω (see Revelation 7:15; Revelation 13:6) to dwell (tabernacle) as of Christ in John 1:14 and of God in Revelation 21:3. The inhabitants of heaven (angels and saints) have cause to rejoice, and earth reason to mourn.Woe for the earth and for the sea  (ουα την γην κα την θαλασσαν). The accusative after ουα as in Revelation 8:13, but nominative in Revelation 18:10; Revelation 18:16; Revelation 18:19 in place of the usual dative (Matthew 11:21; Matthew 18:7, etc.).Is gone down  (κατεβη). Second aorist (effective) active indicative of καταβαινω, "did go down."But a short time  (ολιγον καιρον). Accusative of extent of time, "a little time." The devil's departure from his warfare in the heavens reveals (ειδως, knowing, perfect active participle) to him that his time for doing harm to men is limited, and hence his great wrath (θυμον, boiling rage).
