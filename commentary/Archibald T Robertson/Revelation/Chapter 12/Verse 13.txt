 He persecuted  (εδιωξεν). First aorist active participle of διωκω, to pursue, to chase, hostile pursuit here as in Matthew 5:10; Matthew 10:23, etc. John now, after the "voice" in Revelation 12:10-13, returns to the narrative in verse Revelation 12:9. The child was caught away in verse Revelation 12:5, and now the woman (the true Israel on earth) is given deadly persecution. Perhaps events since A.D. 64 (burning of Rome by Nero) amply illustrated this vision, and they still do so.Which  (ητις). "Which very one."
