 Waxed wroth  (ωργισθη). First aorist (ingressive) passive indicative of οργιζομα, "became angry."With the woman  (επ τη γυναικ). "At the woman," "because of the woman."Went away  (απηλθεν). "Went off" in his rage to make war with the scattered followers of the Lamb not in the wilderness, perhaps an allusion to Genesis 3:15. The devil carries on relentless war with all those "which keep the commandments of God and hold the testimony of Jesus" (των τηρουντων τας εντολας του θεου κα εχοντων την μαρτυριαν Ιησου). These two marks excite the wrath of the devil then and always. Cf. Revelation 1:9; Revelation 6:9; Revelation 14:12; Revelation 19:10; Revelation 20:4.
