 Was cast down  (εβληθη). Effective first aorist passive indicative of βαλλω, cast down for good and all, a glorious consummation. This vision of final victory over Satan is given by Jesus in Luke 10:18; John 12:31. It has not come yet, but it is coming, and the hope of it should be a spur to missionary activity and zeal. The word megas (great) occurs here with δρακων as in Revelation 12:3, and the whole picture is repeated in Revelation 20:2. The dragon in both places is identified with the old serpent (Genesis 3:1) and called αρχαιος (from αρχη, beginning), as Jesus said that the devil was a murderer "from the beginning" (John 8:44). Both διαβολος (slanderer) and Satan (Σατανας) are common in N.T. for this great dragon and old serpent, the chief enemy of mankind. See on Matthew 4:1; Revelation 2:10 for διαβολος and Luke 10:18 for Σατανας.The deceiver of the whole world  (ο πλανων την οικουμενην ολην). This is his aim and his occupation, pictured here by the nominative articular present active participle of πλαναω, to lead astray. For "the inhabited world" see Luke 2:1; Revelation 3:10; Revelation 16:14. Satan can almost "lead astray" the very elect of God (Matthew 24:24), so artful is he in his beguilings as he teaches us how to deceive ourselves (1 John 1:8).He was cast down to the earth  (εβληθη εις την γην). Effective aorist repeated from the beginning of the verse. "The earth was no new sphere of Satan's working" (Swete).Were cast down  (εβληθησαν). Triple use of the same verb applied to Satan's minions. The expulsion is complete.
