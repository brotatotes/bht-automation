 Another beast  (αλλο θηριον). Like the first beast (verse Revelation 13:1), not a ετερον θηριον (a different beast).Out of the earth  (εκ της γης). Not "out of the sea" as the first (verse Revelation 13:1), perhaps locating him in Asia Minor without world-wide scope, but plainly the agent of the first beast and so of the dragon.He had  (ειχεν). Imperfect active of εχω. Only two horns (not ten like the first, verse Revelation 13:1).Like unto a lamb  (ομοια αρνιω). Usual construction. Only the two horns of a young lamb and without the ferocity of the other beast, but "he spake as a dragon" (ελαλε ως δρακων). Gunkel and Charles confess their inability to make anything out of this item. But Swete thinks that he had the roar of a dragon with all the looks of a lamb (weakness and innocence). Cf. the wolves in sheep's clothing (Matthew 7:15).
