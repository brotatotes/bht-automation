 And he deceiveth  (κα πλανα). Present active (dramatic) indicative of πλαναω, the very thing that Jesus had said would happen (Matthew 24:24, "So as to lead astray" ωστε πλανασθα, the word used here, if possible the very elect). It is a constant cause for wonder, the gullibility of the public at the hands of new charlatans who continually bob up with their pipe-dreams.That they should make an image to the beast  (ποιησα εικονα τω θηριω). Indirect command (this first aorist active infinitive of ποιεω) after λεγων as in Acts 21:21, not indirect assertion. This "image" (εικων, for which word see Matthew 22:20; Colossians 1:15) of the emperor could be his head upon a coin (Mark 12:16), an imago painted or woven upon a standard, a bust in metal or stone, a statue, anything that people could be asked to bow down before and worship. This test the priests in the provinces pressed as it was done in Rome itself. The phrase "the image of the beast," occurs ten times in this book (Revelation 13:14; Revelation 13:15 ter; Revelation 14:9; Revelation 14:11; Revelation 15:2; Revelation 16:2; Revelation 19:20; Revelation 20:4). Emperor-worship is the issue and that involves worship of the devil.The stroke of the sword  (την πληγην της μαχαιρης). This language can refer to the death of Nero by his own sword.And lived  (κα εζησεν). "And he came to life" (ingressive first aorist active indicative of ζαω). Perhaps a reference to Domitian as a second Nero in his persecution of Christians.
