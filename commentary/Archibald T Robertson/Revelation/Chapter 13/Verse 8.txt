 Shall worship him  (προσκυνησουσιν αυτον). Future active of προσκυνεω with the accusative here as some MSS. in Revelation 13:4 (το θηριον), both constructions in this book.Whose  (ου--αυτου). Redundant use of genitive αυτου (his) with ου (whose) as common in this book, and singular instead of plural ων with antecedent παντες (all, plural), thus calling attention to the responsibility of the individual in emperor-worship.Hath not been written  (ου γεγραπτα). Perfect passive indicative of γραφω, permanent state, stands written.In the book of life of the Lamb  (εν τω βιβλιω της ζωης του αρνιου). See Revelation 3:5 for this phrase and the O.T. references. It occurs again in Revelation 17:8; Revelation 20:12; Revelation 20:15; Revelation 21:27. "Here and in Revelation 21:27, the Divine Register is represented as belonging to 'the Lamb that was slain'" (Swete).That hath been slain from the foundation of the world  (του εσφαγμενου (for which see Revelation 5:6) απο καταβολης κοσμου). For the phrase απο καταβολης κοσμου (not in the LXX) there are six other N.T. uses (Matthew 13:35 without κοσμου; Revelation 25:34; Luke 11:50; Hebrews 4:3; Hebrews 9:26; Revelation 17:8), and for προ καταβολης κοσμου three (John 17:24; Ephesians 1:4; 1 Peter 1:20). It is doubtful here whether it is to be taken with του εσφαγμενου (cf. 1 Peter 1:20) or with γεγραπτα as in Revelation 17:8. Either makes sense, and here the most natural use is with εσφαγμενου. At any rate the death of Christ lies in the purpose of God, as in John 3:16.
