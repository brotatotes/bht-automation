 He also shall drink  (κα αυτος πιετα). Future middle of πινω. Certainty for him as for Babylon and her paramours (Revelation 16:17).Of the wine of the wrath of God  (εκ του οινου του θυμου του θεου). Note εκ (partitive) after πιετα. In Revelation 16:19; Revelation 19:15 we have both θυμου and οργης (wrath of the anger of God). The white heat of God's anger, held back through the ages, will be turned loose.Prepared unmixed  (του κεκερασμενου ακρατου). A bold and powerful oxymoron, "the mixed unmixed." Ακρατος is an old adjective (alpha privative and κεραννυμ to mix) used of wine unmixed with water (usually so mixed), here only in N.T. So it is strong wine mixed (perfect passive participle of κεραννυμ) with spices to make it still stronger (cf. Psalms 75:9).In the cup of his anger  (εν τω ποτηριω της οργης αυτου). Both θυμος (vehement fury) and οργη (settled indignation).He shall be tormented  (βασανισθησετα). Future passive of βασανιζω. See Revelation 9:5; Revelation 11:10.With fire and brimstone  (εν πυρ κα θειω). See Revelation 9:17 for fire and brimstone and also Revelation 19:20; Revelation 20:10; Revelation 21:8. The imagery is already in Genesis 19:24; Isaiah 30:33; Ezekiel 38:22.In the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb  (ενωπιον αγγελων αγιων κα ενωπιον του αρνιου). This holy environment adds to the punishment.
