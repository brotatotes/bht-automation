 As a voice of many waters  (ως φωνην υδατων πολλων). For which see Revelation 1:15.Of a great thunder  (βροντης μεγαλης). For which see Revelation 6:1; Revelation 19:6. For this voice out of heaven see Revelation 10:4; Revelation 14:15; Revelation 18:4 and note accusative with ηκουσα.As the voice of harpers harping with their harps  (ως κιθαρωιδων κιθαριζοντων εν ταις κιθαραις αυτων). Triple use of κιθαρα (Revelation 5:8), κιθαρωιδων (Revelation 18:22), κιθαριζοντων (old verb κιθαριζω, in N.T. only here and 1 Corinthians 14:7). Wonderful melody in this chorus by the angels, not by the 144,000.
