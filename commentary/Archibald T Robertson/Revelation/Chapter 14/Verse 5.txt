 Was found no lie  (ουχ ευρεθη ψευδος). First aorist passive indicative of ευρισκω. In 1 Peter 2:23 this passage (Isaiah 53:9) is quoted with δολος (deceit, guile) instead of ψευδος (lie), but the difference is not great.Without blemish  (αμωμο). Alpha privative and μωμος (blemish, spot). As Christ the Paschal Lamb is (1 Peter 1:19; Hebrews 9:14), so the followers of the Lamb are to be in the end (Philippians 2:15).
