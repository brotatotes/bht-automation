 Another sign in heaven  (αλλο σημειον εν τω ουρανω). Looking back to Revelation 12:1; Revelation 12:3, after the series intervening. The Seven Bowls are parallel with the Seven Seals (ch. Revelation 15:6) and the Seven Trumpets (chapters Revelation 15:8-11), but there is an even closer connection with chapters Revelation 15:12-14, "the drama of the long conflict between the church and the world" (Swete).Great and marvellous  (μεγα κα θαυμαστον). Θαυμαστος is an old verbal adjective (from θαυμαζω, to wonder) and is already in Matthew 21:42. The wonder extends to the end of this vision or sign (Revelation 16:21).Seven angels  (αγγελους επτα). Accusative case in apposition with σημειον after ειδον. Cf. Revelation 8:2.Which are the last  (τας εσχατας). "Seven plagues the last." As in Revelation 21:9, "the final cycle of such visitations" (Swete).Is finished  (ετελεσθη). Proleptic prophetic first aorist passive indicative of τελεω as in Revelation 10:7. The number seven seems particularly appropriate here for finality and completeness.
