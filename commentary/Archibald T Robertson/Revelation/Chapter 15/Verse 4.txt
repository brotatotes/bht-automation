 Who shall not fear?  (τις ου μη φοβηθηι;). Rhetorical question with ου μη (double negative) and first aorist passive subjunctive of φοβεομα future passive in Jeremiah 10:7).And glorify  (κα δοξασε). Change here to the future indicative instead of the aorist subjunctive, as often. Cf. Psalms 86:9.Thou only art holy  (μονος οσιος). Both predicate adjectives, "Thou art alone holy." God alone is perfectly holy (Revelation 16:5).Shall come  (ηξουσιν). Future active of ηκω.And worship  (κα προσκυνησουσιν). Future active of προσκυνεω. Both from Psalms 86:9.Have been made manifest  (εφανερωθησαν). Prophetic first aorist passive indicative of φανεροω. This martyr's song has the ring of great poetry.
