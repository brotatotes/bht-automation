 The temple of the tabernacle of the testimony  (ο ναος της σκηνης του μαρτυριου). Charles calls this "strange" language. Probably the tabernacle or tent of witness (Numbers 9:15; Numbers 17:7) is in mind and the tent of meeting (Exodus 27:21 rather than the temple in Jerusalem.Was opened  (ηνοιγη). Second aorist passive indicative of ανοιγω as in Revelation 11:19. For ναος see Revelation 3:12; Revelation 7:15; Revelation 14:15; Revelation 14:17; Revelation 16:1; Revelation 16:17.
