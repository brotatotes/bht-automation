 They blasphemed  (εβλασφημησαν)and they repented not  (κα ου μετενοησαν). Precisely as in verse Revelation 16:9, which see. Not just because of the supernatural darkness, but also "because of their pains" (εκ των πονων αυτων, plural here and same use of εκ) and their sores (κα εκ των ελκων αυτων, as in verse Revelation 16:2, only plural, and same use of εκ).Of their works  (εκ των εργων αυτων). "Out of their deeds," and addition to verse Revelation 16:9.The God of heaven  (τον θεον του ουρανου). As in Daniel 2:44. Like the pride of Nebuchadrezzar against Jehovah.
