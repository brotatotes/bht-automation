 Spirits of devils  (πνευματα δαιμονιων). "Spirits of demons." Explanation of the simile ως βατραχο. See 1 Timothy 4:1 about "deceiving spirits and teachings of demons."Working signs  (ποιουντα σημεια). "Doing signs" (present active participle of ποιεω). The Egyptian magicians wrought "signs" (tricks), as did Simon Magus and later Apollonius of Tyana. Houdini claimed that he could reproduce every trick of the spiritualistic mediums.Which go forth  (α εκπορευετα). Singular verb with neuter plural (collective) subject.Unto the kings  (επ τους βασιλεις). The three evil spirits (dragon and the two beasts) spur on the kings of the whole world to a real world war.

Second aorist active infinitive of συναγω, to express purpose (that of the unclean spirits).Unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty  (εις τον πολεμον της ημερας της μεγαλης του θεου του παντοκρατορος). Some take this to be war between nations, like Mark 13:8, but it is more likely war against God (Psalms 2:2) and probably the battle pictured in Revelation 17:14; Revelation 19:19. Cf. 2 Peter 3:12, "the day of God," his reckoning with the nations. See Joel 2:11; Joel 3:4. Paul uses "that day" for the day of the Lord Jesus (the Parousia) as in 1 Thessalonians 5:2; 2 Thessalonians 1:10; 2 Thessalonians 2:2; 1 Corinthians 1:8; 2 Corinthians 1:14; Philippians 1:6; Philippians 2:16; 2 Timothy 1:12; 2 Timothy 1:18; 2 Timothy 4:8.
