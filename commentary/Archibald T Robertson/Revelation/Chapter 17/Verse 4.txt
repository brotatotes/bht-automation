 Was arrayed  (ην περιβεβλημενη). Periphrastic past perfect indicative of περιβαλλω, to fling round one.In purple and scarlet  (πορφυρουν κα κοκκινον). Accusative retained after this passive verb of clothing, as so often. Πορφυρους is old adjective for purple (from πορφυρα), in N.T. only here and John 19:2; John 19:5. See preceding verse for κοκκινος.Decked  (κεχρυσωμενη). Perfect passive participle of χρυσοω, old verb, to gild, to adorn with gold, here alone in N.T.With gold and precious stone and pearls  (χρυσιω κα λιθω τιμιω κα μαργαριταις). Instrumental case. Χρυσιω is cognate with the participle. Λιθω τιμιω is collective (Revelation 18:12; Revelation 18:16; Revelation 21:19). There is a ζευγμα also with μαργαριταις (Revelation 18:12; Revelation 18:16; Revelation 21:21), for which word see Matthew 7:6. Probably John is thinking of the finery of the temple prostitutes in Asia Minor.Full of abominations  (γεμον βδελυγματων). Agreeing with ποτηριον, "cup" (neuter singular accusative). Some MSS. read γεμων (nominative masculine like εχων in verse Revelation 17:3, quite irregular). For βδελυγματων (genitive after γεμον) see Matthew 24:15; (Mark 13:14), common in the LXX for idol worship and its defilements (from βδελυσσω, to render foul), both ceremonial and moral. See Jeremiah 15:7.Even the unclean things of her fornication  (κα τα ακαθαρτα της πορνειας αυτης). Either the accusative after γεμον as in verse Revelation 17:3 (and full of the unclean things of her fornication) or the object of εχουσα, like ποτηριον.
