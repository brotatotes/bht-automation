 After these things  (μετα ταυτα). Often when a turn comes in this book. But Beckwith is probably correct in seeing in Revelation 19:1-5 the climax of chapter Revelation 19:18. This first voice (verses Revelation 19:1; Revelation 19:2) ως φωνην μεγαλην ουχλου πολλου (as it were great voice of much multitude) is probably the response of the angelic host (Revelation 5:11; Hebrews 12:22). There is responsive singing (grand chorus) as in chapters Revelation 19:4; Revelation 19:5.Saying  (λεγοντων). Present active participle of λεγω, genitive plural, though οχλου is genitive singular (collective substantive, agreement in sense).Hallelujah  (Αλληλουια). Transliteration of the Hebrew seen often in the Psalms (LXX) and in III. Macc. 7:13, in N.T. only in Revelation 19:1; Revelation 19:3; Revelation 19:4; Revelation 19:6. It means, "Praise ye the Lord." Fifteen of the Psalms begin or end with this word. The Great Hallel (a title for Revelation 19:104-109) is sung chiefly at the feasts of the passover and tabernacles. This psalm of praise uses language already in Revelation 12:10.
