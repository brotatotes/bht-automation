 To worship him  (προσκυνησα αυτω). First aorist active infinitive of purpose. John either felt that the angel represented God or he was beside himself with excitement over the glorious consummation. He was tempted to worship an angel (Colossians 2:18).See thou do it not  (ορα μη). Repeated in Revelation 22:9. Here there is no verb after μη (ellipse of ποιησηις τουτο) as in Mark 1:44; 1 Thessalonians 5:15), the aorist subjunctive of negative purpose with μη after ορα (present active imperative of οραω), a common enough idiom.Fellow-servant  (συνδουλος).

All Christians are συνδουλο (fellow-servants) as Christ taught (Matthew 18:28; Matthew 24:49) and as Paul (Colossians 1:7; Colossians 4:7) and John (Revelation 6:11) taught. Angels are God's servants also (Hebrews 1:4-14). For "the testimony of Jesus see Revelation 1:2; Revelation 1:9; Revelation 6:9; Revelation 12:17; Revelation 22:4.Worship God  (τω θεω προσκυνησον). And Christ, who is the Son of God (Revelation 5:13).The spirit of prophecy  (το πνευμα της προφητειας). Explanatory use of γαρ (for) here as in Revelation 19:8.
