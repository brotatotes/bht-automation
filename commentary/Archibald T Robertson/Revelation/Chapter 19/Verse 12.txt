 A flame of fire  (φλοξ πυρος). As in the opening vision of Christ in Revelation 1:14 (Revelation 2:18).Many diadems  (διαδηματα πολλα). A new feature, but the dragon has a diadem on each of his seven heads (Revelation 12:3) and the first beast one upon each of his ten horns (Revelation 13:1). So the victorious Messiah will wear many royal diadems and not mere crowns, because he is King of kings (Revelation 19:16).And he hath  (κα εχων). Nominative active present participle of εχω either used absolutely as an independent verb (like indicative) or in an anacoluthon, though αυτου (his) is genitive.A name written  (ονομα γεγραμμενον). Perfect passive participle of γραφω as in Revelation 2:17 (cf. Revelation 3:12).But he himself  (ε μη αυτος). "Except himself" (common ellipsis of the verb after ε μη, "if not"). See Revelation 2:17; Revelation 3:12 for the new name there described. See Revelation 14:1 for the name of Christ on the forehead of the 144,000, and Revelation 17:5 for the name on the forehead of the harlot. This word here supplements what Jesus says in Matthew 11:27.
