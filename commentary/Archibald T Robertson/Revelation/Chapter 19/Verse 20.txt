 Was taken  (επιασθη). First aorist (prophetic) passive indicative of the Doric πιαζω (Attic πιεζω). Cf. 2 Thessalonians 2:8.The false prophet  (ο ψευδοπροφητης). Possibly the second beast of Revelation 13:11-17; Revelation 16:13; Revelation 20:10. Charles takes him to be "the priesthood of the Imperial cult, which practised all kinds of magic and imposture to beguile men to worship the Beast."That wrought the signs in his sight  (ο ποιεσας τα σημεια ενωπιον αυτου). As in Revelation 13:14.Wherewith  (εν οις). "In which" signs.He deceived  (επλανησεν). First aorist active indicative of πλαναω. He was only able to deceive "them that had received" (τους λαβοντας, articular second aorist active participle of λαμβανω, "those receiving") "the mark of the beast" (Revelation 13:16; Revelation 14:9; Revelation 16:2; Revelation 20:4) "and them that worshipped his image" (τους προσκυνουντας τη εικον αυτου) as in Revelation 13:15.They twain  (ο δυο). "The two."Were cast  (εβληθησαν). First aorist passive Indicative of βαλλω. They fall together as they fought together. "The day that sees the end of a false statecraft will see also that of a false priestcraft" (Swete).Alive  (ζωντες). Present active participle of ζαω, predicative nominative, "living."Into the lake of fire  (εις την λιμνην του πυρος). Genitive πυρος describes this λιμνην (lake, cf. Luke 5:1) as it does γεεννα in Matthew 5:22. See also Revelation 20:10; Revelation 21:8. It is a different figure from the "abyss" in Revelation 9:1; Revelation 20:1. This is the final abode of Satan, the beast, the false prophet, and wicked men.That burneth with brimstone  (της καιομενης εν θειω). Note the genitive here in place of the accusative λιμνην, perhaps because of the intervening genitive πυρος (neuter, not feminine). The agreement is regular in Revelation 21:8. For εν θειω (with brimstone) see Revelation 14:10; Revelation 20:10; Revelation 21:8. The fact of hell is clearly taught here, but the imagery is not to be taken literally any more than that of heaven in chapters Revelation 19:4; Revelation 19:5; Revelation 19:21; Revelation 19:22 is to be so understood. Both fall short of the reality.
