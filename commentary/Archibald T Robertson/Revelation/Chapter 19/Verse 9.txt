 Write  (Γραψον). First aorist active imperative of γραφω as in Revelation 1:11; Revelation 14:13. The speaker may be the angel guide of Revelation 17:1.It is another beatitude  (μακαριο, Blessed) like that in Revelation 14:13 (fourth of the seven in the book).They which are bidden  (ο κεκλημενο). Articular perfect passive participle of καλεω, like Matthew 22:3; Luke 14:17. Cf. Revelation 17:14. This beatitude reminds us of that in Luke 14:15. (Cf. Matthew 8:11; Matthew 26:29.)These are true words of God  (Hουτο ο λογο αληθινο του θεου εισιν). Undoubtedly, but one should bear in mind that apocalyptic symbolism "has its own methods and laws of interpretation, and by these the student must be guided" (Swete).
