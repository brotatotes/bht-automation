 Fear not  (μη φοβου). As in Revelation 1:17. Worse things are about to come than poverty and blasphemy, perhaps prison and death, for the devil "is about to cast" (μελλε βαλλειν), "is going to cast."Some of you  (εξ υμων). Without τινας (some) before εξ υμων, a common idiom as in Revelation 3:9; Revelation 11:19; Luke 11:49.That ye may be tried  (ινα πειρασθητε). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist passive subjunctive of πειραζω. John himself is in exile. Peter and John had often been in prison together. James the brother of John, Paul, and Peter had all suffered martyrdom. In Revelation 3:10 a general persecution is outlined by πειρασμος.Ye shall have  (εξετε). Future active, but some MSS. read εχητε (present active subjunctive with hina, "that ye may have").Tribulation ten days  (θλιψιν ημερων δεκα). "Tribulation of ten days" (or "within ten days"). It is unwise to seek a literal meaning for ten days. Even ten days of suffering might seem an eternity while they lasted.Be thou faithful  (γινου πιστος). "Keep on becoming faithful" (present middle imperative of γινομα), "keep on proving faithful unto death" (Hebrews 12:4) as the martyrs have done (Jesus most of all).The crown of life  (τον στεφανον της ζωης). See this very image in James 1:12, a familiar metaphor in the games at Smyrna and elsewhere in which the prize was a garland. See also Revelation 3:11. The crown consists in life (Revelation 2:7). See Paul's use of στεφανος in 1 Corinthians 9:25; 2 Timothy 4:8.
