 Thou sufferest  (αφεις). Late vernacular present active indicative second person singular as if from a form αφεω instead of the usual αφιημ forms.The woman Jezebel  (την γυναικα Ιεζαβελ). Symbolical name for some prominent woman in the church in Thyatira, like the infamous wife of Ahab who was guilty of whoredom and witchcraft (1 Kings 16:31; 2 Kings 9:22) and who sought to drive out the worship of God from Israel. Some MSS. here (A Q 40 min.s) have σου (thy wife, thy woman Ramsay makes it), but surely Aleph C P rightly reject σου. Otherwise she is the pastor's wife!Which calleth herself a prophetess  (η λεγουσα εαυτην προφητιν). Nominative articular participle of λεγω in apposition with the accusative γυναικα like ο μαρτυς in apposition with Αντιπας in Revelation 2:13. Προφητις is an old word, feminine form for προφητης, in N.T. only here and Luke 2:36 (Anna), two extremes surely. See Acts 21:9 for the daughters of Philip who prophesied.And she teacheth and seduceth  (κα διδασκε κα πλανα). A resolution of the participles (διδασκουσα κα πλανωσα) into finite verbs (present active indicatives) as in Revelation 1:5. This woman was not a real prophetess, but a false one with loud claims and loose living. One is puzzled to know how such a woman had so much shrewdness and sex-appeal as to lead astray the servants of God in that church. The church tolerated the Nicolaitans and this leader whose primary object was sexual immorality (Charles) and became too much involved with her to handle the heresy.
