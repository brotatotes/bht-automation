 Thou hast  (εχεις). Continued possession of patience.Didst bear  (εβαστασας). First aorist indicative of βασταζω, repeated reference to the crisis in verse Revelation 2:2.And hast not grown weary  (κα ου κεκοπιακες). Perfect active indicative of κοπιαω, old verb, to grow weary (Matthew 6:28), play on the word κοπος, late form in -ες, for the regular -ας (λελυκας). like αφηκες (verse Revelation 2:4) and πεπτωκες (verse Revelation 2:5). "Tired in loyalty, not of it. The Ephesian church can bear anything except the presence of impostors in her membership" (Moffatt).
