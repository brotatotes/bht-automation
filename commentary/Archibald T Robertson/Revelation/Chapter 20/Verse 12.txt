 The dead, the great and the small  (τους νεκρους τους μεγαλους κα τους μικρους). The general resurrection of verse Revelation 20:13 is pictured by anticipation as already over. No living are mentioned after the battle of verses Revelation 20:7-10, though some will be living when Jesus comes to judge the quick and the dead (2 Timothy 4:1; 1 Thessalonians 4:13). All classes and conditions (Revelation 11:18; Revelation 13:16; Revelation 19:5; Revelation 19:18) John saw "standing before the throne" (εστωτας ενωπιον του θρονου).Books were opened  (βιβλια ηνοιχθησαν). First aorist passive of ανοιγω. Like Daniel 7:10. The record of each human being has been kept in God's books.Were judged  (εκριθησαν). First aorist passive indicative of κρινω. The sentence upon each rests upon written evidence.Another book which is the book of life  (αλλο βιβλιον ο εστιν της ζωης). This book has already been mentioned (Revelation 3:5; Revelation 13:8; Revelation 17:8). "It is the roll of living citizens of Jerusalem" (Swete), "the church of the first born enrolled in heaven" (Hebrews 12:23). The books are "the vouchers for the book of life" (Alford). We are saved by grace, but character at last (according to their works) is the test as the fruit of the tree (Matthew 7:16; Matthew 7:20; Matthew 10:32; Matthew 25:31-46; John 15:6; 2 Corinthians 5:10; Romans 2:10; Revelation 2:23; Revelation 20:12; Revelation 22:12).
