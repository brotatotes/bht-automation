 He laid hold on  (εκρατησεν). First aorist active indicative of κρατεω, to seize.The dragon  (τον δρακοντα). Accusative after εκρατησεν instead of the genitive as in Revelation 2:1. He has been behind the beast and the false prophet from the start. Now he is seized.The old serpent  (ο οφις ο αρχαιος). Precisely the description in Revelation 12:9, only the nominative is here retained, though in apposition with the accusative τον δρακοντα, a frequent anacoluthon in the Apocalypse (Revelation 1:5, etc.). Swete calls it a parenthesis.Which is  (ος εστιν). The relative here relieves the construction and takes the place of ο καλουμενος in Revelation 12:9 before Διαβολος κα ο Σατανας.And bound him  (κα εδησεν αυτον). First aorist active indicative of δεω.For a thousand years  (χιλια ετη). Accusative of extent of time. Here we confront the same problem found in the 1260 days. In this book of symbols how long is a thousand years? All sorts of theories are proposed, none of which fully satisfy one. Perhaps Peter has given us the only solution open to us in 2 Peter 3:8 when he argues that "one day with the Lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day." It will help us all to remember that God's clock does not run by ours and that times and seasons and programs are with him. This wonderful book was written to comfort the saints in a time of great trial, not to create strife among them.
