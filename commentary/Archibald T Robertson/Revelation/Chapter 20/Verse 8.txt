 To deceive the nations  (πλανησα τα εθνη). First aorist active infinitive of purpose of πλαναω, Satan's chief task (chapters 12 to 18, in particular Revelation 12:9; Revelation 13:14; Revelation 19:20; Revelation 20:3; Revelation 20:10).Which are in the four corners of the earth  (τα εν ταις τεσσαρσ γωνιαις της γης). Clearly the reign with Christ, if on earth, was not shared in by all on earth, for Satan finds a large and ready following on his release. See Revelation 7:1 (Isaiah 11:12) for "the four corners of the earth."Gog and Magog  (τον Γωγ κα Μαγωγ). Accusative in explanatory apposition with τα εθνη (the nations). Magog is first mentioned in Genesis 10:2. The reference here seems to be Ezekiel 38:2, where both are mentioned. Josephus (Ant. I. 6. 1) identifies Magog with the Scythians, with Gog as their prince. In the rabbinical writings Gog and Magog appear as the enemies of the Messiah. Some early Christian writers thought of the Goths and Huns, but Augustine refuses to narrow the imagery and sees only the final protest of the world against Christianity.To gather them together to the war  (συναγαγειν αυτους εις τον πολεμον). Second aorist active infinitive of purpose of συναγω, a congenial task for Satan after his confinement. See Revelation 16:14 for this very phrase and also Revelation 17:14; Revelation 19:19.Of whom  (ων--αυτων). Pleonasm or redundant pronoun as in Revelation 3:8 and often (of whom--of them).As the sand of the sea  (ως η αμμος της θαλασσης). Already in Revelation 12:18. Clearly then the millennium, whatever it is, does not mean a period when Satan has no following on earth, for this vast host rallies at once to his standard.
