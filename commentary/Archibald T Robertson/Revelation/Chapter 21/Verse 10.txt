 He carried me away in the Spirit  (απηνεγκεν με εν πνευματ). See same language in Revelation 17:7 when John received a vision of the Harlot City in a wilderness. Here it is "to a mountain great and high" (επ ορος μεγα κα υψηλον). So it was with Ezekiel (Ezekiel 40:2) and so the devil took Jesus (Matthew 4:8). It was apparently not Mount Zion (Revelation 14:1), for the New Jerusalem is seen from this mountain. "The Seer is carried thither 'in spirit' (cf. Revelation 1:10; Revelation 4:1); the Angel's δευρο is a sursum cor to which his spirit under the influence of the 'Spirit of revelation' (Ephesians 1:17) at once responds" (Swete).And he shewed me  (κα εδειξεν μο). First aorist active indicative of δεικνυμ, just as he had said he would do in verse Revelation 21:9 (δειξω σο, I will shew thee). Precisely the same words about Jerusalem as in verse Revelation 21:2, save the absence of καινην (New).
