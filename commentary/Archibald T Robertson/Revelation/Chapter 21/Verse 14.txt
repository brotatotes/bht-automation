 Had  (εχων). Masculine present active participle of εχω instead of εχον (neuter like to τειχος), and the participle occurs independently as if a principal verb (ειχεν) as often in this book.Twelve foundations  (θεμελιους δωδεκα). Foundation stones, old adjective (from θεμα, from τιθημ), here as in 1 Corinthians 3:11; 2 Timothy 2:19, with λιθους (stones understood), though often neuter substantive to θεμελιον (Luke 6:48; Acts 16:26). See Isaiah 28:16; Hebrews 11:10. Twelve because of the twelve apostles as foundation stones (Ephesians 2:20).On them  (επ' αυτων). On the twelve foundation stones.Names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb  (ονοματα των δωδεκα αποστολων του αρνιου). Jesus had spoken of twelve thrones for the apostles (Matthew 19:28); names of all twelve are here written, not just that of Peter, as some would argue from Matthew 16:18. As a matter of fact, Christ is the corner stone or ακρογωνιαιον (1 Peter 2:6; 1 Corinthians 3:10; Ephesians 2:20), though rejected by the Sanhedrin (Matthew 21:42). One may wonder if the name of Judas is on that stone or that of Matthias.
