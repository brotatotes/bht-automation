 Were adorned  (κεκοσμημενο). Perfect passive participle of κοσμεω as in verse Revelation 21:2, but without the copula ησαν (were), followed by instrumental case λιθω (stone).With all manner of precious stones  (παντ λιθω τιμιω). "With every precious stone." The list of the twelve stones in verses Revelation 21:19; Revelation 21:20 has no necessary mystical meaning. "The writer is simply trying to convey the impression of a radiant and superb structure" (Moffatt). The twelve gems do correspond closely (only eight in common) with the twelve stones on the high priest's breastplate (Exodus 28:17-20; Exodus 39:10; Ezekiel 28:13; Isaiah 54:11). Charles identifies them with the signs of zodiac in reverse order, a needless performance here. See the stones in Revelation 4:3. These foundation stones are visible. For jasper (ιασπις) see Revelation 4:3; Revelation 21:11; Revelation 21:18; Isaiah 54:12; sapphire (σαπφειρος) see Exodus 24:10; Isaiah 54:11 (possibly the λαπις λαζυλ of Turkestan); chalcedony (χαλκηδων) we have no other reference in N.T. or LXX (described by Pliny, H.N. XXXIII.21), possibly a green silicate of copper from near Chalcedon; emerald (σμαραγδος) here only in N.T., see Revelation 4:3 σμαραγδινος, and like it a green stone.
