 The holy city, new Jerusalem  (την πολιν την αγιαν Ιερουσαλημ καινην). "The New Earth must have a new metropolis, not another Babylon, but another and greater Jerusalem" (Swete), and not the old Jerusalem which was destroyed A.D. 70. It was called the Holy City in a conventional way (Matthew 4:5; Matthew 27:53), but now in reality because it is new and fresh (καινην), this heavenly Jerusalem of hope (Hebrews 12:22), this Jerusalem above (Galatians 4:26) where our real citizenship is (Philippians 3:20).Coming down out of heaven from God  (καταβαινουσαν εκ του ουρανου απο του θεου). Glorious picture caught by John and repeated from Revelation 3:12 and again in Revelation 21:10. But Charles distinguishes this new city of God from that in Revelation 21:9-22 because there is no tree of life in this one. But one shrinks from too much manipulation of this symbolism. It is better to see the glorious picture with John and let it tell its own story.Made ready  (ητοιμασμενην). Perfect passive participle of ετοιμαζω as in Revelation 19:7. The Wife of the Lamb made herself ready in her bridal attire.As a bride adorned  (ως νυμφην κεκοσμημενην). Perfect passive participle of κοσμεω, old verb (from κοσμος ornament like our cosmetics), as in Revelation 21:19. Only here the figure of bride is not the people of God as in Revelation 19:7, but the abode of the people of God (the New Jerusalem).For her husband  (τω ανδρ αυτης). Dative case of personal interest.
