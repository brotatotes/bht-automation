 Twelve pearls  (δωδεκα μαργαριτα). These gate towers (πυλωνες) were mentioned in verses Revelation 21:12. Each of these (cf. Isaiah 54:12) is a pearl, one of the commonest of jewels (Matthew 7:6; Matthew 13:46; 1 Timothy 2:9).Each one  (ανα εις εκαστος). Distributive use of ανα, but with the nominative (used as adverb, not preposition) rather than the accusative (as a preposition) as appears also in Mark 14:19; John 8:9; with κατα in Romans 12:5, "a barbaric construction" according to Charles.Street  (πλατεια). For which word (broad way, οδος understood) see Matthew 6:5, here the singular, but includes all the streets.Transparent  (διαυγης). Old word (from δια, through, αυγη, ray, shining through), here alone in N.T.
