 I saw no temple therein  (ναον ουκ ειδον εν αυτη). "Temple I did not see in it." The whole city is a temple in one sense (verse Revelation 21:16), but it is something more than a temple even with its sanctuary and Shekinah Glory in the Holy of Holies.For the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb are the temple thereof  (ο γαρ Κυριος ο θεος ο παντοκρατωρ, ναος αυτης εστιν κα το αρνιον). "For the Lord God, the Almighty, is the sanctuary of it and the Lamb." The Eternal Presence is the Shekinah Glory of God (verse Revelation 21:3). In 2 Corinthians 6:16 we are the sanctuary of God here, but now God is our Sanctuary, and so is the Lamb as in chapters Revelation 21:4; Revelation 21:5. See Revelation 1:8 and often for the description of God here.
