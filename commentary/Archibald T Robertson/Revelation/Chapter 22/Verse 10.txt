 And he saith unto me  (κα λεγε μο). The angel resumes as in Revelation 19:9.Seal not up  (μη σφραγισηις). Prohibition with μη and the ingressive first aorist active subjunctive of σφραγιζω. Charles takes this to be the command of Christ because in verses Revelation 22:7; Revelation 22:18 "the words of the prophecy of this book" come from Christ. But that is not a conclusive argument, though Charles, as already stated, rearranges these chapters to suit his own notion. Once only (Revelation 10:4) was John directed to seal and not to write. See there for discussion of σφραγιζω. This book is to be left open for all to read (Revelation 1:3; Revelation 13:18; Revelation 17:9; Revelation 22:7; Revelation 22:18).At hand  (εγγυς). As in Revelation 1:3.
