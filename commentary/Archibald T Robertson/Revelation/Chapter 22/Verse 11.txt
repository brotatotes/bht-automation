 Let him do unrighteousness still  (αδικησατω ετ). First aorist (constative) active imperative of αδικεω, viewed here as a whole. The language is probably ironical, with a reminder of Daniel 12:10, in no sense a commendation of their lost estate. Charles rejects this verse as not like John. It is the hopelessness of the final state of the wicked which is here pictured. So as to "Let him be made filthy still" (ρυπανθητω ετ). First aorist (constative) passive imperative of ρυπαινω, old verb, to make foul or filthy (from ρυπος, filth, 1 Peter 3:21, as is ρυπαρος, filthy), here only in N.T. The use of ετ is not perfectly clear, whether "still" or "yet more." It is the time when Christ has shut the door to those outside who are now without hope (Matthew 25:10; Luke 13:25). Ρυπαρος occurs elsewhere in N.T. only in James 2:2, and ρυπαρια (filthiness) only in James 1:21. So then "the righteous" (ο δικαιος) is to do righteousness still (δικαιοσυνην ποιησατω ετ, first constative aorist active imperative of ποιεω) and "the holy" (ο αγιος) to be made holy still (αγιασθητω ετ, first constative aorist passive imperative of αγιαζω). The states of both the evil and the good are now fixed forever. There is no word here about a "second chance" hereafter.
