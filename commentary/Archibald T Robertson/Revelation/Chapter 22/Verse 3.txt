 There shall be no curse any more  (παν καταθεμα ουκ εστα ετ). No other example of καταθεμα has been found outside of the Didache XVI. 5, though the verb καταθεματιζω occurs in Matthew 26:74, meaning to curse, while we have αναθεματιζω in Mark 14:71 in the same sense. It may be a syncopated form of καταναθεμα. The usual αναθεμα (curse) occurs in 1 Corinthians 16:22; Galatians 1:8; Romans 9:3. For παν with ουκ=ουδεν see Revelation 21:27.Shall do him service  (λατρευσουσιν αυτω). Future active of λατρευω, linear idea, "shall keep on serving." See Revelation 7:15 for present active indicative of this same verb with the dative αυτω as here, picturing the worship of God in heaven. See Revelation 27:1 for "the throne of God and of the Lamb."
