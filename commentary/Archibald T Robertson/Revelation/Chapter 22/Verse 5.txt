 Shall be night no more  (νυξ ουκ εστα ετ). As in Revelation 21:25.They need  (εχουσιν χρειαν). Present active indicative, "They have need," though A has εξουσιν (shall have), future like εστα. Here again there is repetition of part of Revelation 21:23, but for the purpose of showing the delightsomeness of the New Jerusalem with no need of lamp or sun (change to φως with ηλιου instead of φωτος, "they have no light of sun").Shall give them light  (φωτισε). Future active of φωτιζω, while aorist εφωτισεν in Revelation 21:23.They shall reign  (βασιλευσουσιν). Future active of βασιλευω. Reign eternally in contrast with the limited millennial reign of Revelation 20:4; Revelation 20:6. This glorious eternal reign with Christ occurs repeatedly in the book (Revelation 1:6; Revelation 3:21; Revelation 5:10) as in Luke 22:30. Christ's Kingdom is spiritual (John 18:36). "The visions of the Apocalypse are now ended; they have reached their climax in the New Jerusalem" (Swete). Now John gives the parting utterances of some of the speakers, and it is not always clear who is speaking.
