 And I John  (Καγω Ιωαννης). Here John the Seer is the speaker. He had already given his name (Revelation 1:1; Revelation 1:4; Revelation 1:9). Here he claims to be the "one who hears and sees these things" (ο ακουων κα βλεπων ταυτα).I fell down to worship  (επεσα προσκυνησα). Second aorist active indicative of πιπτω (with -α form) and the first aorist active infinitive of purpose of προσκυνεω. It was a natural, though a wrong, thing to do, especially after Christ's own voice followed that of the angel "which shewed me these things" (του δεικνυοντος ταυτα). Genitive singular of the articular present active participle of δεικνυω. Cf. Revelation 1:1; Revelation 4:1; Revelation 17:1; Revelation 21:9; Revelation 22:1; Revelation 22:6.
