 Patience  (υπομενης). "Endurance" as in Revelation 13:10; Revelation 14:12 as also in 2 Thessalonians 3:5.Thou didst keep  (ετηρησας)--I also will keep  (καγω τηρησω). Aorist active indicative and future active corresponding to each other. For a like play on the tenses of this verb by Christ see John 17:6 (τετηρηκαν), John 17:11 (τηρησον), John 17:12 (ετηρουν).From the hour of trial  (εκ της ωρας του πειρασμου). This use of εκ after τηρεω in John 17:15, απο in James 1:27. Trial brings temptation often (James 1:2; James 1:13). Jesus endured (Hebrews 12:1) and he will help them.

First aorist active infinitive of purpose from πειραζω, probably to tempt (cf. the demons in Revelation 9:1-21), not merely to afflict (Revelation 2:10).That dwell upon the earth  (τους κατοικουντας επ της γης). Present active articular participle of κατοικεω, explaining "the whole world" just before.
