 He that overcometh  (ο νικων). Absolute nominative again as in Revelation 3:12, but resumed this time by the dative αυτω as in Revelation 2:26.To sit  (καθισα). First aorist active infinitive of καθιζω. This promise grows out of the prophecy that the saints will share in the Messiah's rule, made to the twelve (Matthew 19:28; Luke 22:29), repeated by Paul (1 Corinthians 6:2), enlarged in Revelation 22:1-5 (to last forever, 2 Timothy 2:11). James and John took this hope and promise literally (Mark 10:40) not metaphorically.As I also overcame  (ως καγω ενικησα). First aorist active indicative of νικαω, looking back on the victory as over in the past. In John 16:33 before the Cross Jesus says Εγω νενικηκα τον κοσμον (perfect active), emphasizing the abiding effect of the victory.Sat down  (εκαθισα). "I took my seat" (Hebrews 1:3) where Christ is now (Revelation 22:3; Colossians 3:1). Cf. 1 John 5:4; Revelation 2:27. Each of these seven messages begins alike and ends alike. Each is the message of the Christ and of the Holy Spirit to the angel of the church. Each has a special message suited to the actual condition of each church. In each case the individual who overcomes has a promise of blessing. Christ the Shepherd knows his sheep and lays bare the particular peril in each case.
