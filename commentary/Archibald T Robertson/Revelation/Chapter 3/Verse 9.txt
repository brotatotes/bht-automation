 I give  (διδω). Late omega form for διδωμ, but the -μ form in Revelation 17:13 (διδοασιν). These Jewish converts are a gift from Christ. For this use of διδωμ see Acts 2:27; Acts 10:40; Acts 14:3. There is ellipse of τινας before εκ as in Revelation 2:10 (εξ υμων) and see Revelation 2:9 for "the synagogue of Satan."Of them which say  (των λεγοντων). Ablative plural in apposition with συναγωγης. On the construction of εαυτους Ιουδαιους εινα see on Revelation 2:9 (Ιουδαιους εινα εαυτους, the order of words being immaterial).But do lie  (αλλα ψευδοντα). Present middle indicative of ψευδομα, explanatory positive, addition here to κα ουκ εισιν of Revelation 2:9, in contrast also with ο αληθινος of verse Revelation 3:7 and in Johannine style (John 8:44; 1 John 1:10; 1 John 2:4).I will make them  (ποιησω αυτους). Future active indicative of ποιεω, resuming the prophecy after the parenthesis (των--ψευδοντα, which say--but do lie).To come and worship  (ινα ηξουσιν κα προσκυνησουσιν). "That they come and worship" (final clause, like facio ut in Latin, with ινα and the future active of ηκω and προσκυνεω). The language is based on Isaiah 45:14; Isaiah 60:14. The Jews expected homage (not worship in the strict sense) from the Gentiles, but it will come to the Christians at last (1 Corinthians 14:24). Later Ignatius (Philad. 6) warns this church against Judaizing Christians, perhaps one result of an influx of Jews.And to know  (κα γνωσιν). Continuation of the purpose clause with ινα, but with the second aorist active subjunctive rather than the less usual future indicative. See both constructions also with ινα in Revelation 22:14. Probably a reminiscence of Isaiah 43:4 in εγω ηγαπησα σε (I loved thee), first aorist active indicative.
