 Like a lion  (ομοιον λεοντ). Associative-instrumental case again. In Revelation 1:6; Revelation 1:10) each ζωον has four faces, but here each has a different face. "The four forms represent whatever is noblest, strongest, wisest, and swiftest in nature" (Swete). But it is not necessary to try to find a symbolism in each face here like the early baseless identification with the Four Evangelists (the lion for Mark, the man for Matthew, the calf for Luke, the eagle for John). Μοσχος is first a sprout, then the young of animals, then a calf (bullock or heifer) as in Luke 15:23; Luke 15:27; Luke 15:30, or a full-grown ox (Ezekiel 1:10).Had  (εχων). Masculine singular (some MSS. εχον neuter singular agreeing with ζωον) present active participle of εχω, changing the construction with the τριτον ζωον almost like a finite verb as in verse Revelation 4:8.A face as of a man  (προσωπον ως ανθρωπου). Shows that the likeness in each instance extended only to the face.Like an eagle flying  (ομοιον αετω πετομενω). Present middle participle of πετομα, to fly, old verb, in N.T. only in Revelation 4:7; Revelation 8:13; Revelation 12:14; Revelation 14:6; Revelation 19:17. The αετος in Matthew 24:28; Luke 17:37 may be a form of vulture going after carrion, but not in Revelation 8:13; Revelation 12:14.
