 Worthy  (αξιον). Agreeing in gender (grammatical neuter) with αρνιον, but some MSS. have αξιος (masculine, natural gender). Note change to third person εστιν instead of second ε. The point of the song is the same as that in verses Revelation 5:9; Revelation 5:10, but the language differs. Note the repeated article το (the lamb the slain) referring to verses Revelation 5:6; Revelation 5:9. Note also the one article την before δυναμιν for all the seven grounds of praise (δυναμιν, power, πλουτον, wealth, σοφιαν, wisdom, ισχυν, strength, τιμην, honor, δοξαν, glory, ευλογιαν, blessing), though πλουτον is masculine, in contrast with separate article for each item (all three feminine) in Revelation 4:11, here grouping them all together, "a heptad of praise" (Swete).
