 And I saw  (κα ειδον). Stirred by the words of the elder in verse Revelation 5:5 (ιδου, behold). "I beheld."In the midst  (εν μεσω). See Revelation 4:6 for this idiom. It is not quite clear where the Lamb was standing in the vision, whether close to the throne or in the space between the throne and the elders (perhaps implied by "came" in verse Revelation 5:7, but nearness to the throne is implied by Revelation 14:1; Acts 7:56; Hebrews 10:11).A Lamb  (αρνιον). Elsewhere in the N.T. ο αμνος is used of Christ (John 1:29; John 1:36; Acts 8:32; 1 Peter 1:19 like Isaiah 53:7), but in the Apocalypse το αρνιον occurs for the Crucified Christ 29 times in twelve chapters.Standing  (εστηκος). Second perfect active (intransitive of ιστημ) neuter accusative singular (grammatical gender like αρνιον), though some MSS. read εστηκως (natural gender masculine and nominative in spite of ειδον construction according to sense).As though it had been slain  (ως εσφαγμενον). Perfect passive predicate participle of σφαζω, old word, in N.T. only in Revelation 5:6; Revelation 5:9; Revelation 5:12; Revelation 6:4; Revelation 6:9; Revelation 13:3; Revelation 18:24; 1 John 3:12. Hως (as if) is used because the Lamb is now alive, but (in appearance) with the marks of the sacrifice. The Christ as the Lamb is both sacrifice and Priest (Hebrews 9:12; Hebrews 10:11).Having  (εχων). Construction according to sense again with masculine nominative participle instead of εχοντα (masculine accusative singular) or εχον (neuter accusative singular). Seven horns (κερας) is a common symbol in the O.T. for strength and kingly power (1 Samuel 2:10; 1 Kings 22:11; Psalms 112:9; Daniel 7:7; Daniel 7:20) and often in Rev. (Revelation 12:3; Revelation 13:1; Revelation 17:3; Revelation 17:12). Fulness of power (the All-powerful one) is symbolized by seven.Seven eyes  (οφθαλμους επτα). Like Zechariah 3:9; Zechariah 4:10 and denotes here, as there, omniscience. Here they are identified with the seven Spirits of Christ, while in Revelation 1:4 the seven Spirits are clearly the Holy Spirit of God (Revelation 3:1), and blaze like torches (Revelation 4:5), like the eyes of Christ (Revelation 1:14). The Holy Spirit is both Spirit of God and of Christ (Romans 8:9).Sent forth  (απεσταλμενο). Perfect passive predicate participle of αποστελλω, masculine plural (agreeing with ο and οφθαλμους in gender), but some MSS. have απεσταλμενα agreeing with the nearer πνευματα.
