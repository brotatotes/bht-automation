 The great day  (η ημερα η μεγαλη). The phrase occurs in the O.T. prophets (Joel 2:11; Joel 2:31; Zephaniah 1:14. Cf. Jude 1:6) and is here combined with "of their wrath" (της οργης αυτων) as in Zephaniah 1:15; Zephaniah 1:18; Zephaniah 2:3; Romans 2:5. "Their" (αυτων) means the wrath of God and of the Lamb put here on an equality as in Revelation 1:17; Revelation 22:3; Revelation 22:13; 1 Thessalonians 3:11; 2 Thessalonians 2:16. Beckwith holds that this language about the great day having come "is the mistaken cry of men in terror caused by the portents which are bursting upon them." There is something, to be sure, to be said for this view which denies that John commits himself to the position that this is the end of the ages.And who is able to stand?  (κα τις δυνατα σταθηναι?). Very much like the words in Nahum 1:6; Malachi 3:2. First aorist passive infinitive of ιστημ. It is a rhetorical question, apparently by the frightened crowds of verse Revelation 6:15. Swete observes that the only possible answer to that cry is the command of Jesus in Luke 21:36: "Keep awake on every occasion, praying that ye may get strength to stand (σταθηνα, the very form) before the Son of Man."
