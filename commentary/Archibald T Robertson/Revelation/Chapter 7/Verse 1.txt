 After this  (μετα τουτο). Instead of the seventh seal (Revelation 8:1) being opened, two other episodes or preliminary visions occupy chapter 7 (the sealing of the servants of God Revelation 7:1-8 and the vision of the redeemed before the throne Revelation 7:9-17).Standing  (εστωτας). Second perfect predicate participle of ιστημ, intransitive and followed by επ and the accusative case γωνιας as already in Revelation 3:20 (επ θυριαν) and often again (Revelation 8:3 some MSS., others genitive; Revelation 11:11; Revelation 12:18; Revelation 14:1; Revelation 15:2), but note επ with genitive θαλασσης in the next clause, like επ κεφαλης in Revelation 12:1; Revelation 7:3.Corners  (γωνιας). Old word for angle (Matthew 6:5), also in Revelation 20:8.Holding  (κρατουντας). Present active participle of κρατεω, to hold fast (Mark 7:3; John 20:23). The four winds (cf. Matthew 24:31) are held prisoner by angels at each of the four corners. Some Jews held the winds from due north, south, east, west to be favourable, while those from the angles (see Acts 27:14) were unfavourable (Charles). There is an angel of the fire (Revelation 14:18) and an angel of the waters (Revelation 16:5).That no wind should blow  (ινα μη πνεη ανεμος). Negative purpose clause with ινα μη and the present active subjunctive, "lest a wind keep on blowing."Upon any tree  (επ παν δενδρον). Accusative case here with επ rather than the preceding genitives (γησ, θαλασσης), "upon the land or upon the sea," but "against any tree" (picture of attack on the tree like a tornado's path).
