 They cry  (κραζουσ). Vivid dramatic present.With a great voice  (φωνη μεγαλη). As in Revelation 6:10; Revelation 7:2. "The polyglott multitude shouts its praises as with one voice" (Swete).Salvation  (η σωτηρια). As in Revelation 12:10; Revelation 19:1. Nominative absolute. Salvation here is regarded as an accomplished act on the part of those coming out of the great tribulation (verse Revelation 7:14) and the praise for it is given to God (τω θεω, dative case) and to the Lamb (τω αρνιω, dative also). Both God and Christ are thus called σωτηρ as in the Pastoral Epistles, as to God (1 Timothy 1:1; 1 Timothy 2:3; Titus 1:3; Titus 3:4) and to Christ (Titus 1:4; Titus 2:13; Titus 3:6). For η σωτηρια see John 4:22; Acts 4:12; Judges 1:3.
