 In the midst  (ανα μεσον). In Revelation 5:6 we have εν μεσω του θρονου as the position of the Lamb, and so that is apparently the sense of ανα μεσον here as in Matthew 13:25, though it can mean "between," as clearly so in 1 Corinthians 6:5.Shall be their shepherd  (παιμανε αυτους). "Shall shepherd them," future active of ποιμαινω (from ποιμην, shepherd), in John 21:16; Acts 20:28; 1 Peter 5:2; Revelation 2:27; Revelation 7:17; Revelation 12:5; Revelation 19:15. Jesus is still the Good Shepherd of his sheep (John 10:11; John 10:14). Cf. Psalms 23:1.Shall guide them  (οδη γησε αυτους). Future active of οδηγεω, old word (from οδηγος, guide, Matthew 15:14), used of God's guidance of Israel (Exodus 15:13), of God's guidance of individual lives (Psalms 5:9), of the guidance of the Holy Spirit (John 16:13), of Christ's own guidance here (cf. John 14:4; Revelation 14:4).Unto fountains of waters of life  (επ ζωης πηγας υδατων). The language is like that in Isaiah 49:10; Jeremiah 2:13. Note the order, "to life's water springs" (Swete) like the Vulgate ad vitae fontes aquarum, with emphasis on ζωης (life's). For this idea see also John 4:12; John 4:14; John 7:38; Revelation 21:6; Revelation 22:1; Revelation 22:17. No special emphasis on the plural here or in Revelation 8:10; Revelation 14:7; Revelation 16:4.And God shall wipe away  (κα εξαλειψε ο θεος). Repeated in Revelation 21:4 from Isaiah 25:8. Future active of εξαλειφω, old compound, to wipe out (εξ), off, away, already in Revelation 3:5 for erasing a name and in Acts 3:19 for removing the stain (guilt) of sin.Every tear  (παν δακρυον). Old word, with other form, δακρυ, in Luke 7:38; Luke 7:44. Note repetition of εκ with οφθαλμων (out of their eyes). "Words like these of vv. Revelation 7:15-17 must sound as a divine music in the ears of the persecuted. God will comfort as a mother comforts" (Baljon).
