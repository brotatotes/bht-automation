 Hurt not  (μη αδικησητε). Prohibition with μη and the ingressive aorist active subjunctive of αδικεω, not to begin to hurt.Till we shall have sealed  (αχρ σφραγισωμεν). Temporal clause of indefinite action for the future with αχρ (sometimes αχρις ου or αχρις ου αν) and the aorist subjunctive as in Revelation 15:8; Revelation 20:3; Revelation 20:5 or the future indicative (Revelation 17:7), usually with the notion of ascent (up to) rather than extent like μεχρ.An  (modal) sometimes occurs, but it is not necessary. But there is no futurum exactum idea in the aorist subjunctive, simply "till we seal," not "till we shall have sealed."Upon their foreheads  (επ των μετωπων). From Ezekiel 9:4. Old word (μετα, ωπς, after the eye, above the eye, the space above or between the eyes), in N.T. only in the Apocalypse (Revelation 7:3; Revelation 9:4; Revelation 13:16; Revelation 14:1; Revelation 14:9; Revelation 17:5; Revelation 20:4; Revelation 22:4). For "the servants of God" (τους δουλους του θεου) who are to be thus marked linked with angels in the service of God see Revelation 1:1; Revelation 2:20; Revelation 19:2; Revelation 19:5; Revelation 22:3; Revelation 22:6.
