 Which no man could number  (ον αριθμησα αυτον ουδεις εδυνατο). Redundant repetition of the pronoun αυτον after the relative ον as in Revelation 7:5; Revelation 3:8. Εδυνατο imperfect indicative and αριθμησα first aorist active infinitive of αριθμεω, old verb, in N.T. only here, Matthew 10:30; Luke 12:7. See Revelation 5:9 (also Revelation 11:9; Revelation 13:7; Revelation 14:10; Revelation 17:15) for the list of words after εκ (the spiritual Israel carried on all over the world), "a polyglott cosmopolitan crowd" (Swete).Standing  (εστωτες). Same form in Revelation 7:1, only nominative masculine plural referring to οχλος (masculine singular), construction according to sense like the plural λεγοντων with οχλου in Revelation 19:1.Arrayed  (περιβεβλημενους). Perfect passive participle of περιβαλλω, but in the accusative plural (not nominative like εστωτες), a common variation in this book when preceded by ειδον and ιδου as in Revelation 4:4 (θρονοι, πρεσβυτερους). Charles regards this as a mere slip which would have been changed to περιβεβλημενο if John had read the MS. over.In white robes  (στολας λευκας). Predicate accusative retained with this passive verb of clothing as in Revelation 7:13; Revelation 10:1; Revelation 11:3; Revelation 12:1; Revelation 17:4; Revelation 18:16; Revelation 19:13.Palms  (φοινικες). Nominative again, back to construction with ιδου, not ειδον. Old word, in N.T. only here for palm branches and John 12:13 for palm trees. Both these and the white robes are signs of victory and joy.
