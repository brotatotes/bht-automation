 Taketh  (ειληφεν). Vivid dramatic perfect active indicative of λαμβανω as in Revelation 5:7, "has taken." The angel had apparently ]aid aside the censer. Hardly merely the pleonastic use of λαμβανω (John 19:23). John pictures the scene for us.Filled  (εγεμισεν). He drops back to the narrative use of the first aorist active indicative of γεμιζω.With the fire  (εκ του πυρος), live coals from the altar (cf. Isaiah 6:6).Cast  (εβαλεν). Second aorist active indicative of βαλλω. See Genesis 19:24 (Sodom); Ezekiel 10:2 and Christ's bold metaphor in Luke 12:49. See this use of βαλλω also in Revelation 8:7; Revelation 12:4; Revelation 12:9; Revelation 12:13; Revelation 14:19.Followed  (εγενοντο). Came to pass naturally after the casting of fire on the earth. Same three elements in Revelation 4:5, but in different order (lightnings, voices, thunders), lightning naturally preceding thunder as some MSS. have it here. Perhaps φωνα, the voices of the storm (wind, etc.).
