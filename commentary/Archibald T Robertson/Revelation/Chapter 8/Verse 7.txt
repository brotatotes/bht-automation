 Sounded  (εσαλπισεν). First aorist active indicative of σαλπιζω, repeated with each angel in turn (Revelation 8:8; Revelation 8:10; Revelation 8:12; Revelation 9:1; Revelation 9:13; Revelation 11:15).Hail and fire mingled with blood  (χαλαζα κα πυρ μεμιγμενα εν αιματ). Like the plague of hail and fire in Exodus 9:24. The first four trumpets are very much like the plagues in Egypt, this one like a semitropical thunderstorm (Swete) with blood like the first plague (Exodus 7:17; Psalms 106:35). The old feminine word χαλαζα (hail) is from the verb χαλαω, to let down (Mark 2:4), in N.T. only in Revelation 8:7; Revelation 11:19; Revelation 16:21. The perfect passive participle μεμιγμενα (from μιγνυμ, to mix) is neuter plural because of πυρ (fire).Were cast  (εβληθη). First aorist passive singular because χαλαζα and πυρ treated as neuter plural. "The storm flung itself on the earth" (Swete).Was burnt up  (κατεκαη). Second aorist (effective) passive indicative of κατακαιω, old verb to burn down (effective use of κατα, up, we say). Repeated here three times for dramatic effect. See Revelation 7:1-3 about the trees and Revelation 9:4 where the locusts are forbidden to injure the grass.
