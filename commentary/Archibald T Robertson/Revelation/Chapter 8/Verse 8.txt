Somewhat like Enoch 18:13, but perhaps with the picture of a great volcanic eruption like that of Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Strabo tells of an eruption B.C. 196 which made a new island (Palaea Kaumene).Became blood  (εγενετο αιμα). Like the Nile in the first plague (Exodus 7:20). Cf. also Revelation 16:3.
