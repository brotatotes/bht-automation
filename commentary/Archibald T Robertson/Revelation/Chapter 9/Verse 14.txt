 One saying to the sixth angel  (λεγοντα τω εκτω). Accusative masculine singular active participle of λεγω, personifying φωνην and agreeing with it in case, though not in gender. This voice speaks to the sixth angel (dative case).Which had the trumpet  (ο εχων την σαλπιγγα). Nominative case in apposition with αγγελω (dative), the same anomalous phenomenon in Revelation 2:20; Revelation 3:12; Revelation 14:12. Swete treats it as a parenthesis, like Revelation 4:1; Revelation 11:15.Loose  (λυσον). First aorist (ingressive) active imperative of λυω, "let loose." Another group of four angels (Revelation 7:1) like Acts 12:4, described here "which are bound" (τους δεδεμενους). Perfect passive articular participle of δεω, evidently the leaders of the demonic horsemen (Revelation 9:15) as the four angels let loose the demonic locusts (Revelation 7:1), both quaternions agents of God's wrath.At the great river Euphrates  (επ τω ποταμω τω μεγαλω Ευφρατη). A regular epithet of the Euphrates (Revelation 16:12; Genesis 15:18; Deuteronomy 1:7). It rises in Armenia and joins the Tigris in lower Babylonia, a total length of nearly 1800 miles, the eastern boundary of the Roman Empire next to Parthia.
