 Repented not  (ου μετενοησαν). First aorist active indicative of μετανοεω. The two-thirds of mankind still spared did not change their creed or their conduct.Of the works  (εκ των εργων). For this use of εκ after μετανοεω see Revelation 2:21; Revelation 9:21; Revelation 16:11. By "works" (εργων) here idolatries are meant, as the next verse shows.That they should not worship  (ινα μη προσκυνησουσιν). Negative purpose clause with ινα μη and the future active of προσκυνεω as in Revelation 9:5.Devils  (τα δαιμονια). Both in the O.T. (Deuteronomy 32:17; Psalms 96:5; Psalms 106:37) and in the N.T. (1 Corinthians 10:21) the worship of idols is called the worship of unclean spirits. Perhaps this is one explanation of the hideous faces given these images. "The idols" (τα ειδωλα 1 John 5:21, from ειδος, form, appearance) represented "demons," whether made of gold (τα χρυσα) or of silver (τα αργυρα) or of brass (τα χαλκα) or of stone (τα λιθινα) or of wood (τα ξυλινα). See Daniel 5:23 for this picture of heathen idols. The helplessness of these idols, "which can neither see nor hear nor walk" (α ουτε βλεπειν δυναντα ουτε ακουειν ουτε περιπατειν), is often presented in the O.T. (Psalms 113:12; Psalms 115:4).
