The attributes of God's nature defined here as "his everlasting power and divinity" (η τε αιδιος αυτου δυναμις κα θειοτης). Αιδιος is for αειδιος from αε (always), old word, in N.T. only here and Jude 1:6, common in Philo (ζωη αιδιος), elsewhere αιωνιος. Θειοτης is from θειος (from θεος) quality of θεος and corresponds more to Latin divinitas from divus, divine. In Colossians 2:9 Paul uses θεοτης (Latin deitas from deus)deity , both old words and nowhere else in the N.T. Θεοτης is Divine Personality, θειοτης, Divine Nature and properties (Sanday and Headlam).Since the creation of the world  (απο κτισεως κοσμου).

Present passive participle of νοεω, to use the νους (intellect).That they may be without excuse  (εις το εινα αυτους αναπολογητους). More likely, "so that they are without excuse." The use of εις το and the infinitive (with accusative of general reference) for result like ωστε is reasonably clear in the N.T. (Moulton, Prolegomena, p. 219; Robertson, Grammar, p. 1003). Αναπολογητους is another verbal with αν from απολογεομα. Old word, in N.T. only here and Romans 2:1 ("inexcusable" here).
