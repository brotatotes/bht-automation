 Wherefore  (διο). Paul's inexorable logic. See it also in verse Romans 1:26 with the same verb and in verse Romans 1:28 κα like "and so."God gave them up  (παρεδωκεν αυτους ο θεος). First aorist active indicative of παραδιδωμ, old and common verb to hand over (beside, παρα) to one's power as in Matthew 4:12. These people had already wilfully deserted God who merely left them to their own self-determination and self-destruction, part of the price of man's moral freedom. Paul refers to this stage and state of man in Acts 17:30 by "overlooked" (υπεριδων). The withdrawal of God's restraint sent men deeper down. Three times Paul uses παρεδωκεν here (verses Romans 1:24; Romans 1:26; Romans 1:28), not three stages in the giving over, but a repetition of the same withdrawal. The words sound to us like clods on the coffin as God leaves men to work their own wicked will.That their bodies should be dishonoured  (του ατιμαζεσθα τα σωματα αυτων). Contemplated result expressed by του (genitive article) and the passive infinitive ατιμαζεσθα (from ατιμος, α privative and τιμος, dishonoured) with the accusative of general reference. Christians had a new sense of dignity for the body (1 Thessalonians 4:4; 1 Corinthians 6:13). Heathenism left its stamp on the bodies of men and women.
