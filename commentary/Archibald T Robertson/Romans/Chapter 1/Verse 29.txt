 Being called with  (πεπληρωμενους). Perfect passive participle of the common verb πληροω, state of completion, "filled to the brim with" four vices in the associative instrumental case (αδικια, unrighteousness as in verse Romans 1:18, πονηρια, active wickedness as in Mark 7:22, πλεονεξια, covetousness as in 1 Thessalonians 2:5; Luke 12:15, κακια, maliciousness or inward viciousness of disposition as in 1 Corinthians 5:8). Note asyndeton, no connective in the lists in verses Romans 1:29-31. Dramatic effect. The order of these words varies in the MSS. and πορνεια, fornication, is not genuine here (absent in Aleph A B C).Full of  (μεστους). Paul changes from participle to adjective. Old adjective, rare in the N.T., like μεστοω, to fill full (only in Acts 2:13 in N.T.), stuffed full of (with genitive). Five substantives in the genitive (φθονου, envy, as in Galatians 5:21, φονου, murder, and so a paronomasia or combination with φθονου, of like sounding words, εριδος, strife, as in 2 Corinthians 12:16, κακοηθιας, malignity, and here only in N.T. though old word from κακοηθης and that from κακος and ηθος, a tendency to put a bad construction on things, depravity of heart and malicious disposition.
