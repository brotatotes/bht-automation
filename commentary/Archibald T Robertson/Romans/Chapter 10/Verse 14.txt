 How then shall they call?  (πως ουν επικαλεσωνται?). Deliberative subjunctive (first aorist middle) of επικαλεομα (see verses Romans 10:12; Romans 10:13). The antecedent of εις ον (in whom) is not expressed.How shall they believe?  (πος πιστευσωσιν?). Deliberative subjunctive again (first aorist active of πιστευω just used). Each time Paul picks up the preceding verb and challenges that. Here again the antecedent εις τουτον before ον is not expressed.How shall they hear?  (πος ακουσωσιν?). Deliberative subjunctive (first aorist active of ακουω).Without a preacher?  (χωρις κηρυσσοντοσ?). Preposition χωρις with ablative singular masculine present active participle of κηρυσσω, "without one preaching."How shall they preach?  (πως κηρυξωσιν?). Deliberative subjunctive again (first aorist active κηρυσσω, to preach).Except they be sent?  (εαν μη αποσταλωσιν?). Second aorist passive deliberative subjunctive of αποστελλω, to send, from which verb αποστολος apostle comes. Negative condition of third class. In graphic style Paul has made a powerful plea for missions. It is just as true today as then.
