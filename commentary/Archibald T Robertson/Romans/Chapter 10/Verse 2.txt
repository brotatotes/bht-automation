 A zeal for God  (ζηλον θεου). Objective genitive like Philippians 3:9, "through faith in Christ" (δια πιστεως Χριστου).But not according to knowledge  (αλλ' ου κατ' επιγνωσιν). They had knowledge of God and so were superior to the Gentiles in privilege (Romans 2:9-11), but they sought God in an external way by rules and rites and missed him (Romans 9:30-33). They became zealous for the letter and the form instead of for God himself.
