 Did they stumble that they might fall?  (μη επταισαν ινα πεσωσιν?). Negative answer expected by μη as in verse Romans 11:1. First aorist active indicative of πταιω, old verb, to stumble, only here in Paul (see James 3:2), suggested perhaps by σκανδαλον in verse Romans 11:9. If ινα is final, then we must add "merely" to the idea, "merely that they might fall" or make a sharp distinction between πταιω, to stumble, and πιπτω, to fall, and take πεσωσιν as effective aorist active subjunctive to fall completely and for good. Hινα, as we know, can be either final, sub-final, or even result. See 1 Thessalonians 5:4; 1 Corinthians 7:29; Galatians 5:17. Paul rejects this query in verse Romans 11:11 as vehemently as he did that in verse Romans 11:1.By their fall  (τω αυτων παραπτωματ). Instrumental case. For the word, a falling aside or a false step from παραπιπτω, see Romans 5:15-20.Is come . No verb in the Greek, but γινετα or γεγονεν is understood.For to provoke them to jealousy  (εις το παραζηλωσα). Purpose expressed by εις and the articular infinitive, first aorist active, of παραζηλοω, for which verb see 1 Corinthians 10:22. As an historical fact Paul turned to the Gentiles when the Jews rejected his message (Acts 13:45; Acts 28:28, etc.).The riches of the world  (πλουτος κοσμου). See Romans 10:12.Their loss  (το ηττημα αυτων). So perhaps in 1 Corinthians 6:7, but in Isaiah 31:8 defeat is the idea. Perhaps so here.Fulness  (πληρωμα). Perhaps "completion," though the word from πληροω, to fill, has a variety of senses, that with which anything is filled (1 Corinthians 10:26; 1 Corinthians 10:28), that which is filled (Ephesians 1:23).How much more?  (ποσω μαλλον). Argument a fortiori as in verse Romans 11:24. Verse Romans 11:25 illustrates the point.
