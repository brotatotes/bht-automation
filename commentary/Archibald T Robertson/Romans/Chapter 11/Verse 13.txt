 To you that are Gentiles  (υμιν τοις εθνεσιν). "To you the Gentiles." He has a serious word to say to them.Inasmuch then  (εφ' οσον μεν ουν). Not temporal, quamdiu, "so long as" (Matthew 9:15), but qualitative quatenus "in so far then as" (Matthew 25:40).I glorify my ministry  (την διακονιαν μου δοξαζω). As apostle to the Gentiles (εθνων αποστολος, objective genitive). Would that every minister of Christ glorified his ministry.If by any means  (ε πως). This use of ε with purpose or aim is a kind of indirect discourse.I may provoke  (παραζηλωσω). Either future active indicative or first aorist active subjunctive, see same uncertainty in Philippians 3:10 καταντησω, but in Romans 3:11 καταλαβω after ε is subjunctive. The future indicative is clear in Romans 1:10 and the optative in Acts 27:12. Doubtful whether future indicative or aorist subjunctive also in σωσω (save).
