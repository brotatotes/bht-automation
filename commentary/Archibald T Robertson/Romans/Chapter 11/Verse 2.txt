 Whom he foreknew  (ον προεγνω). The same form and sense as in Romans 8:29, which see. Probably the Hebrew sense of choice beforehand. The nation of Israel was God's chosen people and so all the individuals in it could not be cast off.Wot ye not?  (ουκ οιδατε?). "Know ye not?" Why keep the old English "wot"?Of Elijah  (εν Ελεια). "In the case of Elijah." Cf. "in the bush" (Mark 12:26).He pleadeth  (εντυγχανε). See on Romans 8:27. Εντυγχανω means to happen on one and so to converse with (Acts 25:24), to plead for (Romans 8:27; Romans 8:34), to plead against as here with κατα, but the "against" is in κατα.
