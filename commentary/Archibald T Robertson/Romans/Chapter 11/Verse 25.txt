 This mystery  (το μυστηριον τουτο). Not in the pagan sense of an esoteric doctrine for the initiated (from μυεω, to blink, to wink), unknown secrets (2 Thessalonians 2:7), or like the mystery religions of the time, but the revealed will of God now made known to all (1 Corinthians 2:1; 1 Corinthians 2:7; 1 Corinthians 4:1) which includes Gentiles also (Romans 16:25; Colossians 1:26; Ephesians 3:3) and so far superior to man's wisdom (Colossians 2:2; Colossians 4:13; Ephesians 3:9; Ephesians 5:32; Ephesians 6:19; Matthew 13:11; Mark 4:11). Paul has covered every point of difficulty concerning the failure of the Jews to accept Jesus as the Messiah and has shown how God has overruled it for the blessing of the Gentiles with a ray of hope still held out for the Jews. "In early ecclesiastical Latin μυστηριον was rendered by sacramentum, which in classical Latin means the military oath. The explanation of the word sacrament, which is so often founded on this etymology, is therefore mistaken, since the meaning of sacrament belongs to μυστηριον and not to sacramentum in the classical sense" (Vincent).Wise in your own conceits  (εν εαυτοις φρονιμο). "Wise in yourselves." Some MSS. read παρ' εαυτοις (by yourselves). Negative purpose here (ινα μη ητε), to prevent self-conceit on the part of the Gentiles who have believed. They had no merit in themselvesA hardening  (πωρωσις). Late word from πωροω (Romans 11:7). Occurs in Hippocrates as a medical term, only here in N.T. save Mark 3:5; Ephesians 4:18. It means obtuseness of intellectual discernment, mental dulness.In part  (απο μερους). Goes with the verb γεγονεν (has happened in part). For απο μερους, see 2 Corinthians 1:14; 2 Corinthians 2:5; Romans 15:24; for ανα μερος, see 1 Corinthians 14:27; for εκ μερους, see 1 Corinthians 12:27; 1 Corinthians 13:9; for κατα μερος, see Hebrews 9:5; for μερος τ (adverbial accusative) partly see 1 Corinthians 11:18. Paul refuses to believe that no more Jews will be saved.Until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in  (αχρ ου το πληρωμα των εθνων εισελθη). Temporal clause with αχρ ου (until which time) and the second aorist active subjunctive of εισερχομα, to come in (Matthew 7:13; Matthew 7:21).For fulness of the Gentiles  (το πληρωμα των εθνων) see on verse Romans 11:12, the complement of the Gentiles.
