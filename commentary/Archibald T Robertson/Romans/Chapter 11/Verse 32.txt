 Hath shut up  (συνεκλεισεν). First aorist active indicative of συνκλειω, to shut together like a net (Luke 5:6). See Galatians 3:22 for this word with υπο αμαρτιαν (under sin). This is a resultant (effective) aorist because of the disbelief and disobedience of both Gentile (Romans 1:17-32) and Jew (Romans 2:1-3).All  (τους παντας). "The all" (both Gentiles and Jews).That he might have mercy  (ινα--ελεηση). Purpose with ινα and aorist active subjunctive. No merit in anyone, but all of grace. "The all" again, who receive God's mercy, not that "all" men are saved.
