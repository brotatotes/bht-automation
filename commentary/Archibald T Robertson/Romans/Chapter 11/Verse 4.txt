 The answer of God  (ο χρηματισμος). An old word in various senses like χρηματιζω, only here in N.T. See this use of the verb in Matthew 2:12; Matthew 2:22; Luke 2:26; Acts 10:22.To Baal  (τη Βααλ). Feminine article. In the LXX the name Βααλ is either masculine or feminine. The explanation is that the Jews put Bosheth (αισχυνη, shame) for Baal and in the LXX the feminine article occurs because αισχυνη is so, though here the LXX has the masculine τω.
