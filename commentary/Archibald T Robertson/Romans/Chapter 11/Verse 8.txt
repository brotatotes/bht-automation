 A spirit of stupor  (πνευμα κατανυξεως). The quotation is a combination of Deuteronomy 19:4; Isaiah 29:10; Isaiah 6:9. This phrase is from Isaiah 29:10. Κατανυξις is a late and rare word from κατανυσσω, to prick or stick (Acts 2:37), in LXX, here only in N.T., one example in Pelagia-Legende. The torpor seems the result of too much sensation, dulled by incitement into apathy.That they should not see  (του μη βλεπειν). Genitive articular infinitive of negative purpose.That they should not hear  (του μη ακουειν). So here also. See Stephen's speech (Acts 7:51).
