 As much as in you lieth  (το εξ υμων). Accusative of general reference, "so far as what proceeds from you" ("the from you part"). See το κατ' εμε in Romans 1:15. This phrase explains "if it be possible" (ε δυνατον). "All your part is to be peace" (Alford). For "be at peace" (ειρηνευοντες) see 2 Corinthians 13:11.
