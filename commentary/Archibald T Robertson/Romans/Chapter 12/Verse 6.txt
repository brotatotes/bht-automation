 Differing  (διαφορα). Old adjective from διαφερω, to differ, to vary. So Hebrews 9:10.According to the proportion of our faith  (κατα την αναλογιαν της πιστεως). The same use of πιστις (faith) as in verse Romans 12:3 "the measure of faith." Old word. αναλογια (our word "analogy") from αναλογος (analogous, conformable, proportional). Here alone in N.T. The verb προφητευωμεν (present active volitive subjunctive, let us prophesy) must be supplied with which εχοντες agrees. The context calls for the subjective meaning of "faith" rather than the objective and outward standard though πιστις does occur in that sense (Galatians 1:23; Galatians 3:23).
