 Let us give ourselves . There is no verb in the Greek. We must supply δωμεν εαυτους or some such phrase.Or he that teacheth  (ειτε ο διδασκων). Here the construction changes and no longer do we have the accusative case like διακονιαν (general word for Christian service of all kinds including ministers and deacons) as the object of εχοντες, but the nominative articular participle. A new verb must be supplied of which ο διδασκων is the subject as with the succeeding participles through verse Romans 12:8. Perhaps in each instance the verb is to be repeated from the participle like διδασκετω here (let him teach) or a general term ποιειτω (let him do it) can be used for all of them as seems necessary before "with liberality" in verse Romans 12:8 (εν απλοτητ, in simplicity, for which word, see Matthew 6:22; 2 Corinthians 8:2; 2 Corinthians 9:11; 2 Corinthians 9:13).He that ruleth  (ο προισταμενος). "The one standing in front" for which see 1 Thessalonians 5:12.With diligence  (εν σπουδη). "In haste" as if in earnest (Mark 6:25; 2 Corinthians 7:11; 2 Corinthians 8:8; 2 Corinthians 8:16), from σπευδω, to hasten. Again verse Romans 12:11.With cheerfulness  (εν ιλαροτητ). Late word, only here in N.T., from ιλαρος (2 Corinthians 9:7) cheerful, hilarious.
