 Andronicus and Junias  (Ανδρονιχου κα Ιουνιαν). The first is a Greek name found even in the imperial household. The second name can be either masculine or feminine.Kinsmen  (συγγενεις). Probably only fellow-countrymen as in Romans 9:13.Fellow-prisoners  (συναιχμαλωτυς). Late word and rare (in Lucian). One of Paul's frequent compounds with συν. Literally, fellow captives in war. Perhaps they had shared one of Paul's numerous imprisonments (2 Corinthians 11:23). In N.T. only here, Philemon 1:23; Colossians 4:10.Of note  (επισημο). Stamped, marked (επ σημα). Old word, only here and Matthew 27:16 (bad sense) in N.T.Among the apostles  (εν τοις αποστολοις). Naturally this means that they are counted among the apostles in the general sense true of Barnabas, James, the brother of Christ, Silas, and others. But it can mean simply that they were famous in the circle of the apostles in the technical sense.Who have been in Christ before me  (ο κα προ εμου γεγοναν εν Χριστω). Andronicus and Junias were converted before Paul was. Note γεγοναν (Koine form by analogy) instead of the usual second perfect active indicative form γεγονασιν, which some MSS. have. The perfect tense notes that they are still in Christ.
