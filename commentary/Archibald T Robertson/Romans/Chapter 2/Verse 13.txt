 Not the hearers--but the doers  (ου γαρ ο ακροαται--αλλ' ο ποιητα). The law was read in the synagogue, but there was no actual virtue in listening. The virtue is in doing. See a like contrast by James between "hearers" and "doers" of the gospel (James 1:22-25).Before God  (παρα τω θεω). By God's side, as God looks at it.Shall be justified  (δικαιωθησοντα). Future passive indicative of δικαιοω, to declare righteous, to set right. "Shall be declared righteous." Like James 1:22-25.
