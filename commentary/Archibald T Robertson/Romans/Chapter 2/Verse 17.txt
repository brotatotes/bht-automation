 Bearest the name  (επονομαζη). Present passive indicative in condition of first class of επονομαζω, old word, to put a name upon (επ), only here in N.T. "Thou art surnamed Jew" (Lightfoot). Jew as opposed to Greek denoted nationality while Hebrew accented the idea of language.Restest upon the law  (επαναπαυη νομω). Late and rare double compound, in LXX and once in the Didache. In N.T. only here and Luke 10:6 which see. It means to lean upon, to refresh oneself back upon anything, here with locative case (νομω). It is the picture of blind and mechanical reliance on the Mosaic law.Gloriest in God  (καυχασα εν θεω). Koine vernacular form for καυχα (καυχαεσαι, καυχασα) of καυχαομα as in verse Romans 2:23; 1 Corinthians 4:7 and κατακαυχασα in Romans 11:18. The Jew gloried in God as a national asset and private prerogative (2 Corinthians 10:15; Galatians 6:13).Approvest the things that are excellent  (δοκιμαζεις τα διαφεροντα). Originally, "Thou testest the things that differ," and then as a result comes the approval for the excellent things. As in Philippians 1:10 it is difficult to tell which stage of the process Paul has in mind.Instructed out of the law  (κατηχουμενος εκ του νομου). Present passive participle of κατηχεω, a rare verb to instruct, though occurring in the papyri for legal instruction. See on Luke 1:4; 1 Corinthians 14:19. The Jew's "ethical discernment was the fruit of catechetical and synagogical instruction in the Old Testament" (Shedd).
