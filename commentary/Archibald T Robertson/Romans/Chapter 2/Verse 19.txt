 A guide of the blind  (οδηγον τυφλων). Accusative οδηγον in predicate with εινα to agree with σεαυτον, accusative of general reference with infinitive εινα in indirect discourse after πεποιθας. Late word (Polybius, Plutarch) from οδος, way, and ηγεομα, to lead, one who leads the way. Τυφλων is objective genitive plural. The Jews were meant by God to be guides for the Gentiles, for salvation is of the Jews (John 4:22).A light  (φως). "A light for those in darkness" (των εν σκοτε, objective genitive again). But this intention of God about the Jews had resulted in conceited arrogance on their part.
