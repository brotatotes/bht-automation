 Who is one inwardly  (ο εν τω κρυπτω). Repeat Ιουδαιος (Jew) here also, "the in the inward part Jew" (circumcision of the heart περιτομη καρδιας and not a mere surgical operation as in Colossians 2:11, in the spirit εν πνευματ, with which compare 2 Corinthians 3:3; 2 Corinthians 3:6). This inward or inside Jew who lives up to his covenant relation with God is the high standard that Paul puts before the merely professional Jew described above.Whose praise  (ου ο επαινος). The antecedent of the relative ου is Ιουδαιος (Jew). Probably (Gifford) a reference to the etymology of Judah (praise) as seen in Galatians 49:8.
