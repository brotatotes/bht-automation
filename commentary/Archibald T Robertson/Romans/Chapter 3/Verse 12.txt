 They are together become unprofitable  (αμα ηχρεωθησαν). First aorist passive indicative of αχρεοω. Late word in Polybius and Cilician inscription of first century A.D. Some MSS. read ηχρειωθησαν from αχρειος, useless (α privative and χρειος, useful) as in Luke 17:10; Matthew 25:30, but Westcott and Hort print as above from the rarer spelling αχρεος. Only here in N.T. The Hebrew word means to go bad, become sour like milk (Lightfoot).No, not so much as one  (ουκ εστιν εως ενος). "There is not up to one."
