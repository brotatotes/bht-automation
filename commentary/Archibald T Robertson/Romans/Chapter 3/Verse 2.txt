 Much every way  (πολυ κατα παντα). Πολυ points back to το περισσον. So it means the overplus of the Jew is much from every angle.First of all  (πρωτον μεν). As in Romans 1:8; 1 Corinthians 11:18 Paul does not add to his "first." He singles out one privilege of the many possessed by the Jew.They were intrusted with  (επιστευθησαν). First aorist passive indicative of πιστευω, to intrust, with accusative of the thing and dative of the person in the active. In the passive as here the accusative of the thing is retained as in 1 Thessalonians 2:4.The oracles of God  (τα λογια του θεου). In the accusative case, therefore, the object of επιστευθησαν. Λογιον is probably a diminutive of λογος, word, though the adjective λογιος also occurs (Acts 18:24). The word was early used for "oracles" from Delphi and is common in the LXX for the oracles of the Lord. But from Philo on it was used of any sacred writing including narrative. It occurs four times in the N.T. (Acts 7:38, which see; Romans 3:2; Hebrews 5:12; 1 Peter 4:11). It is possible that here and in Acts 7:38 the idea may include all the Old Testament, though the commands and promises of God may be all.
