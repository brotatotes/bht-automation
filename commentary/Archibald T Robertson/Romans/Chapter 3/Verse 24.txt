 Being justified  (δικαιουμενο). Present passive participle of δικαιοω, to set right, repeated action in each case, each being set right.Freely  (δωρεαν). As in Galatians 2:21.By his grace  (τη αυτου χαριτ). Instrumental case of this wonderful word χαρις which so richly expresses Paul's idea of salvation as God's free gift.Through the redemption  (δια της απολυτρωσεως). A releasing by ransom (απο, λυτρωσις from λυτροω and that from λυτρον, ransom). God did not set men right out of hand with nothing done about men's sins. We have the words of Jesus that he came to give his life a ransom (λυτρον) for many (Mark 10:45; Matthew 20:28). Λυτρον is common in the papyri as the purchase-money in freeing slaves (Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East, pp. 327f.).That is in Christ Jesus  (τη εν Χριστω Ιησου). There can be no mistake about this redemption. It is like John 3:16.
