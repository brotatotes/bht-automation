 Through my lie  (εν τω εμω ψευσματ). ] Old word from ψευδομα, to lie, only here in N.T. Paul returns to the imaginary objection in verse Romans 3:5. The MSS. differ sharply here between ε δε (but if) and ε γαρ (for if). Paul "uses the first person from motives of delicacy" (Sanday and Headlam) in this supposable case for argument's sake as in 1 Corinthians 4:6. So here he "transfers by a fiction" (Field) to himself the objection.
