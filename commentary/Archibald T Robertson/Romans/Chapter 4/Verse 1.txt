 What then shall we say?  (τ ουν ερουμεν?). Paul is fond of this rhetorical question (Romans 4:1; Romans 6:1; Romans 7:7; Romans 8:31; Romans 9:14; Romans 9:30).Forefather  (προπατορα). Old word, only here in N.T. Accusative case in apposition with Αβρααμ (accusative of general reference with the infinitive).Hath found  (ευρηκενα). Westcott and Hort put ευρηκενα in the margin because B omits it, a needless precaution. It is the perfect active infinitive of ευρισκω in indirect discourse after ερουμεν. The MSS. differ in the position of κατα σαρκα.
