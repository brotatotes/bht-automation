 For our justification  (δια την δικαιωσιν ημων). The first clause (παρεδοθη δια τα παραπτωματα) is from Isaiah 53:12. The first δια with παραπτωματα is probably retrospective, though it will make sense as prospective (to make atonement for our transgressions). The second δια is quite clearly prospective with a view to our justification. Paul does not mean to separate the resurrection from the death of Christ in the work of atonement, but simply to show that the resurrection is at one with the death on the Cross in proof of Christ's claims.
