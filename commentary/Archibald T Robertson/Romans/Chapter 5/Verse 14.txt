 Even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression  (κα επ τους μη αμαρτησαντας επ τω ομοιωματ της παραβασεως Αδαμ). Adam violated an express command of God and Moses gave the law of God clearly. And yet sin and death followed all from Adam on till Moses, showing clearly that the sin of Adam brought terrible consequences upon the race. Death has come upon infants and idiots also as a result of sin, but one understands Paul to mean that they are not held responsible by the law of conscience.A figure  (τυπος). See on Acts 7:43; 1 Thessalonians 1:7; 2 Thessalonians 3:9; 1 Corinthians 10:6 for this word. Adam is a type of Christ in holding a relation to those affected by the headship in each case, but the parallel is not precise as Paul shows.
