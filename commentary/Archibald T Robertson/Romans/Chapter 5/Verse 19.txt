Here again we have "the one" (του ενος) with both Adam and Christ, but "disobedience" (παρακοης, for which see 2 Corinthians 10:6) contrasted with "obedience" (υπακοης), the same verb καθιστημ, old verb, to set down, to render, to constitute (κατεσταθησαν, first aorist passive indicative, κατασταθησοντα, future passive), and "the many" (ο πολλο) in both cases (but with different meaning as with "all men" above).
