 We have had  (εσχηκαμεν). Perfect active indicative of εχω (same verb as εχωμεν), still have it.Our access  (τεν προσαγωγην). Old word from προσαγω, to bring to, to introduce. Hence "introduction," "approach." Elsewhere in N.T. only Ephesians 2:18; Ephesians 3:12.Wherein we stand  (εν η εστηκαμεν). Perfect active (intransitive) indicative of ιστημ. Grace is here present as a field into which we have been introduced and where we stand and we should enjoy all the privileges of this grace about us.Let us rejoice  (καυχωμεθα). "Let us exult." Present middle subjunctive (volitive) because εχωμεν is accepted as correct. The exhortation is that we keep on enjoying peace with God and keep on exulting in hope of the glory of God.
