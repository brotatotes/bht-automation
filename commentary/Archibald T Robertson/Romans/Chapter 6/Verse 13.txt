 Neither present  (μηδε παριστανετε). Present active imperative in prohibition of παριστανω, late form of παριστημ, to place beside. Stop presenting your members or do not have the habit of doing so, "do not go on putting your members to sin as weapons of unrighteousness."Instruments  (οπλα). Old word for tools of any kind for shop or war (John 18:3; 2 Corinthians 6:7; 2 Corinthians 10:4; Romans 13:12). Possibly here figure of two armies arrayed against each other (Galatians 5:16-24), and see οπλα δικαιοσυνης below. The two sets of οπλα clash.But present yourselves unto God  (αλλα παραστησατε εαυτους τω θεω). First aorist active imperative of παριστημ, same verb, but different tense, do it now and completely. Our "members" (μελη) should be at the call of God "as alive from the dead."
