 I speak after the manner of men  (ανθρωπινον λεγω). "I speak a human word." He begs pardon for using "slaving" in connection with righteousness. But it is a good word, especially for our times when self-assertiveness and personal liberty bulk so large in modern speech. See Romans 3:5; Galatians 3:15 where he uses κατα ανθρωπον.Because of the infirmity of your flesh  (δια την ασθενειαν της σαρκος υμων). Because of defective spiritual insight largely due to moral defects also.Servants to uncleanness  (δουλα τη ακαθαρσια). Neuter plural form of δουλος to agree with μελη (members). Patently true in sexual sins, in drunkenness, and all fleshly sins, absolutely slaves like narcotic fiends.So now  (ουτως νυν). Now that you are born again in Christ. Paul uses twice again the same verb παριστημ, to present (παρεστησατε, παραστησατε).Servants to righteousness  (δουλα τη δικαιοσυνη). Repeats the idea of verse Romans 6:18.Unto sanctification  (εις αγιασμον). This the goal, the blessed consummation that demands and deserves the new slavery without occasional lapses or sprees (verse Romans 6:15). This late word appears only in LXX, N.T., and ecclesiastical writers so far. See on 1 Thessalonians 4:3; 1 Corinthians 1:30. Paul includes sanctification in his conception of the God-kind (Romans 1:17) of righteousness (both justification, Romans 1:18-5 and sanctification, chapters Romans 6:6-8). It is a life process of consecration, not an instantaneous act. Paul shows that we ought to be sanctified (Romans 6:1-7) and illustrates the obligation by death (Romans 6:1-14), by slavery (Romans 6:15-23), and by marriage (Romans 7:1-6).
