 A different law  (ετερον νομον). For the distinction between ετερος and αλλος, see Galatians 1:6.Warring against  (αντιστρατευομενον). Rare verb (Xenophon) to carry on a campaign against. Only here in N.T.The law of my mind  (τω νομω του νοος). The reflective intelligence Paul means by νοος, "the inward man" of verse Romans 7:22. It is this higher self that agrees that the law of God is good (Romans 7:12; Romans 7:16; Romans 7:22).Bringing me into captivity  (αιχμαλωτιζοντα). See on this late and vivid verb for capture and slavery Luke 21:24; 2 Corinthians 10:5. Surely it is a tragic picture drawn by Paul with this outcome, "sold under sin" (Romans 7:14), "captivity to the law of sin" (Romans 7:23). The ancient writers (Plato, Ovid, Seneca, Epictetus) describe the same dual struggle in man between his conscience and his deeds.
