 O wretched man that I am  (ταλαιπωρος εγω ανθρωπος). "Wretched man I." Old adjective from τλαω, to bear, and πωρος, a callus. In N.T. only here and Revelation 3:17. "A heart-rending cry from the depths of despair" (Sanday and Headlam).Out of the body of this death  (εκ του σωματος του θανατου τουτου). So the order of words demands. See verse Romans 7:13 for "death" which finds a lodgment in the body (Lightfoot). If one feels that Paul has exaggerated his own condition, he has only to recall 1 Timothy 1:15 when he describes himself a chief of sinners. He dealt too honestly with himself for Pharisaic complacency to live long.
