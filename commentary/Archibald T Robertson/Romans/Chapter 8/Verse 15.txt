 The spirit of adoption  (πνευμα υιοθεσιας). See on this term υιοθεσια, Galatians 4:5. Both Jews and Gentiles receive this "adoption" into the family of God with all its privileges. " Whereby we cry, Abba, Father " (εν η κραζομεν Αββα ο πατηρ). See Galatians 4:6 for discussion of this double use of Father as the child's privilege.
