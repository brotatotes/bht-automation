 The Spirit himself  (αυτο το πνευμα). The grammatical gender of πνευμα is neuter as here, but the Greek used also the natural gender as we do exclusively as in John 16:13 εκεινος (masculinehe ), το πνευμα (neuter). See also John 16:26 (ο--εκεινος). It is a grave mistake to use the neuter "it" or "itself" when referring to the Holy Spirit.Beareth witness with our spirit  (συμμαρτυρε τω πνευματ ημων). See on Romans 2:15 for this verb with associative instrumental case. See 1 John 5:10 for this double witness.
