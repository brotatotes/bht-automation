 The law of the Spirit of life  (ο νομος του πνευματος της ζωης). The principle or authority exercised by the Holy Spirit which bestows life and which rests "in Christ Jesus."Made me free  (ηλευθερωσεν με). First aorist active indicative of the old verb ελευθεροω for which see Galatians 5:1. Aleph B have σε (thee) instead of με. It matters little. We are pardoned, we are free from the old law of sin and death (Romans 7:7-24), we are able by the help of the Holy Spirit to live the new life in Christ.
