 For by hope were we saved  (τη γαρ ελπιδ εσωθημεν). First aorist passive indicative of σωζω. The case of ελπιδ is not certain, the form being the same for locative, instrumental and dative. Curiously enough either makes good sense in this context: "We were saved in hope, by hope, for hope" (of the redemption of the body).
