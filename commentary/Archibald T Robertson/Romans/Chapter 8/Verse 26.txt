 Helpeth our infirmity  (συναντιλαμβανετα τη ασθενεια ημων). Present middle indicative of συναντιλαμβανομα, late and striking double compound (Diodorus, LXX, Josephus, frequent in inscriptions, Deissmann, Light, etc., p. 87), to lend a hand together with, at the same time with one. Only twice in N.T., here and Luke 10:40 in Martha's plea for Mary's help. Here beautifully Paul pictures the Holy Spirit taking hold at our side at the very time of our weakness (associative instrumental case) and before too late.How to pray  (το τ προσευξωμεθα). Articular clause object of οιδαμεν (we know) and indirect question with the deliberative aorist middle subjunctive προσευξωμεθα, retained in the indirect question.As we ought  (καθο δε). "As it is necessary." How true this is of all of us in our praying.Maketh intercession  (υπερεντυγχανε). Present active indicative of late double compound, found only here and in later ecclesiastical writers, but εντυγχανω occurs in verse Romans 8:27 (a common verb). It is a picturesque word of rescue by one who "happens on" (εντυγχανε) one who is in trouble and "in his behalf" (υπερ) pleads "with unuttered groanings" (instrumental case) or with "sighs that baffle words" (Denney). This is work of our Helper, the Spirit himself.
