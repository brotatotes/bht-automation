 Called  (εκαλεσεν)--Justified  (εδικαιωσεν)--Glorified  (εδοξασεν). All first aorist active indicatives of common verbs (καλεω, δικαιοω, δοξαζω). But the glorification is stated as already consummated (constative aorists, all of them), though still in the future in the fullest sense. "The step implied in εδοξασεν is both complete and certain in the Divine counsels" (Sanday and Headlam).
