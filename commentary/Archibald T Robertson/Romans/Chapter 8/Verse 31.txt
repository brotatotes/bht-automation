 For these things  (προς ταυτα). From Romans 8:12 on Paul has made a triumphant presentation of the reasons for the certainty of final sanctification of the sons of God. He has reached the climax with glorification (εδοξασεν in verse Romans 8:30). But Paul lets the objector have his say as he usually does so that in verses Romans 8:31-39 he considers the objections.If God is for us, who is against us?  (ε ο θεος υπερ ημων, τις καθ' ημων?). This condition of the first class carries Paul's challenge to all doubters. There is no one on a par with God. Note the two prepositions in contrast (υπερ, over, κατα, down or against).
