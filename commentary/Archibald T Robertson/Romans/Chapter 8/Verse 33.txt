 Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?  (τις εγκαλεσε κατα εκλεκτων θεου?). Future active indicative of εγκαλεω, old verb, to come forward as accuser (forensic term) in case in court, to impeach, as in Acts 19:40; Acts 23:29; Acts 26:2, the only N.T. examples. Satan is the great Accuser of the brethren.It is God that justifieth  (θεος ο δικαιων). God is the Judge who sets us right according to his plan for justification (Romans 3:21-31). The Accuser must face the Judge with his charges.
