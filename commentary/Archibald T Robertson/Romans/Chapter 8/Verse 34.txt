 Shall condemn  (κατακρινων). Can be either present active participle (condemns) or the future (shall condemn). It is a bold accuser who can face God with false charges or with true ones for that matter for we have an "Advocate" at God's Court (1 John 2:1), "who is at the right hand of God" (ος εστιν εν δεξια του θεου) "who also maketh intercession for us" (ος κα εντυγχανε υπερ ημων). Our Advocate paid the debt for our sins with his blood. The score is settled. We are free (Romans 8:1).
