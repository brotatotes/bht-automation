 Shall separate  (χωρισε). Future active of old verb χοριζω from adverb χωρις and that from χωρα, space. Can any one put a distance between Christ's love and us (objective genitive)? Can any one lead Christ to cease loving us? Such things do happen between husband and wife, alas. Paul changes the figure from "who" (τις) to "what" (τ). The items mentioned will not make Christ love us less. Paul here glories in tribulations as in Romans 5:3.
