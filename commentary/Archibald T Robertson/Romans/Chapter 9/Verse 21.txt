 Or hath not the potter a right over the clay?  (η ουκ εχε εξουσιαν ο κεραμευς του πηλου?). This question, expecting an affirmative answer, is Paul's reply to the previous one, "Why didst thou make me thus?" Πηλος, old word for clay, is mud or wet clay in John 9:6; John 9:11; John 9:14. The old word for potter (κεραμευς) in N.T. only here and Matthew 27:7; Matthew 27:10.Lump  (φυραματος). Late word from φυραω, to mix (clay, dough, etc.).One part  (ο μεν)--another  (ο δε). Regular idiom for contrast (μεν--δε) with the old demonstrative ο (this), "this vessel (σκευος, old word as in Mark 11:16) for honour, that for dishonour." Paul thus claims clearly God's sovereign right (εξουσιαν, power, right, authority, from εξεστ) to use men (already sinners) for his own purpose.
