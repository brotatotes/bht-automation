 Willing  (θελων). Concessive use of the participle, "although willing," not causal, "because willing" as is shown by "with much long-suffering" (εν πολλη μακροθυμια, in much long-suffering).His power  (το δυνατον αυτου). Neuter singular of the verbal adjective rather than the substantive δυναμιν.Endured  (ηνεγκεν). Constative second aorist active indicative of the old defective verb φερω, to bear.Vessels of wrath  (σκευη οργης). The words occur in Jeremiah 50:25 (LXX Jeremiah 27:25), but not in the sense here (objective genitive like τεκνα οργης, Ephesians 2:3, the objects of God's wrath).Fitted  (κατηρτισμενα). Perfect passive participle of καταρτιζω, old verb to equip (see Matthew 4:21; 2 Corinthians 13:11), state of readiness. Paul does not say here that God did it or that they did it. That they are responsible may be seen from 1 Thessalonians 2:15.Unto destruction  (εις απωλειαν). Endless perdition (Matthew 7:13; 2 Thessalonians 2:3; Philippians 3:19), not annihilation.
