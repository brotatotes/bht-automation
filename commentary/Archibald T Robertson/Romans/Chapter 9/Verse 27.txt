 Isaiah  (Εσαιας). Shortened quotation from Isaiah 10:22 (LXX).It is the remnant that shall be saved  (το υπολειμμα σωθησετα). First future passive of σωζω. Literally, "the remnant will be saved." Late word from υπολειπω, to leave behind (Romans 11:3), here only in N.T. Textus Receptus has καταλειμμα, but Aleph A B have υπολειμμα. Isaiah cries in anguish over the outlook for Israel, but sees hope for the remnant.
