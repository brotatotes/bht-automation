 I could wish  (ηυχομην). Idiomatic imperfect, "I was on the point of wishing." We can see that ευχομα (I do wish) would be wrong to say. Αν ηυχομην would mean that he does not wish (conclusion of second class condition). Αν ηυχομην would be conclusion of fourth class condition and too remote. He is shut up to the imperfect indicative (Robertson, Grammar, p. 886).Anathema  (αναθεμα). See for this word as distinct from αναθημα (offering) 1 Corinthians 12:3; Galatians 1:8  I myself  (αυτος εγω). Nominative with the infinitive εινα and agreeing with subject of ηυχομην.According to the flesh  (κατα σαρκα). As distinguished from Paul's Christian brethren.
