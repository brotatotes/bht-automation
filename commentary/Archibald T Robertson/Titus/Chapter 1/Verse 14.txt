See 1 Timothy 1:4 for προσεχω and μυθοις, only here we have Jewish (Ιουδαικοις) added. Perhaps a reference to the oral traditions condemned by Christ in Mark 7:2-8. See also Colossians 2:22, apparently Pharisaic type of Gnostics.Who turn away from the truth  (αποστρεφομενων). Present middle (direct) participle of αποστρεφω, "men turning themselves away from the truth" (accusative according to regular idiom). "The truth" (1 Timothy 4:3) is the gospel (Ephesians 4:21).
