 My true child  (γνησιω τεκνω). See 1 Timothy 1:2 for this adjective with Timothy. Titus is not mentioned in Acts, possibly because he is Luke's brother. But one can get a clear picture of him by turning to 2 Corinthians 2:13; 2 Corinthians 7:6-15; 2 Corinthians 8:6-24; 2 Corinthians 12:16-18; Galatians 2:1-3; Titus 1:4; Titus 3:12; 2 Timothy 4:10. He had succeeded in Corinth where Timothy had failed. Paul had left him in Crete as superintendent of the work there. Now he writes him from Nicopolis (Titus 3:12).After a common faith  (κατα κοινην πιστιν). Here κατα does mean standard, not aim, but it is a faith (πιστιν) common to a Gentile (a Greek) like Titus as well as to a Jew like Paul and so common to all races and classes (Jude 1:3). Κοινος does not here have the notion of unclean as in Acts 10:14; Acts 11:8.
