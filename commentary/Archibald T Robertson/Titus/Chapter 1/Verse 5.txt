 For this cause  (τουτου χαριν). In N.T. only here and Ephesians 3:1; Ephesians 3:14. Paul may be supplementing oral instruction as in Timothy's case and may even be replying to a letter from Titus (Zahn).Left I thee in Crete  (απελειπον σε εν Κρητη). This is the imperfect active of απολειπω, though MSS. give the aorist active also (απελιπον) and some read κατελειπον or κατελιπον. Both are common verbs, though Paul uses καταλειπω only in 1 Thessalonians 3:1 except two quotations (Romans 11:4; Ephesians 5:31) and απολειπω only here and 2 Timothy 4:13; 2 Timothy 4:20. Perhaps απολειπω suggests a more temporary stay than καταλειπω. Paul had apparently stopped in Crete on his return from Spain about A.D. 65.That thou shouldest set in order  (ινα επιδιορθωση). Late and rare double compound (inscriptions, here only in N.T.), first aorist middle subjunctive (final clause with ινα) of επιδιορθοω, to set straight (ορθοω) thoroughly (δια) in addition (επ), a clean job of it.The things that were wanting  (τα λειποντα). "The things that remain." See Titus 3:13; Luke 18:22. Either things left undone or things that survive. In both senses the new pastor faces problems after the tornado has passed. Parry takes it "of present defects" in Cretan character.And appoint  (κα καταστησηις). Final clause still and first aorist active subjunctive of καθιστημ, the word used in Acts 6:13 about the deacons. The word does not preclude the choice by the churches (in every city, κατα πολιν, distributive use of κατα). This is a chief point in the επιδορθωσις (White).Elders  (πρεσβυτερους). See 1 Timothy 3:2; 1 Timothy 4:17.As I gave thee charge  (ως εγω σο διεταξαμην). First aorist (constative) middle imperative of διατασσω, clear reference to previous personal details given to Titus on previous occasions.
