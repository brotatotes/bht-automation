 Now I beseech you  (παρακαλω δε υμας). Old and common verb, over 100 times in N.T., to call to one's side. Corresponds here to ευχαριστω,I thank , in verse 1 Corinthians 1:4. Direct appeal after the thanksgiving.Through the name  (δια του ονοματος). Genitive, not accusative (cause or reason), as the medium or instrument of the appeal (2 Corinthians 10:1; Romans 12:1; Romans 15:30).That  (ινα). Purport (sub-final) rather than direct purpose, common idiom in Koine (Robertson, Grammar, pp.991-4) like Matthew 14:36. Used here with λεγητε, ηι, ητε κατηρτισμενο, though expressed only once.All speak  (λεγητε παντες). Present active subjunctive, that ye all keep on speaking. With the divisions in mind. An idiom from Greek political life (Lightfoot). This touch of the classical writers argues for Paul's acquaintance with Greek culture.There be no divisions among you  (μη η εν υμιν σχισματα). Present subjunctive, that divisions may not continue to be (they already had them). Negative statement of preceding idea. Σχισμα is from σχιζω, old word to split or rend, and so means a rent (Matthew 9:16; Mark 2:21). Papyri use it for a splinter of wood and for ploughing. Here we have the earliest instance of its use in a moral sense of division, dissension, see also 1 Corinthians 11:18 where a less complete change than αιρεσεις; 1 Corinthians 12:25; John 7:43 (discord); 1 Corinthians 9:16; 1 Corinthians 10:19. "Here, faction, for which the classical word is στασις: division within the Christian community" (Vincent). These divisions were over the preachers (1 Corinthians 1:12-4), immorality (1 Corinthians 5:1-13), going to law before the heathen (1 Corinthians 6:1-11), marriage (1 Corinthians 7:1-40), meats offered to idols (1 Corinthians 1:1), conduct of women in church (1 Corinthians 11:1-16), the Lord's Supper (1 Corinthians 11:17-34), spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians 1:1), the resurrection (1 Corinthians 1:1).But that ye be perfected together  (ητε δε κατηρτισμενο). Periphrastic perfect passive subjunctive. See this verb in Matthew 4:21 (Mark 1:19) for mending torn nets and in moral sense already in 1 Thessalonians 3:10. Galen uses it for a surgeon's mending a joint and Herodotus for composing factions. See 2 Corinthians 13:11; Galatians 6:1.Mind  (νο),judgment  (γνωμη). "Of these words νους denotes the frame or state of mind, γνωμη the judgment, opinion or sentiment, which is the outcome of νους" (Lightfoot).
