<p><b> For it hath been signified unto me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδηλωθη γαρ μο</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δηλοω</span></span> and difficult to render into English. Literally, It was signified to me.</p>
<p><b>By them of Chloe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο των Χλοης</span></span>). Ablative case of the masculine plural article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των</span></span>, by the (folks) of Chloe (genitive case). The words "which are of the household" are not in the Greek, though they correctly interpret the Greek, "those of Chloe." Whether the children, the kinspeople, or the servants of Chloe we do not know. It is uncertain also whether Chloe lived in Corinth or Ephesus, probably Ephesus because to name her if in Corinth might get her into trouble (Heinrici). Already Christianity was working a social revolution in the position of women and slaves. The name</p>
<p><b>Chloe </b> means tender verdure and was one of the epithets of Demeter the goddess of agriculture and for that reason Lightfoot thinks that she was a member of the freedman class like Phoebe (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:1">Romans 16:1</span>), Hermes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:14">Romans 16:14</span>), Nereus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:15">Romans 16:15</span>). It is even possible that Stephanas, Fortunatus, Achaicus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:17">1 Corinthians 16:17</span>) may have been those who brought Chloe the news of the schisms in Corinth.</p>
<p><b>Contentions </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εριδες</span></span>). Unseemly wranglings (as opposed to discussing, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαλεγομα</span></span>) that were leading to the</p>
<p><b>schisms </b>. Listed in works of the flesh (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:19">Galatians 5:19</span>) and the catalogues of vices (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:20">2 Corinthians 12:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:19">Romans 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:4">1 Timothy 6:4</span>). </p>
