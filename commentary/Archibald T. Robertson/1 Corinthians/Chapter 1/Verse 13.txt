<p><b> Is Christ divided? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεμεριστα ο Χριστοσ;</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative, Does Christ stand divided? It is not certain, though probable, that this is interrogative like the following clauses. Hofmann calls the assertory form a "rhetorical impossibility." The absence of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> here merely allows an affirmative answer which is true. The fourth or Christ party claimed to possess Christ in a sense not true of the others. Perhaps the leaders of this Christ party with their arrogant assumptions of superiority are the false apostles, ministers of Satan posing as angels of light (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:12-15">2 Corinthians 11:12-15</span>).</p>
<p><b>Was Paul crucified for you? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη Παυλος εσταυρωθη υπερ υμων;</span></span>). An indignant "No" is demanded by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>. Paul shows his tact by employing himself as the illustration, rather than Apollos or Cephas. Probably <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span>, over, in behalf of, rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> (concerning, around) is genuine, though either makes good sense here. In the <i>Koine</i> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> encroaches on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1">2 Thessalonians 2:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Were ye baptized into the name of Paul? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ονομα Παυλου εβαπτισθητε;</span></span>). It is unnecessary to say</p>
<p><b>into </b> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> rather than</p>
<p><b>in </b> since <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> is the same preposition originally as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> and both are used with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτιζω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:16">Acts 8:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:48">Acts 10:48</span> with no difference in idea (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 592). Paul evidently knows the idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> and scouts the notion of being put on a par with Christ or the Trinity. He is no rival of Christ. This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span> for the person is not only in the LXX, but the papyri, ostraca, and inscriptions give numerous examples of the name of the king or the god for the power and authority of the king or god (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, pp. 146ff., 196ff.; <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 121). </p>
