 I thank God  (ευχαριστω τω θεω). See verse 1 Corinthians 1:4, though uncertain if τω θεω is genuine here.Save Crispus and Gaius  (ε μη Κρισπον κα Γαιον). Crispus was the ruler of the synagogue in Corinth before his conversion (Acts 18:8), a Roman cognomen, and Gaius a Roman praenomen, probably the host of Paul and of the whole church in Corinth (Romans 16:23), possibly though not clearly the hospitable Gaius of 3 John 1:5; 3 John 1:6. The prominence and importance of these two may explain why Paul baptized them.
