<p><b> I thank God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστω τω θεω</span></span>). See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:4">1 Corinthians 1:4</span>, though uncertain if <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω θεω</span></span> is genuine here.</p>
<p><b>Save Crispus and Gaius </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη Κρισπον κα Γαιον</span></span>). Crispus was the ruler of the synagogue in Corinth before his conversion (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:8">Acts 18:8</span>), a Roman cognomen, and Gaius a Roman praenomen, probably the host of Paul and of the whole church in Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span>), possibly though not clearly the hospitable Gaius of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:5">3 John 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:6">3 John 1:6</span>. The prominence and importance of these two may explain why Paul baptized them. </p>
