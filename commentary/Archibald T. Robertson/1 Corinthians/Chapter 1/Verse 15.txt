<p><b> Lest any man should say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη τις ειπη</span></span>). Certainly sub-final <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> again or contemplated result as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:29">1 Corinthians 7:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:2">John 9:2</span>. Ellicott thinks that already some in Corinth were laying emphasis on the person of the baptizer whether Peter or some one else. It is to be recalled that Jesus himself baptized no one (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:2">John 4:2</span>) to avoid this very kind of controversy. And yet there are those today who claim Paul as a sacramentalist, an impossible claim in the light of his words here. </p>
