<p><b> Also the household of Stephanas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τον Στεφανα οικον</span></span>). Mentioned as an afterthought. Robertson and Plummer suggest that Paul's amanuensis reminded him of this case. Paul calls him a first-fruit of Achaia (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15">1 Corinthians 16:15</span>) and so earlier than Crispus and he was one of the three who came to Paul from Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:17">1 Corinthians 16:17</span>), clearly a family that justified Paul's personal attention about baptism.</p>
<p><b>Besides </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λοιπον</span></span>). Accusative of general reference, "as for anything else." Added to make clear that he is not meaning to omit any one who deserves mention. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:1">1 Thessalonians 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:2">1 Corinthians 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11">2 Corinthians 13:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>. Ellicott insists on a sharp distinction from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το λοιπον</span></span> "as for the rest" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:1">2 Thessalonians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:1">Philippians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:8">Philippians 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:10">Ephesians 6:10</span>). Paul casts no reflection on baptism, for he could not with his conception of it as the picture of the new life in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:2-6">Romans 6:2-6</span>), but he clearly denies here that he considers baptism essential to the remission of sin or the means of obtaining forgiveness. </p>
