<p><b> For the word of the cross </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λογος γαρ ο του σταυρου</span></span>). Literally, "for the preaching (with which I am concerned as the opposite of</p>
<p><b>wisdom of word </b> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:17">1 Corinthians 1:17</span>) that (repeated article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span>, almost demonstrative) of the cross." "Through this incidental allusion to preaching St. Paul passes to a new subject. The discussions in the Corinthian Church are for a time forgotten, and he takes the opportunity of correcting his converts for their undue exaltation of human eloquence and wisdom" (Lightfoot).</p>
<p><b>To them that are perishing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις μεν απολλυμενοις</span></span>). Dative of disadvantage (personal interest). Present middle participle is here timeless, those in the path to destruction (not annihilation. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:10">2 Thessalonians 2:10</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:3">2 Corinthians 4:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Foolishness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωρια</span></span>). Folly. Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωρος</span></span>, foolish. In N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18">1 Corinthians 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:21">1 Corinthians 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:23">1 Corinthians 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14">1 Corinthians 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:19">1 Corinthians 3:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>But unto us which are being saved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις σωζομενοις ημιν</span></span>). Sharp contrast to those that are perishing and same construction with the articular participle. No reason for the change of pronouns in English. This present passive participle is again timeless. Salvation is described by Paul as a thing done in the past, "we were saved" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:24">Romans 8:24</span>), as a present state, "ye have been saved" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span>), as a process, "ye are being saved" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:2">1 Corinthians 15:2</span>), as a future result, "thou shalt be saved" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:9">Romans 10:9</span>).</p>
<p><b>The power of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις θεου</span></span>). So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>. No other message has this dynamite of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:20">1 Corinthians 4:20</span>). God's power is shown in the preaching of the Cross of Christ through all the ages, now as always. No other preaching wins men and women from sin to holiness or can save them. The judgment of Paul here is the verdict of every soul winner through all time. </p>
