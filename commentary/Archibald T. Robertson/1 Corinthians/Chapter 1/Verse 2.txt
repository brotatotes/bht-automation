<p><b> The church of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εκκλησια του θεου</span></span>). Belonging to God, not to any individual or faction, as this genitive case shows. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span> Paul wrote "the church of the Thessalonians in God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν θεω</span></span>), but "the churches of God" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:14">1 Thessalonians 2:14</span>. See same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:32">1 Corinthians 10:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:16">1 Corinthians 11:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:22">1 Corinthians 11:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:9">1 Corinthians 15:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:1">2 Corinthians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:13">Galatians 1:13</span>, etc.</p>
<p><b>Which is in Corinth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη ουση εν Κορινθω</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span> for idiom. It is God's church even in Corinth, "<i>laetum et ingens paradoxon</i>" (Bengel). This city, destroyed by Mummius B.C. 146, had been restored by Julius Caesar a hundred years later, B.C. 44, and now after another hundred years has become very rich and very corrupt. The very word "to Corinthianize" meant to practise vile immoralities in the worship of Aphrodite (Venus). It was located on the narrow Isthmus of the Peloponnesus with two harbours (Lechaeum and Cenchreae). It had schools of rhetoric and philosophy and made a flashy imitation of the real culture of Athens. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18">1 Corinthians 1:18</span> for the story of Paul's work here and now the later developments and divisions in this church will give Paul grave concern as is shown in detail in I and II Corinthians. All the problems of a modern city church come to the front in Corinth. They call for all the wisdom and statesmanship in Paul.</p>
<p><b>That are sanctified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγιασμενοις</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιαζω</span></span>, late form for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιζω</span></span>, so far found only in the Greek Bible and in ecclesiastical writers. It means to make or to declare <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιον</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγος</span></span>, awe, reverence, and this from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αζω</span></span>, to venerate). It is significant that Paul uses this word concerning the</p>
<p><b>called saints </b> or</p>
<p><b>called to be saints </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλητοις αγιοις</span></span>) in Corinth. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλητος αποστολος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span>. It is because they are sanctified</p>
<p><b>in Christ Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Χριστω Ιησου</span></span>). He is the sphere in which this act of consecration takes place. Note plural, construction according to sense, because <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησια</span></span> is a collective substantive.</p>
<p><b>With all that call upon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν πασιν τοις επικαλουμενοις</span></span>). Associative instrumental case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> (and), making a close connection with "saints" just before and so giving the Corinthian Christians a picture of their close unity with the brotherhood everywhere through the common bond of faith. This phrase occurs in the LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:8">Genesis 12:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:9">Zechariah 13:9</span>) and is applied to Christ as to Jehovah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:7">2 Thessalonians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:9">2 Thessalonians 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:12">2 Thessalonians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9">Philippians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:10">Philippians 2:10</span>). Paul heard Stephen pray to Christ as Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:59">Acts 7:59</span>). Here "with a plain and direct reference to the Divinity of our Lord" (Ellicott).</p>
<p><b>Their Lord and ours </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτων κα ημων</span></span>). This is the interpretation of the Greek commentators and is the correct one, an afterthought and expansion (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επανορθωσις</span></span>) of the previous "our," showing the universality of Christ. </p>
