 Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world?  (Που σοφοσ; που γραμματευσ; που συνζητητης του αιωνος τουτου;). Paul makes use of Isaiah 33:18 without exact quotation. The sudden retreat of Sennacherib with the annihilation of his officers. "On the tablet of Shalmaneser in the Assyrian Gallery of the British Museum there is a surprisingly exact picture of the scene described by Isaiah" (Robertson and Plummer). Note the absence of the Greek article in each of these rhetorical questions though the idea is clearly definite. Probably σοφος refers to the Greek philosopher, γραμματευς to the Jewish scribe and συνζητητης suits both the Greek and the Jewish disputant and doubter (Acts 6:9; Acts 9:29; Acts 17:18; Acts 28:29). There is a note of triumph in these questions. The word συνζητητης occurs here alone in the N.T. and elsewhere only in Ignatius, Eph. 18 quoting this passage, but the papyri give the verb συνζητεω for disputing (questioning together).Hath not God made foolish?  (ουχ εμωρανεν ο θεοσ;). Strong negative form with aorist active indicative difficult of precise translation, "Did not God make foolish?" The old verb μωραινω from μωρος, foolish, was to be foolish, to act foolish, then to prove one foolish as here or to make foolish as in Romans 1:22. In Matthew 5:13; Luke 14:34 it is used of salt that is tasteless.World  (κοσμου). Synonymous with αιων (age), orderly arrangement, then the non-Christian cosmos.
