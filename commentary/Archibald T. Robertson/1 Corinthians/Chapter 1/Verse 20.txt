<p><b> Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Που σοφοσ; που γραμματευσ; που συνζητητης του αιωνος τουτου;</span></span>). Paul makes use of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+33:18">Isaiah 33:18</span> without exact quotation. The sudden retreat of Sennacherib with the annihilation of his officers. "On the tablet of Shalmaneser in the Assyrian Gallery of the British Museum there is a surprisingly exact picture of the scene described by Isaiah" (Robertson and Plummer). Note the absence of the Greek article in each of these rhetorical questions though the idea is clearly definite. Probably <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφος</span></span> refers to the Greek philosopher, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραμματευς</span></span> to the Jewish scribe and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνζητητης</span></span> suits both the Greek and the Jewish disputant and doubter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:9">Acts 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:29">Acts 9:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:29">Acts 28:29</span>). There is a note of triumph in these questions. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνζητητης</span></span> occurs here alone in the N.T. and elsewhere only in Ignatius, Eph. 18 quoting this passage, but the papyri give the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνζητεω</span></span> for disputing (questioning together).</p>
<p><b>Hath not God made foolish? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ εμωρανεν ο θεοσ;</span></span>). Strong negative form with aorist active indicative difficult of precise translation, "Did not God make foolish?" The old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωραινω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωρος</span></span>, foolish, was to be foolish, to act foolish, then to prove one foolish as here or to make foolish as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:22">Romans 1:22</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:13">Matthew 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:34">Luke 14:34</span> it is used of salt that is tasteless.</p>
<p><b>World </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοσμου</span></span>). Synonymous with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιων</span></span> (age), orderly arrangement, then the non-Christian cosmos. </p>
