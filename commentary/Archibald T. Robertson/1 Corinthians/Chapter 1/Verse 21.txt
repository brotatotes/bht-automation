 Seeing that  (επειδη). Since (επε and δη) with explanatory γαρ.Through its wisdom  (δια της σοφιας). Article here as possessive. The two wisdoms contrasted.Knew not God  (ουκ εγνω). Failed to know, second aorist (effective) active indicative of γινωσκω, solemn dirge of doom on both Greek philosophy and Jewish theology that failed to know God. Has modern philosophy done better? There is today even a godless theology (Humanism). "Now that God's wisdom has reduced the self-wise world to ignorance" (Findlay).Through the foolishness of the preaching  (δια της μωριας του κηρυγματος). Perhaps "proclamation" is the idea, for it is not κηρυξις, the act of heralding, but κηρυγμα, the message heralded or the proclamation as in verse 1 Corinthians 1:23. The metaphor is that of the herald proclaiming the approach of the king (Matthew 3:1; Matthew 4:17). See also κηρυγμα in 1 Corinthians 2:4; 2 Timothy 4:17. The proclamation of the Cross seemed foolishness to the wiseacres then (and now), but it is consummate wisdom, God's wisdom and good-pleasure (ευδοκησαν). The foolishness of preaching is not the preaching of foolishness.To save them that believe  (σωσα τους πιστευοντας). This is the heart of God's plan of redemption, the proclamation of salvation for all those who trust Jesus Christ on the basis of his death for sin on the Cross. The mystery-religions all offered salvation by initiation and ritual as the Pharisees did by ceremonialism. Christianity reaches the heart directly by trust in Christ as the Saviour. It is God's wisdom.
