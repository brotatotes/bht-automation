<p><b> Seeing that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επειδη</span></span>). Since (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επε</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δη</span></span>) with explanatory <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Through its wisdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια της σοφιας</span></span>). Article here as possessive. The two wisdoms contrasted.</p>
<p><b>Knew not God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εγνω</span></span>). Failed to know, second aorist (effective) active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, solemn dirge of doom on both Greek philosophy and Jewish theology that failed to know God. Has modern philosophy done better? There is today even a godless theology (Humanism). "Now that God's wisdom has reduced the self-wise world to ignorance" (Findlay).</p>
<p><b>Through the foolishness of the preaching </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια της μωριας του κηρυγματος</span></span>). Perhaps "proclamation" is the idea, for it is not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυξις</span></span>, the act of heralding, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυγμα</span></span>, the message heralded or the proclamation as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:23">1 Corinthians 1:23</span>. The metaphor is that of the herald proclaiming the approach of the king (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:1">Matthew 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:17">Matthew 4:17</span>). See also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυγμα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:4">1 Corinthians 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:17">2 Timothy 4:17</span>. The proclamation of the Cross seemed foolishness to the wiseacres then (and now), but it is consummate wisdom, God's wisdom and good-pleasure (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδοκησαν</span></span>). The foolishness of preaching is not the preaching of foolishness.</p>
<p><b>To save them that believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωσα τους πιστευοντας</span></span>). This is the heart of God's plan of redemption, the proclamation of salvation for all those who trust Jesus Christ on the basis of his death for sin on the Cross. The mystery-religions all offered salvation by initiation and ritual as the Pharisees did by ceremonialism. Christianity reaches the heart directly by trust in Christ as the Saviour. It is God's wisdom. </p>
