 Seeing that  (επειδη). Resumes from verse 1 Corinthians 1:21. The structure is not clear, but probably verses 1 Corinthians 1:23; 1 Corinthians 1:24 form a sort of conclusion or apodosis to verse 1 Corinthians 1:22 the protasis. The resumptive, almost inferential, use of δε like αλλα in the apodosis is not unusual.Ask for signs  (σημεια αιτουσιν). The Jews often came to Jesus asking for signs (Matthew 12:38; Matthew 16:1; John 6:30).Seek after wisdom  (σοφιαν ζητουσιν). "The Jews claimed to possess the truth: the Greeks were seekers, speculators" (Vincent) as in Acts 17:23.
