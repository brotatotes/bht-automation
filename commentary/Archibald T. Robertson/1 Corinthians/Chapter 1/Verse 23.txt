 But we preach Christ crucified  (ημεις δε κηρυσσομεν Χριστον εσταυρωμενον). Grammatically stated as a partial result (δε) of the folly of both Jews and Greeks, actually in sharp contrast. We proclaim, "we do not discuss or dispute" (Lightfoot). Christ (Messiah) as crucified, as in 1 Corinthians 2:2; Galatians 3:1, "not a sign-shower nor a philosopher" (Vincent). Perfect passive participle of σταυροω.Stumbling-block  (σκανδαλον). Papyri examples mean trap or snare which here tripped the Jews who wanted a conquering Messiah with a world empire, not a condemned and crucified one (Matthew 27:42; Luke 24:21).Foolishness  (μωριαν). Folly as shown by their conduct in Athens (Acts 17:32).
