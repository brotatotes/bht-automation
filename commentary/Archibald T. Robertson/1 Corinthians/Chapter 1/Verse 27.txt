 God chose  (εξελεξατο ο θεος). First aorist middle of εκλεγω, old verb to pick out, to choose, the middle for oneself. It expands the idea in κλησιν (verse 1 Corinthians 1:26). Three times this solemn verb occurs here with the purpose stated each time. Twice the same purpose is expressed,that he might put to shame  (ινα καταισχυνη, first aorist active subjunctive with ινα of old verb καταισχυνω, perfective use of κατα). The purpose in the third example isthat he might bring to naught  (ινα καταργηση, make idle, αργος, rare in old Greek, but frequent in Paul). The contrast is complete in each paradox:the foolish things  (τα μωρα),the wild men  (τους σοφους);the weak things  (τα ασθενη),the strong things  (τα ισχυρα);the things that are not  (τα μη οντα),and that are despised  (τα εξουθενημενα, considered nothing, perfect passive participle of εξουθενεω),the things that are  (τα οντα). It is a studied piece of rhetoric and powerfully put.
