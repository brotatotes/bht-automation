<p><b> That no flesh should glory before God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως μη καυχησητα πασα σαρξ ενωπιον του θεου</span></span>). This is the further purpose expressed by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως</span></span> for variety and appeals to God's ultimate choice in all three instances. The first aorist middle of the old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχαομα</span></span>, to boast, brings out sharply that not a single boast is to be made. The papyri give numerous examples of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωπιον</span></span> as a preposition in the vernacular, from adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν-ωπιος</span></span>, in the eye of God. One should turn to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:7">2 Corinthians 4:7</span> for Paul's further statement about our having this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. </p>
