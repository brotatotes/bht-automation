<p><b> Of him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ αυτου</span></span>). Out of God. He chose you.</p>
<p><b>In Christ Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Χριστω Ιησου</span></span>). In the sphere of Christ Jesus the choice was made. This is God's wisdom.</p>
<p><b>Who was made unto us wisdom from God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος εγενηθη σοφια ημιν απο θεου</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενηθη</span></span>, became (first aorist passive and indicative), not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span>, was, the Incarnation, Cross, and Resurrection. Christ is the wisdom of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>) "both righteousness and sanctification and redemption" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη τε κα αγιασμος κα απολυτρωσις</span></span>), as is made plain by the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε--και--κα</span></span>. The three words (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη, αγιασμοσ, απολυτρωσις</span></span>) are thus shown to be an epexegesis of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφια</span></span> (Lightfoot). All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in Christ Jesus. We are made righteous, holy, and redeemed in Christ Jesus. Redemption comes here last for emphasis though the foundation of the other two. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span> we see clearly Paul's idea of the God kind of righteousness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη</span></span>) in Christ. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</span> we have Paul's conception of redemption (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολυτρωσις</span></span>, setting free as a ransomed slave) in Christ. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:19">Romans 6:19</span> we have Paul's notion of holiness or sanctification (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιασμος</span></span>) in Christ. These great theological terms will call for full discussion in Romans, but they must not be overlooked here. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:35">Acts 10:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:25">Acts 24:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:3-7">1 Thessalonians 4:3-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:2">1 Corinthians 1:2</span>. </p>
