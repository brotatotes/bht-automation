<p><b> That </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>). Probably ellipse (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενητα</span></span> to be supplied) as is common in Paul's Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:13">2 Corinthians 8:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:20">Galatians 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:16">Romans 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:1">Romans 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:3">Romans 15:3</span>). Some explain the imperative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχασθω</span></span> as an anacoluthon. The shortened quotation is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+9:24">Jeremiah 9:24</span>. Deissmann notes the importance of these closing verses concerning the origin of Paul's congregations from the lower classes in the large towns as "one of the most important historical witnesses to Primitive Christianity" (<i>New Light on the N.T.</i>, p. 7; <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, pp. 7, 14, 60, 142). </p>
