<p><b> I thank my God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστω τω θεω</span></span>). Singular as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:8">Romans 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:3">Philippians 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:4">Philemon 1:4</span>, but plural in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:2">1 Thessalonians 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:3">Colossians 1:3</span>. The grounds of Paul's thanksgivings in his Epistles are worthy of study. Even in the church in Corinth he finds something to thank God for, though in II Cor. there is no expression of thanksgiving because of the acute crisis in Corinth nor is there any in Galatians. But Paul is gracious here and allows his general attitude (always, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντοτε</span></span>) concerning (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span>, around) the Corinthians to override the specific causes of irritation.</p>
