 That  (οτ). Explicit specification of this grace of God given to the Corinthians. Paul points out in detail the unusual spiritual gifts which were their glory and became their peril (chapters 1 Corinthians 1:1).Ye were enriched in him  (επλουτισθητε εν αυτω). First aorist passive indicative of πλουτιζω, old causative verb from πλουτος, wealth, common in Attic writers, dropped out for centuries, reappeared in LXX. In N.T. only three times and alone in Paul (1 Corinthians 1:5; 2 Corinthians 6:10; 2 Corinthians 6:11). The Christian finds his real riches in Christ, one of Paul's pregnant phrases full of the truest mysticism.In all utterance and all knowledge  (εν παντ λογω κα παση γνωσε). One detail in explanation of the riches in Christ. The outward expression (λογω) here is put before the inward knowledge (γνωσε) which should precede all speech. But we get at one's knowledge by means of his speech. Chapters 1 Corinthians 1:1 throw much light on this element in the spiritual gifts of the Corinthians (the gift of tongues, interpreting tongues, discernment) as summed up in 1 Corinthians 13:1; 1 Corinthians 13:2, the greater gifts of 1 Corinthians 12:31. It was a marvellously endowed church in spite of their perversions.
