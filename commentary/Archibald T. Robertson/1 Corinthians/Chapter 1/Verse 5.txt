<p><b> That </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). Explicit specification of this grace of God given to the Corinthians. Paul points out in detail the unusual spiritual gifts which were their glory and became their peril (chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>Ye were enriched in him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επλουτισθητε εν αυτω</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλουτιζω</span></span>, old causative verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλουτος</span></span>, wealth, common in Attic writers, dropped out for centuries, reappeared in LXX. In N.T. only three times and alone in Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:5">1 Corinthians 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:10">2 Corinthians 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:11">2 Corinthians 6:11</span>). The Christian finds his real riches in Christ, one of Paul's pregnant phrases full of the truest mysticism.</p>
<p><b>In all utterance and all knowledge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν παντ λογω κα παση γνωσε</span></span>). One detail in explanation of the riches in Christ. The outward expression (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογω</span></span>) here is put before the inward knowledge (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωσε</span></span>) which should precede all speech. But we get at one's knowledge by means of his speech. Chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span> throw much light on this element in the spiritual gifts of the Corinthians (the gift of tongues, interpreting tongues, discernment) as summed up in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1">1 Corinthians 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:2">1 Corinthians 13:2</span>, the greater gifts of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span>. It was a marvellously endowed church in spite of their perversions. </p>
