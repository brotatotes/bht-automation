 So that ye come behind in no gift  (ωστε υμας μη υστερεισθα εν μηδεν χαρισματ). Consecutive clause with ωστε and the infinitive and the double negative. Come behind (υστερεισθα) is to be late (υστερος), old verb seen already in Mark 10:21; Matthew 19:20. It is a wonderful record here recorded. But in 2 Corinthians 8:7-11; 2 Corinthians 9:1-7 Paul will have to complain that they have not paid their pledges for the collection, pledges made over a year before, a very modern complaint.Waiting for the revelation  (απεκδεχομενους την αποκαλυψιν). This double compound is late and rare outside of Paul (1 Corinthians 1:7; Galatians 5:5; Romans 8:19; Romans 8:23; Romans 8:25; Philippians 3:20), 1 Peter 3:20; Hebrews 9:28. It is an eager expectancy of the second coming of Christ here termed revelation like the eagerness in προσδεχομενο in Titus 2:13 for the same event. "As if that attitude of expectation were the highest posture that can be attained here by the Christian" (F.W. Robertson).
