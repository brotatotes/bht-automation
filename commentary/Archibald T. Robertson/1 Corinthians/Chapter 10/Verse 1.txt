<p><b> For </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>). Correct text, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>. Paul appeals to the experience of the Israelites in the wilderness in confirmation of his statement concerning himself in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:26">1 Corinthians 9:26</span> and as a powerful warning to the Corinthians who may be tempted to flirt with the idolatrous practices of their neighbours. It is a real, not an imaginary peril.</p>
<p><b>All under the cloud </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντες υπο την νεφελην</span></span>). They all marched under the pillar of cloud by day (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:21">Exodus 13:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:19">Exodus 14:19</span>) which covered the host (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:14">Numbers 14:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:39">Psalms 95:39</span>). This mystic cloud was the symbol of the presence of the Lord with the people. </p>
