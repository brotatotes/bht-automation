 Now these things happened unto them  (ταυτα δε συνεβαινον εκεινοις). Imperfect tense because they happened from time to time.By way of example  (τυπικως). Adverb in sense of τυπο in verse 1 Corinthians 10:6. Only instance of the adverb except in ecclesiastical writers after this time, but adjective τυπικος occurs in a late papyrus.For our admonition  (προς νουθεσιαν ημων). Objective genitive (ημων) again. Νουθεσια is late word from νουθετεω (see on Acts 20:31; 1 Thessalonians 5:12; 1 Thessalonians 5:14) for earlier νουθετησις and νουθετια.The ends of the ages have come  (τα τελη των αιωνων κατηντηκεν). Cf. Hebrews 9:26 η συντελεια των αιωνων, the consummation of the ages (also Matthew 13:40). The plural seems to point out how one stage succeeds another in the drama of human history. Κατηντηκεν is perfect active indicative of κατανταω, late verb, to come down to (see on Acts 16:1). Does Paul refer to the second coming of Christ as in 1 Corinthians 7:26? In a sense the ends of the ages like a curtain have come down to all of us.
