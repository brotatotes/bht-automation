<p><b> Now these things happened unto them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτα δε συνεβαινον εκεινοις</span></span>). Imperfect tense because they happened from time to time.</p>
<p><b>By way of example </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπικως</span></span>). Adverb in sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπο</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:6">1 Corinthians 10:6</span>. Only instance of the adverb except in ecclesiastical writers after this time, but adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπικος</span></span> occurs in a late papyrus.</p>
<p><b>For our admonition </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς νουθεσιαν ημων</span></span>). Objective genitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημων</span></span>) again. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Νουθεσια</span></span> is late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουθετεω</span></span> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:31">Acts 20:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:12">1 Thessalonians 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:14">1 Thessalonians 5:14</span>) for earlier <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουθετησις</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουθετια</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>The ends of the ages have come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα τελη των αιωνων κατηντηκεν</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η συντελεια των αιωνων</span></span>, the consummation of the ages (also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:40">Matthew 13:40</span>). The plural seems to point out how one stage succeeds another in the drama of human history. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κατηντηκεν</span></span> is perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατανταω</span></span>, late verb, to come down to (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span>). Does Paul refer to the second coming of Christ as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:26">1 Corinthians 7:26</span>? In a sense the ends of the ages like a curtain have come down to all of us. </p>
