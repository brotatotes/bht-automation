The cup over which we pronounce a blessing as by Christ at the institution of the ordinance.A communion of the blood of Christ  (κοινωνια του αιματος του Χριστου). Literally, a participation in (objective genitive) the blood of Christ. The word κοινωνια is an old one from κοινωνος, partner, and so here and Philippians 2:1; Philippians 3:10. It can mean also fellowship (Galatians 2:9) or contribution (2 Corinthians 8:4; Philippians 1:5). It is, of course, a spiritual participation in the blood of Christ which is symbolized by the cup. Same meaning for κοινωνια in reference to "the body of Christ."The bread which we break  (τον αρτον ον κλωμεν). The loaf. Inverse attraction of the antecedent (αρτον) to the case (accusative) of the relative (ον) according to classic idiom (Robertson, Grammar, p. 488). Αρτος probably from αρω, to join or fit (flour mixed with water and baked). The mention of the cup here before the bread does not mean that this order was observed for see the regular order of bread and then cup in 1 Corinthians 11:24-27.
