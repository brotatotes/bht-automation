 After the flesh  (κατα σαρκα). The literal Israel, the Jewish people, not the spiritual Israel (Ισραηλ κατα πνευμα) composed of both Jews and Gentiles, the true children of faith (Romans 2:28; Romans 9:8; Galatians 3:7).Communion with the altar  (κοινωνο του θυσιαστηριου). Same idea in κοινωνο participators in, partners in, sharers in (with objective genitive). The word θυσιαστηριον is from late verb θυσιαζω, to offer sacrifice, and that from θυσια, sacrifice, and that from θυω, common verb to slay, to sacrifice (verse 1 Corinthians 10:20). The Israelites who offer sacrifices have a spiritual participation in the altar.
