 Were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea  (παντες εις τον Μωυσην εβαπτισαντο εν τη νεφελη κα εν τη θαλασση). The picture is plain enough. The mystic cloud covered the people while the sea rose in walls on each side of them as they marched across. B K L P read εβαπτισαντο (causative first aorist middle, got themselves baptized) while Aleph A C D have εβαπτισθησαν (first aorist passive, were baptized). The immersion was complete for all of them in the sea around them and the cloud over them. Moses was their leader then as Christ is now and so Paul uses εις concerning the relation of the Israelites to Moses as he does of our baptism in relation to Christ (Galatians 3:27).
