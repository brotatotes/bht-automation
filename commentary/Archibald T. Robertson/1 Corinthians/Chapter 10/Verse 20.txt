<p><b> But I say that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' οτ</span></span>). The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φημ</span></span> (I say) must be repeated from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:19">1 Corinthians 10:19</span> before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>To demons, and not to God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονιοις κα ου θεω</span></span>). Referring to LXX text of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+32:17">Deuteronomy 32:17</span>. It is probable that by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου θεω</span></span> Paul means "to a no-god" as also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+32:21">Deuteronomy 32:21</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ' ουκ εθνε</span></span> (by a no-people). This is Paul's reply to the heathen who claimed that they worshipped the gods represented by the images and not the mere wood or stone or metal idols. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονια</span></span> is an adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονιος</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμων</span></span>, an inferior deity, and with same idea originally, once in this sense in N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span>). Elsewhere in N.T. it has the notion of evil spirits as here, those spiritual forces of wickedness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>) that are under the control of Satan. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονια</span></span>, so common in the Gospels, occurs in Paul's writings only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span>. Demonology is a deep and dark subject here pictured by Paul as the explanation of heathenism which is a departure from God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:19-23">Romans 1:19-23</span>) and a substitute for the worship of God. It is a terrible indictment which is justified by the licentious worship associated with paganism then and now. </p>
