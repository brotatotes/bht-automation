<p><b> Ye cannot </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου δυνασθε</span></span>). Morally impossible to drink the Lord's cup and the cup of demons, to partake of the Lord's table and the table of demons.</p>
<p><b>Of the table of the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τραπεζης Κυριου</span></span>). No articles, but definite idea. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τραπεζα</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετρα</span></span> (four) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεζα</span></span> (a foot), four-footed. Here</p>
<p><b>table </b> means, as often, what is on the table. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:30">Luke 22:30</span> where Jesus says "at my table" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ της τραπεζης μου</span></span>), referring to the spiritual feast hereafter. Here the reference is plainly to the Lord's Supper (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριακον δειπνον</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:20">1 Corinthians 11:20</span>). See allusions in O.T. to use of the table in heathen idol feasts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:11">Isaiah 65:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+7:18">Jeremiah 7:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:18">Ezekiel 16:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+23:41">Ezekiel 23:41</span>). The altar of burnt-offering is called the table of the Lord in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+1:7">Malachi 1:7</span> (Vincent). </p>
