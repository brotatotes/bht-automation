<p><b> Let no man seek his own </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεις το εαυτου ζητειτω</span></span>). This is Paul's rule for social relations (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:5">1 Corinthians 13:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:2">Galatians 6:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:7">Romans 14:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:2">Romans 15:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:1">Philippians 2:1</span>) and is the way to do what is expedient and what builds up.</p>
<p><b>His neighbour's good </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το του ετερου</span></span>). Literally, "the affair of the other man." Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον ετερον</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:8">Romans 13:8</span> for this idea of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερος</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πλησιον</span></span> (the nigh man, the neighbour) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:2">Romans 15:2</span>. This is loving your neighbour as yourself by preferring your neighbour's welfare to your own (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:4">Philippians 2:4</span>). </p>
