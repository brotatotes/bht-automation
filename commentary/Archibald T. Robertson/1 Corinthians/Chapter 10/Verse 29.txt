<p><b> For why is my liberty judged by another conscience? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα τ γαρ η ελευθερια μου κρινετα υπο αλλης συνειδησεωσ;</span></span>). Supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενητα</span></span> (deliberative subjunctive) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span>. Paul deftly puts himself in the place of the strong brother at such a banquet who is expected to conform his conscience to that of the weak brother who makes the point about a particular piece of meat. It is an abridgment of one's personal liberty in the interest of the weak brother. Two individualities clash. The only reason is love which builds up (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:2">1 Corinthians 8:2</span> and all of chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:1">1 Corinthians 10:1</span>). There is this eternal collision between the forces of progress and reaction. If they work together, they must consider the welfare of each other. </p>
