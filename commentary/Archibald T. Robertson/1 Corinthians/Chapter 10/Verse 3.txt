<p><b> The same spiritual meat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το αυτο πνευματικον βρωμα</span></span>). Westcott and Hort needlessly bracket to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτο</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βρωμα</span></span> is food, not just flesh. The reference is to the manna (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:13">Exodus 16:13</span>) which is termed "spiritual" by reason of its supernatural character. Jesus called himself the true bread from heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:35">John 6:35</span>) which the manna typified. </p>
