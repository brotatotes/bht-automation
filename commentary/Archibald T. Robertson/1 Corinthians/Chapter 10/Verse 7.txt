<p><b> Neither be ye idolaters </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδε ειδωλολατρα γινεσθε</span></span>). Literally, stop becoming idolaters, implying that some of them had already begun to be. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδωλολατρης</span></span> seems to be a Christian formation to describe the Christian view. Eating <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα ειδωλοθυτα</span></span> might become a stepping-stone to idolatry in some instances.</p>
<p><b>Drink </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειν</span></span>). Short form for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιειν</span></span>, sometimes even <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιν</span></span> occurs (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 204).</p>
<p><b>To play </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιζειν</span></span>). This old verb to play like a child occurs nowhere else in the N.T., but is common in the LXX and it is quoted here from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:6">Exodus 32:6</span>. In idolatrous festivals like that witnessed by Moses when he saw the people singing and dancing around the golden calf (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:18">Exodus 32:18</span>). </p>
