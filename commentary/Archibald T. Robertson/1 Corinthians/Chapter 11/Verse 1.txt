The preacher is a leader and is bound to set an example or pattern (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπος</span></span>) for others (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:7">Titus 2:7</span>). This verse clearly belongs to the preceding chapter and not to chapter 11. </p>
