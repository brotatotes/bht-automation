<p><b> Ought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειλε</span></span>). Moral obligation therefore (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τουτο</span></span>, rests on woman in the matter of dress that does not (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ οφειλε</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:7">1 Corinthians 11:7</span>) rest on the man.</p>
<p><b>To have a sign of authority </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσιαν εχειν</span></span>). He means <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον εξουσιας</span></span> (symbol of authority) by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσιαν</span></span>, but it is the sign of authority of the man over the woman. The veil on the woman's head is the symbol of the authority that the man with the uncovered head has over her. It is, as we see it, more a sign of subjection (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψποταγης</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:10">1 Timothy 2:10</span>) than of authority (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσιας</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Because of the angels </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τους αγγελους</span></span>). This startling phrase has caused all kinds of conjecture which may be dismissed. It is not preachers that Paul has in mind, nor evil angels who could be tempted (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:1">Genesis 6:1</span>), but angels present in worship (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:9">1 Corinthians 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+138:1">Psalms 138:1</span>) who would be shocked at the conduct of the women since the angels themselves veil their faces before Jehovah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:2">Isaiah 6:2</span>). </p>
