<p><b> Have long hair </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κομα</span></span>). Present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κομαω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κομη</span></span>, hair), old verb, same contraction (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-αηι=α</span></span>) as the indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αε = α</span></span>), but subjunctive here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> in third class condition. Long hair is a glory to a woman and a disgrace to a man (as we still feel). The long-haired man! There is a papyrus example of a priest accused of letting his hair grow long and of wearing woollen garments.</p>
<p><b>For a covering </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ περιβολαιου</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιβαλλω</span></span> to fling around, as a mantle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:12">Hebrews 1:12</span>) or a covering or veil as here. It is not in the place of a veil, but answering to (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span>, in the sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span>), as a permanent endowment (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεδοτα</span></span>, perfect passive indicative). </p>
