 First of all  (πρωτον μεν). There is no antithesis (δευτερον δε, secondly, or επειτα δε, in the next place) expressed. This is the primary reason for Paul's condemnation and the only one given.When ye come together in the church  (συνερχομενων ημων εν εκκλησια). Genitive absolute. Here εκκλησια has the literal meaning of assembly.Divisions  (σχισματα). Accusative of general reference with the infinitive υπαρχειν in indirect discourse. Old word for cleft, rent, from σχιζω. Example in papyri for splinter of wood. See on 1 Corinthians 1:10. Not yet formal cleavages into two or more organizations, but partisan divisions that showed in the love-feasts and at the Lord's Supper.Partly  (μερος τ). Accusative of extent (to some part) like παντα in 1 Corinthians 10:33. He could have said εκ μερους as in 1 Corinthians 13:9. The rumours of strife were so constant (I keep on hearing, ακουω).
