<p><b> First of all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτον μεν</span></span>). There is no antithesis (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευτερον δε</span></span>, secondly, or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επειτα δε</span></span>, in the next place) expressed. This is the primary reason for Paul's condemnation and the only one given.</p>
<p><b>When ye come together in the church </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνερχομενων ημων εν εκκλησια</span></span>). Genitive absolute. Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησια</span></span> has the literal meaning of assembly.</p>
<p><b>Divisions </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχισματα</span></span>). Accusative of general reference with the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαρχειν</span></span> in indirect discourse. Old word for cleft, rent, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχιζω</span></span>. Example in papyri for splinter of wood. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:10">1 Corinthians 1:10</span>. Not yet formal cleavages into two or more organizations, but partisan divisions that showed in the love-feasts and at the Lord's Supper.</p>
<p><b>Partly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μερος τ</span></span>). Accusative of extent (to some part) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:33">1 Corinthians 10:33</span>. He could have said <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ μερους</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:9">1 Corinthians 13:9</span>. The rumours of strife were so constant (I keep on hearing, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span>). </p>
