<p><b> Hold fast the traditions </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας παραδοσεις κατεχετε</span></span>). Hold down as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:2">1 Corinthians 15:2</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παραδοσις</span></span> (tradition) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδωμ</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδωκα</span></span>, first aorist active indicative) is an old word and merely something handed on from one to another. The thing handed on may be bad as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:2">Matthew 15:2</span> (which see) and contrary to the will of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:8">Mark 7:8</span>) or it may be wholly good as here. There is a constant conflict between the new and the old in science, medicine, law, theology. The obscurantist rejects all the new and holds to the old both true and untrue. New truth must rest upon old truth and is in harmony with it. </p>
