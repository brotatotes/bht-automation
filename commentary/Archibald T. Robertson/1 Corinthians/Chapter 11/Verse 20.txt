<p><b> To eat the Lord's Supper </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριακον δειπνον φαγειν</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριακος</span></span>, adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span>, belonging to or pertaining to the Lord, is not just a biblical or ecclesiastical word, for it is found in the inscriptions and papyri in the sense of imperial (Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 358), as imperial finance, imperial treasury. It is possible that here the term applies both to the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αγαπη</span></span> or Love-feast (a sort of church supper or club supper held in connection with, before or after, the Lord's Supper) and the Eucharist or Lord's Supper. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δειπνον</span></span>, so common in the Gospels, only here in Paul. The selfish conduct of the Corinthians made it impossible to eat a Lord's Supper at all. </p>
