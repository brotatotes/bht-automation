 Taketh before  (προλαμβανε). Before others. Old verb to take before others. It was conduct like this that led to the complete separation between the Love-feast and the Lord's Supper. It was not even a common meal together (κοινον δειπνον), not to say a Lord's δειπνον. It was a meregrab-game .This one is hungry  (ος δε πεινα). Demonstrative ος. Nothing is left for him at the love-feast.Another is drunken  (ος δε μεθυε). Such disgusting conduct was considered shameful in heathen club suppers. "Hungry poor meeting intoxicated rich, at what was supposed to be a supper of the Lord" (Robertson and Plummer). On μεθυω, to be drunk, see on Matthew 24:49; Acts 2:15.
