<p><b> Taketh before </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προλαμβανε</span></span>). Before others. Old verb to take before others. It was conduct like this that led to the complete separation between the Love-feast and the Lord's Supper. It was not even a common meal together (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινον δειπνον</span></span>), not to say a Lord's <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειπνον</span></span>. It was a mere</p>
<p><b>grab-game </b>.</p>
<p><b>This one is hungry </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος δε πεινα</span></span>). Demonstrative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span>. Nothing is left for him at the love-feast.</p>
<p><b>Another is drunken </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος δε μεθυε</span></span>). Such disgusting conduct was considered shameful in heathen club suppers. "Hungry poor meeting intoxicated rich, at what was supposed to be a supper of the Lord" (Robertson and Plummer). On <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθυω</span></span>, to be drunk, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:49">Matthew 24:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:15">Acts 2:15</span>. </p>
