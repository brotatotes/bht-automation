<p><b> What? Have ye not houses? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη γαρ οικιας ουκ εχετε;</span></span>) The double negative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη--ουκ</span></span>) in the single question is like the idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:4">1 Corinthians 9:4</span> which see. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη</span></span> expects a negative answer while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span> negatives the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχετε</span></span>. "For do you fail to have houses?" Paul is not approving gluttony and drunkenness but only expressing horror at their sacrilege (despising, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταφρονειτε</span></span>) of the church of God.</p>
<p><b>That have not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους μη εχοντας</span></span>). Not those without houses, but those who have nothing, "the have-nots" (Findlay) like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:12">2 Corinthians 8:12</span>, in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εχοντες</span></span> "the haves" (the men of property).</p>
<p><b>What shall I say to you? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ειπω υμιν;</span></span>) Deliberative subjunctive that well expresses Paul's bewilderment. </p>
