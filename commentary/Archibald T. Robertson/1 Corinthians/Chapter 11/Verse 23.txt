 For I received of the Lord  (εγο γαρ παρελαβον απο του Κυριου). Direct claim to revelation from the Lord Jesus on the origin of the Lord's Supper. Luke's account (Luke 22:17-20) is almost identical with this one. He could easily have read I Corinthians before he wrote his Gospel. See 1 Corinthians 15:3 for use of both παρελαβον and παρεδωκα. Note παρα in both verbs. Paul received the account from (παρα--απο) the Lord and passed it on from himself to them, a true παραδοσις (tradition) as in 1 Corinthians 11:2.He was betrayed  (παρεδιδετο). Imperfect passive indicative (irregular form for παρεδιδοτο, Robertson, Grammar, p. 340). Same verb as παρεδωκα (first aorist active indicative just used for "I delivered").
