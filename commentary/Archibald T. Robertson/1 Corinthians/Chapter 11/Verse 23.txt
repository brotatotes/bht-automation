<p><b> For I received of the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγο γαρ παρελαβον απο του Κυριου</span></span>). Direct claim to revelation from the Lord Jesus on the origin of the Lord's Supper. Luke's account (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:17-20">Luke 22:17-20</span>) is almost identical with this one. He could easily have read I Corinthians before he wrote his Gospel. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span> for use of both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρελαβον</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδωκα</span></span>. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> in both verbs. Paul received the account from (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα--απο</span></span>) the Lord and passed it on from himself to them, a true <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδοσις</span></span> (tradition) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:2">1 Corinthians 11:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>He was betrayed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδιδετο</span></span>). Imperfect passive indicative (irregular form for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδιδοτο</span></span>, Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 340). Same verb as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδωκα</span></span> (first aorist active indicative just used for "I delivered"). </p>
