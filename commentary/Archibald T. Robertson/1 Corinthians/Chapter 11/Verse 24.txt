<p><b> When he had given thanks </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστησας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστεω</span></span> from which word our word Eucharist comes, common late verb (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span>).</p>
<p><b>Which is for you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το υπερ υμων</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κλωμενον</span></span> (broken) of the Textus Receptus (King James Version) is clearly not genuine. Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19">Luke 22:19</span>) has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδομενον</span></span> (given) which is the real idea here. As a matter of fact the body of Jesus was not broken (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:36">John 19:36</span>). The bread was broken, but not the body of Jesus.</p>
<p><b>In remembrance of me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την εμην αναμνησιν</span></span>). The objective use of the possessive pronoun <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμην</span></span>. Not my remembrance of you, but your remembrance of me. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αναμνησις</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναμιμνησκω</span></span>, to remind or to recall, is an old word, but only here in N.T. save <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19">Luke 22:19</span> which see. </p>
