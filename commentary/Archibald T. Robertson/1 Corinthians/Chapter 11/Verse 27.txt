<p><b> Unworthily </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναξιως</span></span>). Old adverb, only here in N.T., not genuine in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:29">1 Corinthians 11:29</span>. Paul defines his meaning in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:29">1 Corinthians 11:29</span>. He does not say or imply that we ourselves must be "worthy" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιο</span></span>) to partake of the Lord's Supper. No one would ever partake on those terms. Many pious souls have abstained from observing the ordinance through false exegesis here.</p>
<p><b>Shall be guilty </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενοχος εστα</span></span>). Shall be held guilty as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:21">Matthew 5:21</span> which see. Shall be guilty of a crime committed against the body and blood of the Lord by such sacrilege (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:6">Hebrews 6:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span>). </p>
