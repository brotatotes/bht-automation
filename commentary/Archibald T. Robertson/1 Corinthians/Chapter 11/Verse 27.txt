 Unworthily  (αναξιως). Old adverb, only here in N.T., not genuine in verse 1 Corinthians 11:29. Paul defines his meaning in verse 1 Corinthians 11:29. He does not say or imply that we ourselves must be "worthy" (αξιο) to partake of the Lord's Supper. No one would ever partake on those terms. Many pious souls have abstained from observing the ordinance through false exegesis here.Shall be guilty  (ενοχος εστα). Shall be held guilty as in Matthew 5:21 which see. Shall be guilty of a crime committed against the body and blood of the Lord by such sacrilege (cf. Hebrews 6:6; Hebrews 10:29).
