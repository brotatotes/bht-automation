<p><b> But I would have you know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω δε υμας ειδενα</span></span>). But I wish you to know, censure in contrast to the praise in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:2">1 Corinthians 11:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>The head of Christ is God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφαλη του Χριστου ο θεος</span></span>). Rather, God is the head of Christ, since <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφαλη</span></span> is anarthrous and predicate. </p>
