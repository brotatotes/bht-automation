<p><b> But if we discerned ourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δε εαυτους διεκρινομεν</span></span>). This condition of the second class, determined as unfulfilled, assumes that they had not been judging themselves discriminatingly, else they would not be judged (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκρινομεθα</span></span>). Note distinction in the two verbs. </p>
