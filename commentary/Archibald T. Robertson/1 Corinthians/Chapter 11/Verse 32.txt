 Ye are chastened of the Lord  (υπο του Κυριου παιδευομεθα). On this sense of παιδευω, from παις, child, to train a child (Acts 7:22), to discipline with words (2 Timothy 2:25), to chastise with scourges see on Luke 23:16 (Hebrews 12:7), and so by afflictions as here (Hebrews 12:6). Hυπο του Κυριου can be construed with κρινομενο instead of with παιδευομεθα.With the world  (συν τω κοσμω). Along with the world. Afflictions are meant to separate us from the doom of the wicked world. Final use of ινα μη here with κατακριθωμεν (first aorist passive subjunctive).
