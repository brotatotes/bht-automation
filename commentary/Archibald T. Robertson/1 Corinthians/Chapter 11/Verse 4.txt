<p><b> Having his head covered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα κεφαλης εχων</span></span>). Literally, having a veil (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλυμμα</span></span> understood) down from the head (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφαλης</span></span> ablative after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> as with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:13">Mark 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:14">Acts 27:14</span>). It is not certain whether the Jews at this time used the <i>tallith</i>, "a four-corned shawl having fringes consisting of eight threads, each knotted five times" (Vincent) as they did later. Virgil (<i>Aeneid</i> iii., 545) says: "And our heads are shrouded before the altar with a Phrygian vestment." The Greeks (both men and women) remained bareheaded in public prayer and this usage Paul commends for the men. </p>
