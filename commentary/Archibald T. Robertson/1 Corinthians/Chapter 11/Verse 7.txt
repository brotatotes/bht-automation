<p><b> The image and glory of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εικων κα δοξα θεου</span></span>). Anarthrous substantives, but definite. Reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:28">Genesis 1:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:26">Genesis 2:26</span> whereby man is made directly in the image (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εικων</span></span>) of God. It is the moral likeness of God, not any bodily resemblance. Ellicott notes that man is the glory (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξα</span></span>) of God as the crown of creation and as endowed with sovereignty like God himself.</p>
<p><b>The glory of the man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξα ανδρος</span></span>). Anarthrous also, man's glory. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:26">Genesis 2:26</span> the LXX has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπος</span></span> (Greek word for both male and female), not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηρ</span></span> (male) as here. But the woman (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυνη</span></span>) was formed from the man (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηρ</span></span>) and this priority of the male (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:8">1 Corinthians 11:8</span>) gives a certain superiority to the male. On the other hand, it is equally logical to argue that woman is the crown and climax of all creation, being the last. </p>
