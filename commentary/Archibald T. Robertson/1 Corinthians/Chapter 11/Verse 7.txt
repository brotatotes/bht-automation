 The image and glory of God  (εικων κα δοξα θεου). Anarthrous substantives, but definite. Reference to Genesis 1:28; Genesis 2:26 whereby man is made directly in the image (εικων) of God. It is the moral likeness of God, not any bodily resemblance. Ellicott notes that man is the glory (δοξα) of God as the crown of creation and as endowed with sovereignty like God himself.The glory of the man  (δοξα ανδρος). Anarthrous also, man's glory. In Genesis 2:26 the LXX has ανθρωπος (Greek word for both male and female), not ανηρ (male) as here. But the woman (γυνη) was formed from the man (ανηρ) and this priority of the male (verse 1 Corinthians 11:8) gives a certain superiority to the male. On the other hand, it is equally logical to argue that woman is the crown and climax of all creation, being the last.
