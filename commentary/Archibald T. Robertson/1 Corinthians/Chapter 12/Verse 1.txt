<p><b> Now concerning spiritual gifts </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ δε των πνευματικων</span></span>). Clearly one of the items asked about in the letter to Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span>) and introduced precisely as the problem of meats offered to idols (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>). This question runs to the end of chapter 14. Plainly much trouble had arisen in Corinth in the exercise of these gifts. </p>
