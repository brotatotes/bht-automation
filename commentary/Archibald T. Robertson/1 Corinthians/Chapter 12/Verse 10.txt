<p><b> Workings of miracles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργηματα δυναμεων</span></span>). Workings of powers. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργων δυναμεις</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:5">Galatians 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span> where all three words are used (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημεια</span></span>, signs, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τερατα</span></span>, wonders, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμεις</span></span>, powers). Some of the miracles were not healings as the blindness on Elymas the sorcerer.</p>
<p><b>Prophecy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητεια</span></span>). Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητης</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφημ</span></span>, to speak forth. Common in papyri. This gift Paul will praise most (chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:1">1 Corinthians 12:1</span>). Not always prediction, but a speaking forth of God's message under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><b>Discernings of spirits </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακρισεις πνευματων</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διακρισις</span></span> is old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακρινω</span></span> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:29">1 Corinthians 11:29</span>) and in N.T. only here; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:14">Hebrews 5:14</span>. A most needed gift to tell whether the gifts were really of the Holy Spirit and supernatural (cf. so-called "gifts" today) or merely strange though natural or even diabolical (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>Divers kinds of tongues </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενη γλωσσων</span></span>). No word for "divers" in the Greek. There has arisen a great deal of confusion concerning the gift of tongues as found in Corinth. They prided themselves chiefly on this gift which had become a source of confusion and disorder. There were varieties (kinds, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενη</span></span>) in this gift, but the gift was essentially an ecstatic utterance of highly wrought emotion that edified the speaker (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:4">1 Corinthians 14:4</span>) and was intelligible to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:2">1 Corinthians 14:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:28">1 Corinthians 14:28</span>). It was not always true that the speaker in tongues could make clear what he had said to those who did not know the tongue (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:13">1 Corinthians 14:13</span>): It was not mere gibberish or jargon like the modern "tongues," but in a real language that could be understood by one familiar with that tongue as was seen on the great Day of Pentecost when people who spoke different languages were present. In Corinth, where no such variety of people existed, it required an interpreter to explain the tongue to those who knew it not. Hence Paul placed this gift lowest of all. It created wonder, but did little real good. This is the error of the Irvingites and others who have tried to reproduce this early gift of the Holy Spirit which was clearly for a special emergency and which was not designed to help spread the gospel among men. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:13-21">Acts 2:13-21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:44-46">Acts 10:44-46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:6">Acts 19:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>The interpretation of tongues </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερμηνεια γλωσσων</span></span>). Old word, here only and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:26">1 Corinthians 14:26</span> in N.T., from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερμηνευω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hερμης</span></span> (the god of speech). Cf. on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διερμηνευω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:27">Luke 24:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:36">Acts 9:36</span>. In case there was no one present who understood the particular tongue it required a special gift of the Spirit to some one to interpret it if any one was to receive benefit from it. </p>
