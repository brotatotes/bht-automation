<p><b> Were we all baptized into one body </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις παντες εις εν σωμα εβαπτισθημεν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτιζω</span></span> and so a reference to a definite past event with each of them of different races, nations, classes, when each of them put on the outward badge of service to Christ, the symbol of the inward changes already wrought in them by the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:27">Galatians 3:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:2">Romans 6:2</span>).</p>
<p><b>And were all made to drink of one Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα παντες εν πνευμα εποτισθημεν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποτιζω</span></span>, old verb, to give to drink. The accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πνευμα</span></span> is retained in the passive as often with verbs that in the active take two accusatives. The reference is to a definite act in the past, probably to the inward experience of the Holy Spirit symbolized by the act of baptism. </p>
