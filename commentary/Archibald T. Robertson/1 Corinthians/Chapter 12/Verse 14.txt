<p><b> Is not one member </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν εν μελος</span></span>). The point sounds like a truism, but it is the key to the whole problem of church life both local and general. Vincent refers to the fable of the body and the members by Menenius Agrippa (Livy, II, 32), but it was an old parable. Socrates pointed out how absurd it would be if feet and hands should work against one another when God made them to cooperate (Xen., <i>Mem</i>. II. iii. 18). Seneca alludes to it as does Marcus Aurelius and Marcus Antoninus. </p>
