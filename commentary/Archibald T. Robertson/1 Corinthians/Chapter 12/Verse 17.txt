<p><b> If the whole body were an eye </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε ολον το σωμα οφθαλμος</span></span>). The eye is the most wonderful organ and supremely useful (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+10:31">Numbers 10:31</span>), the very light of the body (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:34">Luke 11:34</span>). And yet how grotesque it would be if there were nothing else but a great round rolling eye! A big "I" surely!</p>
<p><b>The smelling </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η οσφρησις</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσφραινομα</span></span>, to smell. Here alone in N.T. </p>
