<p><b> Ye were led away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαγομενο</span></span>). The copula <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητε</span></span> is not expressed (common ellipsis) with the participle (periphrastic imperfect passive), but it has to be supplied to make sense. Some scholars would change <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε</span></span> (when) to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποτε</span></span> (once) and so remove the difficulty.</p>
<p><b>Unto those dumb idols </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τα ειδωλα τα αφωνα</span></span>). "Unto the idols the dumb." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:5-7">Psalms 95:5-7</span> for the voicelessness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α-φωνα</span></span>, old adjective, without voice, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνη</span></span>) of the idols. Pagans were led astray by demons (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:19">1 Corinthians 10:19</span>).</p>
<p><b>Howsoever ye might be led </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως αν ηγεσθε</span></span>). Rather, "as often as ye were led." For this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως αν</span></span> for the notion of repetition, regular <i>Koine</i> idiom, see Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 974. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου αν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:56">Mark 6:56</span>. </p>
