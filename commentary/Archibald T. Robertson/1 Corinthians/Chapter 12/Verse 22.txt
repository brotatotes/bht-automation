Adversative sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span>, on the contrary. So far from the more dignified members like the eye and the head being independent of the subordinate ones like the hands and feet, they are "much more" (<i>argumentum a fortiori</i>, "by much more" <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλω μαλλον</span></span>, instrumental case) in need of therm.</p>
<p><b>Those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα δοκουντα μελη του σωματος ασθενεστερα υπαρχειν αναγκαια εστιν</span></span>).
