<p><b> We bestow </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιτιθεμεν</span></span>). Literally, We place around as if a garland (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:17">Mark 15:17</span>) or a garment (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:28">Matthew 27:28</span>).</p>
<p><b>More abundant comeliness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευσχημοσυνην περισσοτεραν</span></span>). One need only mention the mother's womb and the mother's breast to see the force of Paul's argument here. The word, common in old Greek, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευσχημων</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ</span></span>, well, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχημα</span></span>, figure), here only in N.T. One may think of the coal-miner who digs under the earth for the coal to keep us warm in winter. So <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασχημων</span></span> (deformed, uncomely), old word, here only in N.T., but see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:36">1 Corinthians 7:36</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασχημονεω</span></span>. </p>
