 Tempered the body together  (συνεκερασεν το σωμα). First aorist active indicative of συνκεραννυμ, to mix together, old word, but in N.T. only here and Hebrews 4:2. Plato used this very word of the way God compounded (συνεκερασατο) the various elements of the body in creating soul and body. Paul rejects the idea of the later Gnostics that matter is evil and the physical organs degrading. He gives a noble picture of the body with its wonderful organs planned to be the temple of God's Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19) in opposition to the Epicurean sensualists in Corinth.To that part which lacked  (τω υστερουμενω). It is a true instinct that gives superior honour to the unseen organs of life.
