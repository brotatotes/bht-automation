<p><b> Tempered the body together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεκερασεν το σωμα</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνκεραννυμ</span></span>, to mix together, old word, but in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:2">Hebrews 4:2</span>. Plato used this very word of the way God compounded (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεκερασατο</span></span>) the various elements of the body in creating soul and body. Paul rejects the idea of the later Gnostics that matter is evil and the physical organs degrading. He gives a noble picture of the body with its wonderful organs planned to be the temple of God's Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:19">1 Corinthians 6:19</span>) in opposition to the Epicurean sensualists in Corinth.</p>
<p><b>To that part which lacked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω υστερουμενω</span></span>). It is a true instinct that gives superior honour to the unseen organs of life. </p>
