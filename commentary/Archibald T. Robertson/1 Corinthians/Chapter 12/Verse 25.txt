<p><b> That there should be no schism </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη η σχισμα</span></span>). Purpose of God in his plan for the body. Trouble in one organ affects the whole body. A headache may be due to trouble elsewhere and usually is.</p>
<p><b>Have the same care </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το αυτο μεριμνωσιν</span></span>). The very verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεριμναω</span></span> used by Jesus of our anxiety (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:27">Matthew 6:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:31">Matthew 6:31</span>). Paul here personifies the parts of the body as if each one is anxious for the others. The modern knowledge of the billions of cells in the body co-working for the whole confirms Paul's argument. </p>
