<p><b> Suffer with it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνπασχε</span></span>). Medical term in this sense in Hippocrates and Galen. In N.T only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span> (of our suffering with Christ). One of Solon's Laws allowed retaliation by any one for another's injuries. Plato (<i>Republic</i>, V, 462) says the body politic "feels the hurt" as the whole body feels a hurt finger.</p>
<p><b>Rejoice with it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνχαιρε</span></span>). This is fortunately true also. One may tingle with joy all over the body thanks to the wonderful nervous system and to the relation between mind and matter. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:6">1 Corinthians 13:6</span> for joy of love with truth. </p>
