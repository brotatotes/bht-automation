<p><b> Wherefore I give you to understand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διο γνωριζω υμιν</span></span>). Causative idea (only in Aeschylus in old Greek) in papyri (also in sense of recognize) and N.T., from root <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνω</span></span> in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, to know.</p>
<p><b>Speaking in the Spirit of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πνευματ θεου λαλων</span></span>). Either sphere or instrumentality. No great distinction here between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span> (utter sounds) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span> (to say).</p>
<p><b>Jesus is anathema </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθεμα Ιησους</span></span>). On distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθεμα</span></span> (curse) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθημα</span></span> (offering <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:5">Luke 21:5</span>) see discussion there. In LXX <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθημα</span></span> means a thing devoted to God without being redeemed, doomed to destruction (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+27:28">Leviticus 27:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jos+6:17">Joshua 6:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jos+7:12">Joshua 7:12</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:22">1 Corinthians 16:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</span>. This blasphemous language against Jesus was mainly by the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:45">Acts 13:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:6">Acts 18:6</span>). It is even possible that Paul had once tried to make Christians say <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αναθεμα Ιησους</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:11">Acts 26:11</span>).</p>
<p><b>Jesus is Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος Ιησους</span></span>). The term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span>, as we have seen, is common in the LXX for God. The Romans used it freely for the emperor in the emperor worship. "Most important of all is the early establishment of a polemical parallelism between the cult of Christ and the cult of Caesar in the application of the term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span>, 'lord.' The new texts have here furnished quite astonishing revelations" (Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 349). Inscriptions, ostraca, papyri apply the term to Roman emperors, particularly to Nero when Paul wrote this very letter (<i>ib.</i>, p. 353f.): "One with 'Nero Kurios' quite in the manner of a formula (without article, like the 'Kurios Jesus' in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>." "The battle-cries of the spirits of error and of truth contending at Corinth" (Findlay). One is reminded of the demand made by Polycarp that he say <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος Χαεσαρ</span></span> and how each time he replied <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος Ιησους</span></span>. He paid the penalty for his loyalty with his life. Lighthearted men today can say "Lord Jesus" in a flippant or even in an irreverent way, but no Jew or Gentile then said it who did not mean it. </p>
