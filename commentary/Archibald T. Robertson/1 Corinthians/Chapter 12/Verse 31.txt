 The greater gifts  (τα χαρισματα τα μειζονα). Paul unhesitatingly ranks some spiritual gifts above others. Ζηλοω here has good sense, not that of envy as in Acts 7:9; 1 Corinthians 13:4.And a still more excellent way  (κα ετ καθ' υπερβολην οδον). In order to gain the greater gifts. "I show you a way par excellence," beyond all comparison (superlative idea in this adjunct, not comparative), like καθ' υπερβολην εις υπερβολην (2 Corinthians 4:17). Hυπερβολη is old word from υπερβαλλω, to throw beyond, to surpass, to excel (2 Corinthians 3:10; Ephesians 1:19). "I show you a supremely excellent way." Chapter 1 Corinthians 12:1 is this way, the way of love already laid down in 1 Corinthians 8:1 concerning the question of meats offered to idols (cf. 1 John 4:7). Poor division of chapters here. This verse belongs with chapter 1 Corinthians 12:1.
