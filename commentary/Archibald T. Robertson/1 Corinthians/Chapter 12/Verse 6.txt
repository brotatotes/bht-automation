<p><b> Of workings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργηματων</span></span>). Late word, here only in N.T., the effect of a thing wrought (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργεω</span></span>, to operate, perform, energize). Paul uses also the late kindred word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργεια</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:29">Colossians 1:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>) for efficiency.</p>
<p><b>Who worketh all things in all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ενεργων τα παντα εν πασιν</span></span>). Paul is not afraid to say that God is the Energy and the Energizer of the Universe. "I say that the magnet floats in space by the will of God" (Dr. W. R. Whitney, a world figure in science). This is his philosophic and scientific theory of the Cosmos. No one has shown Paul's philosophy and science to be wrong. Here he is speaking only of spiritual gifts and results as a whole, but he applies this principle to the universe (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα παντα</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span> (of Christ) and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span> (of God). Note the Trinity in these verses: the same Spirit (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4">1 Corinthians 12:4</span>), the same Lord (Jesus) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:5">1 Corinthians 12:5</span>, the same God (the Father) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:6">1 Corinthians 12:6</span>. </p>
