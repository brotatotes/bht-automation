 Manifestation  (φανερωσις). Late word, in papyri, in N.T. only here and 2 Corinthians 4:2, from φανεροω, to make manifest (φανερος). Each instance of the whole (verse 1 Corinthians 12:6) is repeatedly given (διδοτα, present passive indicative of διδωμ).To profit withal  (προς το συμφερον). See on 1 Corinthians 6:12; 1 Corinthians 10:23; 1 Corinthians 10:33 for Paul's guiding principle in such matters.
