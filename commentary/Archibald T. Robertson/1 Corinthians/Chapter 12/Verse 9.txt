 Faith  (πιστις). Not faith of surrender, saving faith, but wonder-working faith like that in 1 Corinthians 13:2 (Matthew 17:20; Matthew 21:21). Note here εν τω αυτω πνευματ (in the same Spirit) in contrast with δια and κατα in verse 1 Corinthians 12:8.Gifts of healings  (χαρισματα ιαματων). Ιαμα, old word from ιαομα, common in LXX, in N.T. only in this chapter. It means acts of healing as in Acts 4:30 (cf. James 5:14) and Luke 7:21 (of Jesus). Note εν here as just before.
