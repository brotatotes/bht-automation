<p><b> With the tongues </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταις γλωσσαις</span></span>). Instrumental case. Mentioned first because really least and because the Corinthians put undue emphasis on this gift. Plato (<i>Symposium</i>, 197) and many others have written on love, but Paul has here surpassed them all in this marvellous prose-poem. It comes like a sweet bell right between the jangling noise of the gifts in chapters 12 and 14. It is a pity to dissect this gem or to pull to pieces this fragrant rose, petal by petal. Fortunately Paul's language here calls for little comment, for it is the language of the heart. "The greatest, strongest, deepest thing Paul ever wrote" (Harnack). The condition (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and present subjunctive, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλω κα μη εχω</span></span>, though the form is identical with present indicative) is of the third class, a supposable case.</p>
<p><b>But have not love </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπην δε μη εχω</span></span>). This is the <i>crux</i> of the chapter. Love is the way <i>par excellence</i> of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span>. It is not yet clearly certain that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπη</span></span> (a back-formation from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαω</span></span>) occurs before the LXX and the N.T. Plutarch used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπησις</span></span>. Deissmann (<i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 198) once suspected it on an inscription in Pisidia. It is still possible that it occurs in the papyri (Prayer to Isis). See <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 75 for details. The rarity of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπη</span></span> made it easier for Christians to use this word for Christian love as opposed to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερως</span></span> (sexual love). See also Moffatt's Love in the N.T. (1930) for further data. The word is rare in the Gospels, but common in Paul, John, Peter, Jude. Paul does not limit <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπη</span></span> at all (both toward God and man). Charity (Latin <i>caritas</i>) is wholly inadequate. "Intellect was worshipped in Greece, and power in Rome; but where did St. Paul learn the surpassing beauty of love?" (Robertson and Plummer). Whether Paul had ever seen Jesus in the flesh, he knows him in the spirit. One can substitute Jesus for love all through this panegyric.</p>
<p><b>I am become </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγονα</span></span>). Second perfect indicative in the conclusion rather than the usual future indicative. It is put vividly, "I am already become." Sounding brass (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλχος ηχων</span></span>). Old words. Brass was the earliest metal that men learned to use. Our word <i>echoing</i> is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηχων</span></span>, present active participle. Used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:25">Luke 21:25</span> of the roaring of the sea. Only two examples in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Clanging cymbal </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυμβαλον αλαλαζον</span></span>). Cymbal old word, a hollow basin of brass. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αλαλαζω</span></span>, old onomatopoetic word to ring loudly, in lament (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:38">Mark 5:38</span>), for any cause as here. Only two N.T. examples. </p>
