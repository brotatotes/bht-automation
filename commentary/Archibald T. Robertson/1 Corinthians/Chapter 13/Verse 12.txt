<p><b> In a mirror </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' εσοπτρου</span></span>). By means of a mirror (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσοπτρον</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπτω</span></span>, old word, in papyri). Ancient mirrors were of polished metal, not glass, those in Corinth being famous.</p>
<p><b>Darkly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αινιγματ</span></span>). Literally, in an enigma. Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αινισσομα</span></span>, to express obscurely. This is true of all ancient mirrors. Here only in N.T., but often in LXX. "To see a friend's face in a cheap mirror would be very different from looking at the friend" (Robertson and Plummer).</p>
<p><b>Face to face </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσωπον προς προσωπον</span></span>). Note triple use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> which means facing one as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προσωπον</span></span> is old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπς</span></span>, eye, face.</p>
<p><b>Shall I know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγνωσομα</span></span>). I shall fully (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι-</span></span>) know. Future middle indicative as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span> (I know) is present active and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεγνωσθην</span></span> (I was fully known) is first aorist passive (all three voices). </p>
