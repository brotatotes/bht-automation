<p><b> Abideth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενε</span></span>). Singular, agreeing in number with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span> (faith), first in list.</p>
<p><b>The greatest of these </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζων τουτων</span></span>). Predicative adjective and so no article. The form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζων</span></span> is comparative, but it is used as superlative, for the superlative form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγιστος</span></span> had become rare in the <i>Koine</i> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 667ff.). See this idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:11">Matthew 11:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:1">Matthew 18:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:11">Matthew 23:11</span>. The other gifts pass away, but these abide forever. Love is necessary for both faith and hope. Does not love keep on growing? It is quite worth while to call attention to Henry Drummond's famous sermon <i>The Greatest Thing in the World</i> and to Dr. J.D. Jones's able book <i>The Greatest of These</i>. Greatest, Dr. Jones holds, because love is an attribute of God. </p>
