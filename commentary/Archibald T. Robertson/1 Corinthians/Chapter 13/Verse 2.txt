<p>The ecstatic gifts (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1">1 Corinthians 13:1</span>) are worthless. Equally so are the teaching gifts (prophecy, knowledge of mysteries, all knowledge). Crasis here in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καν=κα εαν</span></span>. Paul is not condemning these great gifts. He simply places love above them and essential to them. Equally futile is wonder-working faith "so as to remove mountains" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε ορη μεθιστανειν</span></span>) without love. This may have been a proverb or Paul may have known the words of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:20">Matthew 17:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:21">Matthew 21:21</span>).</p>
<p><b>I am nothing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουθεν ειμ</span></span>). Not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουθεις</span></span>, nobody, but an absolute zero. This form in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θ</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δ</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν</span></span>) had a vogue for a while (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 219). </p>
