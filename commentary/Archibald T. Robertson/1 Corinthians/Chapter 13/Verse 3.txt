<p><b> Bestow to feed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ψωμισω</span></span>). First aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψωμιζω</span></span>, to feed, to nourish, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψωμος</span></span>, morsel or bit, and so to feed, by putting a morsel into the mouth like infant (or bird). Old word, but only here in N.T.</p>
<p><b>To be burned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα καυθησωμα</span></span>). First future passive subjunctive (Textus Receptus), but D <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυθησομα</span></span> (future passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιω</span></span>, old word to burn). There were even some who courted martyrdom in later years (time of Diocletian). This Byzantine future subjunctive does not occur in the old MSS. (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 876). Aleph A B here read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχησωμα</span></span>, first aorist middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχαομα</span></span> (so Westcott and Hort), "that I may glory." This is correct.</p>
<p><b>It profiteth me nothing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν ωφελουμα</span></span>). Literally, I am helped nothing. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ουδεν</span></span> in the accusative case retained with passive verb. See two accusatives with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφελεω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:6">1 Corinthians 14:6</span>. Verb is old and from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφελος</span></span> (profit). </p>
