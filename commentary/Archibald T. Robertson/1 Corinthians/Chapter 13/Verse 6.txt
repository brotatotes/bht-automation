<p><b> Rejoiceth not in unrighteousness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου χαιρε</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:32">Romans 1:32</span> for this depth of degradation. There are people as low as that whose real joy is in the triumph of evil.</p>
<p><b>But rejoiceth with the truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνχαιρε δε τη αληθεια</span></span>). Associative instrumental case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν-</span></span> in composition. Truth personified as opposed to unrighteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:12">2 Thessalonians 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:8">Romans 2:8</span>). Love is on the side of the angels. Paul returns here to the positive side of the picture (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:4">1 Corinthians 13:4</span>) after the remarkable negatives. </p>
