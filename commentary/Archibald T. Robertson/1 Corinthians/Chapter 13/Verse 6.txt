 Rejoiceth not in unrighteousness  (ου χαιρε). See Romans 1:32 for this depth of degradation. There are people as low as that whose real joy is in the triumph of evil.But rejoiceth with the truth  (συνχαιρε δε τη αληθεια). Associative instrumental case after συν- in composition. Truth personified as opposed to unrighteousness (2 Thessalonians 2:12; Romans 2:8). Love is on the side of the angels. Paul returns here to the positive side of the picture (verse 1 Corinthians 13:4) after the remarkable negatives.
