 Love never faileth  (Hη αγαπη ουδεποτε πιπτε). New turn for the perpetuity of love. Πιπτε correct text, not εκπιπτε, as in Luke 16:17. Love survives everything.They shall be done away  (καταργηθησοντα). First future passive of καταργεω. Rare in old Greek, to make idle (αργος), inoperative. All these special spiritual gifts will pass. It is amazing how little of human work lasts.They shall cease  (παυσοντα). Future middle indicative of παυω, to make cease. They shall make themselves cease or automatically cease of themselves.
