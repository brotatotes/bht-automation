 With the understanding also  (κα τω νο). Instrumental case of νους. Paul is distinctly in favour of the use of the intellect in prayer. Prayer is an intelligent exercise of the mind.And I will sing with the understanding also  (ψαλω δε κα τω νο). There was ecstatic singing like the rhapsody of some prayers without intelligent words. But Paul prefers singing that reaches the intellect as well as stirs the emotions. Solos that people do not understand lose more than half their value in church worship. Ψαλλω originally meant to play on strings, then to sing with an accompaniment (Ephesians 5:19), and here apparently to sing without regard to an instrument.
