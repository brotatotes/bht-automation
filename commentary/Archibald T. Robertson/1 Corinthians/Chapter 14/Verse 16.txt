<p><b> Else if thou bless with the spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επε εαν ευλογηις εν πνευματ</span></span>). Third class condition. He means that, if one is praying and praising God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:16">1 Corinthians 10:16</span>) in an ecstatic prayer, the one who does not understand the ecstasy will be at a loss when to say "amen" at the close of the prayer. In the synagogues the Jews used responsive amens at the close of prayers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ne+5:13">Nehemiah 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ne+8:6">Nehemiah 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ch+16:36">1 Chronicles 16:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+106:48">Psalms 106:48</span>).</p>
<p><b>He that filleth the place of the unlearned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αναπληρων τον τοπον του ιδιωτου</span></span>). Not a special part of the room, but the position of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιωτου</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιος</span></span>, one's own), common from Herodotus for private person (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:13">Acts 4:13</span>), unskilled (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:6">2 Corinthians 11:6</span>), uninitiated (unlearned) in the gift of tongues as here and verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:23">1 Corinthians 14:23</span>.</p>
<p><b>At thy giving of thanks </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τη ση ευχαριστια</span></span>). Just the prayer, not the Eucharist or the Lord's Supper, as is plain from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:17">1 Corinthians 14:17</span>. </p>
