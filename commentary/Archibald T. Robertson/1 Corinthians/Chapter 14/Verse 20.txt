<p><b> Be not children in mind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη παιδια γινεσθε ταις φρεσιν</span></span>). "Cease becoming children in your intellects," as some of them evidently were. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:11-14">Hebrews 5:11-14</span> for a like complaint of intellectual dulness for being old babies.</p>
<p><b>In malice be ye babes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη κακια νηπιαζετε</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Be men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειο γινεσθε</span></span>). Keep on becoming adults in your minds. A noble and a needed command, pertinent today. </p>
