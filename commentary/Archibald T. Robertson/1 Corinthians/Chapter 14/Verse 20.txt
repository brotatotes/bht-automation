 Be not children in mind  (μη παιδια γινεσθε ταις φρεσιν). "Cease becoming children in your intellects," as some of them evidently were. Cf. Hebrews 5:11-14 for a like complaint of intellectual dulness for being old babies.In malice be ye babes  (τη κακια νηπιαζετε).Be men  (τελειο γινεσθε). Keep on becoming adults in your minds. A noble and a needed command, pertinent today.
