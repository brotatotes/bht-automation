<p><b> Will they not say that ye are mad? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ερουσιν οτ μαινεσθε?</span></span>). These unbelievers unacquainted (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιωτα</span></span>) with Christianity will say that the Christians are raving mad (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:15">Acts 12:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:24">Acts 26:24</span>). They will seem like a congregation of lunatics. </p>
