<p><b> Keep silence in the churches </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ταις εκκλησιαις σιγατωσαν</span></span>). The same verb used about the disorders caused by speakers in tongues (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:28">1 Corinthians 14:28</span>) and prophets (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:30">1 Corinthians 14:30</span>). For some reason some of the women were creating disturbance in the public worship by their dress (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:2-16">1 Corinthians 11:2-16</span>) and now by their speech. There is no doubt at all as to Paul's meaning here. In church the women are not allowed to speak (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλειν</span></span>) nor even to ask questions. They are to do that</p>
<p><b>at home </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν οικω</span></span>). He calls it a shame (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αισχρον</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:6">1 Corinthians 11:6</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:12">Ephesians 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:11">Titus 1:11</span>). Certainly women are still in subjection (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσεσθωσαν</span></span>) to their husbands (or ought to be). But somehow modern Christians have concluded that Paul's commands on this subject, even <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:12">1 Timothy 2:12</span>, were meant for specific conditions that do not apply wholly now. Women do most of the teaching in our Sunday schools today. It is not easy to draw the line. The daughters of Philip were prophetesses. It seems clear that we need to be patient with each other as we try to understand Paul's real meaning here. </p>
