 Keep silence in the churches  (εν ταις εκκλησιαις σιγατωσαν). The same verb used about the disorders caused by speakers in tongues (verse 1 Corinthians 14:28) and prophets (1 Corinthians 14:30). For some reason some of the women were creating disturbance in the public worship by their dress (1 Corinthians 11:2-16) and now by their speech. There is no doubt at all as to Paul's meaning here. In church the women are not allowed to speak (λαλειν) nor even to ask questions. They are to do thatat home  (εν οικω). He calls it a shame (αισχρον) as in 1 Corinthians 11:6 (cf. Ephesians 5:12; Titus 1:11). Certainly women are still in subjection (υποτασσεσθωσαν) to their husbands (or ought to be). But somehow modern Christians have concluded that Paul's commands on this subject, even 1 Timothy 2:12, were meant for specific conditions that do not apply wholly now. Women do most of the teaching in our Sunday schools today. It is not easy to draw the line. The daughters of Philip were prophetesses. It seems clear that we need to be patient with each other as we try to understand Paul's real meaning here.
