 Except he interpret  (εκτος ε μη διερμηνευη). Pleonastic combination of εκτος (preposition except) and ε μη (if not, unless) as in 1 Corinthians 15:2; 1 Timothy 5:19. For use of ε with subjunctive rather than εαν see Philippians 3:12 (common enough in the Koine, Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1017f., condition of third class). On the verb see on 1 Corinthians 12:30; Luke 24:27; Acts 9:36.Receive  (λαβη). Second aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of λαμβανω, may get edification.
