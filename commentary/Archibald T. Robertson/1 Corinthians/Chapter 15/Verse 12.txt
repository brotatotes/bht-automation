<p><b> Is preached </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυσσετα</span></span>). Personal use of the verb, Christ is preached.</p>
<p><b>How say some among you? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πως λεγουσιν εν υμιν τινεσ?</span></span>). The question springs naturally from the proof of the fact of the resurrection of Christ (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:1-11">1 Corinthians 15:1-11</span>) and the continual preaching which Paul here assumes by condition of the first class (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ει--κηρυσσετα</span></span>). There were sceptics in Corinth, possibly in the church, who denied the resurrection of dead people just as some men today deny that miracles happen or ever did happen. Paul's answer is the resurrection of Christ as a fact. It all turns on this fact. </p>
