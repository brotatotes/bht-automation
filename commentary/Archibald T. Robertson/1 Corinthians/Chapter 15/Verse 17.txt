<p><b> Vain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ματαια</span></span>). Old word from adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ματην</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:9">Matthew 15:9</span>), devoid of truth, a lie. Stronger word than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κενον</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:14">1 Corinthians 15:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Ye are yet in your sins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετ εστε εν ταις αμαρτιαις υμων</span></span>). Because the death of Christ has no atoning value if he did not rise from the dead. In that case he was only a man like other men and did not die for our sins (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span>). </p>
