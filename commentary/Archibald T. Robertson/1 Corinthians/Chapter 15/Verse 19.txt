<p><b> We have hoped </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλπικοτες εσμεν</span></span>). Periphrastic perfect active indicative. Hope limited to this life even if "in Christ."</p>
<p><b>Only </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονον</span></span>) qualifies the whole clause.</p>
<p><b>Most pitiable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεεινοτερο</span></span>). Comparative form, not superlative, of old adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεεινος</span></span>, to be pitied, pitiable. If our hope is limited to this life, we have denied ourselves what people call pleasures and have no happiness beyond. The Epicureans have the argument on us. Paul makes morality turn on the hope of immortality. Is he not right? Witness the breaking of moral ties today when people take a merely animal view of life. </p>
