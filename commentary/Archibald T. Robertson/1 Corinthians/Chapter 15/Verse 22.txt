<p><b> Shall be made alive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωοποιηθησοντα</span></span>). First future passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωοποιεω</span></span>, late verb (Aristotle) to give life, to restore to life as here. In verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:36">1 Corinthians 15:36</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωοποιειτα</span></span> is used in the sense of natural life as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21">John 5:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:63">John 6:63</span> of spiritual life. It is not easy to catch Paul's thought here. He means resurrection (restoration) by the verb here, but not necessarily eternal life or salvation. So also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντες</span></span> may not coincide in both clauses. All who die die in Adam, all who will be made alive will be made alive (restored to life) in Christ. The same problem occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span> about "all," and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:19">1 Corinthians 15:19</span> about "the many." </p>
