 Shall be made alive  (ζωοποιηθησοντα). First future passive indicative of ζωοποιεω, late verb (Aristotle) to give life, to restore to life as here. In verse 1 Corinthians 15:36 ζωοποιειτα is used in the sense of natural life as in John 5:21; John 6:63 of spiritual life. It is not easy to catch Paul's thought here. He means resurrection (restoration) by the verb here, but not necessarily eternal life or salvation. So also παντες may not coincide in both clauses. All who die die in Adam, all who will be made alive will be made alive (restored to life) in Christ. The same problem occurs in Romans 5:18 about "all," and in verse 1 Corinthians 15:19 about "the many."
