<p><b> Order </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταγματ</span></span>). Old military term from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τασσω</span></span>, to arrange, here only in N.T. Each in his own division, troop, rank.</p>
<p><b>At his coming </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη παρουσια</span></span>). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρουσια</span></span> was the technical word "for the arrival or visit of the king or emperor" and can be traced from the Ptolemaic period into the second century A.D. (Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 368). "Advent-coins were struck after a parousia of the emperor." Paul is only discussing "those that are Christ's" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:23">1 Corinthians 3:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:24">Galatians 5:24</span>) and so says nothing about judgment (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:19">1 Thessalonians 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>). </p>
