<p><b> The last enemy that shall be abolished is death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσχατος εχθρος καταργειτα ο θανατος</span></span>). A rather free translation. Literally, "death (note article, and so subject) is done away (prophetic or futuristic use of present tense of same verb as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:24">1 Corinthians 15:24</span>), the last enemy" (predicate and only one "last" and so no article as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span>). </p>
