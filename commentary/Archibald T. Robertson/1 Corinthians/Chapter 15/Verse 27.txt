<p><b> He put </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεταξεν</span></span>). First aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσω</span></span>, to subject. Supply God (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span>) as subject (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:7">Psalms 8:7</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:5-9">Hebrews 2:5-9</span> for similar use. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:8">1 Corinthians 15:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>But when he saith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν δε ειπη</span></span>). Here Christ must be supplied as the subject if the reference is to his future and final triumph. The syntax more naturally calls for God as the subject as before. Either way makes sense. But there is no need to take <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπη</span></span> (second aorist active subjunctive) as <i>a futurum exactum</i>, merely "whenever he shall say."</p>
<p><b>Are put in subjection </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτετακτα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative, state of completion, final triumph.</p>
<p><b>It is evident that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δηλον οτ</span></span>). Supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> (is) before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>He is excepted who did subject </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτος του υποταξαντος</span></span>). "Except the one (God) who did subject (articular aorist active participle) the all things to him (Christ)." </p>
