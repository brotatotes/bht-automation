<p><b> And when all things have been subjected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν δε υποταγη τα παντα</span></span>). Second aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσω</span></span>, not perfect. Merely, "when the all things are subjected unto him." The aorist subjunctive has given translators a deal of needless trouble in this passage. It is prophecy, of course.</p>
<p><b>That God may be all in all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα η ο θεος παντα εν πασιν</span></span>). The final goal of all God's redemptive plans as Paul has so well said in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span>. Precisely this language Paul will use of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:11">Colossians 3:11</span>). </p>
