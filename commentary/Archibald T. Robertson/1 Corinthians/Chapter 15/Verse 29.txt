<p><b>Which are baptized for the dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο βαπτιζομενο υπερ των νεκρων</span></span>). This passage remains a puzzle. Stanley gives thirteen interpretations, no one of which may be correct. Over thirty have been suggested. The Greek expositors took it to be about the dead (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> in sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> as often as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:6">2 Corinthians 1:6</span>) since baptism is a burial and a resurrection (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:2-6">Romans 6:2-6</span>). Tertullian tells of some heretics who took it to mean baptized in the place of dead people (unsaved) in order to save them. Some take it to be baptism over the dead. Others take it to mean that Paul and others were in peril of death as shown by baptism (see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:30">1 Corinthians 15:30</span>).</p>
