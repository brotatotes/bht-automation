<p><b>Which I also received </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κα παρελαβον</span></span>). Direct revelation claimed as about the institution of the Lord's Supper (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23">1 Corinthians 11:23</span>) and same verbs used (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδωκα, παρελαβον</span></span>). Four items given by Paul in explaining "the gospel" which Paul preached. Stanley calls it (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:1-11">1 Corinthians 15:1-11</span>) the creed of the early disciples, but "rather a sample of the exact form of the apostle's early teaching, than a profession of faith on the part of converts" (Vincent). The four items are presented by four verbs (died, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεθανεν</span></span>, was buried, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εταφη</span></span>, hath been raised, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγηγερτα</span></span>, appeared, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφθη</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Christ died </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος απεθανεν</span></span>). Historical fact and crucial event.</p>
<p><b>For our sins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ των αμαρτιων ημων</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυπερ</span></span> means literally over, in behalf, even instead of (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span>), where used of persons. But here much in the sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:14">Galatians 1:14</span>) as is common in <i>Koine</i>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:18">1 Peter 3:18</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ αμαρτιων, υπερ αδικων</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>According to the Scriptures </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα τας γραφας</span></span>). As Jesus showed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:37">Luke 22:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:25">Luke 24:25</span>) and as Peter pointed out (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:25-27">Acts 2:25-27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:35">Acts 3:35</span>) and as Paul had done (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:24">Acts 13:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:3">Acts 17:3</span>).
