We also as well as those who receive baptism which symbolizes death. Old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κινδυνος</span></span> (peril, danger), in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:23">Luke 8:23</span>. Paul's Epistles and Acts (especially chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:19">1 Corinthians 15:19</span>) throw light on Paul's argument. He was never out of danger from Damascus to the last visit to Rome. There are perils in Ephesus of which we do not know (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:8">2 Corinthians 1:8</span>) whatever may be true as to an Ephesian imprisonment. G. S. Duncan (<i>St. Paul's Ephesian Ministry</i>, 1930) even argues for several imprisonments in Ephesus. The accusative of time (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασαν ωραν</span></span>) naturally means all through every hour (extension). </p>
