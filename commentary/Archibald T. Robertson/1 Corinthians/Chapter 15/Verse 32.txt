<p><b> After the manner of men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα ανθρωπον</span></span>). Like men, for applause, money, etc. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:9">1 Corinthians 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:7">Philippians 3:7</span>).</p>
<p><b>If I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε εθηριομαχησα εν Εφεσω</span></span>). Late verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θηριομαχος</span></span>, a fighter with wild beasts. Found in inscriptions and in Ignatius. Those who argue for an Ephesian imprisonment for Paul and Ephesus as the place where he wrote the imprisonment epistles (see Duncan's book just mentioned) take the verb literally. There is in the ruins of Ephesus now a place called St. Paul's Prison. But Paul was a Roman citizen and it was unlawful to make such a one be a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θηριομαχος</span></span>. If he were cast to the lions unlawfully, he could have prevented it by claiming his citizenship. Besides, shortly after this Paul wrote II Corinthians, but he does not mention so unusual a peril in the list in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span>. The incident, whatever it was, whether literal or figurative language, took place before Paul wrote I Corinthians.</p>
<p><b>What doth it profit me? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ μο το οφελοσ?</span></span>). What the profit to me?</p>
<p><b>Let us eat and drink </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαγωμεν κα πιωμεν</span></span>). Volitive second aorist subjunctives of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσθιω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πινω</span></span>. Cited from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+22:13">Isaiah 22:13</span>. It is the outcry of the people of Jerusalem during the siege of Jerusalem by the Assyrians. At Anchiale near Tarsus is a statue of Sardanapalus with the inscription: "Eat, drink, enjoy thyself. The rest is nothing." This was the motto of the Epicureans. Paul is not giving his own view, but that of people who deny the resurrection. </p>
