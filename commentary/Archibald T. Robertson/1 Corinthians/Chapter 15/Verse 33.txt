<p><b> Be not deceived </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πλανασθε</span></span>). Do not be led astray (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλαναω</span></span>) by such a false philosophy of life.</p>
<p><b>Evil company </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομιλια κακα</span></span>). Evil companionships. Old word, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομιλια</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομιλος</span></span> (a crowd, gang, bunch). Only here in N.T. Good manners (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηθη</span></span>). Old word (kin to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθος</span></span>) custom, usage, morals. Good morals here. This line of poetry (iambic) occurs in Menander. It may be a current proverb. Paul could have gotten it from either source. </p>
