 Awake up righteously  (εκνηψατε δικαιως). Wake up as if from drunkenness. Εκνηφω, only here in N.T. sin not (μη αμαρτανετε). Stop sinning.No knowledge of God  (αγνωσιαν θεου). Old word for ignorance, in N.T. only here and 1 Peter 2:15. Ignorance of God, agnosticism. Some today (agnostics) even take pride in it instead of shame (εντροπην, turning in on oneself). See on 1 Corinthians 6:5 for εντροπη.
