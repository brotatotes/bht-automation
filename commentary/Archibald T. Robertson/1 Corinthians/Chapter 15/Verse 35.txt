<p><b> But some one will say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα ερε τις</span></span>). Paul knows what the sceptics were saying. He is a master at putting the standpoint of the imaginary adversary.</p>
<p><b>How </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πως</span></span>). This is still the great objection to the resurrection of our bodies. Granted that Jesus rose from the dead, for the sake of argument, these sceptics refuse to believe in the possibility of our resurrection. It is the attitude of Matthew Arnold who said, "Miracles do not happen." Scientifically we know the "how" of few things. Paul has an astounding answer to this objection. Death itself is the way of resurrection as in the death of the seed for the new plant (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:36">1 Corinthians 15:36</span>).</p>
<p><b>With what manner of body </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιω σωματ</span></span>). This is the second question which makes plainer the difficulty of the first. The first body perishes. Will that body be raised? Paul treats this problem more at length (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:38-54">1 Corinthians 15:38-54</span>) and by analogy of nature (Cf. Butler's famous <i>Analogy</i>). It is a spiritual, not a natural, body that is raised. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σωμα</span></span> here is an organism.</p>
<p><b>Flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρξ</span></span>) is the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωμα</span></span> for the natural man, but there is spiritual (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικον</span></span>) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωμα</span></span> for the resurrection. </p>
