<p><b> Thou foolish one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφρων</span></span>). Old word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρην</span></span>), lack of sense. It is a severe term and justified by the implication "that the objector plumes himself on his acuteness" (Robertson and Plummer). Proleptic position of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ</span></span> (thou) sharpens the point. Sceptics (agnostics) pose as unusually intellectual (the intelligentsia), but the pose does not make one intelligent.</p>
<p><b>Except it die </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη αποθανη</span></span>). Condition of third class, possibility assumed. This is the answer to the "how" question. In plant life death precedes life, death of the seed and then the new plant. </p>
