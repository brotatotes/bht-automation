<p><b> The same flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αυτη σαρξ</span></span>). Paul takes up animal life to show the great variety there is as in the plant kingdom. Even if evolution should prove to be true, Paul's argument remains valid. Variety exists along with kinship. Progress is shown in the different kingdoms, progress that even argues for a spiritual body after the body of flesh is lost.</p>
<p><b>Of beasts </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτηνων</span></span>). Old word, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κταομα</span></span>, to possess, and so property. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:34">Luke 10:34</span>.</p>
