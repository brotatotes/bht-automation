<p><b> And that he was buried </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα οτ εταφη</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> repeated before each of the four verbs as a separate item. Second aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαπτω</span></span>, old verb, to bury. This item is an important detail as the Gospels show.</p>
<p><b>And that he hath been raised </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα οτ εγηγερτα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγερθη</span></span> like</p>
<p><b>rose </b> of the King James' Version. There is reason for this sudden change of tense. Paul wishes to emphasize the permanence of the resurrection of Jesus. He is still risen.</p>
<p><b>On the third day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη ημερα τη τριτη</span></span>). Locative case of time. Whether Paul had seen either of the Gospels we do not know, but this item is closely identified with the fact of Christ's resurrection. We have it in Peter's speech (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:40">Acts 10:40</span>) and Jesus points it out as part of prophecy (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:46">Luke 24:46</span>). The other expression occasionally found "after three days" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:34">Mark 10:34</span>) is merely free vernacular for the same idea and not even <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:40">Matthew 12:40</span> disturbs it. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:1">Luke 24:1</span> for record of the empty tomb on the first day of the week (the third day). </p>
