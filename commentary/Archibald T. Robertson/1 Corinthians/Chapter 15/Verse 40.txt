<p><b>terrestrial </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγεια</span></span>, upon earth, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι, γε</span></span>) bodies.

Experience does not argue against a glory for the spiritual body (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>). </p>
