 Celestial  (επουρανια). Old word, from επ, upon, ουρανος, heaven, existing in heaven. Paul now rises higher in the range of his argument, above the merelyterrestrial  (επιγεια, upon earth, επι, γε) bodies. He has shown differences in the bodies here on earth in plants and in the animal kingdom and now he indicates like differences to be seen in the heavens above us.Is one  (ετερα μεν)--is another  (ετερα δε). Antithesis that admits glory for bodies on earth and bodies in the heavens. Experience does not argue against a glory for the spiritual body (Philippians 3:21).
