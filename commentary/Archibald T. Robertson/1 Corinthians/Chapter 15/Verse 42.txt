 So is the resurrection of the dead  (ουτως κα η αναστασις των νεκρων). Paul now applies his illustrations to his argument to prove the kind of body we shall have after the resurrection. He does it by a series of marvellous contrasts that gather all his points. The earthly and the risen beings differ in duration, value, power (Wendt).It is sown  (σπειρετα). In death, like the seed (1 Corinthians 15:37).In incorruption  (εν αφθαρσια). Late word from α privative and φθειρω, to corrupt. In LXX, Plutarch, Philo, late papyrus of a Gnostic gospel, and quotation from Epicurus. Vulgate incorruptio. The resurrection body has undergone a complete change as compared with the body of flesh like the plant from the seed. It is related to it, but it is a different body of glory.
