<p><b> So is the resurrection of the dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως κα η αναστασις των νεκρων</span></span>). Paul now applies his illustrations to his argument to prove the kind of body we shall have after the resurrection. He does it by a series of marvellous contrasts that gather all his points. The earthly and the risen beings differ in duration, value, power (Wendt).</p>
<p><b>It is sown </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπειρετα</span></span>). In death, like the seed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:37">1 Corinthians 15:37</span>).</p>
<p><b>In incorruption </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αφθαρσια</span></span>). Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθειρω</span></span>, to corrupt. In LXX, Plutarch, Philo, late papyrus of a Gnostic gospel, and quotation from Epicurus. Vulgate <i>incorruptio</i>. The resurrection body has undergone a complete change as compared with the body of flesh like the plant from the seed. It is related to it, but it is a different body of glory. </p>
