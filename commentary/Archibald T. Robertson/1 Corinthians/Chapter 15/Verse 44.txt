<p><b> A natural body </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωμα ψυχικον</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14">1 Corinthians 2:14</span> for this word, a difficult one to translate since <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span> has so many meanings. Natural is probably as good a rendering as can be made, but it is not adequate, for the body here is not all <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span> either as soul or life. The same difficulty exists as to a spiritual body (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωμα πνευματικον</span></span>). The resurrection body is not wholly <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span>. Caution is needed here in filling out details concerning the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span> and the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span>. But certainly he means to say that the "spiritual body" has some kind of germinal connection with the "natural body," though the development is glorious beyond our comprehension though not beyond the power of Christ to perform (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>). The force of the argument remains unimpaired though we cannot follow fully into the thought beyond us.</p>
<p><b>If there is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε εστιν</span></span>). "If there exists" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> means this with accent on first syllable), a condition of first class assumed as true.</p>
<p><b>There is also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν κα</span></span>). There exists also. </p>
