<p><b> Earthly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χοικος</span></span>). Late rare word, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χους</span></span>, dust.</p>
<p><b>The second man from heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δευτερος ανθρωπος εξ ουρανου</span></span>). Christ had a human (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχικον</span></span>) body, of course, but Paul makes the contrast between the first man in his natural body and the Second Man in his risen body. Paul saw Jesus after his resurrection and he appeared to him "from heaven." He will come again from heaven. </p>
