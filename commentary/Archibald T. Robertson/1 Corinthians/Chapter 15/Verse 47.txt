 Earthly  (χοικος). Late rare word, from χους, dust.The second man from heaven  (ο δευτερος ανθρωπος εξ ουρανου). Christ had a human (ψυχικον) body, of course, but Paul makes the contrast between the first man in his natural body and the Second Man in his risen body. Paul saw Jesus after his resurrection and he appeared to him "from heaven." He will come again from heaven.
