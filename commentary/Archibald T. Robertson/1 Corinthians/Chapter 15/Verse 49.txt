<p><b> We shall also bear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορεσομεν κα</span></span>). Old MSS. (so Westcott and Hort) read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορεσωμεν κα</span></span>. Volitive aorist active subjunctive, Let us also bear. Ellicott strongly opposes the subjunctive. It may be merely the failure of scribes to distinguish between long o and short o. Paul hardly means to say that our attaining the resurrection body depends on our own efforts! A late frequentative form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερω</span></span>. </p>
