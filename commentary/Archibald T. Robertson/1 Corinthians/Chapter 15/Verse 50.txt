<p><b> Cannot inherit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κληρονομησα ου δυναντα</span></span>). Hence there must be a change by death from the natural body to the spiritual body. In the case of Christ this change was wrought in less than three days and even then the body of Jesus was in a transition state before the Ascension. He ate and could be handled and yet he passed through closed doors. Paul does not base his argument on the special circumstances connected with the risen body of Jesus. </p>
