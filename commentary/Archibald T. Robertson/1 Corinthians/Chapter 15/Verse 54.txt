First aorist middle subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> whenever, merely indefinite future, no <i>futurum exactum</i>, merely meaning, "whenever shall put on," not "shall have put on."</p>
<p><b>Is swallowed up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεποθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταπινω</span></span>, old verb to drink down, swallow down. Perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα-</span></span> where we say "up," "swallow up." Timeless use of the aorist tense. Paul changes the active voice <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεπιεν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:8">Isaiah 25:8</span> to the passive. Death is no longer victory. Theodotion reads the Hebrew verb (<i>bulla</i>, for <i>billa</i>,) as passive like Paul. It is the "final overthrow of the king of Terrors" (Findlay) as shown in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:15">Hebrews 2:15</span>. </p>
