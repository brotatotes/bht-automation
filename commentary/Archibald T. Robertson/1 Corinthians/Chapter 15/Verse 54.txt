 Shall have put on  (ενδυσητα). First aorist middle subjunctive with οταν whenever, merely indefinite future, no futurum exactum, merely meaning, "whenever shall put on," not "shall have put on."Is swallowed up  (κατεποθη). First aorist passive indicative of καταπινω, old verb to drink down, swallow down. Perfective use of κατα- where we say "up," "swallow up." Timeless use of the aorist tense. Paul changes the active voice κατεπιεν in Isaiah 25:8 to the passive. Death is no longer victory. Theodotion reads the Hebrew verb (bulla, for billa,) as passive like Paul. It is the "final overthrow of the king of Terrors" (Findlay) as shown in Hebrews 2:15.
