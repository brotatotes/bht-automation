<p><b> To above five hundred brethren at once </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επανω πεντακοσιοις αδελφοις εφαπαξ</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Επανω</span></span> here is just an adverb with no effect on the case. As a preposition with the ablative see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:14">Matthew 5:14</span>. This incident is the one described in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:16">Matthew 28:16</span> the prearranged meeting on the mountain in Galilee. The strength of this witness lies in the fact that the majority (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πλειους</span></span>) of them were still living when Paul wrote this Epistle, say spring of A.D. 54 or 55, not over 25 years after Christ's resurrection. </p>
