 As unto one born out of due time  (ωσπερε τω εκτρωματ). Literally, as to the miscarriage (or untimely birth). Word first occurs in Aristotle for abortion or miscarriage and occurs in LXX (Numbers 12:12; Job 3:16) and papyri (for miscarriage by accident). The verb τιτρωσκω means to wound and εκ is out. Paul means that the appearance to him came after Jesus had ascended to heaven.
