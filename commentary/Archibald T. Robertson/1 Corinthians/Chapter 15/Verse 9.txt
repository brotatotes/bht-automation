<p><b> The least </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ελαχιστος</span></span>). True superlative, not elative. Explanation of the strong word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτρωμα</span></span> just used. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span> where he calls himself "less than the least of all saints" and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span> the "chief" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτος</span></span>) of sinners. Yet under attack from the Judaizers Paul stood up for his rank as equal to any apostle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:5">2 Corinthians 11:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span>).</p>
<p><b>Because I persecuted the church of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιωξα την εκκλησιαν του θεου</span></span>). There were times when this terrible fact confronted Paul like a nightmare. Who does not understand this mood of contrition? </p>
