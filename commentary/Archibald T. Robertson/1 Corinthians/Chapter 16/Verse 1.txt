<p><b> Now concerning the collection for the saints </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ δε της λογιας της εις τους αγιους</span></span>). Paul has discussed all the problems raised by the Corinthians. Now he has on his own heart the collection for the saints in Jerusalem (see chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:2">1 Corinthians 16:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:9">1 Corinthians 16:9</span>). This word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογια</span></span> (or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-εια</span></span>) is now known to be derived from a late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογευω</span></span>, to collect, recently found in papyri and inscriptions (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 143). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογια</span></span> is chiefly found in papyri, ostraca, and inscriptions that tell of religious collections for a god or a temple (Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 105). The introduction of this topic may seem sudden, but the Corinthians were behind with their part of it. They may even have asked further about it. Paul feels no conflict between discussion of the resurrection and the collection.</p>
<p><b>So also do ye </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως κα υμας ποιησατε</span></span>). Paul had given orders (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεταξα</span></span>) to the churches of Galatia and now gives them like commands. As a matter of fact, they had promised a long time before this (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:10">2 Corinthians 8:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:1-5">2 Corinthians 9:1-5</span>). Now do what you pledged. </p>
