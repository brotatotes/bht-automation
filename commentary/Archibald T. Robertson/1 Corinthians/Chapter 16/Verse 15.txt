<p><b> Ye know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδατε</span></span>). <i>Koine</i> form for second perfect indicative used as present of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>. Parenthetic clause through rest of the verse. Stephanas is mentioned also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:16">1 Corinthians 1:16</span> and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:17">1 Corinthians 16:17</span>. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαρχη</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:20">1 Corinthians 15:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:23">1 Corinthians 15:23</span>.</p>
<p><b>They have set themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εταξαν εαυτους</span></span>). Remarkable statement worthy of attention today. This noble family appointed themselves to be ministers to the saints that needed it (the poor and needy). Personal work for Christ is still the only way to win the world for Christ, voluntary personal work. If all Christians did it! </p>
