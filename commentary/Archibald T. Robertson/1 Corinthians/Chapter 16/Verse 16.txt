<p><b> That ye also be in subjection unto such </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα κα υμεις υποτασσησθε τοις τοιουτοις</span></span>). This is the exhortation begun in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15">1 Corinthians 16:15</span>. The family of Stephanas took the lead in good works. Do ye also follow such leaders. This is our great problem today, to find great leaders and many loyal followers. This would solve all church problems, great leadership and great following. Lend a hand. </p>
