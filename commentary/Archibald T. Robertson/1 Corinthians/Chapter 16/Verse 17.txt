 At the coming  (επ τη παρουσια). At the coming here of Stephanas, etc., the very word used of the παρουσια of Christ (1 Corinthians 15:23).That which was lacking on your part they supplied  (το υμετερον υστερημα ουτο ανεπληρωσαν). Either "these filled up my lack of you" or "these filled up your lack of me." Either makes perfectly good sense and both were true. Which Paul meant we cannot tell.
