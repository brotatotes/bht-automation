<p><b> The churches of Asia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α εκκλησια της Ασιας</span></span>). True of the Roman province (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:10">Acts 10:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:26">Acts 10:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1">Colossians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:13">Colossians 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:16">Colossians 4:16</span>). The gospel spread rapidly from Ephesus.</p>
<p><b>With the church that is in their house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν τη κατ' οικον αυτων εκκλησια</span></span>). Paul had long ago left the synagogue for the school house of Tyrannus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:9">Acts 19:9</span>). But Aquila and Prisca opened their house here for the services. The churches had to meet where they could. Paul had laboured and lived with this family in Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span>) and now again in Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:19">Acts 18:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:34">Acts 20:34</span>). It was their habit wherever they lived (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span>). </p>
