 The churches of Asia  (α εκκλησια της Ασιας). True of the Roman province (Acts 10:10; Acts 10:26; Colossians 1:6; Colossians 2:1; Colossians 4:13; Colossians 4:16). The gospel spread rapidly from Ephesus.With the church that is in their house  (συν τη κατ' οικον αυτων εκκλησια). Paul had long ago left the synagogue for the school house of Tyrannus (Acts 19:9). But Aquila and Prisca opened their house here for the services. The churches had to meet where they could. Paul had laboured and lived with this family in Corinth (Acts 18:2) and now again in Ephesus (Acts 18:19; Acts 20:34). It was their habit wherever they lived (Romans 16:5).
