For the use of the cardinal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιαν</span></span> in sense of ordinal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτην</span></span> after Hebrew fashion in LXX (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 672) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:2">Mark 16:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:1">Luke 24:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7">Acts 20:7</span>.

Treasuring it (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19">Matthew 6:19</span>. for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θησαυριζω</span></span>).

<p><b>As he may prosper </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ εαν ευοδωτα</span></span>). Old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ</span></span>, well, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδος</span></span>, way or journey, to have a good journey, to prosper in general, common in LXX. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:10">Romans 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:2">3 John 1:2</span>. It is uncertain what form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευοδωτα</span></span> is, present passive subjunctive, perfect passive indicative, or even perfect passive subjunctive (Moulton, <i>Prolegomena</i>, p. 54). The old MSS. had no accents. Some MSS. even have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευοδωθη</span></span> (first aorist passive subjunctive). But the sense is not altered. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hοτ</span></span> is accusative of general reference and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> can occur either with the subjunctive or indicative. This rule for giving occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:12">2 Corinthians 8:12</span>. Paul wishes the collections to be made before he comes. </p>
