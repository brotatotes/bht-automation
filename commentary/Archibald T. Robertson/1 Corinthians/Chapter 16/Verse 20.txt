<p><b> With a holy kiss </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν φιληματ αγιω</span></span>). In the synagogue men kissed men and women kissed women. This was the Christian custom at a later date and apparently so here. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:26">1 Thessalonians 5:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:12">2 Corinthians 13:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:8">Romans 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:14">1 Peter 5:14</span>. It seems never to have been promiscuous between the sexes. </p>
