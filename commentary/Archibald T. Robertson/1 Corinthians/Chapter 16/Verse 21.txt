<p><b> Of me Paul with mine own hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εμη χειρ Παυλου</span></span>). Literally, "With the hand of me Paul." The genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παυλου</span></span> is in apposition with the possessive pronoun <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμη</span></span> which is in the instrumental case just as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>, the sign in every Epistle. He dictated, but signed at the end. If we only had that signature on that scrap of paper. </p>
