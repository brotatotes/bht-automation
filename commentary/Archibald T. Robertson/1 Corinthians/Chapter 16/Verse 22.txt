Αναθεμα. The word seems a bit harsh to us, but the refusal to love Christ (ου φιλε) on the part of a nominal Christian deserves αναθεμα (see on 1 Corinthians 12:3 for this word). Μαραν αθα. This Aramaic phrase means "Our Lord (μαραν) cometh (αθα)" or, used as a proleptic perfect, "has come." It seems to be a sort of watchword (cf. 1 Thessalonians 4:14; James 5:7; Philippians 4:5; Revelation 1:7; Revelation 3:11; Revelation 22:20), expressing the lively hope that the Lord will come. It was a curious blunder in the King James Version that connected Μαραν αθα with Αναθεμα.
