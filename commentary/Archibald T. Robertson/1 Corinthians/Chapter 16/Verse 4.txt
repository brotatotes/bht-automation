<p><b> And if it be meet for me to go also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν δε αξιον η του καμε πορευεσθα</span></span>). "If the collection be worthy of the going as to me also." Condition of third class (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν--η</span></span>) and the articular infinitive in the genitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του</span></span>) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιον</span></span>. The accusative of general reference (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καμε</span></span>, me also) with the infinitive. So the awkward phrase clears up. </p>
