<p><b> For a great and effectual door is opened unto me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυρα γαρ μο ανεωιγεν μεγαλη κα ενεργης</span></span>). Second perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιγω</span></span>, to open. Intransitive, stands wide open at last after his years there (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:31">Acts 20:31</span>). A wide open door. What does he mean by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργης</span></span>? It is a late word in the <i>Koine</i>. In the papyri a medical receipt has it for "tolerably strong." The form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργος</span></span> in the papyri is used of a mill "in working order," of "tilled land," and of "wrought iron." In the N.T. it occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:6">Philemon 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:12">Hebrews 4:12</span> of "the word of God" as "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργης</span></span>" (powerful). Paul means that he has at least a great opportunity for work in Ephesus.</p>
<p><b>And there are many adversaries </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αντικειμενο πολλο</span></span>). "And many are lying opposed to me," lined up against me. These Paul mentions as a reason for staying in, not for leaving, Ephesus. Read <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:19">1 Corinthians 16:19</span> and see the opposition from Jews and Gentiles with the explosion under the lead of Demetrius. And yet Paul suddenly leaves. He hints of much of which we should like to know more (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:32">1 Corinthians 15:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:8">2 Corinthians 1:8</span>). </p>
