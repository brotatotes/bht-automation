<p><b> Not with excellency of speech or of wisdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου καθ' υπεροχην λογου η σοφιας</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυπεροχη</span></span> is an old word from the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερεχω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:7">Philippians 4:7</span>) and means preeminence, rising above. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:2">1 Timothy 2:2</span> of magistrates. It occurs in inscriptions of Pergamum for persons of position (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 255). Here it means excess or superfluity, "not in excellence of rhetorical display or of philosophical subtlety" (Lightfoot).</p>
<p><b>The mystery of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μυστηριον του θεου</span></span>). So Aleph A C Copt. like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>, but B D L P read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυριον</span></span> like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:6">1 Corinthians 1:6</span>. Probably</p>
<p><b>mystery </b> is correct. Christ crucified is the mystery of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>). Paul did not hesitate to appropriate this word in common use among the mystery religions, but he puts into it his ideas, not those in current use. It is an old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυεω</span></span>, to close, to shut, to initiate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:12">Philippians 4:12</span>). This mystery was once hidden from the ages (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</span>), but is now made plain in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>). The papyri give many illustrations of the use of the word for secret doctrines known only to the initiated (Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>). </p>
