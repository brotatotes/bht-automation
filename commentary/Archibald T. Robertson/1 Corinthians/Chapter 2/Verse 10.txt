<p><b> But unto us God revealed them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημιν γαρ απεκαλυψεν ο θεος</span></span>). So with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span> B 37 Sah Cop read instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> of Aleph A C D. "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δε</span></span> is superficially easier; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span> intrinsically better" (Findlay). Paul explains why this is no longer hidden, "for God revealed unto us" the wonders of grace pictured in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:9">1 Corinthians 2:9</span>. We do not have to wait for heaven to see them. Hence we can utter those things hidden from the eye, the ear, the heart of man. This revelation (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκαλυψεν</span></span>, first aorist active indicative) took place, at "the entry of the Gospel into the world," not "when we were admitted into the Church, when we were baptized" as Lightfoot interprets it.</p>
<p><b>Through the Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του πνευματος</span></span>). The Holy Spirit is the agent of this definite revelation of grace, a revelation with a definite beginning or advent (constative aorist), an unveiling by the Spirit where "human ability and research would not have sufficed" (Robertson and Plummer), "according to the revelation of the mystery" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>), "the revelation given to Christians as an event that began a new epoch in the world's history" (Edwards).</p>
<p><b>Searcheth all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα εραυνα</span></span>). This is the usual form from A.D. 1 on rather than the old <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερευναω</span></span>. The word occurs (Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>) for a professional searcher's report and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εραυνητα</span></span>, searchers for customs officials. "The Spirit is the organ of understanding between man and God" (Findlay). So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:27">Romans 8:27</span> we have this very verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εραυναω</span></span> again of God's searching our hearts. The Holy Spirit not merely investigates us, but he searches "even the deep things of God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τα βαθη του θεου</span></span>). <i>Profunda Dei</i> (Vulgate). Cf. "the deep things of Satan" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:24">Revelation 2:24</span>) and Paul's language in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:33">Romans 11:33</span> "Oh the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God." Paul's point is simply that the Holy Spirit fully comprehends the depth of God's nature and his plans of grace and so is fully competent to make the revelation here claimed. </p>
