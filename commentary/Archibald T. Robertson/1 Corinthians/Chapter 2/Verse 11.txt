<p><b> Knoweth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδεν, εγνωκεν</span></span>). Second perfect of root <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδ-</span></span>, to see and so know, first perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, to know by personal experience, has come to know and still knows. See First John for a clear distinction in the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>The spirit of man that is in him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πνευμα του ανθρωπου το εν αυτω</span></span>). The self-consciousness of man that resides in the man or woman (generic term for mankind, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπος</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>The Spirit of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πνευμα του θεου</span></span>). Note the absence of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το εν αυτω</span></span>. It is not the mere self-consciousness of God, but the personal Holy Spirit in his relation to God the Father. Paul's analogy between the spirit of man and the Spirit of God does not hold clear through and he guards it at this vital point as he does elsewhere as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span> and in the full Trinitarian benediction in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:13">2 Corinthians 13:13</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πνευμα</span></span> in itself merely means breath or wind as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:8">John 3:8</span>. To know accurately Paul's use of the word in every instance calls for an adequate knowledge of his theology, and psychology. But the point here is plain. God's Holy Spirit is amply qualified to make the revelation claimed here in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6-10">1 Corinthians 2:6-10</span>. </p>
