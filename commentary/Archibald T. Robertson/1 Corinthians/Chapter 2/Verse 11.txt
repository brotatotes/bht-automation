 Knoweth  (οιδεν, εγνωκεν). Second perfect of root ιδ-, to see and so know, first perfect of γινωσκω, to know by personal experience, has come to know and still knows. See First John for a clear distinction in the use of οιδα and γινωσκω.The spirit of man that is in him  (το πνευμα του ανθρωπου το εν αυτω). The self-consciousness of man that resides in the man or woman (generic term for mankind, ανθρωπος).The Spirit of God  (το πνευμα του θεου). Note the absence of το εν αυτω. It is not the mere self-consciousness of God, but the personal Holy Spirit in his relation to God the Father. Paul's analogy between the spirit of man and the Spirit of God does not hold clear through and he guards it at this vital point as he does elsewhere as in Romans 8:26 and in the full Trinitarian benediction in 2 Corinthians 13:13. Πνευμα in itself merely means breath or wind as in John 3:8. To know accurately Paul's use of the word in every instance calls for an adequate knowledge of his theology, and psychology. But the point here is plain. God's Holy Spirit is amply qualified to make the revelation claimed here in verses 1 Corinthians 2:6-10.
