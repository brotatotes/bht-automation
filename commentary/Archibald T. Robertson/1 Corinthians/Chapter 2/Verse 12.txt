<p><b> But we </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις δε</span></span>). We Christians like</p>
<p><b>us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημιν</span></span>) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10">1 Corinthians 2:10</span> of the revelation, but particularly Paul and the other apostles.</p>
<p><b>Received </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαβομεν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span> and so a definite event, though the constative aorist may include various stages.</p>
<p><b>Not the spirit of the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου το πνευμα του κοσμου</span></span>). Probably a reference to the wisdom of this age in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:4">Romans 8:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:6">Romans 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:7">Romans 8:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:4">1 Corinthians 11:4</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θε πνευμα ετερον</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>But the spirit which is of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα το πνευμα το εκ θεου</span></span>). Rather, "from God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>), which proceeds from God.</p>
<p><b>That we might know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ειδωμεν</span></span>). Second perfect subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> to express purpose. Here is a distinct claim of the Holy Spirit for understanding (Illumination) the Revelation received. It is not a senseless rhapsody or secret mystery, but God expects us to understand "the things that are freely given us by God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα υπο του θεου χαρισθεντα ημιν</span></span>). First aorist passive neuter plural articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριζομα</span></span>, to bestow. God gave the revelation through the Holy Spirit and he gives us the illumination of the Holy Spirit to understand the mind of the Spirit. The tragic failures of men to understand clearly God's revealed will is but a commentary on the weakness and limitation of the human intellect even when enlightened by the Holy Spirit. </p>
