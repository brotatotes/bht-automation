<p><b> Now the natural man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχικος δε ανθρωπος</span></span>). Note absence of article here, "A natural man" (an unregenerate man). Paul does not employ modern psychological terms and he exercises variety in his use of all the terms here present as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικοσ, ψυχη</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχικοσ, σαρξ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκινος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκικος</span></span>. A helpful discussion of the various uses of these words in the New Testament is given by Burton in his <i>New Testament Word Studies</i>, pp. 62-68, and in his</p>
<p><b>Spirit, Soul, and Flesh </b>. The papyri furnish so many examples of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρξ, πνευμα</span></span>, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span> that Moulton and Milligan make no attempt at an exhaustive treatment, but give a few miscellaneous examples to illustrate the varied uses that parallel the New Testament. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ψυχικος</span></span> is a qualitative adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span> (breath of life like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανιμα</span></span>, life, soul). Here the Vulgate renders it by <i>animalis</i> and the German by <i>sinnlich</i>, the original sense of animal life as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:19">Judges 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:15">James 3:15</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:44">1 Corinthians 15:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:46">1 Corinthians 15:46</span> there is the same contrast between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχικος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικος</span></span> as here. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχικος</span></span> man is the unregenerate man while the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικος</span></span> man is the renewed man, born again of the Spirit of God.</p>
<p><b>Receiveth not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου δεχετα</span></span>). Does not accept, rejects, refuses to accept. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:7">Romans 8:7</span> Paul definitely states the inability (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε γαρ δυνατα</span></span>) of the mind of the flesh to receive the things of the Spirit untouched by the Holy Spirit. Certainly the initiative comes from God whose Holy Spirit makes it possible for us to accept the things of the Spirit of God. They are no longer "foolishness" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωρια</span></span>) to us as was once the case (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:23">1 Corinthians 1:23</span>). Today one notes certain of the <i>intelligentsia</i> who sneer at Christ and Christianity in their own blinded ignorance.</p>
<p><b>He cannot know them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου δυνατα γνωνα</span></span>). He is not able to get a knowledge (ingressive second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>). His helpless condition calls for pity in place of impatience on our part, though such an one usually poses as a paragon of wisdom and commiserates the deluded followers of Christ.</p>
<p><b>They are spiritually judged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικως ανακρινετα</span></span>). Paul and Luke are fond of this verb, though nowhere else in the N.T. Paul uses it only in I Corinthians. The word means a sifting process to get at the truth by investigation as of a judge. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:11">Acts 17:11</span> the Beroeans scrutinized the Scriptures. These <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχικο</span></span> men are incapable of rendering a decision for they are unable to recognize the facts. They judge by the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span> (mere animal nature) rather than by the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span> (the renewed spirit). </p>
