<p><b> Judgeth all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακρινε παντα</span></span>). The spiritual man (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πνευματικος</span></span>) is qualified to sift, to examine, to decide rightly, because he has the eyes of his heart enlightened (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>) and is no longer blinded by the god of this world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>). There is a great lesson for Christians who know by personal experience the things of the Spirit of God. Men of intellectual gifts who are ignorant of the things of Christ talk learnedly and patronizingly about things of which they are grossly ignorant. The spiritual man is superior to all this false knowledge.</p>
<p><b>He himself is judged of no man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος δε υπ' ουδενος ανακρινετα</span></span>). Men will pass judgment on him, but the spiritual man refuses to accept the decision of his ignorant judges. He stands superior to them all as Polycarp did when he preferred to be burnt to saying, "Lord Caesar" in place of "Lord Jesus." He was unwilling to save his earthly life by the worship of Caesar in place of the Lord Jesus. Polycarp was a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικος</span></span> man. </p>
