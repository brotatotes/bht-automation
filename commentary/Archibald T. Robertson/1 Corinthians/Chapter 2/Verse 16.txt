<p><b> For who hath known the mind of the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τις γαρ εγνω νουν Κυριου;</span></span>). Quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:13">Isaiah 40:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>That he should instruct him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος συνβιβασε αυτον</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span> (relative</p>
<p><b>who </b>) is almost consecutive (result). The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικος</span></span> man is superior to others who attempt even to instruct God himself. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:22">Acts 9:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:10">Acts 16:10</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνβιβαζω</span></span>, to make go together.</p>
<p><b>But we have the mind of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις δε νουν Χριστου εχομεν</span></span>). As he has already shown (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6-13">1 Corinthians 2:6-13</span>). Thus with the mind (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νους</span></span>. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:5">Philippians 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:27">Romans 8:27</span>). Hence Paul and all <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικο</span></span> men are superior to those who try to shake their faith in Christ, the mystery of God. Paul can say, "I know him whom I have believed." "I believe; therefore I have spoken." </p>
