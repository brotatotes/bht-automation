<p><b> I was with you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενομην προς υμας</span></span>). Rather, "I came to you" (not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span>, was). "I not only eschewed all affectation of cleverness or grandiloquence, but I went to the opposite extreme of diffidence and nervous self-effacement" (Robertson and Plummer). Paul had been in prison in Philippi, driven out of Thessalonica and Beroea, politely bowed out of Athens. It is a human touch to see this shrinking as he faced the hard conditions in Corinth. It is a common feeling of the most effective preachers. Cool complacency is not the mood of the finest preaching.
