<p><b> Not in persuasive words of wisdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εν πιθοις σοφιας λογοις</span></span>). This looks like a false disclaimer or mock modesty, for surely the preacher desires to be persuasive. This adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιθος</span></span> (MSS. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθος</span></span>) has not yet been found elsewhere. It seems to be formed directly from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθω</span></span>, to persuade, as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φειδος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιδος</span></span>) is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φειδομα</span></span>, to spare. The old Greek form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιθανος</span></span> is common enough and is used by Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. VIII. 9. 1) of "the plausible words of the lying prophet" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1">1 Corinthians 2:1</span>. The kindred word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιθανολογια</span></span> occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:4">Colossians 2:4</span> for the specious and plausible Gnostic philosophers. And gullible people are easy marks for these plausible pulpiteers. Corinth put a premium on the veneer of false rhetoric and thin thinking.</p>
<p><b>But in demonstration </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' εν αποδειξε</span></span>). In contrast with the</p>
<p><b>plausibility </b> just mentioned. This word, though an old one from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδεικνυμ</span></span>, to show forth, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament.</p>
<p><b>Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span>) here can be the Holy Spirit or inward spirit as opposed to superficial expression and</p>
<p><b>power </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις</span></span>) is moral power rather than intellectual acuteness (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18">1 Corinthians 1:18</span>). </p>
