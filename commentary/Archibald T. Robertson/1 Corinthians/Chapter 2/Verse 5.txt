 That your faith should not stand  (ινα η πιστις υμων μη η). Purpose of God, but μη η is "not be" merely. The only secure place for faith to find a rest is in God's power, not in the wisdom of men. One has only to instance the changing theories of men about science, philosophy, religion, politics to see this. A sure word from God can be depended on.
