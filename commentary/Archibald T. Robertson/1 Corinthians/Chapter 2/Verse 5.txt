<p><b> That your faith should not stand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα η πιστις υμων μη η</span></span>). Purpose of God, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη η</span></span> is "not be" merely. The only secure place for faith to find a rest is in God's power, not in the wisdom of men. One has only to instance the changing theories of men about science, philosophy, religion, politics to see this. A sure word from God can be depended on. </p>
