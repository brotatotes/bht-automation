<p><b> Among the perfect </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις τελειοις</span></span>). Paul is not here drawing a distinction between exoteric and esoteric wisdom as the Gnostics did for their initiates, but simply to the necessary difference in teaching for babes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:1">1 Corinthians 3:1</span>) and adults or grown men (common use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειος</span></span> for relative perfection, for adults, as is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:20">1 Corinthians 14:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:15">Philippians 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:14">Hebrews 5:14</span>). Some were simply old babes and unable in spite of their years to digest solid spiritual food, "the ample teaching as to the Person of Christ and the eternal purpose of God. Such 'wisdom' we have in the Epistles to the Ephesians and the Colossians especially, and in a less degree in the Epistle to the Romans. This 'wisdom' is discerned in the Gospel of John, as compared with the other Evangelists" (Lightfoot). These imperfect disciples Paul wishes to develop into spiritual maturity.</p>
<p><b>Of this world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του αιωνος τουτου</span></span>). This age, more exactly, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:20">1 Corinthians 1:20</span>. This wisdom does not belong to the passing age of fleeting things, but to the enduring and eternal (Ellicott).</p>
<p><b>Which are coming to naught </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των καταργουμενων</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:28">1 Corinthians 1:28</span>. Present passive participle genitive plural of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταργεω</span></span>. The gradual nullification of these "rulers" before the final and certain triumph of the power of Christ in his kingdom. </p>
