 Among the perfect  (εν τοις τελειοις). Paul is not here drawing a distinction between exoteric and esoteric wisdom as the Gnostics did for their initiates, but simply to the necessary difference in teaching for babes (1 Corinthians 3:1) and adults or grown men (common use of τελειος for relative perfection, for adults, as is in 1 Corinthians 14:20; Philippians 3:15; Ephesians 4:13; Hebrews 5:14). Some were simply old babes and unable in spite of their years to digest solid spiritual food, "the ample teaching as to the Person of Christ and the eternal purpose of God. Such 'wisdom' we have in the Epistles to the Ephesians and the Colossians especially, and in a less degree in the Epistle to the Romans. This 'wisdom' is discerned in the Gospel of John, as compared with the other Evangelists" (Lightfoot). These imperfect disciples Paul wishes to develop into spiritual maturity.Of this world  (του αιωνος τουτου). This age, more exactly, as in 1 Corinthians 1:20. This wisdom does not belong to the passing age of fleeting things, but to the enduring and eternal (Ellicott).Which are coming to naught  (των καταργουμενων). See on 1 Corinthians 1:28. Present passive participle genitive plural of καταργεω. The gradual nullification of these "rulers" before the final and certain triumph of the power of Christ in his kingdom.
