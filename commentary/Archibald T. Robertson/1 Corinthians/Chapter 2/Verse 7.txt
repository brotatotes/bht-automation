<p><b> God's wisdom in a mystery </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεου σοφιαν εν μυστηριω</span></span>). Two points are here sharply made. It is God's wisdom (note emphatic position of the genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεου</span></span>) in contrast to the wisdom of this age. Every age of the world has a conceit of its own and it is particularly true of this twentieth century, but God's wisdom is eternal and superior to the wisdom of any age or time. God's wisdom is alone absolute. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1">1 Corinthians 2:1</span> for mystery. It is not certain whether</p>
<p><b>in a mystery </b> is to be taken with</p>
<p><b>wisdom </b> or</p>
<p><b>we speak </b>. The result does not differ greatly, probably with</p>
<p><b>wisdom </b>, so long a secret and now at last revealed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</span>).</p>
<p><b>That hath been hidden </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αποκεκρυμμενην</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5">Ephesians 3:5</span>. Articular perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκρυπτω</span></span>, more precisely defining the indefinite <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφιαν</span></span> (wisdom).</p>
<p><b>Foreordained before the worlds </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προωρισεν προ των αιωνων</span></span>). This relative clause (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span>) defines still more closely God's wisdom. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ</span></span> with both verb and substantive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιωνων</span></span>). Constative aorist of God's elective purpose as shown in Christ crucified (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18-24">1 Corinthians 1:18-24</span>). "It was no afterthought or change of plan" (Robertson and Plummer).</p>
<p><b>Unto our glory </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις δοξαν ημων</span></span>). "The glory of inward enlightenment as well as of outward exaltation" (Lightfoot). </p>
