<p><b> But as it is written </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα καθως γεγραπτα</span></span>). Elliptical sentence like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:3">Romans 15:3</span> where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγονεν</span></span> (it has happened) can be supplied. It is not certain where Paul derives this quotation as Scripture. Origen thought it a quotation from the <i>Apocalypse of Elias</i> and Jerome finds it also in the <i>Ascension of Isaiah</i>. But these books appear to be post-Pauline, and Jerome denies that Paul obtained it from these late apocryphal books. Clement of Rome finds it in the LXX text of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+64:4">Isaiah 64:4</span> and cites it as a Christian saying. It is likely that Paul here combines freely <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+64:4">Isaiah 64:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:17">Isaiah 65:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:15">Isaiah 52:15</span> in a sort of catena or free chain of quotations as he does in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:10-18">Romans 3:10-18</span>. There is also an anacoluthon for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> (which things) occurs as the direct object (accusative) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδεν</span></span> (saw) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσαν</span></span> (heard), but as the subject (nominative) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεβη</span></span> (entered, second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινω</span></span>, to go up).</p>
<p><b>Whatsoever </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσα</span></span>). A climax to the preceding relative clause (Findlay).</p>
<p><b>Prepared </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητοιμασεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετοιμαζω</span></span>. The only instance where Paul uses this verb of God, though it occurs of final glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:31">Luke 2:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:23">Matthew 20:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34">Matthew 25:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:40">Mark 10:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:16">Hebrews 11:16</span>) and of final misery (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:41">Matthew 25:41</span>). But here undoubtedly the dominant idea is the present blessing to these who love God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:5-7">1 Corinthians 1:5-7</span>).</p>
<p><b>Heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρδιαν</span></span>) here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21">Romans 1:21</span> is more than emotion. The Gnostics used this passage to support their teaching of esoteric doctrine as Hegesippus shows. Lightfoot thinks that probably the apocryphal <i>Ascension of Isaiah</i> and <i>Apocalypse of Elias</i> were Gnostic and so quoted this passage of Paul to support their position. But the next verse shows that Paul uses it of what is now</p>
<p><b>revealed </b> and made plain, not of mysteries still unknown. </p>
