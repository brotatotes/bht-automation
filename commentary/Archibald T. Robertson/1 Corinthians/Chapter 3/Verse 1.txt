<p><b> But as unto carnal </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ως σαρκινοις</span></span>). Latin <i>carneus</i>. "As men o' flesh," Braid Scots; "as worldlings," Moffatt. This form in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ινος</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθινος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:3">2 Corinthians 3:3</span> means the material of flesh, "not on tablets of stone, but on fleshen tablets on hearts." So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:16">Hebrews 7:16</span>. But in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:14">Romans 7:14</span> Paul says, "I am fleshen (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκινος</span></span>) sold under sin," as if <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκινος</span></span> represented the extreme power of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρξ</span></span>. Which does Paul mean here? He wanted to speak the wisdom of God among the adults (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span>), the spiritual (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πνευματικο</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:15">1 Corinthians 2:15</span>), but he was unable to treat them as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικο</span></span> in reality because of their seditions and immoralities. It is not wrong to be <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκινος</span></span>, for we all live in the flesh (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν σαρκ</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>), but we are not to live according to the flesh (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα σαρκα</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:12">Romans 8:12</span>). It is not culpable to a babe in Christ (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηπιος</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:11">1 Corinthians 13:11</span>), unless unduly prolonged (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:20">1 Corinthians 14:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:13">Hebrews 5:13</span>). It is one of the tragedies of the minister's life that he has to keep on speaking to the church members "as unto babes in Christ" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως νηπιοις εν Χριστω</span></span>), who actually glory in their long babyhood whereas they ought to be teachers of the gospel instead of belonging to the cradle roll. Paul's goal was for all the babes to become adults (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:28">Colossians 1:28</span>). </p>
