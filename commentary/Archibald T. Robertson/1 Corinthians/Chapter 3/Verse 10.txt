<p><b> As a wise masterbuilder </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως σοφος αρχιτεκτων</span></span>). Paul does not shirk his share in the work at Corinth with all the sad outcome there. He absolves Apollos from responsibility for the divisions. He denies that he himself is to blame. In doing so he has to praise himself because the Judaizers who fomented the trouble at Corinth had directly blamed Paul. It is not always wise for a preacher to defend himself against attack, but it is sometimes necessary. Factions in the church were now a fact and Paul went to the bottom of the matter. God gave Paul the grace to do what he did. This is the only New Testament example of the old and common word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχιτεκτων</span></span>, our architect. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τεκτων</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τικτω</span></span>, to beget, and means a begetter, then a worker in wood or stone, a carpenter or mason (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:55">Matthew 13:55</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:3">Mark 6:3</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αρχι-</span></span> is an old inseparable prefix like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχαγγελος</span></span> (archangel), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχεπισχοπος</span></span> (archbishop), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχιερευς</span></span> (chiefpriest). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αρχιτεκτων</span></span> occurs in the papyri and inscriptions in an even wider sense than our use of architect, sometimes of the chief engineers. But Paul means to claim primacy as pastor of the church in Corinth as is true of every pastor who is the architect of the whole church life and work. All the workmen (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκτονες</span></span>, carpenters) work under the direction of the architect (Plato, <i>Statesman</i>, 259). "As a wise architect I laid a foundation" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμελιον εθηκα</span></span>). Much depends on the wisdom of the architect in laying the foundation. This is the technical phrase (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:48">Luke 6:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:29">Luke 14:29</span>), a cognate accusative for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμελιον</span></span>. The substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμελιον</span></span> is from the same root <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θε</span></span> as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθηκα</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τι-θημ</span></span>). We cannot neatly reproduce the idiom in English. "I placed a placing" does only moderately well. Paul refers directly to the events described by Luke in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:1-18">Acts 18:1-18</span>. The aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθηκα</span></span> is the correct text, not the perfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεθεικα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Another buildeth thereon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλος εποικοδομε</span></span>). Note the preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> with the verb each time (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:10">1 Corinthians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11">1 Corinthians 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:12">1 Corinthians 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:14">1 Corinthians 3:14</span>). The successor to Paul did not have to lay a new foundation, but only to go on building on that already laid. It is a pity when the new pastor has to dig up the foundation and start all over again as if an earthquake had come.</p>
<p><b>Take heed how he buildeth thereon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπετω πως εποικοδομε</span></span>). The carpenters have need of caution how they carry out the plans of the original architect. Successive architects of great cathedrals carry on through centuries the original design. The result becomes the wonder of succeeding generations. There is no room for individual caprice in the superstructure. </p>
