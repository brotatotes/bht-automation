<p><b> Other foundation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμελιον αλλον</span></span>). The gender of the adjective is here masculine as is shown by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλον</span></span>. If neuter, it would be <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλο</span></span>. It is masculine because Paul has Christ in mind. It is not here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερον</span></span> a different kind of gospel (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερον ευαγγελιον</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:4">2 Corinthians 11:4</span>) which is not another (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλο</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7">Galatians 1:7</span>) in reality. But another Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:4">2 Corinthians 11:4</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλον Ιησουν</span></span>) is a reflection on the one Lord Jesus. Hence there is no room on the platform with Jesus for another Saviour, whether Buddha, Mahomet, Dowie, Eddy, or what not. Jesus Christ is the one foundation and it is gratuitous impudence for another to assume the role of Foundation.</p>
<p><b>Than that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα τον κειμενον, ος εστιν Ιησους Χριστος</span></span>). Literally, "alongside (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>) the one laid (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κειμενον</span></span>)," already laid (present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κειμα</span></span>, used here as often as the perfect passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span> in place of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεθειμενον</span></span>). Paul scouts the suggestion that one even in the interest of so-called "new thought" will dare to lay beside Jesus another foundation for religion. And yet I have seen an article by a professor in a theological seminary in which he advocates regarding Jesus as a landmark, not as a goal, not as a foundation. Clearly Paul means that on this one true foundation, Jesus Christ, one must build only what is in full harmony with the Foundation which is Jesus Christ. If one accuses Paul of narrowness, it can be replied that the architect has to be narrow in the sense of building here and not there. A broad foundation will be too thin and unstable for a solid and abiding structure. It can be said also that Paul is here merely repeating the claim of Jesus himself on this very subject when he quoted <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span> to the members of the Sanhedrin who challenged his authority (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:10">Mark 11:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42-45">Matthew 21:42-45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:17">Luke 20:17</span>). Apostles and prophets go into this temple of God, but Christ Jesus is the chief corner stone (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακρογωναιος</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>). All believers are living stones in this temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>). But there is only one foundation possible. </p>
