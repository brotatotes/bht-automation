<p><b> The day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ημερα</span></span>). The day of judgment as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span> (which see), <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:12">Romans 13:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:25">Hebrews 10:25</span>. The work (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργον</span></span>) of each will be made manifest. There is no escape from this final testing.</p>
<p><b>It is revealed in fire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πυρ αποκαλυπτετα</span></span>). Apparently "the day" is the subject of the verb, not the work, not the Lord. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:8">2 Thessalonians 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>. This metaphor of fire was employed in the O.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:9">Daniel 7:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:1">Malachi 4:1</span>) and by John the Baptist (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:12">Matthew 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:16">Luke 3:16</span>). It is a metaphor that must not be understood as purgatorial, but simple testing (Ellicott) as every fire tests (<b> the fire itself will test </b>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πυρ αυτο δοκιμασε</span></span>) the quality of the material used in the building,</p>
<p><b>of what sort it is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οποιον εστιν</span></span>), qualitative relative pronoun. Men today find, alas, that some of the fireproof buildings are not fireproof when the fire actually comes. </p>
