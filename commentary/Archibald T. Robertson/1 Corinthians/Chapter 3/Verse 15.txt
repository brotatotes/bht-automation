<p><b> Shall be burned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακαησετα</span></span>). First-class condition again, assumed as true. Second future (late form) passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακαιω</span></span>, to burn down, old verb. Note perfective use of preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>, shall be burned down. We usually say "burned up," and that is true also, burned up in smoke.</p>
<p><b>He shall suffer loss </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζημιωθησετα</span></span>). First future passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζημιω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζημια</span></span> (damage, loss), to suffer loss. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:26">Matthew 16:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:36">Mark 8:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:25">Luke 9:25</span> the loss is stated to be the man's soul (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχην</span></span>) or eternal life. But here there is no such total loss as that. The man's work (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργον</span></span>) is burned up (sermons, lectures, books, teaching, all dry as dust).</p>
<p><b>But he himself shall be saved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος δε σωθησετα</span></span>). Eternal salvation, but not by purgatory. His work is burned up completely and hopelessly, but he himself escapes destruction because he is really a saved man a real believer in Christ.</p>
<p><b>Yet so as through fire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως δε ως δια πυρος</span></span>). Clearly Paul means with his work burned down (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:15">1 Corinthians 3:15</span>). It is the tragedy of a fruitless life, of a minister who built so poorly on the true foundation that his work went up in smoke. His sermons were empty froth or windy words without edifying or building power. They left no mark in the lives of the hearers. It is the picture of a wasted life. The one who enters heaven by grace, as we all do who are saved, yet who brings no sheaves with him. There is no garnered grain the result of his labours in the harvest field. There are no souls in heaven as the result of his toil for Christ, no enrichment of character, no growth in grace. </p>
