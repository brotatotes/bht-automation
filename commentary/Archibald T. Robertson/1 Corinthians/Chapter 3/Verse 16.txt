<p><b> Ye are a temple of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναος θεου εστε</span></span>). Literally, a sanctuary (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναος</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερον</span></span>, the sacred enclosure, but the holy place and the most holy place) of God. The same picture of building as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδομη</span></span>), only here the sanctuary itself.</p>
<p><b>Dwelleth in you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υμιν οικε</span></span>). The Spirit of God makes his home (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικε</span></span>) in us, not in temples made with hands (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:48">Acts 7:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:24">Acts 17:24</span>). </p>
