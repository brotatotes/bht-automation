<p><b> Let no man deceive himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μηδεις εαυτον εξαπατω</span></span>). A warning that implied that some of them were guilty of doing it (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the present imperative). Excited partisans can easily excite themselves to a pious phrenzy, hypnotize themselves with their own supposed devotion to truth.</p>
<p><b>Thinketh that he is wise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκε σοφος εινα</span></span>). Condition of first class and assumed to be true. Predicate nominative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφος</span></span> with the infinitive to agree with subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκε</span></span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1038). Paul claimed to be "wise" himself in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:10">1 Corinthians 3:10</span> and he desires that the claimant to wisdom may become wise (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα γενητα σοφος</span></span>, purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and subjunctive) by becoming a fool (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωρος γενεσθω</span></span>, second aorist middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>) as this age looks at him. This false wisdom of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18-20">1 Corinthians 1:18-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:23">1 Corinthians 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14">1 Corinthians 2:14</span>), this self-conceit, has led to strife and wrangling. Cut it out. </p>
