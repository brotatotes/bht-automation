 Let no man deceive himself  (Μηδεις εαυτον εξαπατω). A warning that implied that some of them were guilty of doing it (μη and the present imperative). Excited partisans can easily excite themselves to a pious phrenzy, hypnotize themselves with their own supposed devotion to truth.Thinketh that he is wise  (δοκε σοφος εινα). Condition of first class and assumed to be true. Predicate nominative σοφος with the infinitive to agree with subject of δοκε (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1038). Paul claimed to be "wise" himself in verse 1 Corinthians 3:10 and he desires that the claimant to wisdom may become wise (ινα γενητα σοφος, purpose clause with ινα and subjunctive) by becoming a fool (μωρος γενεσθω, second aorist middle imperative of γινομα) as this age looks at him. This false wisdom of the world (1 Corinthians 1:18-20; 1 Corinthians 1:23; 1 Corinthians 2:14), this self-conceit, has led to strife and wrangling. Cut it out.
