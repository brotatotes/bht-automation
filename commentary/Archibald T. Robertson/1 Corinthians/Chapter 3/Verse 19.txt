<p><b> Foolishness with God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωρια παρα τω θεω</span></span>). Whose standard does a church (temple) of God wish, that of this world or of God? The two standards are not the same. It is a pertinent inquiry with us all whose idea rules in our church. Paul quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+5:13">Job 5:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>That taketh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δρασσομενος</span></span>). Old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δρασσομα</span></span>, to grasp with the hand, is used here for the less vivid word in the LXX <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλαμβανων</span></span>. It occurs nowhere else in the N.T., but appears in the papyri to lay hands on. Job is quoted in the N.T. only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:35">Romans 11:35</span> and both times with variations from the LXX. This word occurs in Ecclesiasticus 26:7; 34:2. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:12">Psalms 2:12</span> the LXX has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δραξασθε παιδειας</span></span>, lay hold on instruction.</p>
<p><b>Craftiness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πανουργια</span></span>). The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πανουργος</span></span> man is ready for any or all work (if bad enough). So it means versatile cleverness (Robertson and Plummer), <i>astutia</i> (Vulgate). </p>
