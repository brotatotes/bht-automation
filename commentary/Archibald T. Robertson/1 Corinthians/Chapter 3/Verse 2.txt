<p><b> I fed you with milk, not with meat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαλα υμας εποτισα, ου βρωμα</span></span>). Note two accusatives with the verb, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποτισα</span></span>, first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποτιζω</span></span>, as with other causative verbs, that of the person and of the thing. In the LXX and the papyri the verb often means to irrigate. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βρωμα</span></span> does not mean meat (flesh) as opposed to bread, but all solid food as in "meats and drinks" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:7">Hebrews 9:7</span>). It is a zeugma to use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποτισα</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βρωμα</span></span>. Paul did not glory in making his sermons thin and watery. Simplicity does not require lack of ideas or dulness. It is pathetic to think how the preacher has to clip the wings of thought and imagination because the hearers cannot go with him. But nothing hinders great preaching like the dulness caused by sin on the part of auditors who are impatient with the high demands of the gospel. </p>
