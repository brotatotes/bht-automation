<p><b> Wherefore let no one glory in men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε μηδεις καυχασθω εν ανθρωποις</span></span>). The conclusion (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span>) from the self-conceit condemned. This particle here is merely inferential with no effect on the construction (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωσ+τε</span></span> = and so) any more than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν</span></span> would have, a paratactic conjunction. There are thirty such examples of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span> in the N.T., eleven with the imperative as here (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 999). The spirit of glorying in party is a species of self-conceit and inconsistent with glorying in the Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:31">1 Corinthians 1:31</span>). </p>
