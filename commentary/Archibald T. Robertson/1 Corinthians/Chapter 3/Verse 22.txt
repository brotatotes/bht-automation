<p><b> Yours </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμων</span></span>). Predicate genitive, belong to you. All the words in this verse and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:23">1 Corinthians 3:23</span> are anarthrous, though not indefinite, but definite. The English reproduces them all properly without the definite article except <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοσμος</span></span> (the world), and even here just world will answer. Proper names do not need the article to be definite nor do words for single objects like world, life, death. Things present (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεστωτα</span></span>, second perfect participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενιστημ</span></span>) and things to come divide two classes. Few of the finer points of Greek syntax need more attention than the absence of the article. We must not think of the article as "omitted" (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 790). The wealth of the Christian includes all things, all leaders, past, present, future, Christ, and God. There is no room for partisan wrangling here. </p>
