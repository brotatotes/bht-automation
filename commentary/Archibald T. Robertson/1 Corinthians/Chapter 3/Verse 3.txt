<p><b> For ye are yet carnal </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετ γαρ σαρκικο εστε</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σαρκικος</span></span>, unlike <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκινος</span></span>, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικος</span></span> formations, means adapted to, fitted for the flesh (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρξ</span></span>), one who lives according to the flesh (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα σαρκα</span></span>). Paul by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχικος</span></span> describes the unregenerate man, by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικος</span></span> the regenerate man. Both classes are <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκινο</span></span> made in flesh, and both may be <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκικο</span></span> though the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικο</span></span> should not be. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικο</span></span> who continue to be <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκινο</span></span> are still babes (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηπιο</span></span>), not adults (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειο</span></span>), while those who are still <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκικο</span></span> (carnal) have given way to the flesh as if they were still <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχικο</span></span> (unregenerate). It is a bold and cutting figure, not without sarcasm, but necessary to reveal the Corinthians to themselves.</p>
<p><b>Jealousy and strife </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλος κα ερις</span></span>). Zeal (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλος</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζεω</span></span>, to boil) is not necessarily evil, but good if under control. It may be not according to knowledge (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:2">Romans 10:2</span>) and easily becomes jealousy (same root through the French <i>jaloux</i>) as zeal. Ardour may be like the jealousy of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>) or the envy of men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:17">Acts 5:17</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ερις</span></span> is an old word, but used only by Paul in N.T. (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:11">1 Corinthians 1:11</span>). Wrangling follows jealousy. These two voices of the spirit are to Paul proof that the Corinthians are still <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκικο</span></span> and walking according to men, not according to the Spirit of Christ. </p>
