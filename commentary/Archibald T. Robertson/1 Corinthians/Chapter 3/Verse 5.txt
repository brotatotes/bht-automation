<p><b> What then? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ουν;</span></span>). He does not say <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις</span></span> (who), but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span> (what), neuter singular interrogative pronoun.</p>
<p><b>Ministers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονο</span></span>). Not leaders of parties or sects, but merely servants through whom ye believed. The etymology of the word Thayer gives as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κονις</span></span> "raising dust by hastening." In the Gospels it is the servant (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:26">Matthew 20:26</span>) or waiter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:5">John 2:5</span>). Paul so describes himself as a minister (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:25">Colossians 1:25</span>). The technical sense of deacon comes later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:12">1 Timothy 3:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>As the Lord gave to him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ο Κυριος εδωκεν</span></span>). Hence no minister of the Lord like Apollos and Paul has any basis for pride or conceit nor should be made the occasion for faction and strife. This idea Paul enlarges upon through chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:1">1 Corinthians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:4">1 Corinthians 3:4</span> and it is made plain in chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:1">1 Corinthians 3:1</span>. </p>
