<p><b> I planted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω εφυτευσα</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυτευω</span></span>. This Paul did as Luke tells us in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:1-18">Acts 18:1-18</span>.</p>
<p><b>Apollos watered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Απολλως εποτισεν</span></span>). Apollos irrigated the church there as is seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:24-19">Acts 18:24-19</span>. Another aorist tense as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:2">1 Corinthians 3:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>But God gave the increase </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα ο θεος ηυξανεν</span></span>). Imperfect tense here (active indicative) for the continuous blessing of God both on the work of Paul and Apollos, co-labourers with God in God's field (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>). Reports of revivals sometimes give the glory to the evangelist or to both evangelist and pastor. Paul gives it all to God. He and Apollos cooperated as successive pastors. </p>
