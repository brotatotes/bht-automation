<p><b> Are one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εισιν</span></span>). The neuter singular again (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>) as with the interrogative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span> and the indefinite <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span>. By this bold metaphor which Paul expands he shows how the planter and the waterer work together. If no one planted, the watering would be useless. If no one watered, the planting would come to naught as the dreadful drouth of 1930 testifies while these words are written.</p>
<p><b>According to his own labour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα τον ιδιον κοπον</span></span>). God will bestow to each the reward that his labour deserves. That is the pay that the preacher is sure to receive. He may get too little or too much here from men. But the due reward from God is certain and it will be adequate however ungrateful men may be. </p>
