 God's fellow-workers  (θεου συνεργο). This old word (co-workers of God) has a new dignity here. God is the major partner in the enterprise of each life, but he lets us work with him. Witness the mother and God with the baby as the product.God's husbandry  (θεου γεωργιον). God's tilled land (γη, εργον). The farmer works with God in God's field. Without the sun, the rains, the seasons the farmer is helpless.God's building  (θεου οικοδομη). God is the Great Architect. We work under him and carry out the plans of the Architect. It is building (οικος, house, δεμω, to build). Let us never forget that God sees and cares what we do in the part of the building where we work for him.
