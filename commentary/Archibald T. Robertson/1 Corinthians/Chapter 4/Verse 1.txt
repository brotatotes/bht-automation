 Ministers of Christ  (υπηρετας Χριστου). Paul and all ministers (διακονους) of the New Covenant (1 Corinthians 3:5) are under-rowers, subordinate rowers of Christ, only here in Paul's Epistles, though in the Gospels (Luke 4:20 the attendant in the synagogue) and the Acts (Acts 13:5) of John Mark. Theso  (ουτως) gathers up the preceding argument (1 Corinthians 3:5-23) and applies it directly by theas  (ως) that follows.Stewards of the mysteries of God  (οικονομους μυστηριων θεου). The steward or house manager (οικος, house, νεμω, to manage, old word) was a slave (δουλος) under his lord (κυριος, Luke 12:42), but a master (Luke 16:1) over the other slaves in the house (menservants παιδας, maidservants παιδισκας Luke 12:45), an overseer (επιτροπος) over the rest (Matthew 20:8). Hence the under-rower (υπηρετης) of Christ has a position of great dignity as steward (οικονομος) of the mysteries of God. Jesus had expressly explained that the mysteries of the kingdom were open to the disciples (Matthew 13:11). They were entrusted with the knowledge of some of God's secrets though the disciples were not such apt pupils as they claimed to be (Matthew 13:51; Matthew 16:8-12). As stewards Paul and other ministers are entrusted with the mysteries (see on 1 Corinthians 2:7 for this word) of God and are expected to teach them. "The church is the οικος (1 Timothy 3:15), God the οικοδεσποτης (Matthew 13:52), the members the οικειο (Galatians 6:10; Ephesians 2:19)" (Lightfoot). Paul had a vivid sense of the dignity of this stewardship (οικονομια) of God given to him (Colossians 1:25; Ephesians 1:10). The ministry is more than a mere profession or trade. It is a calling from God for stewardship.
