<p><b> Ministers of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπηρετας Χριστου</span></span>). Paul and all ministers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονους</span></span>) of the New Covenant (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5">1 Corinthians 3:5</span>) are under-rowers, subordinate rowers of Christ, only here in Paul's Epistles, though in the Gospels (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:20">Luke 4:20</span> the attendant in the synagogue) and the Acts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:5">Acts 13:5</span>) of John Mark. The</p>
<p><b>so </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως</span></span>) gathers up the preceding argument (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5-23">1 Corinthians 3:5-23</span>) and applies it directly by the</p>
<p><b>as </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span>) that follows.</p>
<p><b>Stewards of the mysteries of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικονομους μυστηριων θεου</span></span>). The steward or house manager (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικος</span></span>, house, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεμω</span></span>, to manage, old word) was a slave (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span>) under his lord (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριος</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42">Luke 12:42</span>), but a master (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:1">Luke 16:1</span>) over the other slaves in the house (menservants <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδας</span></span>, maidservants <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδισκας</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:45">Luke 12:45</span>), an overseer (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτροπος</span></span>) over the rest (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:8">Matthew 20:8</span>). Hence the under-rower (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπηρετης</span></span>) of Christ has a position of great dignity as steward (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικονομος</span></span>) of the mysteries of God. Jesus had expressly explained that the mysteries of the kingdom were open to the disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:11">Matthew 13:11</span>). They were entrusted with the knowledge of some of God's secrets though the disciples were not such apt pupils as they claimed to be (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:51">Matthew 13:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:8-12">Matthew 16:8-12</span>). As stewards Paul and other ministers are entrusted with the mysteries (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span> for this word) of God and are expected to teach them. "The church is the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span>), God the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδεσποτης</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:52">Matthew 13:52</span>), the members the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικειο</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:10">Galatians 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:19">Ephesians 2:19</span>)" (Lightfoot). Paul had a vivid sense of the dignity of this stewardship (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικονομια</span></span>) of God given to him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:25">Colossians 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>). The ministry is more than a mere profession or trade. It is a calling from God for stewardship. </p>
