<p><b> We--you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεισ--υμεις</span></span>). Triple contrast in keenest ironical emphasis. "The three antitheses refer respectively to teaching, demeanour, and worldly position" (Robertson and Plummer). The apostles were fools for Christ's sake (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:11">2 Corinthians 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:7">Philippians 3:7</span>). They made "union with Christ the basis of worldly wisdom" (Vincent). There is change of order (chiasm) in the third ironical contrast. They are over strong in pretension. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ενδοξος</span></span>, illustrious, is one of the 103 words found only in Luke and Paul in the N.T. Notion of display and splendour. </p>
