 We--you  (ημεισ--υμεις). Triple contrast in keenest ironical emphasis. "The three antitheses refer respectively to teaching, demeanour, and worldly position" (Robertson and Plummer). The apostles were fools for Christ's sake (2 Corinthians 4:11; Philippians 3:7). They made "union with Christ the basis of worldly wisdom" (Vincent). There is change of order (chiasm) in the third ironical contrast. They are over strong in pretension. Ενδοξος, illustrious, is one of the 103 words found only in Luke and Paul in the N.T. Notion of display and splendour.
