<p><b> To shame you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντρεπων</span></span>). Literally, shaming you (present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντρεπω</span></span>), old verb to turn one on himself either middle or with reflexive pronoun and active, but the reflexive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτοις</span></span> is not expressed here. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:14">2 Thessalonians 3:14</span>. The harsh tone has suddenly changed. </p>
