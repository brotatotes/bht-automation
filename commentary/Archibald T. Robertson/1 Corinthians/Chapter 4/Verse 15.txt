<p><b>Tutors </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδαγωγους</span></span>). This old word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παις</span></span>, boy, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγωγος</span></span>, leader) was used for the guide or attendant of the child who took him to school as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24">Galatians 3:24</span> (Christ being the schoolmaster) and also as a sort of tutor who had a care for the child when not in school. The papyri examples (Moulton and Milligan, <i>Vocabulary</i>) illustrate both aspects of the paedagogue. Here it is the "tutor in Christ" who is the Teacher. These are the only two N.T. examples of the common word.</p>
