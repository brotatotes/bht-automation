<p><b> Be ye imitators of me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμητα μου γινεσθε</span></span>). "Keep on becoming (present middle imperative) imitators of me (objective genitive)." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μιμητης</span></span> is an old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμεομα</span></span>, to copy, to mimic (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμος</span></span>). Paul stands for his rights as their spiritual father against the pretensions of the Judaizers who have turned them against him by the use of the names of Apollos and Cephas. </p>
