<p><b> Have I sent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεμψα</span></span>). First aorist active indicative. Probably Timothy had already gone as seems clear from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:10">1 Corinthians 16:10</span>. Apparently Timothy came back to Ephesus and was sent on to Macedonia before the uproar in Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>). Probably also Titus was then despatched to Corinth, also before the uproar.</p>
<p><b>In every church </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν παση εκκλησια</span></span>). Paul expects his teachings and practices to be followed in every church (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:33">1 Corinthians 14:33</span>). Note his language here "my ways those in Christ Jesus." Timothy as Paul's spokesman</p>
<p><b>will remind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναμνησε</span></span>) the Corinthians of Paul's teachings. </p>
