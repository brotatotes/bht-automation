 Here  (ωδε). Either here on earth or in this matter. It is always local.Moreover  (λοιπον). Like λοιπον in 1 Corinthians 1:16 which see, accusative of general reference, as for what is left, besides.It is required  (ζητειτα). It is sought. Many MSS. read ζητειτε, ye seek, an easy change as α and ε came to be pronounced alike (Robertson, Grammar, p. 186).That a man be found faithful  (ινα πιστος τις ευρεθη). Non-final use of ινα with first aorist passive subjunctive of ευρισκω, the result of the seeking (ζητεω). Fidelity is the essential requirement in all such human relationships, in other words, plain honesty in handling money like bank-clerks or in other positions of trust like public office.
