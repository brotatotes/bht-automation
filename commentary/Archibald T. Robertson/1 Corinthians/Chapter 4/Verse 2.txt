<p><b> Here </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωδε</span></span>). Either here on earth or in this matter. It is always local.</p>
<p><b>Moreover </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λοιπον</span></span>). Like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λοιπον</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:16">1 Corinthians 1:16</span> which see, accusative of general reference, as for what is left, besides.</p>
<p><b>It is required </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητειτα</span></span>). It is sought. Many MSS. read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητειτε</span></span>, ye seek, an easy change as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> came to be pronounced alike (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 186).</p>
<p><b>That a man be found faithful </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα πιστος τις ευρεθη</span></span>). Non-final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> with first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκω</span></span>, the result of the seeking (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητεω</span></span>). Fidelity is the essential requirement in all such human relationships, in other words, plain honesty in handling money like bank-clerks or in other positions of trust like public office. </p>
