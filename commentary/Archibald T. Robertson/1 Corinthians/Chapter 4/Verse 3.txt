<p><b> But with me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμο δε</span></span>). The ethical dative of personal relation and interest, "as I look at my own case." Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:21">Philippians 1:21</span>.</p>
<p><b>It is a very small thing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ελαχιστον εστιν</span></span>). This predicate use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> is like the Hebrew, but it occurs also in the papyri. The superlative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαχιστον</span></span> is elative, very little, not the true superlative, least. "It counts for very little with me."</p>
<p><b>That I should be judged of you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα υφ' υμων ανακριθω</span></span>). Same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:2">1 Corinthians 4:2</span>. For the verb (first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακρινω</span></span>) see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14">1 Corinthians 2:14</span>. Paul does not despise public opinion, but he denies "the competency of the tribunal" in Corinth (Robertson and Plummer) to pass on his credentials with Christ as his Lord.</p>
<p><b>Or of man's judgement </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η υπο ανθρωπινης ημερας</span></span>). Or "by human day," in contrast to the Lord's Day (<i>der Tag</i>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:13">1 Corinthians 3:13</span>. "<i>That</i> is the tribunal which the Apostle recognizes; a <i>human</i> tribunal he does not care to satisfy" (Robertson and Plummer).</p>
<p><b>Yea, I judge not mine own self </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ουδε εμαυτον ανακρινω</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αλλα</span></span> here is confirmatory, not adversative. "I have often wondered how it is that every man sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others" (M. Aurelius, xii. 4. Translated by Robertson and Plummer). Paul does not even set himself up as judge of himself. </p>
