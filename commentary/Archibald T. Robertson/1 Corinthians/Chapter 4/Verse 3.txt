 But with me  (εμο δε). The ethical dative of personal relation and interest, "as I look at my own case." Cf. Philippians 1:21.It is a very small thing  (εις ελαχιστον εστιν). This predicate use of εις is like the Hebrew, but it occurs also in the papyri. The superlative ελαχιστον is elative, very little, not the true superlative, least. "It counts for very little with me."That I should be judged of you  (ινα υφ' υμων ανακριθω). Same use of ινα as in verse 1 Corinthians 4:2. For the verb (first aorist passive subjunctive of ανακρινω) see on 1 Corinthians 2:14. Paul does not despise public opinion, but he denies "the competency of the tribunal" in Corinth (Robertson and Plummer) to pass on his credentials with Christ as his Lord.Or of man's judgement  (η υπο ανθρωπινης ημερας). Or "by human day," in contrast to the Lord's Day (der Tag) in 1 Corinthians 3:13. "That is the tribunal which the Apostle recognizes; a human tribunal he does not care to satisfy" (Robertson and Plummer).Yea, I judge not mine own self  (αλλ' ουδε εμαυτον ανακρινω). Αλλα here is confirmatory, not adversative. "I have often wondered how it is that every man sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others" (M. Aurelius, xii. 4. Translated by Robertson and Plummer). Paul does not even set himself up as judge of himself.
