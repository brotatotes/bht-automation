<p><b> For I know nothing against myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν γαρ εμαυτω συνοιδα</span></span>). Not a statement of fact, but an hypothesis to show the unreliability of mere complacent self-satisfaction. Note the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνοιδα</span></span> (second perfect active indicative with dative (disadvantage) of the reflexive pronoun) for guilty knowledge against oneself (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:2">Acts 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:12">Acts 12:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:6">Acts 14:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>Yet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ'</span></span>). Adversative use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Am I not hereby justified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εν τουτω δεδικαιωμα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of state of completion. Failure to be conscious of one's own sins does not mean that one is innocent. Most prisoners plead "not guilty." Who is the judge of the steward of the mysteries of God? It is the Lord "that judgeth me" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ανακρινων με</span></span>). Probably, who examines me and then passes on my fidelity (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστος</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:2">1 Corinthians 4:2</span>). </p>
