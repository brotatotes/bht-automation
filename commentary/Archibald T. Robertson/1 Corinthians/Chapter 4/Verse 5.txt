<p><b> Wherefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:21">1 Corinthians 3:21</span> which see.</p>
<p><b>Judge nothing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη τ κρινετε</span></span>). Stop passing judgment, stop criticizing as they were doing. See the words of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:1">Matthew 7:1</span>. The censorious habit was ruining the Corinthian Church.</p>
<p><b>Before the time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ καιρου</span></span>). The day of the Lord in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:13">1 Corinthians 3:13</span>. "Do not therefore anticipate the great judgment (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρισις</span></span>) by any preliminary investigation (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακρισις</span></span>) which must be futile and incomplete" (Lightfoot).</p>
<p><b>Until the Lord come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως αν ελθη ο κυριος</span></span>). Common idiom of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως</span></span> and the aorist subjunctive with or without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> for a future event. Simple futurity, but held forth as a glorious hope, the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus as Judge.</p>
<p><b>Who will both bring to light </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος κα φωτισε</span></span>). Future indicative of this late verb (in papyri also) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φως</span></span> (light), to turn the light on the hidden things of darkness.</p>
<p><b>And make manifest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα φανερωσε</span></span>). (Ionic and late) causative verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανεροω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανερος</span></span>. By turning on the light the counsels of all hearts stand revealed.</p>
<p><b>His praise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο επαινος</span></span>). The praise (note article) due him from God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span>) will come to each then (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε</span></span>) and not till then. Meanwhile Paul will carry on and wait for the praise from God. </p>
