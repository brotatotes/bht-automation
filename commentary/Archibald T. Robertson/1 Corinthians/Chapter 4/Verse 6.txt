<p><b> I have in a figure transferred </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετεσχηματισα</span></span>). First aorist active (not perfect) indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα-σχηματιζω</span></span>, used by Plato and Aristotle for changing the form of a thing (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα</span></span>, after, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχημα</span></span>, form or habit, like Latin <i>habitus</i> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span> and so different from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μορφη</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:2">Romans 12:2</span>). For the idea of refashioning see Field, <i>Notes</i>, p. 169f. and Preisigke, <i>Fachworter</i>). Both Greek and Latin writers (Quintilian, Martial) used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχημα</span></span> for a rhetorical artifice. Paul's use of the word (in Paul only in N.T.) appears also further in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:13-15">2 Corinthians 11:13-15</span> where the word occurs three times, twice of the false apostles posing and passing as apostles of Christ and ministers of righteousness, and once of Satan as an angel of light, twice with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> and once with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span> the word is used for the change in the body of our humiliation to the body of glory. But here it is clearly the rhetorical figure for a veiled allusion to Paul and Apollos "for your sakes" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια υμας</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>That in us ye may learn </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα εν ημιν μαθητε</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μανθανω</span></span>, to learn. As an object lesson in our cases (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ημιν</span></span>). It is no more true of Paul and Apollos than of other ministers, but the wrangles in Corinth started about them. So Paul boldly puts himself and Apollos to the fore in the discussion of the principles involved.</p>
<p><b>Not to go beyond the things which are written </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το Μη υπερ α γεγραπτα</span></span>). It is difficult to reproduce the Greek idiom in English. The article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το</span></span> is in the accusative case as the object of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαθητε</span></span> (learn) and points at the words "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη υπερ α γεγραπτα</span></span>," apparently a proverb or rule, and elliptical in form with no principal verb expressed with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>, whether "think" (Auth.) or "go" (Revised). There was a constant tendency to smooth out Paul's ellipses as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:26">1 Corinthians 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:31">1 Corinthians 1:31</span>. Lightfoot thinks that Paul may have in mind O.T. passages quoted in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:19">1 Corinthians 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:31">1 Corinthians 1:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:19">1 Corinthians 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:20">1 Corinthians 3:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>That ye be not puffed up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη φυσιουσθε</span></span>). Sub-final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> (second use in this sentence) with notion of result. It is not certain whether <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσιουσθε</span></span> (late verb form like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσιαω, φυσαω</span></span>, to blow up, to inflate, to puff up), used only by Paul in the N.T., is present indicative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλουτε</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:17">Galatians 4:17</span> (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα γινωσκομεν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:20">1 John 5:20</span>) or the present subjunctive by irregular contraction (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 203, 342f.), probably the present indicative. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φυσιοω</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσις</span></span> (nature) and so meant to make natural, but it is used by Paul just like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσαω</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσιαω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσα</span></span>, a pair of bellows), a vivid picture of self-conceit.</p>
<p><b>One for the one against the other </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις υπερ του ενος κατα του ετερου</span></span>). This is the precise idea of this idiom of partitive apposition. This is the rule with partisans. They are "for" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span>) the one and "against" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>, down on, the genitive case) the other (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ετερου</span></span>, not merely another or a second, but the different sort, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετεροδοξ</span></span>). </p>
