<p><b> Maketh thee to differ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σε διακρινε</span></span>). Distinguishes thee, separates thee. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διακρινω</span></span> means to sift or separate between (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:9">Acts 15:9</span> (which see) where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταξυ</span></span> is added to make it plainer. All self-conceit rests on the notion of superiority of gifts and graces as if they were self-bestowed or self-acquired.</p>
<p><b>Which thou didst not receive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ουκ ελαβες</span></span>). "Another home-thrust" (Robertson and Plummer). Pride of intellect, of blood, of race, of country, of religion, is thus shut out.</p>
<p><b>Dost thou glory </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχασα</span></span>). The original second person singular middle ending <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-σα</span></span> is here preserved with variable vowel contraction, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχαεσαι=καυχασα</span></span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 341). Paul is fond of this old and bold verb for boasting.</p>
<p><b>As if thou hadst not received it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως μη λαβων</span></span>). This neat participial clause (second aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> (assumption) and negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> punctures effectually the inflated bag of false pride. What pungent questions Paul has asked. Robertson and Plummer say of Augustine, "Ten years before the challenge of Pelagius, the study of St. Paul's writings, and especially of this verse and of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:16">Romans 9:16</span>, had crystallized in his mind the distinctively Augustinian doctrines of man's total depravity, of irresistible grace, and of absolute predestination." Human responsibility does exist beyond a doubt, but there is no foundation for pride and conceit. </p>
