 Maketh thee to differ  (σε διακρινε). Distinguishes thee, separates thee. Διακρινω means to sift or separate between (δια) as in Acts 15:9 (which see) where μεταξυ is added to make it plainer. All self-conceit rests on the notion of superiority of gifts and graces as if they were self-bestowed or self-acquired.Which thou didst not receive  (ο ουκ ελαβες). "Another home-thrust" (Robertson and Plummer). Pride of intellect, of blood, of race, of country, of religion, is thus shut out.Dost thou glory  (καυχασα). The original second person singular middle ending -σα is here preserved with variable vowel contraction, καυχαεσαι=καυχασα (Robertson, Grammar, p. 341). Paul is fond of this old and bold verb for boasting.As if thou hadst not received it  (ως μη λαβων). This neat participial clause (second aorist active of λαμβανω) with ως (assumption) and negative μη punctures effectually the inflated bag of false pride. What pungent questions Paul has asked. Robertson and Plummer say of Augustine, "Ten years before the challenge of Pelagius, the study of St. Paul's writings, and especially of this verse and of Romans 9:16, had crystallized in his mind the distinctively Augustinian doctrines of man's total depravity, of irresistible grace, and of absolute predestination." Human responsibility does exist beyond a doubt, but there is no foundation for pride and conceit.
