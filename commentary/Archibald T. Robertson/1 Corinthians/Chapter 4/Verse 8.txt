 Already are ye filled?  (ηδη κεκορεσμενο εστε?). Perfect passive indicative, state of completion, of κορεννυμ, old Greek verb to satiate, to satisfy. The only other example in N.T. is Acts 27:38 which see. Paul may refer to Deuteronomy 31:20; Deuteronomy 32:15. But it is keen irony, even sarcasm. Westcott and Hort make it a question and the rest of the sentence also.Already ye are become rich  (ηδη επλουτησατε). Note change to ingressive aorist indicative of πλουτεω, old verb to be rich (cf. 2 Corinthians 8:9). "The aorists, used instead of perfects, imply indecent haste" (Lightfoot). "They have got a private millennium of their own" (Robertson Plummer) with all the blessings of the Messianic Kingdom (Luke 22:29 1 Thessalonians 2:12; 2 Timothy 2:12).Ye have reigned without us  (χωρις ημων εβασιλευσατε). Withering sarcasm. Ye became kings without our company. Some think that Paul as in 1 Corinthians 3:21 is purposely employing Stoic phraseology though with his own meanings. If so, it is hardly consciously done. Paul was certainly familiar with much of the literature of his time, but it did not shape his ideas.I would that ye did reign  (κα οφελον γε εβασιλευσατε). More exactly, "And would at least that ye had come to reign (or become kings)." It is an unfulfilled wish about the past expressed by οφελον and the aorist indicative instead of ε γαρ and the aorist indicative (the ancient idiom). See Robertson, Grammar, p. 1003, for the construction with particle οφελον (an unaugmented second aorist form).That we also might reign with you  (ινα κα ημεις υμιν συνβασιλευσωμεν). Ironical contrast to χωρις ημων εβασιλευσατε, just before. Associative instrumental case of υμιν after συν-.
