<p><b> Already are ye filled? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη κεκορεσμενο εστε?</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative, state of completion, of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κορεννυμ</span></span>, old Greek verb to satiate, to satisfy. The only other example in N.T. is <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:38">Acts 27:38</span> which see. Paul may refer to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+31:20">Deuteronomy 31:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+32:15">Deuteronomy 32:15</span>. But it is keen irony, even sarcasm. Westcott and Hort make it a question and the rest of the sentence also.</p>
<p><b>Already ye are become rich </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη επλουτησατε</span></span>). Note change to ingressive aorist indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλουτεω</span></span>, old verb to be rich (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span>). "The aorists, used instead of perfects, imply indecent haste" (Lightfoot). "They have got a private millennium of their own" (Robertson Plummer) with all the blessings of the Messianic Kingdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:29">Luke 22:29</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:12">1 Thessalonians 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:12">2 Timothy 2:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>Ye have reigned without us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρις ημων εβασιλευσατε</span></span>). Withering sarcasm. Ye became kings without our company. Some think that Paul as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:21">1 Corinthians 3:21</span> is purposely employing Stoic phraseology though with his own meanings. If so, it is hardly consciously done. Paul was certainly familiar with much of the literature of his time, but it did not shape his ideas.</p>
<p><b>I would that ye did reign </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα οφελον γε εβασιλευσατε</span></span>). More exactly, "And would at least that ye had come to reign (or become kings)." It is an unfulfilled wish about the past expressed by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφελον</span></span> and the aorist indicative instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε γαρ</span></span> and the aorist indicative (the ancient idiom). See Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1003, for the construction with particle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφελον</span></span> (an unaugmented second aorist form).</p>
<p><b>That we also might reign with you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα κα ημεις υμιν συνβασιλευσωμεν</span></span>). Ironical contrast to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρις ημων εβασιλευσατε</span></span>, just before. Associative instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν-</span></span>. </p>
