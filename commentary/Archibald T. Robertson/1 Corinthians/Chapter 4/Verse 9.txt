 Hath set forth us the apostles last  (ημας τους αποστολους εσχατους απεδειξεν). The first aorist active indicative of αποδεικνυμ, old verb to show, to expose to view or exhibit (Herodotus), in technical sense (cf. 2 Thessalonians 2:4) for gladiatorial show as in εθηριομαχησα (1 Corinthians 15:32). In this grand pageant Paul and other apostles come last (εσχατους, predicate accusative after απεδειξεν) as a grand finale.As men doomed to die  (ως επιθανατιους). Late word, here alone in N.T. The LXX (Bel and the Dragon 31) has it for those thrown daily to the lions. Dionysius of Halicarnassus (A.R. vii. 35) uses it of those thrown from the Tarpeian Rock. The gladiators would say morituri salutamus. All this in violent contrast to the kingly Messianic pretensions of the Corinthians.A spectacle  (θεατρον). Cf. Hebrews 11:33-40. The word, like our theatre, means the place of the show (Acts 19:29; Acts 19:31). Then, it means the spectacle shown there (θεαμα or θεα), and, as here, the man exhibited as the show like the verb θεατριζομενο, made a spectacle (Hebrews 10:33). Sometimes it refers to the spectators (θεατα) like our "house" for the audience. Here the spectators include "the world, both to angels and men" (τω κοσμω κα αγγελοις κα ανθρωποις), dative case of personal interest.
