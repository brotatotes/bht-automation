<p><b> Actually </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολως</span></span>). Literally, wholly, altogether, like Latin <i>omnino</i> and Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντως</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:22">1 Corinthians 9:22</span>). So papyri have it for "really" and also for "generally" or "everywhere" as is possible here. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:7">1 Corinthians 6:7</span>. With a negative it has the sense of "not at all" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:29">1 Corinthians 15:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:34">Matthew 5:34</span> the only N.T. examples, though a common word.</p>
<p><b>It is reported </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουετα</span></span>). Present passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span>, to hear; so literally, it is heard. "Fornication is heard of among you." Probably the household of Chloe (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:11">1 Corinthians 1:11</span>) brought this sad news (Ellicott).</p>
<p><b>And such </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τοιαυτη</span></span>). Climactic qualitative pronoun showing the revolting character of this particular case of illicit sexual intercourse. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πορνεια</span></span> is sometimes used (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:20">Acts 15:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:29">Acts 15:29</span>) of such sin in general and not merely of the unmarried whereas <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μοιχεια</span></span> is technically adultery on the part of the married (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:21">Mark 7:21</span>).</p>
<p><b>As is not even among the Gentiles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητις ουδε εν τοις εθνεσιν</span></span>). Height of scorn. The Corinthian Christians were actually trying to win pagans to Christ and living more loosely than the Corinthian heathen among whom the very word "Corinthianize" meant to live in sexual wantonness and license. See Cicero <i>pro Cluentio</i>, v. 14.</p>
<p><b>That one of you hath his father's wife </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε γυναικα τινα του πατρος εχειν</span></span>). "So as (usual force of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span>) for one to go on having (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχειν</span></span>, present infinitive) a wife of the (his) father." It was probably a permanent union (concubine or mistress) of some kind without formal marriage like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:8">John 4:8</span>. The woman probably was not the offender's mother (step-mother) and the father may have been dead or divorced. The Jewish law prescribed stoning for this crime (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+18:8">Leviticus 18:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+22:11">Leviticus 22:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+22:30">Deuteronomy 22:30</span>). But the rabbis (Rabbi Akibah) invented a subterfuge in the case of a proselyte to permit such a relation. Perhaps the Corinthians had also learned how to split hairs over moral matters in such an evil atmosphere and so to condone this crime in one of their own members. Expulsion Paul had urged in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:6">2 Thessalonians 3:6</span> for such offenders. </p>
