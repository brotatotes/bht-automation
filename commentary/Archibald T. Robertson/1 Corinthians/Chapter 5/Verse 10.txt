<p><b> Not altogether </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου παντως</span></span>). Not absolutely, not in all circumstances. Paul thus puts a limitation on his prohibition and confines it to members of the church. He has no jurisdiction over the outsiders (this world, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του κοσμου τουτου</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>The covetous </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις πλεονεκταις</span></span>). Old word for the over-reachers, those avaricious for more and more (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεον, εχω</span></span>, to have more). In N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:10">1 Corinthians 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>. It always comes in bad company (the licentious and the idolaters) like the modern gangsters who form a combination of liquor, lewdness, lawlessness for money and power.</p>
<p><b>Extortioners </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαξιν</span></span>). An old adjective with only one gender, rapacious (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:15">Matthew 7:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:11">Luke 18:11</span>), and as a substantive robber or extortioner (here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:10">1 Corinthians 6:10</span>). Bandits, hijackers, grafters they would be called today.</p>
<p><b>Idolaters </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδωλολατραις</span></span>). Late word for hirelings (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λατρις</span></span>) of the idols (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδωλον</span></span>), so our very word idolater. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:9">1 Corinthians 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:7">1 Corinthians 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:15">Revelation 22:15</span>. Nageli regards this word as a Christian formation.</p>
<p><b>For then must ye needs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επε ωφειλετε ουν</span></span>). This neat Greek idiom of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επε</span></span> with the imperfect indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφειλετε</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειλω</span></span>, to be under obligation) is really the conclusion of a second-class condition with the condition unexpressed (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 965). Sometimes <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> is used also as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:2">Hebrews 10:2</span>, but with verbs of obligation or necessity <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> is usually absent as here (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:20">Hebrews 9:20</span>). The unexpressed condition here would be, "if that were true" (including fornicators, the covetous, extortioners, idolaters of the outside world). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αρα</span></span> means in that case. </p>
