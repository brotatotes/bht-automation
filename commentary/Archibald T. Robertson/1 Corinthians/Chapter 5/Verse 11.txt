<p><b> But now I write unto you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν δε εγραψα υμιν</span></span>). This is the epistolary aorist referring to this same epistle and not to a previous one as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:9">1 Corinthians 5:9</span>.

<p><b>If any man that is named a brother be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν τις αδελφος ονομαζομενος η</span></span>). Condition of the third class, a supposable case.</p>
<p><b>Or a reviler or a drunkard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η λοιδορος η μεθυσος</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λοιδορος</span></span> occurs in Euripides as an adjective and in later writings. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:10">1 Corinthians 6:10</span>. For the verb see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:12">1 Corinthians 4:12</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μεθυσος</span></span> is an old Greek word for women and even men (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροινος</span></span>, of men, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span>).

Chrysostom noted that people in his day complained of the bad company given by Paul for revilers and drunkards as being men with more "respectable" vices!</p>
