<p><b> And ye are puffed up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υμεις πεφυσιωμενο εστε</span></span>). Emphatic position of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις</span></span> (you). It may be understood as a question. Perfect passive periphrastic indicative of the same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσιοω</span></span> used already of the partisans in Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:6">1 Corinthians 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:19">1 Corinthians 4:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:20">1 Corinthians 4:20</span>). Those of the same faction with this scoundrel justified his rascality.</p>
<p><b>Did not rather mourn </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουχ μαλλον επενθησατε</span></span>). Possibly question also and note strong negative form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ</span></span>, which favours it. The very least that they could have done (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλλον</span></span> rather than be puffed up) was to mourn for shame (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πενθεω</span></span>, old verb for lamentation) as if for one dead.</p>
<p><b>That he might be taken away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα αρθη</span></span>). The sub-final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> of desired result (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:15">1 Corinthians 1:15</span>) so common in the <i>Koine</i>. First aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρω</span></span>, to lift up, to carry off. Decent self-respect should have compelled the instant expulsion of the man instead of pride in his rascality. </p>
