 For I verily  (εγω μεν γαρ). Emphatic statement of Paul's own attitude of indignation, εγω in contrast with υμεις. He justifies his demand for the expulsion of the man.Being absent  (απων) Although absent (concessive participle) and so of παρων though present. Each with locative case (τω σωματι, τω πνευματ).Have already judged  (ηδη κεκρικα). Perfect active indicative of κρινω. I have already decided or judged, as though present (ως παρων). Paul felt compelled to reach a conclusion about the case and in a sentence of much difficulty seems to conceive an imaginary church court where the culprit has been tried and condemned. There are various ways of punctuating the clauses in this sentence in verses 1 Corinthians 5:3-5. It is not merely Paul's individual judgment. The genitive absolute clause in verse 1 Corinthians 5:4,ye being gathered together  (συναχθεντων υμων, first aorist passive participle of συναγω, in regular assembly)and my spirit  (κα του εμου πνευματος) with the assembly (he means)and meeting in the name of our Lord Jesus  (εν τω ονοματ του Κυριου [ημων] Ιησου) with the power of the Lord Jesus (συν τη δυναμε του Κυριου ημων Ιησου), though this clause can be taken with the infinitive to deliver (παραδουνα). It makes good syntax and sense taken either way. The chief difference is that, if taken with "gathered together" (συναχθεντων) Paul assumes less apostolic prerogative to himself. But he did have such power and used it against Elymas (Acts 13:8) as Peter did against Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1).
