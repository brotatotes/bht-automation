<p><b> For I verily </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω μεν γαρ</span></span>). Emphatic statement of Paul's own attitude of indignation, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω</span></span> in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις</span></span>. He justifies his demand for the expulsion of the man.</p>
<p><b>Being absent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απων</span></span>) Although absent (concessive participle) and so of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρων</span></span> though present. Each with locative case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω σωματι, τω πνευματ</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Have already judged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη κεκρικα</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>. I have already decided or judged, as though present (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως παρων</span></span>). Paul felt compelled to reach a conclusion about the case and in a sentence of much difficulty seems to conceive an imaginary church court where the culprit has been tried and condemned. There are various ways of punctuating the clauses in this sentence in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:3-5">1 Corinthians 5:3-5</span>. It is not merely Paul's individual judgment. The genitive absolute clause in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:4">1 Corinthians 5:4</span>,</p>
<p><b>ye being gathered together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναχθεντων υμων</span></span>, first aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγω</span></span>, in regular assembly)</p>
<p><b>and my spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα του εμου πνευματος</span></span>) with the assembly (he means)</p>
<p><b>and meeting in the name of our Lord Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ονοματ του Κυριου [ημων] Ιησου</span></span>) with the power of the Lord Jesus (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν τη δυναμε του Κυριου ημων Ιησου</span></span>), though this clause can be taken with the infinitive to deliver (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδουνα</span></span>). It makes good syntax and sense taken either way. The chief difference is that, if taken with "gathered together" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναχθεντων</span></span>) Paul assumes less apostolic prerogative to himself. But he did have such power and used it against Elymas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:8">Acts 13:8</span>) as Peter did against Ananias and Sapphira (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:1">Acts 5:1</span>). </p>
