<p><b> To deliver such an one unto Satan </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδουνα τον τοιουτον τω Σατανα</span></span>). We have the same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20">1 Timothy 1:20</span> used of Hymenius and Alexander. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span> Paul speaks of his own physical suffering as a messenger (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελος</span></span>) of Satan. Paul certainly means expulsion from the church (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:2">1 Corinthians 5:2</span>) and regarding him as outside of the commonwealth of Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:11">Ephesians 2:11</span>). But we are not to infer that expulsion from the local church means the damnation of the offender. The wilful offenders have to be expelled and not regarded as enemies, but admonished as brothers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:14">2 Thessalonians 3:14</span>).</p>
<p><b>For the destruction of the flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ολεθρον της σαρκος</span></span>). Both for physical suffering as in the case of Job (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+2:6">Job 2:6</span>) and for conquest of the fleshly sins, remedial punishment.</p>
<p><b>That the spirit may be saved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα το πνευμα σωθη</span></span>). The ultimate purpose of the expulsion as discipline. Note the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πνευμα</span></span> in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρξ</span></span> as the seat of personality (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:15">1 Corinthians 3:15</span>). Paul's motive is not merely vindictive, but the reformation of the offender who is not named here nor in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:5-11">2 Corinthians 2:5-11</span> if the same man is meant, which is very doubtful. The final salvation of the man in the day of Christ is the goal and this is to be attained not by condoning his sin. </p>
