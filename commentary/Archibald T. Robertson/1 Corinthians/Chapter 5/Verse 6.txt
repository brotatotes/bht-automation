<p><b> Not good </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου καλον</span></span>). Not beautiful, not seemly, in view of this plague spot, this cancer on the church. They needed a surgical operation at once instead of boasting and pride (puffed up). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Καυχημα</span></span> is the thing gloried in.</p>
<p><b>A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μικρα ζυμη ολον το φυραμα ζυμο</span></span>). This proverb occurs <i>verbatim</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:9">Galatians 5:9</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ζυμη</span></span> (leaven) is a late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζεω</span></span>, to boil, as is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζυμοω</span></span>, to leaven. The contraction is regular (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-οει=ο</span></span>) for the third person singular present indicative. See the parables of Jesus for the pervasive power of leaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:33">Matthew 13:33</span>). Some of the members may have argued that one such case did not affect the church as a whole, a specious excuse for negligence that Paul here answers. The emphasis is on the "little" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μικρα</span></span>, note position). Lump (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυραμα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυραω</span></span>, to mix, late word, in the papyri mixing a medical prescription) is a substance mixed with water and kneaded like dough. Compare the pervasive power of germs of disease in the body as they spread through the body. </p>
