<p><b> Wherefore let us keep the feast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε εορταζωμεν</span></span>). Present active subjunctive (volitive). Let us keep on keeping the feast, a perpetual feast (Lightfoot), and keep the leaven out. It is quite possible that Paul was writing about the time of the Jewish passover, since it was before pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:8">1 Corinthians 16:8</span>). But, if so, that is merely incidental, and his language here is not a plea for the observance of Easter by Christians.</p>
<p><b>With the leaven of malice and wickedness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ζυμη κακιας κα πονηριας</span></span>). Vicious disposition and evil deed.</p>
<p><b>With the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αζυμοις ειλικρινιας κα αληθειας</span></span>). No word for "bread." The plural of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αζυμοις</span></span> may suggest "elements" or "loaves." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ειλικρινια</span></span> (sincerity) does not occur in the ancient Greek and is rare in the later Greek. In the papyri it means probity in one example. The etymology is uncertain. Boisacq inclines to the notion of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειλη</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελη</span></span>, sunlight, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>, to judge by the light of the sun, holding up to the light. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αληθεια</span></span> (truth) is a common word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθης</span></span> (true) and this from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ληθω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαθειν, λανθανω</span></span>, to conceal or hide) and so unconcealed, not hidden. The Greek idea of truth is out in the open. Note <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18">Romans 1:18</span> where Paul pictures those who are holding down the truth in unrighteousness. </p>
