 I wrote unto you in my epistle  (εγραψα υμιν εν τη επιστολη). Not the epistolary aorist, but a reference to an epistle to the Corinthians earlier than this one (our First Corinthians), one not preserved to us. What a "find" it would be if a bundle of papyri in Egypt should give it back to us?To have no company with fornicators  (μη συναναμιγνυσθα πορνοις). Present middle infinitive with μη in an indirect command of a late double compound verb used in the papyri to mix up with (συν-ανα-μιγνυσθα, a μ verb). It is in the N.T. only here and verse 1 Corinthians 5:11; 2 Thessalonians 3:14 which see. It is used here with the associative instrumental case (πορνοις, from περαω, περνημ, to sell, men and women who sell their bodies for lust). It is a pertinent question today how far modern views try to put a veneer over the vice in men and women.
