<p><b> I wrote unto you in my epistle </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγραψα υμιν εν τη επιστολη</span></span>). Not the epistolary aorist, but a reference to an epistle to the Corinthians earlier than this one (our First Corinthians), one not preserved to us. What a "find" it would be if a bundle of papyri in Egypt should give it back to us?</p>
<p><b>To have no company with fornicators </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη συναναμιγνυσθα πορνοις</span></span>). Present middle infinitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> in an indirect command of a late double compound verb used in the papyri to mix up with (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν-ανα-μιγνυσθα</span></span>, a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μ</span></span> verb). It is in the N.T. only here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:11">1 Corinthians 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:14">2 Thessalonians 3:14</span> which see. It is used here with the associative instrumental case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορνοις</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περαω, περνημ</span></span>, to sell, men and women who sell their bodies for lust). It is a pertinent question today how far modern views try to put a veneer over the vice in men and women. </p>
