<p><b> Dare any of you? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τολμα τις υμων;</span></span>). Does any one of you dare? Rhetorical question with present indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τολμαω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τολμα</span></span>, daring. Bengel: <i>grandi verbo notatur laesa majestas Christianorum</i>. "The word is an argument in itself" (Robertson and Plummer). Apparently Paul has an actual case in mind as in chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:1">1 Corinthians 6:1</span> though no name is called.</p>
<p><b>Having a matter against his neighbour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πραγμα εχων προς τον ετερον</span></span>). Forensic sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πραγμα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρασσω</span></span>, to do, to exact, to extort as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:13">Luke 3:13</span>), a case, a suit (Demosthenes 1020, 26), with the other or the neighbour as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:24">1 Corinthians 10:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:17">1 Corinthians 14:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:4">Galatians 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:1">Romans 2:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Go to law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινεσθα</span></span>). Present middle or passive (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:4">Romans 3:4</span>) in the same forensic sense as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριθηνα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:40">Matthew 5:40</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κριτης</span></span>, judge, is from this verb.</p>
<p><b>Before the unrighteous </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ των αδικων</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> with the genitive for "in the presence of" is idiomatic as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:14">2 Corinthians 7:14</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ Τιτου</span></span>, in the case of Titus. The Jews held that to bring a lawsuit before a court of idolaters was blasphemy against the law. But the Greeks were fond of disputatious lawsuits with each other. Probably the Greek Christians brought cases before pagan judges. </p>
