<p><b> And such were some of you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ταυτα τινες ητε</span></span>). A sharp homethrust. Literally, "And these things (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτα</span></span>, neuter plural) were ye (some of you)." The horror is shown by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτα</span></span>, but by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινες</span></span> Paul narrows the picture to some, not all. But that was in the past (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητε</span></span>, imperfect indicative) like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:17">Romans 6:17</span>. Thank God the blood of Jesus does cleanse from such sins as these. But do not go back to them.</p>
<p><b>But ye were washed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απελουσασθε</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative, not passive, of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολουω</span></span>. Either direct middle, ye washed yourselves, or indirect middle, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:16">Acts 22:16</span>, ye washed your sins away (force of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>). This was their own voluntary act in baptism which was the outward expression of the previous act of God in cleansing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγιασθητε</span></span>, ye were sanctified or cleansed before the baptism) and justified (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδικαιωθητε</span></span>, ye were put right with God before the act of baptism). "These twin conceptions of the Christian state in its beginning appear commonly in the reverse order" (Findlay). The outward expression is usually mentioned before the inward change which precedes it. In this passage the Trinity appear as in the baptismal command in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>. </p>
