<p><b> Lawful </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεστιν</span></span>). Apparently this proverb may have been used by Paul in Corinth (repeated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:23">1 Corinthians 10:23</span>), but not in the sense now used by Paul's opponents. The "all things" do not include such matters as those condemned in chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:1">1 Corinthians 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:1-11">1 Corinthians 6:1-11</span>. Paul limits the proverb to things not immoral, things not wrong <i>per se</i>. But even here liberty is not license.</p>
<p><b>But not all things are expedient </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ου παντα συμφερε</span></span>). Old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφερε</span></span>, bears together for good and so worthwhile. Many things, harmless in themselves in the abstract, do harm to others in the concrete. We live in a world of social relations that circumscribe personal rights and liberties.</p>
<p><b>But I will not be brought under the power of any </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ ουκ εγω εξουσιασθησομα υπο τινος</span></span>). Perhaps a conscious play on the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεστιν</span></span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσιαζω</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσια</span></span> and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεστιν</span></span>. Verb from Aristotle on, though not common (Dion. of Hal., LXX and inscriptions). In N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:4">1 Corinthians 7:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:25">Luke 22:25</span>. Paul is determined not to be a slave to anything harmless in itself. He will maintain his self-control. He gives a wholesome hint to those who talk so much about personal liberty. </p>
