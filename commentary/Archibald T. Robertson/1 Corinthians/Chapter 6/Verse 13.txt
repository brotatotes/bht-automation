<p><b> But God shall bring to nought both it and them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε θεος κα ταυτην κα ταυτα καταργησε</span></span>). Another proverb about the adaptation of the belly (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοιλια</span></span>) and food (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βρωματα</span></span>, not just flesh), which had apparently been used by some in Corinth to justify sexual license (fornication and adultery). These Gentiles mixed up matters not alike at all (questions of food and sensuality). " We have traces of this gross moral confusion in the circumstances which dictated the Apostolic Letter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:23-29">Acts 15:23-29</span>), where things wholly diverse are combined, as directions about meats to be avoided and a prohibition of fornication" (Lightfoot). Both the belly (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτην</span></span>) and the foods (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτα</span></span>) God will bring to an end by death and change.</p>
<p><b>But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το δε σωμα ου τη πορνεια αλλα τω κυριωι, κα ο κυριος τω σωματ</span></span>). Paul here boldly shows the fallacy in the parallel about appetite of the belly for food. The human body has a higher mission than the mere gratification of sensual appetite. Sex is of God for the propagation of the race, not for prostitution. Paul had already stated that God dwells in us as the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>). This higher function of the body he here puts forward against the debased Greek philosophy of the time which ignored completely Paul's idea, "the body for the Lord and the Lord for the body" (dative of personal interest in both cases). "The Lord Jesus and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορνεια</span></span> contested for the bodies of Christian men; loyal to him they must renounce <i>that</i>, yielding to <i>that</i> they renounce him" (Findlay). </p>
