<p><b> Your body is a temple </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το σωμα υμων ναος εστιν</span></span>). A sanctuary as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span> which see. Our spirits dwell in our bodies and the Holy Spirit dwells in our spirits. Some of the Gnostics split hairs between the sins of the body and fellowship with God in the spirit. Paul will have none of this subterfuge. One's body is the very shrine for the Holy Spirit. In Corinth was the temple to Aphrodite in which fornication was regarded as consecration instead of desecration. Prostitutes were there as priestesses of Aphrodite, to help men worship the goddess by fornication.</p>
<p><b>Ye are not your own </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστε εαυτων</span></span>). Predicate genitive. Ye do not belong to yourselves, even if you could commit fornication without personal contamination or self-violation. Christianity makes unchastity dishonour in both sexes. There is no double standard of morality. Paul's plea here is primarily to men to be clean as members of Christ's body. </p>
