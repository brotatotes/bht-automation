<p><b> Shall judge the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον κοσμον κρινουσιν</span></span>). Future active indicative. At the last day with the Lord Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:30">Luke 22:30</span>).</p>
<p><b>Are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναξιο εστε κριτηριων ελαχιστων;</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αναξιος</span></span> is an old word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιος</span></span>), though only here in the N.T. There is dispute as to the meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριτηρια</span></span> here and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:4">1 Corinthians 6:4</span>, old word, but nowhere else in N.T. save in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:6">James 2:6</span>. Naturally, like other words in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-τηριον</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακροατηριον</span></span>, auditorium, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:23">Acts 25:23</span>), this word means the place where judgment is rendered, or court. It is common in the papyri in the sense of tribunal. In the <i>Apost. Const</i>. ii. 45 we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ερχεσθω επ κριτηριον εθνικον</span></span> (Let him not come before a heathen tribunal). Hence here it would mean, "Are ye unworthy of the smallest tribunals?" That is, of sitting on the smallest tribunals, of forming courts yourselves to settle such things? </p>
