 Shall judge the world  (τον κοσμον κρινουσιν). Future active indicative. At the last day with the Lord Jesus (Matthew 19:28; Luke 22:30).Are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  (αναξιο εστε κριτηριων ελαχιστων;). Αναξιος is an old word (αν and αξιος), though only here in the N.T. There is dispute as to the meaning of κριτηρια here and in verse 1 Corinthians 6:4, old word, but nowhere else in N.T. save in James 2:6. Naturally, like other words in -τηριον (ακροατηριον, auditorium, Acts 25:23), this word means the place where judgment is rendered, or court. It is common in the papyri in the sense of tribunal. In the Apost. Const. ii. 45 we have μη ερχεσθω επ κριτηριον εθνικον (Let him not come before a heathen tribunal). Hence here it would mean, "Are ye unworthy of the smallest tribunals?" That is, of sitting on the smallest tribunals, of forming courts yourselves to settle such things?
