<p><b> For ye were bought with a price </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγορασθητε γαρ τιμης</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγοραζω</span></span>, old verb to buy in the marketplace (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγορα</span></span>). With genitive of price. Paul does not here state the price as Peter does in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:19">1 Peter 1:19</span> (the blood of Christ) and as Jesus does in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span> (his life a ransom). The Corinthians understood his meaning.</p>
<p><b>Glorify God therefore in your body </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξασατε δη τον θεον εν τω σωματ υμων</span></span>). Passionate conclusion to his powerful argument against sexual uncleanness. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δη</span></span> is a shortened form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη</span></span> and is an urgent inferential particle. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:15">Luke 2:15</span>. Paul holds to his high ideal of the destiny of the body and urges glorifying God in it. Some of the later Christians felt that Paul's words could be lightened a bit by adding "and in your spirits which are his," but these words are found only in late MSS. and are clearly not genuine. Paul's argument stands four-square for the dignity of the body as the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit united to the Lord Jesus. </p>
