<p><b> How much more, things that pertain to this life? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μητ γε βιωτικα;</span></span>). The question expects the answer no and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γε</span></span> adds sharp point to Paul's surprised tone, "Need I so much as say?" It can be understood also as ellipsis, "let me not say" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητιγε λεγω</span></span>), not to say. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βιωτικα</span></span> occurs first in Aristotle, but is common afterwards. In the papyri it is used of business matters. It is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιος</span></span> (manner of life in contrast to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωη</span></span>, life principle). </p>
