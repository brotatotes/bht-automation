 How much more, things that pertain to this life?  (Μητ γε βιωτικα;). The question expects the answer no and γε adds sharp point to Paul's surprised tone, "Need I so much as say?" It can be understood also as ellipsis, "let me not say" (μητιγε λεγω), not to say. Βιωτικα occurs first in Aristotle, but is common afterwards. In the papyri it is used of business matters. It is from βιος (manner of life in contrast to ζωη, life principle).
