 If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life  (βιωτικα μεν ουν κριτηρια εαν εχητε). Note emphatic position (proleptic) of βιωτικα κριτηρια (tribunals pertaining to this life, as above). "If ye have tribunals pertaining to this life" (condition of third class, εαν εχητε). If καθιζετε (do ye set) is indicative and interrogative, then by "who are of no account in the church" (τους εξουθενημενους εν τη εκκλησια) Paul means the heathen as in verse 1 Corinthians 6:1. If καθιζετε be imperative, then Paul means the least esteemed members of the church for such unwished for work. It is a harsh term for the heathen, but one of indignation toward Christians.
