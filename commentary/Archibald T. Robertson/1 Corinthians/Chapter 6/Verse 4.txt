<p><b> If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιωτικα μεν ουν κριτηρια εαν εχητε</span></span>). Note emphatic position (proleptic) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιωτικα κριτηρια</span></span> (tribunals pertaining to this life, as above). "If ye have tribunals pertaining to this life" (condition of third class, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν εχητε</span></span>). If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθιζετε</span></span> (do ye set) is indicative and interrogative, then by "who are of no account in the church" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους εξουθενημενους εν τη εκκλησια</span></span>) Paul means the heathen as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:1">1 Corinthians 6:1</span>. If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθιζετε</span></span> be imperative, then Paul means the least esteemed members of the church for such unwished for work. It is a harsh term for the heathen, but one of indignation toward Christians. </p>
