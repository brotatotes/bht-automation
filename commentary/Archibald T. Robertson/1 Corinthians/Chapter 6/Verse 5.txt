<p><b> I say this to move you to shame </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς εντροπην υμιν λεγω</span></span>). Old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντροπη</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντρεπω</span></span>, to turn in (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:14">1 Corinthians 4:14</span> which see). In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:34">1 Corinthians 15:34</span>.</p>
<p><b>One wise man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφος</span></span>). From sarcasm to pathos Paul turns.</p>
<p><b>Does there not exist </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>, short form for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεστ</span></span>)? With double negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ--ουδεις</span></span>, expecting the answer yes. Surely</p>
<p><b>one </b> such man exists in the church.</p>
<p><b>Who </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span>). Almost consecutive in idea, of such wisdom that he will be able.</p>
<p><b>To decide between his brethren </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακρινα ανα μεσον του αδελφου αυτου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κρινα</span></span> is to judge or decide (first aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> (two) carries on the idea of between. Then <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα μεσον</span></span> makes it still plainer, in the midst as</p>
<p><b>arbitrator </b> between brother and brother like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα μεσον εμου κα σου</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+23:15">Genesis 23:15</span>). It is even so a condensed expression with part of it unexpressed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα μεσον κα του αδελφου αυτου</span></span>) between brother and his brother. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδελφος</span></span> has a sharp reflection on them for their going to heathen judges to settle disputes between brothers in Christ. </p>
