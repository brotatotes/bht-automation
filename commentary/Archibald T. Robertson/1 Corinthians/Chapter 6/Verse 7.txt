<p><b> Nay, already it is altogether a defect among you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη μεν ουν ολως ηττημα υμιν εστιν</span></span>). "Indeed therefore there is to you already (to begin with, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη</span></span>, before any question of courts) wholly defeat." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hηττημα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητταομα</span></span>) is only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:12">Romans 11:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+31:8">Isaiah 31:8</span> and ecclesiastical writers. See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητταομα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηττων</span></span>, less) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:13">2 Corinthians 12:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:19">2 Peter 2:19</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Νικη</span></span> was victory and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηττα</span></span> defeat with the Greeks. It is defeat for Christians to have lawsuits (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριματα</span></span>, usually decrees or judgments) with one another. This was proof of the failure of love and forgiveness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:13">Colossians 3:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>Take wrong </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικεισθε</span></span>). Present middle indicative, of old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικεω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικος</span></span>, not right). Better undergo wrong yourself than suffer</p>
<p><b>defeat </b> in the matter of love and forgiveness of a brother.</p>
<p><b>Be defrauded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστερεισθε</span></span>). Permissive middle again like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικεισθε</span></span>. Allow yourselves to be robbed (old verb to deprive, to rob) rather than have a lawsuit. </p>
