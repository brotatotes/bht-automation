 Nay, already it is altogether a defect among you  (ηδη μεν ουν ολως ηττημα υμιν εστιν). "Indeed therefore there is to you already (to begin with, ηδη, before any question of courts) wholly defeat." Hηττημα (from ητταομα) is only here, Romans 11:12; Isaiah 31:8 and ecclesiastical writers. See ητταομα (from ηττων, less) in 2 Corinthians 12:13; 2 Peter 2:19 Νικη was victory and ηττα defeat with the Greeks. It is defeat for Christians to have lawsuits (κριματα, usually decrees or judgments) with one another. This was proof of the failure of love and forgiveness (Colossians 3:13).Take wrong  (αδικεισθε). Present middle indicative, of old verb αδικεω (from αδικος, not right). Better undergo wrong yourself than sufferdefeat  in the matter of love and forgiveness of a brother.Be defrauded  (αποστερεισθε). Permissive middle again like αδικεισθε. Allow yourselves to be robbed (old verb to deprive, to rob) rather than have a lawsuit.
