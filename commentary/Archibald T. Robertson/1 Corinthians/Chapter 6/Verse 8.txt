<p><b> Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong and defraud </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα υμεις αδικειτε κα αποστερειτε</span></span>). "But (adversative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span>, on the contrary) you (emphatic) do the wronging and the robbing" (active voices) "and that your brethren" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τουτο αδελφους</span></span>). Same idiom as at close of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:6">1 Corinthians 6:6</span>. The very climax of wrong-doings, to stoop to do this with one's brethren in Christ. </p>
