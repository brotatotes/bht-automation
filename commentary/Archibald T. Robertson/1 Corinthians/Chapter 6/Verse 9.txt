<p><b> The unrighteous </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικο</span></span>). To remind them of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικεω</span></span> just used.</p>
<p><b>The Kingdom of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεου βασιλειαν</span></span>). Precisely, God's kingdom.</p>
<p><b>Be not deceived </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πλανασθε</span></span>). Present passive imperative with negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>. Do not be led astray by plausible talk to cover up sin as mere animal behaviourism. Paul has two lists in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:9">1 Corinthians 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:10">1 Corinthians 6:10</span>, one with repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτε</span></span>, neither (fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλακο</span></span>, abusers of themselves with men or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρσενοκοιτα</span></span> or sodomites as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:10">1 Timothy 1:10</span> a late word for this horrid vice, thieves, covetous), the other with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> not (drunkards, revilers, extortioners). All these will fall short of the kingdom of God. This was plain talk to a city like Corinth. It is needed today. It is a solemn roll call of the damned even if some of their names are on the church roll in Corinth whether officers or ordinary members. </p>
