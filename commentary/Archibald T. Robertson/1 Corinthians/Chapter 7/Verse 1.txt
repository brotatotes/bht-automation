<p><b> Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ δε ων εγραψατε</span></span>). An ellipsis of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ τουτων</span></span>, the antecedent of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ ων</span></span>, is easily supplied as in papyri. The church had written Paul a letter in which a number of specific problems about marriage were raised. He answers them <i>seriatim</i>. The questions must be clearly before one in order intelligently to interpret Paul's replies. The first is whether a single life is wrong. Paul pointedly says that it is not wrong, but good (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλον</span></span>). One will get a one-sided view of Paul's teaching on marriage unless he keeps a proper perspective. One of the marks of certain heretics will be forbidding to marry (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:3">1 Timothy 4:3</span>). Paul uses marriage as a metaphor of our relation to Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:4">Romans 7:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:28-33">Ephesians 5:28-33</span>). Paul is not here opposing marriage. He is only arguing that celibacy may be good in certain limitations. The genitive case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απτεσθα</span></span> (touch) is the usual construction. </p>
