<p><b>Not I, but the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εγω αλλα ο κυριος</span></span>). Paul had no commands from Jesus to the unmarried (men or women), but Jesus had spoken to the married (husbands and wives) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:31">Matthew 5:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:3-12">Matthew 19:3-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:9-12">Mark 10:9-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:18">Luke 16:18</span>. The Master had spoken plain words about divorce. Paul reenforces his own inspired command by the command of Jesus. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:9">Mark 10:9</span> we have from Christ: "What therefore God joined together let not man put asunder" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη χοριζετω</span></span>).</p>

First aorist passive infinitive (indirect command after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραγγελλω</span></span>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χοριζω</span></span>, old verb from adverbial preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρις</span></span>, separately, apart from, from. Here used of divorce by the wife which, though unusual then, yet did happen as in the case of Salome (sister of Herod the Great) and of Herodias before she married Herod Antipas. Jesus also spoke of it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:12">Mark 10:12</span>). Now most of the divorces are obtained by women. This passive infinitive is almost reflexive in force according to a constant tendency in the <i>Koine</i> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 817). </p>
