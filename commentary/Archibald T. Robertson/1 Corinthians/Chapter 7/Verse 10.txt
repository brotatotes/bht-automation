 To the married  (τοις γεγαμηκοσιν). Perfect active participle of γαμεω, old verb, to marry, and still married as the tense shows.I give charge  (παραγγελλω). Not mere wish as in verses 1 Corinthians 7:7; 1 Corinthians 7:8.Not I, but the Lord  (ουκ εγω αλλα ο κυριος). Paul had no commands from Jesus to the unmarried (men or women), but Jesus had spoken to the married (husbands and wives) as in Matthew 5:31; Matthew 19:3-12; Mark 10:9-12; Luke 16:18. The Master had spoken plain words about divorce. Paul reenforces his own inspired command by the command of Jesus. In Mark 10:9 we have from Christ: "What therefore God joined together let not man put asunder" (μη χοριζετω).That the wife depart not from her husband  (γυναικα απο ανδρος μη χορισθηνα). First aorist passive infinitive (indirect command after παραγγελλω) of χοριζω, old verb from adverbial preposition χωρις, separately, apart from, from. Here used of divorce by the wife which, though unusual then, yet did happen as in the case of Salome (sister of Herod the Great) and of Herodias before she married Herod Antipas. Jesus also spoke of it (Mark 10:12). Now most of the divorces are obtained by women. This passive infinitive is almost reflexive in force according to a constant tendency in the Koine (Robertson, Grammar, p. 817).
