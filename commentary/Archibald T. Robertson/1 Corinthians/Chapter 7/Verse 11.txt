<p><b> But and if she depart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν δε κα χωρισθη</span></span>). Third class condition, undetermined. If, in spite of Christ's clear prohibition, she get separated (ingressive passive subjunctive),</p>
<p><b>let her remain unmarried </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενετω αγαμος</span></span>). Paul here makes no allowance for remarriage of the innocent party as Jesus does by implication.</p>
<p><b>Or else be reconciled to her husband </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η τω ανδρ καταλλαγητω</span></span>). Second aorist (ingressive) passive imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλλασσω</span></span>, old compound verb to exchange coins as of equal value, to reconcile. One of Paul's great words for reconciliation with God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:18-20">2 Corinthians 5:18-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:10">Romans 5:10</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διαλλασσω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:24">Matthew 5:24</span> which see) was more common in the older Greek, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλλασσω</span></span> in the later. The difference in idea is very slight, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια-</span></span> accents notion of exchange, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ-</span></span> the perfective idea (complete reconciliation). Dative of personal interest is the case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανδρ</span></span>. This sentence is a parenthesis between the two infinitives <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρισθηνα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιενα</span></span> (both indirect commands after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραγγελλω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>And that the husband leave not his wife </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ανδρα μη αφιενα</span></span>). This is also part of the Lord's command (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:11">Mark 10:11</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Απολυω</span></span> occurs in Mark of the husband's act and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιενα</span></span> here, both meaning to send away. Bengel actually stresses the difference between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρισθηνα</span></span> of the woman as like <i>separatur</i> in Latin and calls the wife "pars ignobilior" and the husband "nobilior." I doubt if Paul would stand for that extreme. </p>
