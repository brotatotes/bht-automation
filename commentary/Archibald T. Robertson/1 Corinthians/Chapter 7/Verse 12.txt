<p><b> But to the rest say I, not the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις δε λοιποις λεγω εγω, ουχ ο Κυριος</span></span>). Paul has no word about marriage from Jesus beyond the problem of divorce. This is no disclaimer of inspiration. He simply means that here he is not quoting a command of Jesus.</p>
<p><b>An unbelieving wife </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυναικα απιστον</span></span>). This is a new problem, the result of work among the Gentiles, that did not arise in the time of Jesus. The form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιστον</span></span> is the same as the masculine because a compound adjective. Paul has to deal with mixed marriages as missionaries do today in heathen lands. The rest (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λοιπο</span></span>) for Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:3">Ephesians 2:3</span>) we have already had in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13">1 Thessalonians 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:6">1 Thessalonians 5:6</span> which see. The Christian husband married his wife when he himself was an unbeliever. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιστος</span></span> sometimes means unfaithful (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:46">Luke 12:46</span>), but not here (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:27">John 20:27</span>).</p>
<p><b>She is content </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνευδοκε</span></span>). Late compound verb to be pleased together with, agree together. In the papyri.</p>
<p><b>Let him not leave her </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη αφιετω αυτην</span></span>). Perhaps here and in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:11">1 Corinthians 7:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:13">1 Corinthians 7:13</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιημ</span></span> should be translated "put away" like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολυω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:1">Mark 10:1</span>. Some understand <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιημ</span></span> as separation from bed and board, not divorce. </p>
