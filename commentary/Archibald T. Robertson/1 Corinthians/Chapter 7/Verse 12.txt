 But to the rest say I, not the Lord  (τοις δε λοιποις λεγω εγω, ουχ ο Κυριος). Paul has no word about marriage from Jesus beyond the problem of divorce. This is no disclaimer of inspiration. He simply means that here he is not quoting a command of Jesus.An unbelieving wife  (γυναικα απιστον). This is a new problem, the result of work among the Gentiles, that did not arise in the time of Jesus. The form απιστον is the same as the masculine because a compound adjective. Paul has to deal with mixed marriages as missionaries do today in heathen lands. The rest (ο λοιπο) for Gentiles (Ephesians 2:3) we have already had in 1 Thessalonians 4:13; 1 Thessalonians 5:6 which see. The Christian husband married his wife when he himself was an unbeliever. The word απιστος sometimes means unfaithful (Luke 12:46), but not here (cf. John 20:27).She is content  (συνευδοκε). Late compound verb to be pleased together with, agree together. In the papyri.Let him not leave her  (μη αφιετω αυτην). Perhaps here and in verses 1 Corinthians 7:11; 1 Corinthians 7:13 αφιημ should be translated "put away" like απολυω in Mark 10:1. Some understand αφιημ as separation from bed and board, not divorce.
