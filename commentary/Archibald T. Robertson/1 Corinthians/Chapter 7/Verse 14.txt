<p><b> Is sanctified in the wife </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγιαστα εν τη γυναικ</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιαζω</span></span>, to set apart, to hallow, to sanctify. Paul does not, of course, mean that the unbelieving husband is saved by the faith of the believing wife, though Hodge actually so interprets him. Clearly he only means that the marriage relation is sanctified so that there is no need of a divorce. If either husband or wife is a believer and the other agrees to remain, the marriage is holy and need not be set aside. This is so simple that one wonders at the ability of men to get confused over Paul's language.</p>
<p><b>Else were your children unclean </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επε αρα τα τεκνα ακαθαρτα</span></span>). The common ellipse of the condition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επε</span></span>: "since, accordingly, if it is otherwise, your children are illegitimate (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακαθαρτα</span></span>)." If the relations of the parents be holy, the child's birth must be holy also (not illegitimate). "He is not assuming that the child of a Christian parent would be baptized; that would spoil rather than help his argument, for it would imply that the child was not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιος</span></span> till it was baptized. The verse throws no light on the question of infant baptism" (Robertson and Plummer). </p>
