<p><b> For how knowest thou? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ γαρ οιδασ;</span></span>). But what does Paul mean? Is he giving an argument <i>against</i> the believer accepting divorce or <i>in favour</i> of doing so? The syntax allows either interpretation with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> (if) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδας</span></span>. Is the idea in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> (if) <i>hope</i> of saving the other or <i>fear</i> of not saving and hence peril in continuing the slavery of such a bondage? The latter idea probably suits the context best and is adopted by most commentators. And yet one hesitates to interpret Paul as <i>advocating</i> divorce unless strongly insisted on by the unbeliever. There is no problem at all unless the unbeliever makes it. If it is a hopeless case, acquiescence is the only wise solution. But surely the believer ought to be sure that there is no hope before he agrees to break the bond. Paul raises the problem of the wife first as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:10">1 Corinthians 7:10</span>. </p>
