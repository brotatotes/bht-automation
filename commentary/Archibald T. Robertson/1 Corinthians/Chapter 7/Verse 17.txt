<p><b> Only </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη</span></span> as an elliptical condition is very common (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:5">1 Corinthians 7:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7">Galatians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:19">Galatians 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:14">Romans 14:14</span>), "except that" like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλην</span></span>. Paul gives a general principle as a limitation to what he has just said in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:15">1 Corinthians 7:15</span>. "It states the general principle which determines these questions about marriage, and this is afterwards illustrated by the cases of circumcision and slavery" (Robertson and Plummer). He has said that there is to be no compulsory slavery between the believer and the disbeliever (the Christian and the pagan). But on the other hand there is to be no reckless abuse of this liberty, no license.</p>
<p><b>As the Lord hath distributed to each man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαστω ως μεμερικεν ο κυριος</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεριζω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μερος</span></span>, apart. Each has his lot from the Lord Jesus, has his call from God. He is not to seek a rupture of the marriage relation if the unbeliever does not ask for it.</p>
<p><b>And so ordain I </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουτως διατασσομα</span></span>). Military term, old word, to arrange in all the churches (distributed, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια-</span></span>). Paul is conscious of authoritative leadership as the apostle of Christ to the Gentiles. </p>
