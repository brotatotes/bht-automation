<p><b> Wast thou called being a bondservant? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος εκληθησ;</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative. Wast thou, a slave, called?</p>
<p><b>Care not for it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη σο μελετω</span></span>). "Let it not be a care to thee." Third person singular (impersonal) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελε</span></span>, old verb with dative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σο</span></span>. It was usually a fixed condition and a slave could be a good servant of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:22">Colossians 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5">Ephesians 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:9">Titus 2:9</span>), even with heathen masters.</p>
<p><b>Use it rather </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλλον χρησα</span></span>). Make use of what? There is no "it" in the Greek. Shall we supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελευθερια</span></span> (instrumental case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρησα</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλεια</span></span>)? Most naturally <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελευθερια</span></span>, freedom, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελευθερος</span></span>, just before. In that case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε κα</span></span> is not taken as although, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> goes with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνασα</span></span>, "But if thou canst also become free, the rather use your opportunity for freedom." On the whole this is probably Paul's idea and is in full harmony with the general principle above about mixed marriages with the heathen. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χρησα</span></span> is second person singular aorist middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χραομα</span></span>, to use, old and common verb. </p>
