 Wast thou called being a bondservant?  (δουλος εκληθησ;). First aorist passive indicative. Wast thou, a slave, called?Care not for it  (μη σο μελετω). "Let it not be a care to thee." Third person singular (impersonal) of μελε, old verb with dative σο. It was usually a fixed condition and a slave could be a good servant of Christ (Colossians 3:22; Ephesians 6:5; Titus 2:9), even with heathen masters.Use it rather  (μαλλον χρησα). Make use of what? There is no "it" in the Greek. Shall we supply ελευθερια (instrumental case after χρησα or δουλεια)? Most naturally ελευθερια, freedom, from ελευθερος, just before. In that case ε κα is not taken as although, but κα goes with δυνασα, "But if thou canst also become free, the rather use your opportunity for freedom." On the whole this is probably Paul's idea and is in full harmony with the general principle above about mixed marriages with the heathen. Χρησα is second person singular aorist middle imperative of χραομα, to use, old and common verb.
