<p><b> The Lord's freedman </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απελευθερος Κυριου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Απελευθερος</span></span> is an old word for a manumitted slave, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελευθερος</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, to go and so go free, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ-</span></span> from bondage. Christ is now the owner of the Christian and Paul rejoices to call himself Christ's slave (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span>). But Christ set us free from sin by paying the ransom (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυτρον</span></span>) of his life on the Cross (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:2">Romans 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>). Christ is thus the <i>patronus</i> of the <i>libertus</i> who owes everything to his <i>patronus</i>. He is no longer the slave of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:18">Romans 6:18</span>), but a slave to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:22">Romans 6:22</span>).</p>
<p><b>Likewise the freeman when called is Christ's slave </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιως ο ελευθερος κληθεις δουλος εστιν Χριστου</span></span>). Those who were not slaves, but freemen, when converted, are as much slaves of Christ as those who were and still were slaves of men. All were slaves of sin and have been set free from sin by Christ who now owns them all. </p>
