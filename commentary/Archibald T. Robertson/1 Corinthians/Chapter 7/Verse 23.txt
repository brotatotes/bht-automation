<p><b> Ye were bought with a price </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμης ηγορασθητε</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:20">1 Corinthians 6:20</span> for this very phrase, here repeated. Both classes (slaves and freemen) were purchased by the blood of Christ.</p>
<p><b>Become not bondservants of men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη γινεσθε δουλο ανθρωπων</span></span>). Present middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span> with negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>. Literally, stop becoming slaves of men. Paul here clearly defines his opposition to human slavery as an institution which comes out so powerfully in the Epistle to Philemon. Those already free from human slavery should not become enslaved. </p>
