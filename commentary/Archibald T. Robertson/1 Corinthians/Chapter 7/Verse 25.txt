<p><b> I have no commandment of the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιταγην Κυριου ουκ εχω</span></span>). A late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτασσω</span></span>, old Greek verb to enjoin, to give orders to. Paul did have (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:10">1 Corinthians 7:10</span>) a command from the Lord as we have in Matthew and Mark. It was quite possible for Paul to know this command of Jesus as he did other sayings of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:35">Acts 20:35</span>) even if he had as yet no access to a written gospel or had received no direct revelation on the subject from Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23">1 Corinthians 11:23</span>). Sayings of Jesus were passed on among the believers. But Paul had no specific word from Jesus on the subject of virgins. They call for special treatment, young unmarried women only Paul means (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:25">1 Corinthians 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:28">1 Corinthians 7:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:34">1 Corinthians 7:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:36-38">1 Corinthians 7:36-38</span>) and not as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:4">Revelation 14:4</span> (metaphor). It is probable that in the letter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span>) the Corinthians had asked about this problem.</p>
<p><b>But I give my judgment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωμην δε διδωμ</span></span>). About mixed marriages (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:12-16">1 Corinthians 7:12-16</span>) Paul had the command of Jesus concerning divorce to guide him. Here he has nothing from Jesus at all. So he gives no "command," but only "a judgment," a deliberately formed decision from knowledge (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:10">2 Corinthians 8:10</span>), not a mere passing fancy.</p>
<p><b>As one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ηλεημενος υπο κυριου πιστος εινα</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεεω</span></span>, old verb to receive mercy (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεος</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πιστος</span></span> is predicate nominative with infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα</span></span>. This language, so far from being a disclaimer of inspiration, is an express claim to help from the Lord in the forming of this duly considered judgment, which is in no sense a command, but an inspired opinion. </p>
