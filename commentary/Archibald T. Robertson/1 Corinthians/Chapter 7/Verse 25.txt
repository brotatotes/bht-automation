 I have no commandment of the Lord  (επιταγην Κυριου ουκ εχω). A late word from επιτασσω, old Greek verb to enjoin, to give orders to. Paul did have (verse 1 Corinthians 7:10) a command from the Lord as we have in Matthew and Mark. It was quite possible for Paul to know this command of Jesus as he did other sayings of Jesus (Acts 20:35) even if he had as yet no access to a written gospel or had received no direct revelation on the subject from Jesus (1 Corinthians 11:23). Sayings of Jesus were passed on among the believers. But Paul had no specific word from Jesus on the subject of virgins. They call for special treatment, young unmarried women only Paul means (1 Corinthians 7:25; 1 Corinthians 7:28; 1 Corinthians 7:34; 1 Corinthians 7:36-38) and not as in Revelation 14:4 (metaphor). It is probable that in the letter (1 Corinthians 7:1) the Corinthians had asked about this problem.But I give my judgment  (γνωμην δε διδωμ). About mixed marriages (1 Corinthians 7:12-16) Paul had the command of Jesus concerning divorce to guide him. Here he has nothing from Jesus at all. So he gives no "command," but only "a judgment," a deliberately formed decision from knowledge (2 Corinthians 8:10), not a mere passing fancy.As one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful  (ως ηλεημενος υπο κυριου πιστος εινα). Perfect passive participle of ελεεω, old verb to receive mercy (ελεος). Πιστος is predicate nominative with infinitive εινα. This language, so far from being a disclaimer of inspiration, is an express claim to help from the Lord in the forming of this duly considered judgment, which is in no sense a command, but an inspired opinion.
