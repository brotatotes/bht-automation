 I think therefore  (νομιζω ουν). Paul proceeds to express therefore the previously mentioned judgment (γνωμην) and calls it his opinion, not because he is uncertain, but simply because it is not a command, but advice.By reason of the present distress  (δια την ενεστωσαν αναγκην). The participle ενεστωσαν is second perfect active of ενιστημ and means "standing on" or "present" (cf. Galatians 1:4; Hebrews 9:9). It occurs in 2 Thessalonians 2:2 of the advent of Christ as not "present." Whether Paul has in mind the hoped for second coming of Jesus in this verse we do not certainly know, though probably so. Jesus had spoken of those calamities which would precede his coming (Matthew 24:8) though Paul had denied saying that the advent was right at hand (2 Thessalonians 2:2). Αναγκη is a strong word (old and common), either for external circumstances or inward sense of duty. It occurs elsewhere for the woes preceding the second coming (Luke 21:23) and also for Paul's persecutions (1 Thessalonians 3:7; 2 Corinthians 6:4; 2 Corinthians 12:10). Perhaps there is a mingling of both ideas here.Namely . This word is not in the Greek. The infinitive of indirect discourse (υπαρχειν) after νομιζω is repeated with recitative οτ, "That the being so is good for a man" (οτ καλον ανθρωπω το ουτως εινα). The use of the article το with εινα compels this translation. Probably Paul means for one (ανθρωπω, generic term for man or woman) to remain as he is whether married or unmarried. The copula εστιν is not expressed. He uses καλον (good) as in 1 Corinthians 7:1.
