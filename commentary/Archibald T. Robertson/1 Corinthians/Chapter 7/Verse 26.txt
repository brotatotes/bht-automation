<p><b> I think therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομιζω ουν</span></span>). Paul proceeds to express therefore the previously mentioned judgment (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωμην</span></span>) and calls it his opinion, not because he is uncertain, but simply because it is not a command, but advice.</p>
<p><b>By reason of the present distress </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια την ενεστωσαν αναγκην</span></span>). The participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεστωσαν</span></span> is second perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενιστημ</span></span> and means "standing on" or "present" (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:4">Galatians 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9">Hebrews 9:9</span>). It occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span> of the advent of Christ as not "present." Whether Paul has in mind the hoped for second coming of Jesus in this verse we do not certainly know, though probably so. Jesus had spoken of those calamities which would precede his coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:8">Matthew 24:8</span>) though Paul had denied saying that the advent was right at hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αναγκη</span></span> is a strong word (old and common), either for external circumstances or inward sense of duty. It occurs elsewhere for the woes preceding the second coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:23">Luke 21:23</span>) and also for Paul's persecutions (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:7">1 Thessalonians 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:4">2 Corinthians 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:10">2 Corinthians 12:10</span>). Perhaps there is a mingling of both ideas here.</p>
<p><b>Namely </b>. This word is not in the Greek. The infinitive of indirect discourse (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαρχειν</span></span>) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομιζω</span></span> is repeated with recitative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>, "That the being so is good for a man" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ καλον ανθρωπω το ουτως εινα</span></span>). The use of the article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα</span></span> compels this translation. Probably Paul means for one (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπω</span></span>, generic term for man or woman) to remain as he is whether married or unmarried. The copula <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> is not expressed. He uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλον</span></span> (good) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span>. </p>
