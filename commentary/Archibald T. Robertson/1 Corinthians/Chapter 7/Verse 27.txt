<p><b> Art thou bound to a wife? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεδεσα γυναικι;</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεω</span></span>, to bind, with dative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυναικ</span></span>. Marriage bond as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:2">Romans 7:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>Seek not to be loosed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ζητε λυσιν</span></span>). Present active imperative with negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>, "Do not be seeking release" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυσιν</span></span>) from the marriage bond, old word, here only in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Seek not a wife </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ζητε γυναικα</span></span>). Same construction, Do not be seeking a wife. Bachelors as well as widowers are included in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λελυσα</span></span> (loosed, perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυω</span></span>). This advice of Paul he only urges "because of the present necessity" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:26">1 Corinthians 7:26</span>). Whether he held on to this opinion later one does not know. Certainly he gives the noblest view of marriage in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:22-33">Ephesians 5:22-33</span>. Paul does not present it as his opinion for all men at all times. Men feel it their duty to seek a wife. </p>
