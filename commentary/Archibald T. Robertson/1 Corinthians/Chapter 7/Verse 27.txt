 Art thou bound to a wife?  (δεδεσα γυναικι;). Perfect passive indicative of δεω, to bind, with dative case γυναικ. Marriage bond as in Romans 7:2.Seek not to be loosed  (μη ζητε λυσιν). Present active imperative with negative μη, "Do not be seeking release" (λυσιν) from the marriage bond, old word, here only in N.T.Seek not a wife  (μη ζητε γυναικα). Same construction, Do not be seeking a wife. Bachelors as well as widowers are included in λελυσα (loosed, perfect passive indicative of λυω). This advice of Paul he only urges "because of the present necessity" (verse 1 Corinthians 7:26). Whether he held on to this opinion later one does not know. Certainly he gives the noblest view of marriage in Ephesians 5:22-33. Paul does not present it as his opinion for all men at all times. Men feel it their duty to seek a wife.
