<p><b> But and if thou marry </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν δε κα γαμησηις</span></span>). Condition of the third class, undetermined with prospect of being determined, with the ingressive first aorist (late form) active subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span>: "But if thou also commit matrimony or get married," in spite of Paul's advice to the contrary.</p>
<p><b>Thou hast not sinned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ ημαρτες</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτανω</span></span>, to sin, to miss a mark. Here either Paul uses the timeless (gnomic) aorist indicative or by a swift transition he changes the standpoint (proleptic) in the conclusion from the future (in the condition) to the past. Such mixed conditions are common (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1020, 1023). Precisely the same construction occurs with the case of the virgin (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρθενος</span></span>) except that the old form of the first aorist subjunctive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γημη</span></span>) occurs in place of the late <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαμηση</span></span> above. The MSS. interchange both examples. There is no special point in the difference in the forms.</p>
<p><b>Shall have tribulation in the flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιψιν τη σαρκ εξουσιν</span></span>). Emphatic position of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιψιν</span></span> (pressure). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκολοπς τη σαρκ</span></span> (thorn in the flesh).</p>
<p><b>And I would spare you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω δε υμων φειδομα</span></span>). Possibly conative present middle indicative, I am trying to spare you like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγε</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιουσθε</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:4">Galatians 5:4</span>. </p>
