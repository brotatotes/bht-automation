 But and if thou marry  (εαν δε κα γαμησηις). Condition of the third class, undetermined with prospect of being determined, with the ingressive first aorist (late form) active subjunctive with εαν: "But if thou also commit matrimony or get married," in spite of Paul's advice to the contrary.Thou hast not sinned  (ουχ ημαρτες). Second aorist active indicative of αμαρτανω, to sin, to miss a mark. Here either Paul uses the timeless (gnomic) aorist indicative or by a swift transition he changes the standpoint (proleptic) in the conclusion from the future (in the condition) to the past. Such mixed conditions are common (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1020, 1023). Precisely the same construction occurs with the case of the virgin (παρθενος) except that the old form of the first aorist subjunctive (γημη) occurs in place of the late γαμηση above. The MSS. interchange both examples. There is no special point in the difference in the forms.Shall have tribulation in the flesh  (θλιψιν τη σαρκ εξουσιν). Emphatic position of θλιψιν (pressure). See 2 Corinthians 12:7 σκολοπς τη σαρκ (thorn in the flesh).And I would spare you  (εγω δε υμων φειδομα). Possibly conative present middle indicative, I am trying to spare you like αγε in Romans 2:4 and δικαιουσθε in Galatians 5:4.
