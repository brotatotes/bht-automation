<p><b> But this I say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο δε φημ</span></span>. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φημ</span></span> here rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span> (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:8">1 Corinthians 7:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:12">1 Corinthians 7:12</span>). A new turn is here given to the argument about the present necessity.</p>
<p><b>The time is shortened </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο καιρος συνεσταλμενος εστιν</span></span>). Perfect periphrastic passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συστελλω</span></span>, old verb to place together, to draw together. Only twice in the N.T., here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:6">Acts 5:6</span> which see. Found in the papyri for curtailing expenses. Calvin takes it for the shortness of human life, but apparently Paul pictures the foreshortening of time (opportunity) because of the possible nearness of and hope for the second coming. But in Philippians Paul faces death as his fate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:21-26">Philippians 1:21-26</span>), though still looking for the coming of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:20">1 Corinthians 3:20</span>).</p>
<p><b>That henceforth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το λοιπον ινα</span></span>). Proleptic position of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το λοιπον</span></span> before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and in the accusative of general reference and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> has the notion of result rather than purpose (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 997).</p>
<p><b>As though they had none </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως μη εχοντες</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> with the participle for an assumed condition is regular and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> in the <i>Koine</i> is the normal negative of the participle. So the idiom runs on through verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:31">1 Corinthians 7:31</span>. </p>
