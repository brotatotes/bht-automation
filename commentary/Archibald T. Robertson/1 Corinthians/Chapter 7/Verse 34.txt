<p><b> And there is a difference also between the wife and the virgin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μεμεριστα κα η γυνη κα η παρθενος</span></span>). But the text here is very uncertain, almost hopelessly so. Westcott and Hort put <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μεμεριστα</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:33">1 Corinthians 7:33</span> and begin a new sentence with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα η γυνη</span></span> and add <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αγαμος</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η γυνη</span></span>, meaning "the widow and the virgin each is anxious for the things of the Lord" like the unmarried man (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αγαμος</span></span>, bachelor or widow) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:32">1 Corinthians 7:32</span>. Possibly so, but the MSS. vary greatly at every point. At any rate Paul's point is that the married woman is more disposed to care for the things of the world. But, alas, how many unmarried women (virgins and widows) are after the things of the world today and lead a fast and giddy life. </p>
