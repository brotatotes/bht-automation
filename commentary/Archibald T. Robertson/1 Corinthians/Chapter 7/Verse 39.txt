<p><b> For so long time as her husband liveth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφ' οσον χρονον ζη ο ανηρ αυτης</span></span>). While he lives (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω ζωντ ανδρ</span></span>) Paul says in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:2">Romans 7:2</span>. This is the ideal and is pertinent today when husbands meet their ex-wives and wives meet their ex-husbands. There is a screw loose somewhere. Paul here treats as a sort of addendum the remarriage of widows. He will discuss it again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:9-13">1 Timothy 5:9-13</span> and then he will advise younger widows to marry. Paul leaves her free here also to be married again, "only in the Lord" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονον εν Κυριω</span></span>). Every marriage ought to be "in the Lord."</p>
<p><b>To be married </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαμηθηνα</span></span>) is first aorist passive infinitive followed by the dative relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω</span></span> with unexpressed antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτω</span></span>. </p>
