If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> is genuine, it can either be regarded as like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> though without a verb or as loosely added after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μητ</span></span> and construed with it.</p>

First aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχολαζω</span></span>, late verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχολη</span></span>, leisure (our "school"), and so to have leisure (punctiliar act and not permanent) for prayer.
