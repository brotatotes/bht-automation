<p><b> By way of permission </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα συνγνωμην</span></span>). Old word for pardon, concession, indulgence. <i>Secundum indulgentiam</i> (Vulgate). Only here in N.T., though in the papyri for pardon. The word means "knowing together," understanding, agreement, and so concession.</p>
<p><b>Not of commandment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου κατ' επιταγην</span></span>). Late word (in papyri) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτασσω</span></span>, old word to enjoin. Paul has not commanded people to marry. He has left it an open question. </p>
