 By way of permission  (κατα συνγνωμην). Old word for pardon, concession, indulgence. Secundum indulgentiam (Vulgate). Only here in N.T., though in the papyri for pardon. The word means "knowing together," understanding, agreement, and so concession.Not of commandment  (ου κατ' επιταγην). Late word (in papyri) from επιτασσω, old word to enjoin. Paul has not commanded people to marry. He has left it an open question.
