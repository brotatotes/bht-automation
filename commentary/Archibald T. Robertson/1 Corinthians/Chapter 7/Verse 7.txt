<p><b> Yet I would </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω δε</span></span>). "But I wish." Followed by accusative and infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπους εινα</span></span>). This is Paul's personal preference under present conditions (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:26">1 Corinthians 7:26</span>).</p>
<p><b>Even as I myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως κα εμαυτον</span></span>). This clearly means that Paul was not then married and it is confirmed by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:5">1 Corinthians 9:5</span>. Whether he had been married and was now a widower turns on the interpretation of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span> "I cast my vote." If this is taken literally (the obvious way to take it) as a member of the Sanhedrin, Paul was married at that time. There is no way to decide.</p>
<p><b>His own gift from God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιον χαρισμα εκ θεου</span></span>). So each must decide for himself. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρισμα</span></span>, a late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριζομα</span></span>. </p>
