<p><b> To the unmarried and to the widows </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις αγαμοις κα ταις χηραις</span></span>). It is possible that by "the unmarried" (masculine plural) the apostle means only men since widows are added and since virgins receive special treatment later (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:25">1 Corinthians 7:25</span>) and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:32">1 Corinthians 7:32</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αγαμος</span></span> is the unmarried man. It is hardly likely that Paul means only widowers and widows and means to call himself a widower by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως καγω</span></span> (even as I). After discussing marital relations in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:2-7">1 Corinthians 7:2-7</span> he returns to the original question in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span> and repeats his own personal preference as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:7">1 Corinthians 7:7</span>. He does not say that it is <i>better</i> to be unmarried, but only that it is <i>good</i> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλον</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span>) for them to remain unmarried. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αγαμος</span></span> is an old word and in N.T. occurs only in this passage. In verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:11">1 Corinthians 7:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:34">1 Corinthians 7:34</span> it is used of women where the old Greeks would have used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανανδρος</span></span>, without a husband. </p>
