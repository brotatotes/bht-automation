<p><b> Through thy knowledge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη ση γνωσε</span></span>). Literally, in thy knowledge. Surely a poor use to put one's superior knowledge.</p>
<p><b>Perisheth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολλυτα</span></span>). Present middle indicative of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολλυμ</span></span>, to destroy. Ruin follows in the wake of such daredevil knowledge.</p>
<p><b>For whose sake Christ died </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ον Χριστος απεθανεν</span></span>). Just as much as for the enlightened brother with his selfish pride. The accusative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον</span></span>) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι'</span></span> gives the reason, not the agent as with the genitive in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:6">1 Corinthians 8:6</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ου</span></span>). The appeal to the death (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεθανεν</span></span>, second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποθνησκω</span></span>) of Christ is the central fact that clinches Paul's argument. </p>
