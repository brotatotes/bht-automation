 Through thy knowledge  (εν τη ση γνωσε). Literally, in thy knowledge. Surely a poor use to put one's superior knowledge.Perisheth  (απολλυτα). Present middle indicative of the common verb απολλυμ, to destroy. Ruin follows in the wake of such daredevil knowledge.For whose sake Christ died  (δι' ον Χριστος απεθανεν). Just as much as for the enlightened brother with his selfish pride. The accusative (ον) with δι' gives the reason, not the agent as with the genitive in 1 Corinthians 8:6 (δι' ου). The appeal to the death (απεθανεν, second aorist active indicative of αποθνησκω) of Christ is the central fact that clinches Paul's argument.
