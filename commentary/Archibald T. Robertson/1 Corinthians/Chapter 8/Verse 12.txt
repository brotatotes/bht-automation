<p><b> Wounding their conscience </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπτοντες αυτων την συνειδησιν</span></span>). Old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπτω</span></span>, to smite with fist, staff, whip. The conscience is sensitive to a blow like that, a slap in the face.</p>
<p><b>Ye sin against Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Χριστον αμαρτανετε</span></span>). That fact they were overlooking. Jesus had said to Saul that he was persecuting him when he persecuted his disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:5">Acts 9:5</span>). One may wonder if Paul knew the words of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:40">Matthew 25:40</span>, "ye did it unto me." </p>
