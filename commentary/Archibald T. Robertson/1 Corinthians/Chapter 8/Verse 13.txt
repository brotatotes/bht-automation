<p><b> Meat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βρωμα</span></span>). Food it should be, not flesh (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρεα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Maketh my brother to stumble </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκανδαλιζε τον αδελφον μου</span></span>). Late verb (LXX and N.T.) to set a trap-stick (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29">Matthew 5:29</span>) or stumbling-block like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκομμα</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:9">1 Corinthians 8:9</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:13">Romans 14:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:21">Romans 14:21</span>). Small boys sometimes set snares for other boys, not merely for animals to see them caught.</p>
<p><b>I will eat no flesh for evermore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη φαγω κρεα εις τον αιωνα</span></span>). The strong double negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span> with the second aorist subjunctive. Here Paul has</p>
<p><b>flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρεα</span></span>) with direct reference to the flesh offered to idols. Old word, but in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:21">Romans 14:21</span>. This is Paul's principle of love (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:2">1 Corinthians 8:2</span>) applied to the matter of eating meats offered to idols. Paul had rather be a vegetarian than to lead his weak brother to do what he considered sin. There are many questions of casuistry today that can only be handled wisely by Paul's ideal of love. </p>
