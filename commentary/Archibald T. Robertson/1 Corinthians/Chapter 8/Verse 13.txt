 Meat  (βρωμα). Food it should be, not flesh (κρεα).Maketh my brother to stumble  (σκανδαλιζε τον αδελφον μου). Late verb (LXX and N.T.) to set a trap-stick (Matthew 5:29) or stumbling-block like προσκομμα in verse 1 Corinthians 8:9 (cf. Romans 14:13; Romans 14:21). Small boys sometimes set snares for other boys, not merely for animals to see them caught.I will eat no flesh for evermore  (ου μη φαγω κρεα εις τον αιωνα). The strong double negative ου μη with the second aorist subjunctive. Here Paul hasflesh  (κρεα) with direct reference to the flesh offered to idols. Old word, but in N.T. only here and Romans 14:21. This is Paul's principle of love (verse 1 Corinthians 8:2) applied to the matter of eating meats offered to idols. Paul had rather be a vegetarian than to lead his weak brother to do what he considered sin. There are many questions of casuistry today that can only be handled wisely by Paul's ideal of love.
