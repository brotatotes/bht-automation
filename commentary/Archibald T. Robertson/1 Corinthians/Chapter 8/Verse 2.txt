<p><b> Puffeth up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσιο</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσιοω</span></span> (present indicative active). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:6">1 Corinthians 4:6</span>. Pride may be the result, not edification (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδομε</span></span>) which comes from love. Note article (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span>) with both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωσις</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπη</span></span>, making the contrast sharper. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:11">1 Thessalonians 5:11</span> for the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδομεω</span></span>, to build up. Love is the solution, not knowledge, in all social problems.</p>
<p><b>That he knoweth anything </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγνωκενα τ</span></span>). Perfect active infinitive in indirect discourse after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκε</span></span> (condition of first class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span>). So "has acquired knowledge" (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:18">1 Corinthians 3:18</span>), has gone to the bottom of the subject.</p>
<p><b>He knoweth not yet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουπω εγνω</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative, timeless aorist, summary (punctiliar) statement of his ignorance.</p>
<p><b>As he ought to know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως δε γνωνα</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive, ingressive aorist (come to know). Newton's remark that he was only gathering pebbles on the shore of the ocean of truth is pertinent. The really learned man knows his ignorance of what lies beyond. Shallow knowledge is like the depth of the mud hole, not of the crystal spring. </p>
