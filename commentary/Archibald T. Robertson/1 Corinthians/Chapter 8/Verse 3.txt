<p><b> The same is known of him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος εγνωστα υπ' αυτου</span></span>). Loving God (condition of first class again) is the way to come to know God. It is not certain whether <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span> refers to the man who loves God or to God who is loved. Both are true. God knows those that are his (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:19">2 Timothy 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:12">Exodus 33:12</span>). Those who know God are known of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:9">Galatians 4:9</span>). We love God because he first loved us (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:19">1 John 4:19</span>). But here Paul uses both ideas and both verbs. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγνωστα</span></span> is perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, an abiding state of recognition by (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπ'</span></span>) God. No one is acquainted with God who does not love him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:8">1 John 4:8</span>). God sets the seal of his favour on the one who loves him. So much for the principle. </p>
