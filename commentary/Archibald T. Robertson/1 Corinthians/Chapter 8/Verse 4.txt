<p><b> No idol is anything in the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν ειδωλον εν κοσμω</span></span>). Probably correct translation, though no copula is expressed. On <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδωλον</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδος</span></span>), old word, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:41">Acts 7:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:20">Acts 15:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:9">1 Thessalonians 1:9</span>. The idol was a mere picture or symbol of a god. If the god has no existence, the idol is a non-entity. This Gentile Christians had come to know as Jews and Jewish Christians already knew.</p>
<p><b>No God but one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεις θεος ε μη εις</span></span>). This Christians held as firmly as Jews. The worship of Jesus as God's Son and the Holy Spirit does not recognize three Gods, but one God in three Persons. It was the worship of Mary the Mother of Jesus that gave Mahomet his cry: "Allah is One." The cosmos, the ordered universe, can only be ruled by one God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>). </p>
