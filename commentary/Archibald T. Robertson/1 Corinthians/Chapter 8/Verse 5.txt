 For though there be  (κα γαρ ειπερ εισ). Literally, "For even if indeed there are" (a concessive clause, condition of first class, assumed to be true for argument's sake).Called gods  (λεγομενο θεο). So-called gods, reputed gods. Paul denied really the existence of these so-called gods and held that those who worshipped idols (non-entities) in reality worshipped demons or evil spirits, agents of Satan (1 Corinthians 10:19-21).
