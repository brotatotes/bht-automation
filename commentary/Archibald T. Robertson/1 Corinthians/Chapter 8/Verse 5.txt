<p><b> For though there be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα γαρ ειπερ εισ</span></span>). Literally, "For even if indeed there are" (a concessive clause, condition of first class, assumed to be true for argument's sake).</p>
<p><b>Called gods </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγομενο θεο</span></span>). So-called gods, reputed gods. Paul denied really the existence of these so-called gods and held that those who worshipped idols (non-entities) in reality worshipped demons or evil spirits, agents of Satan (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:19-21">1 Corinthians 10:19-21</span>). </p>
