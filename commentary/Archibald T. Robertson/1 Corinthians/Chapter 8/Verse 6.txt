 Yet to us there is one God, the Father  (αλλ' ημιν εις θεος ο πατηρ). B omits αλλ' here, but the sense calls for it anyhow in this apodosis, a strong antithesis to the protasis ( even if at least , κα ειπερ).Of whom  (εξ ου). As the source (εξ) of the universe (τα παντα as in Romans 11:36; Colossians 1:16) and also our goal is God (εις αυτον) as in Romans 11:36 where δι' αυτου is added whereas here δι' ου (through whom) and δι' αυτου (through him) point to Jesus Christ as the intermediate agent in creation as in Colossians 1:15-20; John 1:3. Here Paul calls JesusLord  (Κυριος) and notGod  (θεος), though he does apply that word to him in Romans 9:5; Titus 2:13; Colossians 2:9; Acts 20:28.
