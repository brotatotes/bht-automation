<p><b> Howbeit in all men there is not that knowledge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ουκ εν πασιν η γνωσις</span></span>). The knowledge (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η γνωσις</span></span>) of which Paul is speaking. Knowledge has to overcome inheritance and environment, prejudice, fear, and many other hindrances.</p>
<p><b>Being used until now to the idol </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη συνηθεια εως αρτ του ειδωλου</span></span>). Old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνηθεια</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνηθης</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν, ηθος</span></span>), accustomed to, like Latin <i>consuetudo</i>, intimacy. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:39">John 18:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:16">1 Corinthians 11:16</span>. It is the force of habit that still grips them when they eat such meat. They eat it "as an idol sacrifice" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ειδωλοθυτον</span></span>), though they no longer believe in idols. The idol-taint clings in their minds to this meat.</p>
<p><b>Being weak </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασθενης ουσα</span></span>). "It is defiled, not by the partaking of polluted food, for food cannot pollute (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:18">Mark 7:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:41">Luke 11:41</span>), but by the doing of something which the unenlightened conscience does not allow" (Robertson and Plummer). For this great word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνειδησις</span></span> (conscientia, knowing together, conscience) see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:1">Acts 23:1</span>. It is important in Paul's Epistles, Peter's First Epistle, and Hebrews. Even if unenlightened, one must act according to his conscience, a sensitive gauge to one's spiritual condition. Knowledge breaks down as a guide with the weak or unenlightened conscience. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασθενης</span></span>, weak (lack of strength) see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:41">Matthew 26:41</span>.</p>
<p><b>Defiled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μολυνετα</span></span>). Old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μολυνω</span></span>, to stain, pollute, rare in N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:9">1 Timothy 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:4">Revelation 3:4</span>). </p>
