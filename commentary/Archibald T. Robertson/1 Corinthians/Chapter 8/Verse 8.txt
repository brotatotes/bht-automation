<p><b> Will not commend </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου παραστησε</span></span>). Future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παριστημ</span></span>, old word to present as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:3">Acts 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:22">Luke 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:28">Colossians 1:28</span>. Food (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βρωμα</span></span>) will not give us an entree to God for commendation or condemnation, whether meat-eaters or vegetarians.</p>
<p><b>Are we the worse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υστερουμεθα</span></span>). Are we left behind, do we fall short. Both conditions are of the third class (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη, εαν</span></span>) undetermined.</p>
<p><b>Are we the better </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσευομεθα</span></span>). Do we overflow, do we have excess of credit. Paul here disposes of the pride of knowledge (the enlightened ones) and the pride of prejudice (the unenlightened). Each was disposed to look down upon the other, the one in scorn of the other's ignorance, the other in horror of the other's heresy and daring. </p>
