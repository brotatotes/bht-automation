<p><b> Take heed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπετε</span></span>). A warning to the enlightened.</p>
<p><b>Lest by any means </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πως</span></span>). Common construction after verbs of caution or fearing, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πως</span></span> with aorist subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενητα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>This liberty of yours </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η εξουσια υμων αυτη</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εξουσια</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεστιν</span></span>, means a grant, allowance, authority, power, privilege, right, liberty. It shades off easily. It becomes a battle cry, personal liberty does, to those who wish to indulge their own whims and appetites regardless of the effect upon others.</p>
<p><b>A stumbling-block to the weak </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκομμα τοις ασθενεσιν</span></span>). Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκοπτω</span></span>, to cut against, to stumble against. So an obstacle for the foot to strike. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:13">Romans 14:13</span> Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκανδαλον</span></span> as parallel with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκομμα</span></span>. We do not live alone. This principle applies to all social relations in matters of law, of health, of morals. <i>Noblesse oblige</i>. The enlightened must consider the welfare of the unenlightened, else he does not have love. </p>
