<p><b> Am I not free? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ουκ ειμ ελευθεροσ;</span></span>). Free as a Christian from Mosaic ceremonialism (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:19">1 Corinthians 9:19</span>) as much as any Christian and yet he adapts his moral independence to the principle of considerate love in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:13">1 Corinthians 8:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>Am I not an apostle? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ειμ αποστολοσ;</span></span>). He has the exceptional privileges as an apostle to support from the churches and yet he foregoes these.</p>
<p><b>Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ Ιησουν τον Κυριον ημων εορακα;</span></span>). Proof (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:8">1 Corinthians 15:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:27">Acts 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:9">Acts 18:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17">Acts 22:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:1">2 Corinthians 12:1</span>) that he has the qualification of an apostle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span>) though not one of the twelve. Note strong form of the negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ</span></span> here. All these questions expect an affirmative answer. The perfect active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εορακα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>, to see, does not here have double reduplication as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>. </p>
<p><b> Are not ye? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου υμεις εστε;</span></span>). They were themselves proof of his apostleship. </p>
