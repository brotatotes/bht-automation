 Am I not free?  (Ουκ ειμ ελευθεροσ;). Free as a Christian from Mosaic ceremonialism (cf. 1 Corinthians 9:19) as much as any Christian and yet he adapts his moral independence to the principle of considerate love in 1 Corinthians 8:13.Am I not an apostle?  (ουκ ειμ αποστολοσ;). He has the exceptional privileges as an apostle to support from the churches and yet he foregoes these.Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?  (ουχ Ιησουν τον Κυριον ημων εορακα;). Proof (1 Corinthians 15:8; Acts 9:17; Acts 9:27; Acts 18:9; Acts 22:14; Acts 22:17; 2 Corinthians 12:1) that he has the qualification of an apostle (Acts 1:22) though not one of the twelve. Note strong form of the negative ουχ here. All these questions expect an affirmative answer. The perfect active εορακα from οραω, to see, does not here have double reduplication as in John 1:18.  Are not ye?  (ου υμεις εστε;). They were themselves proof of his apostleship.
