<p><b> He that plougheth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αροτριων</span></span>). Late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αροτριαω</span></span>, to plough, for the old <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αροω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αροτρον</span></span> (plough), in LXX and rare in papyri.</p>
<p><b>In hope of partaking </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ' ελπιδ του μετεχειν</span></span>). The infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλοαιν</span></span> is not repeated nor is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειλε</span></span> though it is understood, "He that thresheth ought to thresh in hope of partaking." He that ploughs hardly refers to the ox at the plough as he that threshes does. The point is that all the workers (beast or man) share in the fruit of the toil. </p>
