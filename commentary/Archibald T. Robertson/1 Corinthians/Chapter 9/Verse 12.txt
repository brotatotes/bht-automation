<p><b> Over you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμων</span></span>). Objective genitive after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσιαν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Do not we yet more? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μαλλον ημεισ;</span></span>). Because of Paul's peculiar relation to that church as founder and apostle.</p>
<p><b>But we bear all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα παντα στεγομεν</span></span>). Old verb to cover (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στεγη</span></span>, roof) and so to cover up, to conceal, to endure (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7">1 Corinthians 13:7</span> of love). Paul deliberately declined to use (usual instrumental case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χραομα</span></span>) his right to pay in Corinth.</p>
<p><b>That we may cause no hindrance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη τινα ενκοπην δωμεν</span></span>). Late word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενκοπη</span></span>, a cutting in (cf. <i>radio</i> or telephone) or hindrance from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενκοπτω</span></span>, to cut in, rare word (like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκοπη</span></span>) here only in N.T. and once in Vettius Valens. How considerate Paul is to avoid "a hindrance to the gospel of Christ" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω ευαγγελιω του Χριστου</span></span>, dative case and genitive) rather than insist on his personal rights and liberties, an eloquent example for all modern men. </p>
