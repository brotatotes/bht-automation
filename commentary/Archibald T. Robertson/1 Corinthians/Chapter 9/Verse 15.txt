<p><b> For it were good for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλον γαρ μο μαλλον αποθανειν η το καυχημα μου ουδεις κενωσε</span></span>). The tangled syntax of this sentence reflects the intensity of Paul's feeling on the subject. He repeats his refusal to use his privileges and rights to a salary by use of the present perfect middle indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεχρημα</span></span>). By the epistolary aorist (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγραψα</span></span>) he explains that he is not now hinting for a change on their part towards him in the matter, "in my case" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εμο</span></span>). Then he gives his reason in vigorous language without a copula (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span>, were): "For good for me to die rather than," but here he changes the construction by a violent anacoluthon. Instead of another infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κενωσα</span></span>) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span> (than) he changes to the future indicative without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>, "No one shall make my glorying void," viz., his independence of help from them. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κενοω</span></span> is an old verb, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κενος</span></span>, empty, only in Paul in N.T.
