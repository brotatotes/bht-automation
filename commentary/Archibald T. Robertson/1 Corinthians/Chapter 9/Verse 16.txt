<p><b> For if I preach </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν γαρ ευαγγελιζωμα</span></span>). Third class condition, supposable case. Same construction in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:16">1 Corinthians 9:16</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>For necessity is laid upon me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγκη γαρ μο επικειτα</span></span>). Old verb, lies upon me (dative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μο</span></span>). Jesus had called him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:6">Acts 9:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:15">Galatians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:14">Romans 1:14</span>). He could do no other and deserves no credit for doing it.</p>
<p><b>Woe is me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουα γαρ μο</span></span>). Explaining the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγκη</span></span> (necessity). Paul had to heed the call of Christ that he had heard. He had a real call to the ministry. Would that this were the case with every modern preacher. </p>
