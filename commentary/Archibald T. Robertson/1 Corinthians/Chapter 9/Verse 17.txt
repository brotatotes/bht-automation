 Of mine own will  (εκων)--not of mine own will  (ακων). Both common adjectives, but only here in N.T. save εκων, also in Romans 8:20. The argument is not wholly clear. Paul's call was so clear that he certainly did his workwillingly  and so had a reward (see on Matthew 6:1 for μισθος); but the onlyreward  that he had for his willing work (Marcus Dods) was to make the gospelfree of expense  (αδαπανον, verse 1 Corinthians 9:18, rare word, here only in N.T., once in inscription at Priene). This was his μισθος. It was glorying (καυχημα, to be able to say so as in Acts 20:33).I have a stewardship intrusted to me  (οικονομιαν πεπιστευμα). Perfect passive indicative with the accusative retained. I have been intrusted with a stewardship and so would go on with my task like any οικονομος (steward) even if ακων (unwilling).
