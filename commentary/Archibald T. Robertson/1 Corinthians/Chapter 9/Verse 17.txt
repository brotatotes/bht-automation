<p><b> Of mine own will </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκων</span></span>)</p>
<p><b>--not of mine own will </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακων</span></span>). Both common adjectives, but only here in N.T. save <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκων</span></span>, also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:20">Romans 8:20</span>. The argument is not wholly clear. Paul's call was so clear that he certainly did his work</p>
<p><b>willingly </b> and so had a reward (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1">Matthew 6:1</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθος</span></span>); but the only</p>
<p><b>reward </b> that he had for his willing work (Marcus Dods) was to make the gospel</p>
<p><b>free of expense </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδαπανον</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:18">1 Corinthians 9:18</span>, rare word, here only in N.T., once in inscription at Priene). This was his <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθος</span></span>. It was glorying (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχημα</span></span>, to be able to say so as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:33">Acts 20:33</span>).</p>
<p><b>I have a stewardship intrusted to me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικονομιαν πεπιστευμα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative with the accusative retained. I have been intrusted with a stewardship and so would go on with my task like any <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικονομος</span></span> (steward) even if <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακων</span></span> (unwilling). </p>
