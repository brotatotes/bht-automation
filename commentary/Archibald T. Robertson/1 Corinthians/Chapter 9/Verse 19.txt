<p><b> I brought myself under bondage </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμαυτον εδουλωσα</span></span>). Voluntary bondage, I enslaved myself to all, though free. Causative verb in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-οω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλοω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span>). The more (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους πλειονας</span></span>). Than he could have done otherwise. Every preacher faces this problem of his personal attitude and conduct.
