<p><b> As a Jew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως Ιουδαιος</span></span>). He was a Jew and was not ashamed of it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:18">Acts 18:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:26">Acts 21:26</span>).</p>
<p><b>Not being myself under the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ων αυτος υπο νομον</span></span>). He was emancipated from the law as a means of salvation, yet he knew how to speak to them because of his former beliefs and life with them (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:21">Galatians 4:21</span>). He knew how to put the gospel to them without compromise and without offence. </p>
