<p><b> I became weak </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενομην ασθενης</span></span>). This is the chief point, the climax in his plea for the principle of love on the part of the enlightened for the benefit of the unenlightened (chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span>). He thus brings home his conduct about renouncing pay for preaching as an illustration of love (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:13">1 Corinthians 8:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>All things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα</span></span>)</p>
<p><b>to all men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις πασιν</span></span>, the whole number)</p>
<p><b>by all means </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντως</span></span>). Pointed play on the word all,</p>
<p><b>that I may save some </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα τινας σωσω</span></span>). This his goal and worth all the cost of adaptation. In matters of principle Paul was adamant as about Titus the Greek (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:5">Galatians 2:5</span>). In matters of expediency as about Timothy (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:3">Acts 16:3</span>) he would go half way to win and to hold. This principle was called for in dealing with the problem of eating meat offered to idols (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:1">Romans 15:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:14">1 Thessalonians 5:14</span>). </p>
