<p><b> That I may be a joint partaker thereof </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα συνκοινωνος αυτου γενωμα</span></span>). Literally, That I may become co-partner with others in the gospel. The point is that he may be able to share the gospel with others, his evangelistic passion. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συνκοινωνος</span></span> is a compound word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span>, together with, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνος</span></span>, partner or sharer). We have two genitives with it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:7">Philippians 1:7</span>, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> and the locative is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>. It is found only in the N.T. and a late papyrus. Paul does not wish to enjoy the gospel just by himself. </p>
