<p><b> That striveth in the games </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αγωνιζομενος</span></span>). Common verb for contest in the athletic games (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγων</span></span>), sometimes with the cognate accusative, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγωνα αγωνιζομα</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:12">1 Timothy 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:7">2 Timothy 4:7</span>. Probably Paul often saw these athletic games.</p>
<p><b>Is temperate in all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα εγκρατευετα</span></span>). Rare verb, once in Aristotle and in a late Christian inscription, and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:9">1 Corinthians 7:9</span> and here, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγκρατης</span></span>, common adjective for one who controls himself. The athlete then and now has to control himself (direct middle) in all things (accusative of general reference). This is stated by Paul as an athletic axiom. Training for ten months was required under the direction of trained judges. Abstinence from wine was required and a rigid diet and regimen of habits. </p>
<p><b> A corruptible crown </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθαρτον στεφανον</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Στεφανος</span></span> (crown) is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στεφω</span></span>, to put around the head, like the Latin <i>corona</i>, wreath or garland, badge of victory in the games. In the Isthmian games it was of pine leaves, earlier of parsley, in the Olympian games of the wild olive. "Yet these were the most coveted honours in the whole Greek world" (Findlay). For the crown of thorns on Christ's head see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:29">Matthew 27:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:17">Mark 15:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:2">John 19:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:5">John 19:5</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διαδημα</span></span> (diadem) was for kings (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:3">Revelation 12:3</span>). Favourite metaphor in N.T., the crown of righteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>), the crown of life (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span>), the crown of glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>), the crown of rejoicing (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span>), description of the Philippians (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:1">Philippians 4:1</span>). Note contrast between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθαρτον</span></span> (verbal adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθειρω</span></span>, to corrupt) like the garland of pine leaves, wild olive, or laurel, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφθαρτον</span></span> (same form with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative) like the crown of victory offered the Christian, the amaranthine (unfading rose) crown of glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>). </p>
