<p><b> So </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως</span></span>). Both with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρεχω</span></span> (run) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυκτευω</span></span> (fight).</p>
<p><b>As not uncertainly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ουκ αδηλως</span></span>). Instead of exhorting them further Paul describes his own conduct as a runner in the race. He explains <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αδηλως</span></span> old adverb, only here in N.T. His objective is clear, with Christ as the goal (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:14">Philippians 3:14</span>). He kept his eye on Christ as Christ watched him.</p>
<p><b>Fight </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυκτευω</span></span>). Paul changes the metaphor from the runner to the boxer. Old verb (only here in N.T.) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυκτης</span></span> (pugilist) and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυγμη</span></span> (fist). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:3">Mark 7:3</span>).</p>
<p><b>As not beating the air </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ουκ αερα δερων</span></span>). A boxer did this when practising without an adversary (cf. doing "the daily dozen") and this was called "shadow-fighting" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκιαμαχια</span></span>). He smote something more solid than air. Probably <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> negatives <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αερα</span></span>, though it still occurs with the participle as a strong and positive negative. </p>
