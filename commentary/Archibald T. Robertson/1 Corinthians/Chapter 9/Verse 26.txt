 So  (ουτως). Both with τρεχω (run) and πυκτευω (fight).As not uncertainly  (ως ουκ αδηλως). Instead of exhorting them further Paul describes his own conduct as a runner in the race. He explains ουτως. Αδηλως old adverb, only here in N.T. His objective is clear, with Christ as the goal (Philippians 3:14). He kept his eye on Christ as Christ watched him.Fight  (πυκτευω). Paul changes the metaphor from the runner to the boxer. Old verb (only here in N.T.) from πυκτης (pugilist) and that from πυγμη (fist). See on Mark 7:3).As not beating the air  (ως ουκ αερα δερων). A boxer did this when practising without an adversary (cf. doing "the daily dozen") and this was called "shadow-fighting" (σκιαμαχια). He smote something more solid than air. Probably ου negatives αερα, though it still occurs with the participle as a strong and positive negative.
