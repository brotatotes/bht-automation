<p><b> But I buffet my body </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα υπωπιαζω μου το σωμα</span></span>). In Aristophanes, Aristotle, Plutarch, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπωπιον</span></span>, and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπς</span></span> (in papyri), the part of the face under the eyes, a blow in the face, to beat black and blue. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:5">Luke 18:5</span> which see. Paul does not, like the Gnostics, consider his <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρξ</span></span> or his <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωμα</span></span> sinful and evil. But "it is like the horses in a chariot race, which must be kept well in hand by whip and rein if the prize is to be secured" (Robertson and Plummer). The boxers often used boxing gloves (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χεστυς</span></span>, of ox-hide bands) which gave telling blows. Paul was not willing for his body to be his master. He found good as the outcome of this self-discipline (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:13">Romans 8:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:23">Colossians 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:5">Colossians 3:5</span>).</p>
<p><b>And bring it into bondage </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα δουλαγωγω</span></span>). Late compound verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλαγωγος</span></span>, in Diodorus Siculus, Epictetus and substantive in papyri. It is the metaphor of the victor leading the vanquished as captive and slave.</p>
<p><b>Lest by any means </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πως</span></span>). Common conjunction for negative purpose with subjunctive as here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενωμα</span></span>, second aorist middle).</p>
<p><b>After that I have preached to others </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλοις κηρυξας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυσσω</span></span> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:23">1 Corinthians 1:23</span>), common verb to preach, from word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυξ</span></span> (herald) and that is probably the idea here. A <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυξ</span></span> at the games announced the rules of the game and called out the competitors. So Paul is not merely a herald, but a competitor also.</p>
<p><b>I myself should be rejected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος αδοκιμος γενωμα</span></span>). Literally, "I myself should become rejected." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αδοκιμος</span></span> is an old adjective used of metals, coin, soil (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:8">Hebrews 6:8</span>) and in a moral sense only by Paul in N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27">1 Corinthians 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:5-7">2 Corinthians 13:5-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:16">Titus 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:8">2 Timothy 3:8</span>). It means not standing the test (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμος</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμαζω</span></span>). Paul means rejected for the</p>
<p><b>prize </b>, not for the entrance to the race. He will fail to win if he breaks the rules of the game (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:22">Matthew 7:22</span>). What is the prize before Paul? Is it that</p>
<p><b>reward </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθος</span></span>) of which he spoke in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:18">1 Corinthians 9:18</span>, his glorying of preaching a free gospel? So Edwards argues. Most writers take Paul to refer to the possibility of his rejection in his personal salvation at the end of the race. He does not claim absolute perfection (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:12">Philippians 3:12</span>) and so he presses on. At the end he has serene confidence (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:7">2 Timothy 4:7</span>) with the race run and won. It is a humbling thought for us all to see this wholesome fear instead of smug complacency in this greatest of all heralds of Christ. </p>
