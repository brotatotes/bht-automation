<p><b> My defence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η εμη απολογια</span></span>). Original sense, not idea of apologizing as we say. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:1">Acts 22:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:16">Acts 25:16</span>. Refers to what precedes and to what follows as illustration of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:13">1 Corinthians 8:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>To them that examine me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις εμε ανακρινουσιν</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:15">1 Corinthians 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:3">1 Corinthians 4:3</span>. The critics in Corinth were "investigating" Paul with sharp eyes to find faults. How often the pastor is under the critic's spy-glass. </p>
