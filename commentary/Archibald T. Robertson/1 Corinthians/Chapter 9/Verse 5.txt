<p><b> Have we no right? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη ουκ εχομεν εξουσιαν;</span></span>). Same idiom.</p>
<p><b>To lead about a wife that is a believer? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδελφην γυναικα περιαγειν;</span></span>). Old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιαγω</span></span>, intransitive in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:11">Acts 13:11</span>. Two substantives in apposition, a sister a wife, a common Greek idiom. This is a plea for the support of the preacher's wife and children. Plainly Paul has no wife at this time.</p>
<p><b>And Cephas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα Κηφας</span></span>). Why is he singled out by name? Perhaps because of his prominence and because of the use of his name in the divisions in Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>). It was well known that Peter was married (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14">Matthew 8:14</span>). Paul mentions James by name in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:19">Galatians 1:19</span> as one of the Lord's brothers. All the other apostles were either married or had the right to be. </p>
