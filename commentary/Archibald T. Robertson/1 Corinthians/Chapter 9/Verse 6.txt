<p><b> Have we not a right to forbear working? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εχομεν εξουσιαν μη εργαζεσθαι;</span></span>). By <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span> (or) Paul puts the other side about Barnabas (the only allusion since the dispute in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:39">Acts 15:39</span>, but in good spirit) and himself. Perhaps (Hofmann) Paul has in mind the fact that in the first great mission tour (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:13">1 Corinthians 9:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:14">1 Corinthians 9:14</span>), Barnabas and Paul received no help from the church in Antioch, but were left to work their way along at their own charges. It was not till the Philippian Church took hold that Paul had financial aid (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:15">Philippians 4:15</span>). Here both negatives have their full force. Literally, Do we not have (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εχομεν</span></span>, expecting the affirmative reply) the right not (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>, negative of the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργαζεσθα</span></span>) to do manual labour (usual meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργαζομα</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:12">1 Corinthians 4:12</span>)?" There was no more compulsion on Paul and Barnabas to support themselves than upon the other workers for Christ. They renounced no rights in being voluntarily independent. </p>
