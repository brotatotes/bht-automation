 What soldier ever serveth?  (τις στρατευετα ποτε;). "Who ever serves as a soldier?" serves in an army (στρατος). Present middle of old verb στρατευω.At his own charges  (ιδιοις οψωνιοις). This late word οψωνιον (from οψον, cooked meat or relish with bread, and ωνεομα, to buy) found in Menander, Polybius, and very common in papyri and inscriptions in the sense of rations or food, then for the soldiers' wages (often provisions) or the pay of any workman. So of the wages of sin (Romans 6:23). Paul uses λαβων οψωνιον (receiving wages, the regular idiom) in 2 Corinthians 11:8. See Moulton and Milligan, Vocabulary; Deissmann, Bible Studies, pp. 148,266; Light from the Ancient East, p. 168. To give proof of his right to receive pay for preaching Paul uses the illustrations of the soldier (verse 1 Corinthians 9:7), the husbandman (verse 1 Corinthians 9:7), the shepherd (verse 1 Corinthians 9:7), the ox treading out the grain (1 Corinthians 9:8), the ploughman (verse 1 Corinthians 9:10), the priests in the temple (1 Corinthians 9:13), proof enough in all conscience, and yet not enough for some churches who even today starve their pastors in the name of piety.Who planteth a vineyard?  (τις φυτευε αμπελωνα;). Αμπελων no earlier than Diodorus, but in LXX and in papyri. Place of vines (αμπελος), meaning of ending -ων.Who feedeth a flock?  (τις ποιμαινε ποιμνην;). Cognate accusative, both old words. Paul likens the pastor to a soldier, vinedresser, shepherd. He contends with the world, he plants churches, he exercises a shepherd's care over them (Vincent).
