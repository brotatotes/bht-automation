<p><b> What soldier ever serveth? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις στρατευετα ποτε;</span></span>). "Who ever serves as a soldier?" serves in an army (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατος</span></span>). Present middle of old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατευω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>At his own charges </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιοις οψωνιοις</span></span>). This late word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψωνιον</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψον</span></span>, cooked meat or relish with bread, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωνεομα</span></span>, to buy) found in Menander, Polybius, and very common in papyri and inscriptions in the sense of rations or food, then for the soldiers' wages (often provisions) or the pay of any workman. So of the wages of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:23">Romans 6:23</span>). Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαβων οψωνιον</span></span> (receiving wages, the regular idiom) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:8">2 Corinthians 11:8</span>. See Moulton and Milligan, <i>Vocabulary</i>; Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, pp. 148,266; <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 168. To give proof of his right to receive pay for preaching Paul uses the illustrations of the soldier (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:7">1 Corinthians 9:7</span>), the husbandman (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:7">1 Corinthians 9:7</span>), the shepherd (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:7">1 Corinthians 9:7</span>), the ox treading out the grain (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:8">1 Corinthians 9:8</span>), the ploughman (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:10">1 Corinthians 9:10</span>), the priests in the temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:13">1 Corinthians 9:13</span>), proof enough in all conscience, and yet not enough for some churches who even today starve their pastors in the name of piety.</p>
<p><b>Who planteth a vineyard? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις φυτευε αμπελωνα;</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αμπελων</span></span> no earlier than Diodorus, but in LXX and in papyri. Place of vines (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμπελος</span></span>), meaning of ending <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ων</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Who feedeth a flock? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις ποιμαινε ποιμνην;</span></span>). Cognate accusative, both old words. Paul likens the pastor to a soldier, vinedresser, shepherd. He contends with the world, he plants churches, he exercises a shepherd's care over them (Vincent). </p>
