<p><b> Do I speak these things after the manner of men? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη κατα ανθρωπον ταυτα λαλω;</span></span>). Negative answer expected. Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα ανθρωπον</span></span> six times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:3">1 Corinthians 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:8">1 Corinthians 9:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:32">1 Corinthians 15:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:11">Galatians 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:15">Galatians 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:5">Romans 3:5</span>). The illustrations from human life are pertinent, but he has some of a higher order, from Scripture.</p>
<p><b>The law also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο νομος</span></span>). Perhaps objection was made that the Scripture does not support the practice of paying preachers. That objection is still made by the stingy. </p>
