<p><b> Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου φιμωσεις βουν αλοωντα</span></span>). Quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+25:4">Deuteronomy 25:4</span>. Prohibition by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> and the volitive future indicative. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φιμοω</span></span>, to muzzle (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιμος</span></span>, a muzzle for dogs and oxen), appears first in Aristophanes (<i>Clouds</i>, 592) and not again till LXX and N.T., though in the papyri also. Evidently a vernacular word, perhaps a slang word. See metaphorical use in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:12">Matthew 22:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:34">Matthew 22:34</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αλοωντα</span></span> is present active participle of the old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλοαω</span></span>, occurs in the N.T. only here (and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:10">1 Corinthians 9:10</span>) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:18">1 Timothy 5:18</span> where it is also quoted. It is probably derived from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλος</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλον</span></span>, a threshing-floor, or the disc of a shield or of the sun and moon. The Egyptians according to the monuments, used oxen to thresh out the grain, sometimes donkeys, by pulling a drag over the grain. The same process may be found today in Andalusia, Italy, Palestine. A hieroglyphic inscription at Eileithyas reads: </p>
<p>"Thresh ye yourselves, O oxen, Measures of grain for yourselves, Measures of grain for your masters." </p>
<p>Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη μελε</span></span> expects the negative answer, impersonal verb with dative and genitive cases (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεο</span></span>, God, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βοων</span></span>, oxen).</p>
<p><b>Altogether </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντως</span></span>). But here probably with the notion of doubtless or assuredly. The editors differ in the verse divisions here. The Canterbury Version puts both these questions in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:10">1 Corinthians 9:10</span>, the American Standard the first in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:9">1 Corinthians 9:9</span>, the second in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:10">1 Corinthians 9:10</span>. </p>
