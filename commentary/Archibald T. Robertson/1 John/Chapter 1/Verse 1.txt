<p><b> That which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span>). Strictly speaking, the neuter relative here is not personal, but the message "concerning the Word of life" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ του λογου της ζωης</span></span>), a phrase that reminds one at once of the Word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογος</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:14">Revelation 19:14</span> (an incidental argument for identity of authorship for all these books). For discussion of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογος</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1-18">John 1:1-18</span>. Here the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογος</span></span> is described by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της ζωης</span></span> (of life), while in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span> he is called <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ζωη</span></span> (the Life) as here in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2">1 John 1:2</span> and as Jesus calls himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25">John 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>), an advance on the phrase here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:14">Revelation 19:14</span> he is termed <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λογος του θεου</span></span> (the Word of God), though in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span> the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογος</span></span> is flatly named <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος</span></span> (God). John does use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> in a collective personal sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:37">John 6:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39">John 6:39</span>. See also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν ο</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>From the beginning </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' αρχης</span></span>). Anarthrous as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:64">John 6:64</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:4">John 16:4</span>. See same phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:7">1 John 2:7</span>. The reference goes beyond the Christian dispensation, beyond the Incarnation, to the eternal purpose of God in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>), "coeval in some sense with creation" (Westcott).</p>
<p><b>That which we have heard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ακηκοαμεν</span></span>). Note fourfold repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> (that which) without connectives (asyndeton). The perfect tense (active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span>) stresses John's equipment to speak on this subject so slowly revealed. It is the literary plural unless John associates the elders of Ephesus with himself (Lightfoot) the men who certified the authenticity of the Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:24">John 21:24</span>).</p>
<p><b>That which we have seen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εωρακαμεν</span></span>). Perfect active, again, of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>, with the same emphasis on the possession of knowledge by John.</p>
<p><b>With our eyes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις οφθαλμοις ημων</span></span>). Instrumental case and showing it was not imagination on John's part, not an optical illusion as the Docetists claimed, for Jesus had an actual human body. He could be heard and seen.</p>
<p><b>That which we beheld </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εθεασαμεθα</span></span>). Repetition with the aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεαομα</span></span> (the very form in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>), "a spectacle which broke on our astonished vision" (D. Smith).</p>
<p><b>Handled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εψηλαφησαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψηλαφαω</span></span>, old and graphic verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψαω</span></span>, to touch), the very verb used by Jesus to prove that he was not a mere spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:39">Luke 24:39</span>). Three senses are here appealed to (hearing, sight, touch) as combining to show the reality of Christ's humanity against the Docetic Gnostics and the qualification of John by experience to speak. But he is also "the Word of life" and so God Incarnate. </p>
