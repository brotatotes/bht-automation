<p><b> If we say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ειπωμεν</span></span>). As in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:6">1 John 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8">1 John 1:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>We have not sinned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ αμαρτηκαμεν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτανω</span></span>. This is a denial of any specific acts of sin, while in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8">1 John 1:8</span> we have the denial of the principle of sin. David Smith observes that the claim to personal perfectionism has two causes, one the stifling of conscience in making God a liar (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψευστην</span></span>, the word used of the devil by Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>), and the other ignorance of God's word, which is not in us, else we should not make such a claim. </p>
