 Was manifested  (εφανερωθη). First aorist passive indicative of φανεροω, to make known what already exists, whether invisible (B. Weiss) or visible, "intellectual or sensible" (Brooke). In Colossians 3:4 Paul employs it of the second coming of Christ. Verse 1 John 1:2 here is an important parenthesis, a mark of John's style as in John 1:15. By the parenthesis John heaps reassurance upon his previous statement of the reality of the Incarnation by the use of εωρακαμεν (as in verse 1 John 1:1) with the assertion of the validity of his "witness" (μαρτυρουμεν) and "message" (απαγγελλομεν), both present active indicatives (literary plurals), απαγγελλω being the public proclamation of the great news (John 16:25).The life, the eternal life  (την ζωην την αιωνιον). Taking up ζωη of verse 1 John 1:1, John defines the term by the adjective αιωνιος, used 71 times in the N.T., 44 times with ζωη and 23 in John's Gospel and Epistles (only so used in these books by John). Here lt means the divine life which the Logos was and is (John 1:4; 1 John 1:1).Which  (ητις). Qualitative relative, "which very life."Was with the Father  (ην προς τον πατερα). Not εγενετο, but ην, and προς with the accusative of intimate fellowship, precisely as in John 1:1 ην προς τον θεον (was with God). Then John closes the parenthesis by repeating εφανερωθη.
