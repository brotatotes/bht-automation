<p><b> Was manifested </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφανερωθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανεροω</span></span>, to make known what already exists, whether invisible (B. Weiss) or visible, "intellectual or sensible" (Brooke). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4">Colossians 3:4</span> Paul employs it of the second coming of Christ. Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2">1 John 1:2</span> here is an important parenthesis, a mark of John's style as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span>. By the parenthesis John heaps reassurance upon his previous statement of the reality of the Incarnation by the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εωρακαμεν</span></span> (as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>) with the assertion of the validity of his "witness" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρουμεν</span></span>) and "message" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαγγελλομεν</span></span>), both present active indicatives (literary plurals), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαγγελλω</span></span> being the public proclamation of the great news (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:25">John 16:25</span>).</p>
<p><b>The life, the eternal life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ζωην την αιωνιον</span></span>). Taking up <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωη</span></span> of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>, John defines the term by the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιωνιος</span></span>, used 71 times in the N.T., 44 times with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωη</span></span> and 23 in John's Gospel and Epistles (only so used in these books by John). Here lt means the divine life which the Logos was and is (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητις</span></span>). Qualitative relative, "which very life."</p>
<p><b>Was with the Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην προς τον πατερα</span></span>). Not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span>, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span>, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> with the accusative of intimate fellowship, precisely as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην προς τον θεον</span></span> (was with God). Then John closes the parenthesis by repeating <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφανερωθη</span></span>. </p>
