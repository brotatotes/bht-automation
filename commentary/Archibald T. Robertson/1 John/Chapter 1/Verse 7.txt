<p><b> If we walk </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν περιπατωμεν</span></span>). Condition of third class also with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and present active subjunctive (keep on walking in the light with God).</p>
<p><b>As he </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως αυτος</span></span>). As God is light (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>) and dwells in light unapproachable (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:16">1 Timothy 6:16</span>).</p>
<p><b>One with another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετ' αλληλων</span></span>). As he has already said in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span>. But we cannot have fellowship with one another unless we have it with God in Christ, and to do that we must walk in the light with God.</p>
<p><b>And the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα το αιμα Ιησου του υιου αυτου καθαριζε ημας απο πασης αμαρτιας</span></span>). This clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> in true Johannine style is coordinate with the preceding one. Walking in the light with God makes possible fellowship with one another and is made possible also by the blood of Jesus (real blood and no mere phantom, atoning blood of the sinless Son of God for our sins). John is not ashamed to use this word. It is not the mere "example" of Jesus that "cleanses" us from sin. It does cleanse the conscience and life and nothing else does (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13">Hebrews 9:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</span>). See in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:9">1 John 1:9</span> both forgiveness and cleansing. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span>. </p>
