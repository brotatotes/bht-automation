<p><b> If we say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ειπωμεν</span></span>). See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:6">1 John 1:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>We have no sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιαν ουκ εχομεν</span></span>). For this phrase see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:41">John 9:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:22">John 15:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:24">John 15:24</span>. That is, we have no personal guilt, no principle of sin. This some of the Gnostics held, since matter was evil and the soul was not contaminated by the sinful flesh, a thin delusion with which so-called Christian scientists delude themselves today.</p>
<p><b>We deceive ourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτους πλανωμεν</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλαναω</span></span>, to lead astray. We do not deceive others who know us. Negative statement again of the same idea, "the truth is not in us." </p>
