 If we confess  (εαν ομολογωμεν). Third-class condition again with εαν and present active subjunctive of ομολογεω, "if we keep on confessing." Confession of sin to God and to one another (James 5:16) is urged throughout the N.T. from John the Baptist (Mark 1:5) on.Faithful  (πιστος). Jesus made confession of sin necessary to forgiveness. It is God's promise and he is "righteous" (δικαιος).To forgive  (ινα αφη). Sub-final clause with ινα and second aorist active subjunctive of αφιημ.And to cleanse  (κα αγιαση). So again with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of καθαριζω (verse 1 John 1:7).
