<p><b> My little children </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνια μου</span></span>). Tender tone with this diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνον</span></span> (child), again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:12">1 John 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:18">1 John 3:18</span>, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδια</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:14">1 John 2:14</span>. John is now an old man and regards his readers as his little children. That attitude is illustrated in the story of his visit to the robber to win him to Christ.</p>
<p><b>That ye may not sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη αμαρτητε</span></span>). Purpose (negative) clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη</span></span> and the second aorist (ingressive, commit sin) active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτανω</span></span>, to sin. John has no patience with professional perfectionists (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8-10">1 John 1:8-10</span>), but he has still less with loose-livers like some of the Gnostics who went to all sorts of excesses without shame.</p>
<p><b>If any man sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν τις αμαρτη</span></span>). Third-class condition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and second aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive again, "if one commit sin."</p>
<p><b>We have </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχομεν</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span> in the apodosis, a present reality like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχομεν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>An advocate </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακλητον</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span> for this word, nowhere else in the N.T. The Holy Spirit is God's Advocate on earth with men, while Christ is man's Advocate with the Father (the idea, but not the word, in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:31-39">Romans 8:31-39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span>). As <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιος</span></span> (righteous) Jesus is qualified to plead our case and to enter the Father's presence (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:18">Hebrews 2:18</span>). </p>
