<p><b> Abideth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενε</span></span>). Present active indicative, continues in the light and so does not interrupt the light by hating his brother.</p>
<p><b>Occasion of stumbling </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκανδαλον</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:41">Matthew 13:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:23">Matthew 16:23</span> for this interesting word. It is a stumbling block or trap either in the way of others (its usual sense), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:7">Matthew 18:7</span>, or in one's own way, as is true of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκοπτω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:9">John 11:9</span> and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:11">1 John 2:11</span> here. But, as Westcott argues, John may very well have the usual meaning here and the other in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:11">1 John 2:11</span>. </p>
