<p><b> I have written </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγραψα</span></span>). Repeated three times. Epistolary aorist referring to this Epistle, not to a previous Epistle. Law (<i>Tests of Life</i>, p. 309) suggests that John was interrupted at the close of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13">1 John 2:13</span> and resumes here in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:14">1 John 2:14</span> with a reference to what he had previously written in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13">1 John 2:13</span>. But that is needless ingenuity. It is quite in John's style to repeat himself with slight variations.</p>
<p><b>The Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον πατερα</span></span>). The heavenly Father as all of God's children should come to know him. He repeats from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13">1 John 2:13</span> what he said to "fathers." To the young men he adds <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυρο</span></span> (strong) and the word of God abiding in them. That is what makes them powerful (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυρο</span></span>) and able to gain the victory over the evil one. </p>
