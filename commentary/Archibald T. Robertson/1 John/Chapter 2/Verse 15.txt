<p><b> Love not the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη αγαπατε τον κοσμον</span></span>). Prohibition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the present active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαω</span></span>, either stop doing it or do not have the habit of doing it. This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοσμος</span></span> is common in John's Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:10">1 John 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+17:14">1 John 17:14</span>) and appears also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:19">1 John 5:19</span>. In epitome the Roman Empire represented it. See it also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:4">James 4:4</span>. It confronts every believer today.</p>
<p><b>If any man love </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν τις αγαπα</span></span>). Third-class condition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαω</span></span> (same form as indicative), "if any keep on loving the world."</p>
<p><b>The love of the Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αγαπη του πατρος</span></span>). Objective genitive, this phrase only here in N.T., with which compare "love of God" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:5">1 John 2:5</span>. In antithesis to love of the world. </p>
