<p><b> All that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν το</span></span>). Collective use of the neuter singular as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span>, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν ο</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:37">John 6:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39">John 6:39</span>. Three examples, not necessarily covering all sins, are given in the nominative in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν το</span></span>. "The lust of the flesh" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η επιθυμια της σαρκος</span></span>, subjective genitive, lust felt by the flesh) may be illustrated by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:19">Mark 4:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:17">Galatians 5:17</span>. So the genitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η επιθυμια των οφθαλμων</span></span> (the lust of the eyes) is subjective, lust with the eyes as organs as shown by Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:28">Matthew 5:28</span>. The use of the "movies" today for gain by lustful exhibitions is a case in point. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλαζονεια</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:16">James 4:16</span>, the only other N.T. example. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αλαζων</span></span> (a boaster) occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:30">Romans 1:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:2">2 Timothy 3:2</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βιος</span></span> (life) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:17">1 John 3:17</span> is the external aspect (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:14">Luke 8:14</span>), not the inward principle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωη</span></span>). David Smith thinks that, as in the case of Eve (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:1-6">Genesis 3:1-6</span>) and the temptations of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:1-11">Matthew 4:1-11</span>), these three sins include all possible sins. But they are all "of the world" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του κοσμου</span></span>) in origin, in no sense "of the Father" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του πατρος</span></span>). The problem for the believer is always how to be in the world and yet not of it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:11">John 17:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:14">John 17:14</span>). </p>
