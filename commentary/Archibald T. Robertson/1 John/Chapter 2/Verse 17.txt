<p><b> Passeth away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραγετα</span></span>). "Is passing by" (linear action, present middle indicative), as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:8">1 John 2:8</span>. There is consolation in this view of the transitoriness of the conflict with the world. Even the lust which belongs to the world passes also. The one who keeps on doing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιων</span></span> present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>) the will of God "abides for ever" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενε εις τον αιωνα</span></span>) "amid the flux of transitory things" (D. Smith). </p>
