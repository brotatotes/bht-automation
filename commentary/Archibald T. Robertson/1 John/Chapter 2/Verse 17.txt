 Passeth away  (παραγετα). "Is passing by" (linear action, present middle indicative), as in verse 1 John 2:8. There is consolation in this view of the transitoriness of the conflict with the world. Even the lust which belongs to the world passes also. The one who keeps on doing (ποιων present active participle of ποιεω) the will of God "abides for ever" (μενε εις τον αιωνα) "amid the flux of transitory things" (D. Smith).
