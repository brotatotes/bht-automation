<p><b> It is the last hour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσχατη ωρα εστιν</span></span>). This phrase only here in N.T., though John often uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωρα</span></span> for a crisis (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:4">John 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:21">John 4:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:23">John 4:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28">John 5:28</span>, etc.). It is anarthrous here and marks the character of the "hour." John has seven times "the last day" in the Gospel. Certainly in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:28">1 John 2:28</span> John makes it plain that the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρουσια</span></span> might come in the life of those then living, but it is not clear that here he definitely asserts it as a fact. It was his hope beyond a doubt. We are left in doubt about this "last hour" whether it covers a period, a series, or the final climax of all just at hand.</p>
<p><b>As ye heard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως ηκουσατε</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Antichrist cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιχριστος ερχετα</span></span>). "Is coming." Present futuristic or prophetic middle indicative retained in indirect assertion. So Jesus taught (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:6">Mark 13:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:22">Mark 13:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:5">Matthew 24:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:15">Matthew 24:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>) and so Paul taught (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:30">Acts 20:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</span>). These false Christs (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:22">Mark 13:22</span>) are necessarily antichrists, for there can be only one. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αντ</span></span> can mean substitution or opposition, but both ideas are identical in the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιχριστος</span></span> (in N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:22">1 John 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:3">1 John 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:7">2 John 1:7</span>). Westcott rightly observes that John's use of the word is determined by the Christian conception, not by the Jewish apocalypses.</p>
<p><b>Have there arisen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγονασιν</span></span>). Second perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Many antichrists </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιχριστο πολλο</span></span>). Not just one, but the exponents of the Gnostic teaching are really antichrists, just as some modern deceivers deserve this title.</p>
<p><b>Whereby </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οθεν</span></span>). By the fact that these many antichrists have come. </p>
