<p><b> From us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ ημων</span></span>)</p>
<p><b>--of us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ ημων</span></span>). The same idiom, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span> and the ablative case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημων</span></span>), but in different senses to correspond with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηλθαν</span></span> (they went out from our membership) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ησαν</span></span> (they were not of us in spirit and life). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span> in the sense of origin see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span>, for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span> in the sense of likeness, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:14">John 17:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>For if they had been of us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε γαρ εξ ημων ησαν</span></span>). Condition of second class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and imperfect tense (no aorist for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>They would have continued </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεμενηκεισαν αν</span></span>). Past perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενω</span></span>, to remain, without augment, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> in apodosis of second-class condition.</p>
<p><b>With us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθ' ημων</span></span>). In fellowship, for which see <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span>. They had lost the inner fellowship and then apparently voluntarily broke the outward.</p>
<p><b>But they went </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ'</span></span>). Ellipsis of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηλθαν</span></span> above, a common habit (ellipse) in John s Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8">1 John 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+9:3">1 John 9:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+13:18">1 John 13:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+15:25">1 John 15:25</span>).</p>
<p><b>That they might be made manifest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα φανερωθωσιν</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανεροω</span></span>, for which verb see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:1">John 21:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4">Colossians 3:4</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:3">2 Corinthians 3:3</span> for the personal construction with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> as here.</p>
<p><b>They all are not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εισιν παντες</span></span>). Not just some, but all, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:21">1 John 2:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:5">1 John 3:5</span>. These antichrists are thus revealed in their true light. </p>
