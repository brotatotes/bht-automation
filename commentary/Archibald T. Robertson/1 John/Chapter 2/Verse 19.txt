 From us  (εξ ημων)--of us  (εξ ημων). The same idiom, εξ and the ablative case (ημων), but in different senses to correspond with εξηλθαν (they went out from our membership) and ουκ ησαν (they were not of us in spirit and life). For εξ in the sense of origin see John 17:15, for εξ in the sense of likeness, John 17:14.For if they had been of us  (ε γαρ εξ ημων ησαν). Condition of second class with ε and imperfect tense (no aorist for ειμ).They would have continued  (μεμενηκεισαν αν). Past perfect of μενω, to remain, without augment, with αν in apodosis of second-class condition.With us  (μεθ' ημων). In fellowship, for which see μετα in 1 John 1:3. They had lost the inner fellowship and then apparently voluntarily broke the outward.But they went  (αλλ'). Ellipsis of the verb εξηλθαν above, a common habit (ellipse) in John s Gospel (1 John 1:8; 1 John 9:3; 1 John 13:18; 1 John 15:25).That they might be made manifest  (ινα φανερωθωσιν). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist passive subjunctive of φανεροω, for which verb see John 21:1; Colossians 3:4. See 2 Corinthians 3:3 for the personal construction with οτ as here.They all are not  (ουκ εισιν παντες). Not just some, but all, as in 1 John 2:21; 1 John 3:5. These antichrists are thus revealed in their true light.
