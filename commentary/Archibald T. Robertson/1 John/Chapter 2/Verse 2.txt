<p><b> And he </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αυτος</span></span>). He himself in his own person, both priest and sacrifice (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>).</p>
<p><b>The propitiation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλασμος</span></span>). Late substantive from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλασκομα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:13">Luke 18:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>), in LXX, Philo, Plutarch, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:10">1 John 4:10</span>. Christ himself is the means of propitiation for (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> concerning) our sins. See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλαστηριον</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:15">Romans 3:15</span>.</p>
<p><b>For the whole world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ ολου του κοσμου</span></span>). It is possible to supply the ellipsis here of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των αμαρτιων</span></span> (the sins of) as we have it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:27">Hebrews 7:27</span>, but a simpler way is just to regard "the whole world" as a mass of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:19">1 John 5:19</span>). At any rate, the propitiation by Christ provides for salvation for all (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>) if they will only be reconciled with God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19-21">2 Corinthians 5:19-21</span>). </p>
