<p><b> Anointing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρισμα</span></span>). Old word for result (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ματ</span></span>) and for the material, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χριω</span></span>, to anoint, perhaps suggested by the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιχριστο</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span>. Christians are "anointed ones," <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χριστο</span></span> in this sense, with which compare <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+105:15">Psalms 105:15</span>: "Touch not my anointed ones" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη αψησθε των χριστων μου</span></span>). These antichrists posed as the equals of or even superior to Christ himself. But followers of Christ do have "the oil of anointing" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ελαιον του χρισματος</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:7">Exodus 29:7</span>), the Holy Spirit. This word in the N.T. only here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:27">1 John 2:27</span>. Later the term was applied to baptism after baptismal remission came to be taught (Tertullian, etc.).</p>
<p><b>From the Holy One </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο του αγιου</span></span>). They receive this anointing of the Holy Spirit from the Anointed One, Jesus Christ (the Holy One). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:69">John 6:69</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:14">Acts 3:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>And ye know all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα οιδατε παντα</span></span>). But the best MSS. read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντες</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα</span></span>, "Ye all know it." This anointing is open to all Christians, not just a select few. </p>
