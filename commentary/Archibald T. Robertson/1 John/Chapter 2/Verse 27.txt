<p><b> And as for you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υμεις</span></span>). Prolepsis again as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:24">1 John 2:24</span>.</p>
<p><b>Which ye received of him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ελαβετε απ' αυτου</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>, a definite experience, this anointing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρισμα</span></span>), from Christ himself as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:20">1 John 2:20</span>. This Paraclete was promised by Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:13">John 16:13</span>) and came on the great Pentecost, as they knew, and in the experience of all who yielded themselves to the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><b>That any one teach you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα τις διδασκη υμας</span></span>). Sub-final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκω</span></span>, "that any one keep on teaching you."</p>
<p><b>Teacheth you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκε υμας</span></span>). Present active indicative. The Holy Spirit was to bring all things to their remembrance (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>) and to bear witness concerning Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:12-15">John 16:12-15</span>). Yet they need to be reminded of what they already know to be "true" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθες</span></span>) and "no lie" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν ψευδος</span></span>), according to John's habit of positive and negative (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>). So he exhorts them to "abide in him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενετε εν αυτω</span></span>, imperative active, though same form as the indicative). Precisely so Jesus had urged that the disciples abide in him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:4">John 15:4</span>). </p>
