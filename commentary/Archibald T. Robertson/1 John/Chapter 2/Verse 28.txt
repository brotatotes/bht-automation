<p><b> And now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα νυν</span></span>). John tenderly repeats the exhortation, "keep on abiding in him."</p>
<p><b>If he shall be manifested </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν φανερωθη</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and first aorist passive subjunctive as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:19">1 John 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:3">Colossians 3:3</span>. A clear reference to the second coming of Christ which may be at any time.</p>
<p><b>That we have boldness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα σχωμεν παρρησιαν</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the ingressive second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>, "that we may get boldness."</p>
<p><b>And not be ashamed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μη αισχυνθωμεν</span></span>). Likewise negative purpose (after John's fashion) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αισχυνω</span></span>, to put to shame.</p>
<p><b>Before him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' αυτου</span></span>). "From him," as if shrinking away from Christ in guilty surprise. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:9">2 Thessalonians 1:9</span> for this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> (from the face of the Lord). </p>
