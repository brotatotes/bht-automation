<p><b> Hereby </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τουτω</span></span>). See this phrase also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:5">1 John 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:16">1 John 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:19">1 John 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24">1 John 3:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:2">1 John 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:13">1 John 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:2">1 John 5:2</span>. That is explained by the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> clause, "if we keep his commandments " (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν τηρωμεν</span></span>, condition of the third class, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> with present active subjunctive, "if we keep on keeping"), the clause itself in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτω</span></span> (locative case).</p>
<p><b>Know we that we know him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινοσκομεν οτ εγνωκαμεν αυτον</span></span>). "Know we that we have come to know and still know him," <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγνωκαμεν</span></span> the perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>. The Gnostics boasted of their superior knowledge of Christ, and John here challenges their boast by an appeal to experimental knowledge of Christ which is shown by keeping his (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span>, Christ's) commandments, thoroughly Johannine phrase (12 times in the Gospel, 6 in this Epistle, 6 in the Apocalypse). </p>
