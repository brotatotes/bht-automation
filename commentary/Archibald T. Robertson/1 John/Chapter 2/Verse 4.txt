<p><b> I know him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγνωκα αυτον</span></span>). Perfect active indicative with recitative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> like quotation marks just before it. This is one of the pious platitudes, cheap claptrap of the Gnostics, who would bob up in meetings with such explosions. John punctures such bubbles with the sharp addition "and keepeth not" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μη τηρων</span></span>, present active linear participle). "The one who keeps on saying: 'I have come to know him,' and keeps on not keeping his commandments is a liar" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψευστης</span></span>, just like Satan, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span> and like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8">1 John 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:10">1 John 1:10</span>), followed by the negative statement as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8">1 John 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:10">1 John 1:10</span>. There is a whip-cracker effect in John's words. </p>
