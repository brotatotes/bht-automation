<p><b> But whoso keepeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος δ' αν τηρη</span></span>). Indefinite relative clause with modal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and the present active subjunctive, "whoever keeps on keeping."</p>
<p><b>Verily </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθως</span></span>). Truly, of a truth. This prize is open to all, not confined to a few initiated Gnostic intellectuals or pneumatics.</p>
<p><b>Hath the love of God been perfected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αγαπη του θεου τετελειωτα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειοω</span></span>, stands completed. Probably objective genitive, our love for God, which is realized in absolute obedience (Brooke).</p>
<p><b>Hereby </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τουτω</span></span>). That is by continuous keeping of Christ's commandments, not by loud talk and loose living. </p>
