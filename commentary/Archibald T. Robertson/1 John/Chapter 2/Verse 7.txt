<p><b> Beloved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπητο</span></span>). First instance of this favourite form of address in these Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:21">1 John 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:7">1 John 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:3">1 John 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:2">1 John 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:5">1 John 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:11">1 John 4:11</span>).</p>
<p><b>No new commandment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εντολην καινην</span></span>). Not novel or new in kind (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινην</span></span> as distinct from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεος</span></span>, new in time, for which distinction see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:33-38">Luke 5:33-38</span>).</p>
<p><b>But an old commandment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' εντολην παλαιαν</span></span>). Ancient as opposed both to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεος</span></span>. The Mosaic law taught love for one's neighbours and Christ taught love even of enemies.</p>
<p><b>Which ye had </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην ειχετε</span></span>). Imperfect active, reaching back to the beginning of their Christian lives (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' αρχης</span></span>). They had heard it expressly from Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34">John 13:34</span>), who, however, calls it "a new commandment." </p>
