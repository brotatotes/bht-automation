<p><b> Again a new commandment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν εντολην καινην</span></span>). Paradox, but truth. Old in teaching (as old as the story of Cain and Abel, 3:11f.), but new in practice. For this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν</span></span> for a new turn see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:28">John 16:28</span>. To walk as Christ walked is to put in practice the old commandment and so make it new (ever new and fresh), as love is as old as man and fresh in every new experience.</p>
<p><b>True in him and in you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθες εν αυτω κα εν υμιν</span></span>). This newness is shown supremely in Christ and in disciples when they walk as Jesus did (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:6">1 John 2:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>Because </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). Explanation of the paradox.</p>
<p><b>Is passing away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραγετα</span></span>). Present middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραγω</span></span>, old verb, to lead by, to go by (intransitive), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:30">Matthew 20:30</span>. Night does pass by even if slowly. See this verb in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:17">1 John 2:17</span> of the world passing by like a procession.</p>
<p><b>True </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθινον</span></span>). Genuine, reliable, no false flicker.</p>
<p><b>Already shineth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη φαινε</span></span>). Linear present active, "is already shining" and the darkness is already passing by. Dawn is here. Is John thinking of the second coming of Christ or of the victory of truth over error, of light over darkness (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:5-9">John 1:5-9</span>), the slow but sure victory of Christ over Satan as shown in the Apocalypse? See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>. </p>
