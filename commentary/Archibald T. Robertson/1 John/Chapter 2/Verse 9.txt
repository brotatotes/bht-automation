<p><b> And hateth his brother </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τον αδελφον αυτου μισων</span></span>). Sharp contrast between the love just described and hate. The only way to walk in the light (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span>) is to have fellowship with God who is light (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>). So the claim to be in the light is nullified by hating a brother.</p>
<p><b>Even until now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως αρτ</span></span>). Up till this moment. In spite of the increasing light and his own boast he is in the dark. </p>
