<p><b> In this </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τουτω</span></span>). As already shown. A life of sin is proof that one is a child of the devil and not of God. This is the line of cleavage that is obvious to all. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:33-39">John 8:33-39</span> for the claim of the Pharisees to be the children of Abraham, whereas their conduct showed them to be children of the devil. This is not a popular note with an age that wishes to remove all distinctions between Christians and the world.</p>
<p><b>Doeth not righteousness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μη ποιων δικαιοσυνην</span></span>). Habit (linear present participle) again of not doing righteousness, as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:7">1 John 3:7</span> of doing it. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιε</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ποιων</span></span> (doing and not doing) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:24">Matthew 7:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:26">Matthew 7:26</span>.</p>
<p><b>Neither </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>). Literally, "and," but with the ellipsis of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν εκ του θεου</span></span> (is not of God). The addition here of this one item about not loving (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη αγαπων</span></span>) one's brother is like Paul's summary in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:9">Romans 13:9</span>, a striking illustration of the general principle just laid down and in accord with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:9-11">1 John 2:9-11</span>. </p>
