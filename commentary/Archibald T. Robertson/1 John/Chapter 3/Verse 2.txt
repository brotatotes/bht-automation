<p><b> Now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν</span></span>). Without waiting for the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρουσια</span></span> or second coming. We have a present dignity and duty, though there is greater glory to come.</p>
<p><b>It is not yet made manifest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουπω εφανερωθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανεροω</span></span>. For the aorist indicative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουπω</span></span> with a future outlook Brooke notes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:2">Mark 11:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:2">1 Corinthians 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:4">Hebrews 12:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:10">Revelation 17:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:12">Revelation 17:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>What we shall be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ εσομεθα</span></span>). Not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινες</span></span> (who), but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span> (what) neuter singular predicate nominative. "This <i>what</i> suggests something unspeakable, contained in the likeness of God" (Bengel).</p>
<p><b>If he shall be manifested </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν φανερωθη</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:28">1 John 2:28</span>, which see. The subject may be Christ as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:9">1 John 3:9</span>, or the future manifestation just mentioned. Either makes sense, probably "it" here better than "he."</p>
<p><b>Like him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιο αυτω</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αυτω</span></span> is associative instrumental case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιο</span></span>. This is our destiny and glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>), to be like Jesus who is like God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>We shall see him even as he is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψομεθα αυτον καθως εστιν</span></span>). Future middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>. The transforming power of this vision of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span>) is the consummation of the glorious process begun at the new birth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>). </p>
