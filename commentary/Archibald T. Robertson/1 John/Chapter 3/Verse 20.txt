 Whereinsoever our heart condemn us  (οτ εαν καταγινωσκη ημων η καρδια). A construction like οτ αν, whatever, in John 2:5; John 14:13. Καταγινωσκω occurs only three times in the N.T., here, verse 1 John 3:21; Galatians 2:11. It means to know something against one, to condemn.Because God is greater than our heart  (οτ μειζων εστιν της καρδιας ημων). Ablative καρδιας after the comparative μειζων.And knoweth all things  (κα γινωσκε παντα). Just so Peter replied to Jesus in spite of his denials (John 21:17). God's omniscience is linked with his love and sympathy. God knows every secret in our hearts. This difficult passage strikes the very centre of Christian truth (Brooke).
