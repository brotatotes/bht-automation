Indefinite relative clause with modal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and the present active subjunctive, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ εαν καταγινωσκη</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:20">1 John 3:20</span>. In form no limitations are placed here save that of complete fellowship with God, which means complete surrender of our will to that of God our Father. See the clear teaching of Jesus on this subject in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:24">Mark 11:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:9">Luke 11:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:12">John 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:23">John 16:23</span> and his example (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:36">Mark 14:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:39">Matthew 26:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:42">Luke 22:42</span>). The answer may not always be in the form that we expect, but it will be better.</p>
<p><b>We receive of him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανομεν απ' αυτου</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' αυτου</span></span> (from him).</p>
<p><b>Because </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). Twofold reason why we receive regularly (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανομεν</span></span>) the answer to our prayers (1) "we keep" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρουμεν</span></span>, for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:3">1 John 2:3</span>) his commandments and (2) "we do" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιουμεν</span></span>, we practise regularly) "the things that are pleasing" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα αρεστα</span></span>, old verbal adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρεσκω</span></span>, to please, with dative in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:29">John 8:29</span> with same phrase; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:3">Acts 12:3</span> and infinitive in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:2">Acts 6:2</span>, only other N.T. examples) "in his sight" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωπιον αυτου</span></span>, common late vernacular preposition in papyri, LXX, and in N.T., except Matthew and Mark, chiefly by Luke and in the Apocalypse), in God's eye, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:21">Hebrews 13:21</span>. </p>
