In form no limitations are placed here save that of complete fellowship with God, which means complete surrender of our will to that of God our Father. See the clear teaching of Jesus on this subject in Mark 11:24; Luke 11:9; John 14:12; John 16:23 and his example (Mark 14:36; Matthew 26:39; Luke 22:42).
