<p><b> His commandment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η εντολη αυτου</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>That </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>). Subfinal use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντολη</span></span> (commandment) and explanatory of it, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:12">John 15:12</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντολη ινα</span></span>). See Christ's summary of the commandments (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:28-31">Mark 12:28-31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:34-40">Matthew 22:34-40</span>). So these two points here (1)</p>
<p><b>We should believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευσωμεν</span></span>, first aorist active subjunctive according to B K L, though Aleph A C read the present subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευωμεν</span></span>) either in a crisis (aorist) or the continuous tenor (present) of our lives. The "name" of Jesus Christ here stands for all that he is, "a compressed creed " (Westcott) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span>. Note dative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονοματ</span></span> here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:10">1 John 5:10</span>, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ονομα</span></span> (on the name) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:13">1 John 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:12">John 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:18">John 3:18</span>. But (2) we should love one another" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπωμεν αλληλους</span></span>), as he has already urged (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:7">1 John 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:11">1 John 3:11</span>) and as he will repeat (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:7">1 John 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:11">1 John 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:5">2 John 1:5</span>) as Jesus (even as he gave us commandment, that is Christ) had previously done (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34">John 13:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:12">John 15:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:17">John 15:17</span>). There are frequent points of contact between this Epistle and the words of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:13-17">1 John 3:13-17</span>. </p>
