<p><b> And he in him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αυτος εν αυτω</span></span>). That is "God abides in him" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:15">1 John 4:15</span>. We abide in God and God abides in us through the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:10">John 14:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:17">John 14:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:23">John 14:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21">John 17:21</span>). "Therefore let God be a home to thee, and be thou the home of God: abide in God, and let God abide in thee" (Bede).</p>
<p><b>By the Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του πνευματος</span></span>). It is thus (by the Holy Spirit, first mention in this Epistle and "Holy" not used with "Spirit" in this Epistle or the Apocalypse) that we know that God abides in us.</p>
<p><b>Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span>). Ablative case by attraction from accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> (object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκεν</span></span>) to agree with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματος</span></span> as often, though not always. It is a pity that the grammatical gender (which) is retained here in the English instead of "whom," as it should be. </p>
