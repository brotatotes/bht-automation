<p><b> Sin is lawlessness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αμαρτια εστιν η ανομια</span></span>). The article with both subject and predicate makes them coextensive and so interchangeable. Doing sin is the converse of doing righteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:29">1 John 2:29</span>). The present active participle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιων</span></span>) means the habit of doing sin. </p>
