<p><b> He </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος</span></span>). As in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>.</p>
<p><b>Was manifested </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφανερωθη</span></span>). Same form as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>, but here of the Incarnation as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:1">John 21:1</span>, not of the second coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:28">1 John 2:28</span>).</p>
<p><b>To take away sins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα τας αμαρτιας αρη</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:11">Isaiah 53:11</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναφερω</span></span> for bearing sins, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρω</span></span> properly means to lift up and carry away (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:16">John 2:16</span>). So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:4">Hebrews 10:4</span> we find <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφαιρεω</span></span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:11">Hebrews 10:11</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιαιρεω</span></span>, to take away sins completely (the complete expiation wrought by Christ on Calvary). The plural <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιας</span></span> here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:14">Colossians 1:14</span>, not singular (collective sense) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιαν</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>.</p>
<p><b>And in him is no sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αμαρτια εν αυτω ουκ εστιν</span></span>). "And sin (the sinful principle) in him is not." As Jesus had claimed about himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:18">John 7:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:46">John 8:46</span>) and as is repeatedly stated in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26">Hebrews 7:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13">Hebrews 9:13</span>). </p>
