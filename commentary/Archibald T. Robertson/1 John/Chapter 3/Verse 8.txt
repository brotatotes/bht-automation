<p><b> He that doeth sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ποιων την αμαρτιαν</span></span>). "He that keeps on doing sin" (the habit of sin).</p>
<p><b>Of the devil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του διαβολου</span></span>). In spiritual parentage as Jesus said of the Pharisees in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>. When one acts like the devil he shows that he is not a true child of God.</p>
<p><b>Sinneth from the beginning </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' αρχης αμαρτανε</span></span>). Linear progressive present active indicative, "he has been sinning from the beginning" of his career as the devil. This is his normal life and those who imitate him become his spiritual children.</p>
<p><b>That he might destroy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα λυση</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυω</span></span>. This purpose (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τουτο</span></span>) Jesus had and has. There is eternal conflict, with final victory over Satan certain. </p>
