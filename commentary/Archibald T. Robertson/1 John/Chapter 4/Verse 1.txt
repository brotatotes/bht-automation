<p><b> Beloved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπητο</span></span>). Three times in this chapter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:7">1 John 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:11">1 John 4:11</span>) we have this tender address on love.</p>
<p><b>Believe not every spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη παντ πνευματ πιστευετε</span></span>). "Stop believing," as some were clearly carried away by the spirits of error rampant among them, both Docetic and Cerinthian Gnostics. Credulity means gullibility and some believers fall easy victims to the latest fads in spiritualistic humbuggery.</p>
<p><b>Prove the spirits </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμαζετε τα πνευματα</span></span>). Put them to the acid test of truth as the metallurgist does his metals. If it stands the test like a coin, it is acceptable (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμος</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:18">2 Corinthians 10:18</span>), otherwise it is rejected (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδοκιμος</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27">1 Corinthians 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:5-7">2 Corinthians 13:5-7</span>).</p>
<p><b>Many false prophets </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλο ψευδοπροφητα</span></span>). Jesus had warned people against them (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:15">Matthew 7:15</span>), even when they as false Christs work portents (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:11">Matthew 24:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:22">Mark 13:22</span>). It is an old story (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:26">Luke 6:26</span>) and recurs again and again (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:6">Acts 13:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:13">Revelation 16:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span>) along with false teachers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>Are gone out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεληλυθασιν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξερχομα</span></span>. Cf. aorist in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:19">1 John 2:19</span>. They are abroad always. </p>
