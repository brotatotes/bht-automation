<p><b> Hereby know we </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τουτω γινωσκομεν</span></span>). The Christian's consciousness of the fact of God dwelling in him is due to the Spirit of God whom God has given (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεδωκεν</span></span>, perfect active indicative here, though the aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκεν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24">1 John 3:24</span>). This gift of God is proof of our fellowship with God. </p>
