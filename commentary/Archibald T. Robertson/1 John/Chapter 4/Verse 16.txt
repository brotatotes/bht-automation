<p><b> We know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγνωκαμεν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative, "we have come to know and still know" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:9">John 6:9</span>, only there order is changed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπιστευκαμεν</span></span> coming before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγνωκαμεν</span></span>). Confession (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογεω</span></span>) follows experimental knowledge (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>) and confident trust (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>). Believers are the sphere (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ημιν</span></span>, in our case) in which the love of God operates (Westcott). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:35">John 13:35</span> for "having love."</p>
<p><b>God is love </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος αγαπη εστιν</span></span>). Repeated from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:8">1 John 4:8</span>. So he gathers up the whole argument that one who is abiding in love is abiding in God and shows that God is abiding in him. Thoroughly Johannine style. </p>
