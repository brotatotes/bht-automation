<p><b> Herein </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τουτω</span></span>). It is not clear whether the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> clause (sub-final use) is in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τουτω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:8">John 15:8</span> or the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> clause (because) with the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> clause as parenthesis. Either makes sense. Westcott argues for the latter idea, which is reinforced by the preceding sentence.</p>
<p><b>With us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθ' ημων</span></span>). Construed with the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετελειωτα</span></span> (is perfected). In contrast to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ημιν</span></span> (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:12">1 John 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:16">1 John 4:16</span>), emphasising cooperation. "God works with man" (Westcott). For boldness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησιαν</span></span>) in the day of judgment (only here with both articles, but often with no articles as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:9">2 Peter 2:9</span>) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:28">1 John 2:28</span>.</p>
<p><b>As he is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως εκεινος εστιν</span></span>). That is Christ as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:6">1 John 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:5">1 John 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:7">1 John 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:16">1 John 3:16</span>. Same tense (present) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:7">1 John 3:7</span>. "Love is a heavenly visitant" (David Smith). We are in this world to manifest Christ. </p>
