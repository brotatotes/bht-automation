 Fear  (φοβος). Like a bond-slave (Romans 8:15), not the reverence of a son (ευλαβεια, Hebrews 5:7) or the obedience to a father (εν φοβω, 1 Peter 1:17). This kind of dread is the opposite of παρρησια (boldness).Perfect love  (η τελεια αγαπη). There is such a thing, perfect because it has been perfected (verses 1 John 4:12; 1 John 4:17). Cf. James 1:4.Casteth out fear  (εξω βαλλε τον φοβον). "Drives fear out" so that it does not exist in real love. See εκβαλλω εξω in John 6:37; John 9:34; John 12:31; John 15:6 to turn out-of-doors, a powerful metaphor. Perfect love harbours no suspicion and no dread (1 John 4:1).Hath punishment  (κολασιν εχε). Old word, in N.T. only here and Matthew 25:46. Τιμωρια has only the idea of penalty, κολασις has also that of discipline, while παιδεια has that of chastisement (Hebrews 12:7). The one who still dreads (φοβουμενος) has not been made perfect in love (ου τετελειωτα). Bengel graphically describes different types of men: "sine timore et amore; cum timore sine amore; cum timore et amore; sine timore cum amore."
