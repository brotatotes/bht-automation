<p><b> He first </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος πρωτος</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτος</span></span> (nominative), not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτον</span></span>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:4">John 20:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:8">John 20:8</span>. God loved us</p>
<p><b>before </b> we loved him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>). Our love is in response to his love for us. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αγαπωμεν</span></span> is indicative (we love), not subjunctive (let us love) of the same form. There is no object expressed here. </p>
