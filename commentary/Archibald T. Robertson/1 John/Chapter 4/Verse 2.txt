 Hereby know ye  (εν τουτω γινωσκετε). Either present active indicative or imperative. The test of "the Spirit of God" (το πνευμα του θεου) here alone in this Epistle, save verse 1 John 4:13. With the clamour of voices then and now this is important. The test (εν τουτω, as in 1 John 3:19) follows.That Jesus Christ is come in the flesh  (Ιησουν Χριστον εν σαρκ εληλυθοτα). The correct text (perfect active participle predicate accusative), not the infinitive (εληλυθενα, B Vg). The predicate participle (see John 9:22 for predicate accusative with ομολογεω) describes Jesus as already come in the flesh (his actual humanity, not a phantom body as the Docetic Gnostics held). See this same idiom in 2 John 1:7 with ερχομενον (coming). A like test is proposed by Paul for confessing the deity of Jesus Christ in 1 Corinthians 12:3 and for the Incarnation and Resurrection of Jesus in Romans 10:6-10.
