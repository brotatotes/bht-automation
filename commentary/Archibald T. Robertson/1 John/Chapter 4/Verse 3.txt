<p><b> Confesseth not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ομολογε</span></span>). Indefinite relative clause with the subjective negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> rather than the usual objective negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:6">1 John 4:6</span>). It is seen also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:9">2 Peter 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:11">Titus 1:11</span>, a survival of the literary construction (Moulton, <i>Prolegomena</i>, p. 171). The Vulgate (along with Irenaeus, Tertullian, Augustine) reads <i>solvit</i> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυε</span></span>) instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ομολογε</span></span>, which means "separates Jesus," apparently an allusion to the Cerinthian heresy (distinction between Jesus and Christ) as the clause before refers to the Docetic heresy. Many MSS. have here also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν σαρκ εληλυθοτα</span></span> repeated from preceding clause, but not A B Vg Cop. and not genuine.</p>
<p><b>The spirit of the antichrist </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το του αντιχριστου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πνευμα</span></span> (spirit) not expressed, but clearly implied by the neuter singular article to. It is a repetition of the point about antichrists made in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18-25">1 John 2:18-25</span>.</p>
<p><b>Whereof </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span>). Accusative of person (grammatical neuter referring to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span>) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span> along with accusative of the thing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ερχετα</span></span>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span>, futuristic present middle indicative). Here the perfect active indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακηκοατε</span></span>), while in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span> the aorist (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσατε</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>And now already </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα νυν ηδη</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span> also (many have come). "The prophecy had found fulfilment before the Church had looked for it" (Westcott). It is often so. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:35">John 4:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:27">John 9:27</span>. </p>
