<p><b> Of the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του κοσμου</span></span>). As Jesus is not and as the disciples are not (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:14">John 17:14</span>).</p>
<p><b>As of the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του κοσμου</span></span>). No "as" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span>), but that is the idea, for their talk proceeds from the world and wins a ready hearing. The false prophets and the world are in perfect unison. </p>
