<p><b> We </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις</span></span>). In sharp contrast with the false prophets and the world. We are in tune with the Infinite God. Hence "he that knoweth God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο γινωσκων τον θεον</span></span>, present active articular participle, the one who keeps on getting acquainted with God, growing in his knowledge of God) "hears us" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουε ημων</span></span>). This is one reason why sermons are dull (some actually are, others so to dull hearers) or inspiring. There is a touch of mysticism here, to be sure, but the heart of Christianity is mysticism (spiritual contact with God in Christ by the Holy Spirit). John states the same idea negatively by a relative clause parallel with the preceding articular participle, the negative with both clauses. John had felt the cold, indifferent, and hostile stare of the worldling as he preached Jesus.</p>
<p><b>By this </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ τουτου</span></span>). "From this," deduction drawn from the preceding; only example in the Epistle for the common <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τουτω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:2">1 John 4:2</span>. The power of recognition (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκομεν</span></span>, we know by personal experience) belongs to all believers (Westcott). There is no reason for Christians being duped by "the spirit of error" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πνευμα της πλανης</span></span>), here alone in the N.T., though we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμασιν πλανοις</span></span> (misleading spirits) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span>. Rejection of the truth may be due also to our not speaking the truth in love (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:15">Ephesians 4:15</span>). </p>
