<p><b> Of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του θεου</span></span>). Even human love comes from God, "a reflection of something in the Divine nature itself" (Brooke). John repeats the old commandment of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:7">1 John 2:7</span>. Persistence in loving (present tense <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπωμεν</span></span> indicative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπων</span></span> participle) is proof that one "has been begotten of God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του θεου γεγεννητα</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:29">1 John 2:29</span>) and is acquainted with God. Otherwise mere claim to loving God accompanied by hating one's brother is a lie (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:9-11">1 John 2:9-11</span>). </p>
