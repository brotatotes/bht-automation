<p><b>God is love </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος αγαπη εστιν</span></span>). Anarthrous predicate, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αγαπη</span></span>. John does not say that love is God, but only that God is love. The two terms are not interchangeable. God is also light (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>) and spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:24">John 4:24</span>). </p>
