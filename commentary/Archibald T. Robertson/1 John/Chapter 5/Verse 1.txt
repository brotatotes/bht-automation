<p><b> That Jesus is the Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ Ιησους εστιν ο Χριστος</span></span>). The Cerinthian antichrist denies the identity of Jesus and Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:22">1 John 2:22</span>). Hence John insists on this form of faith (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευων</span></span> here in the full sense, stronger than in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:23">1 John 3:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:16">1 John 4:16</span>, seen also in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span>, where English and Latin fall down in having to use another word for the verb) as he does in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:5">1 John 5:5</span> and in accord with the purpose of John's Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+20:31">1 John 20:31</span>). Nothing less will satisfy John, not merely intellectual conviction, but full surrender to Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. "The Divine Begetting is the antecedent, not the consequent of the believing" (Law). For "is begotten of God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του θεου γεγεννητα</span></span>) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:29">1 John 2:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:9">1 John 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:7">1 John 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:18">1 John 5:18</span>. John appeals here to family relationship and family love.</p>
<p><b>Him that begat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον γεννησαντα</span></span>). First aorist active articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενναω</span></span>, to beget, the Father (our heavenly Father).</p>
<p><b>Him also that is begotten of him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον γεγεννημενον εξ αυτου</span></span>). Perfect passive articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενναω</span></span>, the brother or sister by the same father. So then we prove our love for the common Father by our conduct towards our brothers and sisters in Christ. </p>
