 Toward him  (προς αυτον). Fellowship with (προς, face to face) Christ. For boldness see 1 John 2:28.That  (οτ). Declarative again, as in verse 1 John 5:11.If we ask anything  (εαν τ αιτωμεθα). Condition of third class with εαν and present middle (indirect) subjunctive (personal interest as in James 4:3, though the point is not to be pressed too far, for see Matthew 20:20; Matthew 20:22; John 16:24; John 16:26).According to his will  (κατα το θελημα αυτου). This is the secret in all prayer, even in the case of Jesus himself. For the phrase see 1 Peter 4:19; Galatians 1:4; Ephesians 1:5; Ephesians 1:11.He heareth us  (ακουε ημων). Even when God does not give us what we ask, in particular then (Hebrews 5:7).
