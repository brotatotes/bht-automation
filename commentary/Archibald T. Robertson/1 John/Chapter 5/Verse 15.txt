 And if we know  (κα εαν οιδαμεν). Condition of first class with εαν (usually ε) and the perfect active indicative, assumed as true. See 1 Thessalonians 3:8; Acts 8:31 for the indicative with εαν as in the papyri. "An amplification of the second limitation" (D. Smith).Whatsoever we ask  (ο εαν αιτωμεθα). Indefinite relative clause with modal εαν (=αν) and the present middle (as for ourselves) subjunctive of αιτεω. This clause, like ημων, is also the object of ακουε.We know that we have  (οιδαμεν οτ εχομεν). Repetition of οιδαμεν, the confidence of possession by anticipation.The petitions  (τα αιτηματα). Old word, from αιτεω, requests, here only in John, elsewhere in N.T. Luke 23:24; Philippians 4:6. We have the answer already as in Mark 11:24.We have asked  (ηιτηκαμεν). Perfect active indicative of αιτεω, the asking abiding.
