<p><b> If any man see </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν τις ιδη</span></span>). Third-class condition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Sinning a sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτανοντα αμαρτιαν</span></span>). Present active predicate (supplementary) participle agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδελφον</span></span> and with cognate accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιαν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Not unto death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη προς θανατον</span></span>). Repeated again with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτανουσιν</span></span> and in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτια προς θανατον</span></span> (sin unto death). Most sins are not mortal sins, but clearly John conceives of a sin that is deadly enough to be called "unto death." This distinction is common in the rabbinic writings and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:22">Numbers 18:22</span> the LXX has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαβειν αμαρτιαν θανατηφορον</span></span> "to incur a death-bearing sin" as many crimes then and now bear the death penalty. There is a distinction in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26">Hebrews 10:26</span> between sinning wilfully after full knowledge and sins of ignorance (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:2">Hebrews 5:2</span>). Jesus spoke of the unpardonable sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:29">Mark 3:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:32">Matthew 12:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:10">Luke 12:10</span>), which was attributing to the devil the manifest work of the Holy Spirit. It is possible that John has this idea in mind when he applies it to those who reject Jesus Christ as God's Son and set themselves up as antichrists.</p>
<p><b>Concerning this </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ εκεινης</span></span>). This sin unto death.</p>
<p><b>That he should make request </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ερωτηση</span></span>). Sub-final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> with the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερωταω</span></span>, used here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:20">John 17:20</span> (and often) for request rather than for question. John does not forbid praying for such cases; he simply does not command prayer for them. He leaves them to God. </p>
