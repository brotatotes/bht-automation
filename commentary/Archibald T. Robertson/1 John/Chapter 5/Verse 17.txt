<p><b> All unrighteousness is sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασα αδικια αμαρτια εστιν</span></span>). Unrighteousness is one manifestation of sin as lawlessness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:4">1 John 3:4</span>) is another (Brooke). The world today takes sin too lightly, even jokingly as a mere animal inheritance. Sin is a terrible reality, but there is no cause for despair. Sin not unto death can be overcome in Christ. </p>
