<p><b> Hereby </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τουτω</span></span>). John's usual phrase for the test of the sincerity of our love. "The love of God and the love of the brethren do in fact include each the other" (Westcott). Each is a test of the other. So put <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:14">1 John 3:14</span> with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:2">1 John 5:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>When </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span>). "Whenever" indefinite temporal clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> and the present active subjunctive (the same form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπωμεν</span></span> as the indicative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> (that) just before, "whenever we keep on loving God."</p>
<p><b>And do </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ποιωμεν</span></span>) "and whenever we keep on doing (present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>) his commandments." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:6">1 John 1:6</span> for "doing the truth." </p>
