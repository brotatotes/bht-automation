<p><b> Is come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκε</span></span>). Present active indicative, but the root has a perfect sense, "has come." See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηλθον κα ηκω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:42">John 8:42</span>.</p>
<p><b>An understanding </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διανοιαν</span></span>). Here alone in John's writings, but in Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:18">Ephesians 4:18</span>) and Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:13">1 Peter 1:13</span>). John does not use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωσις</span></span> (knowledge) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νους</span></span> (mind) only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:18">Revelation 13:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:9">Revelation 17:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>That we know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα γινωσκομεν</span></span>). Result clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the present active indicative, as is common with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the future indicative (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:3">John 7:3</span>). It is possible that here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> was pronounced <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω</span></span> as a subjunctive, but many old MSS. have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα γινωσκουσιν</span></span> (plainly indicative) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>, and in many other places in the N.T. the present indicative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> occurs as a variant reading as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:20">John 5:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>Him that is true </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αληθινον</span></span>). That is, God. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8">1 John 1:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>In him that is true </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω αληθινω</span></span>). In God in contrast with the world "in the evil one" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:19">1 John 5:19</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Even in his Son Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω υιω αυτου Ιησου Χριστω</span></span>). The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> refers clearly to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω αληθινω</span></span> (God). Hence this clause is not in apposition with the preceding, but an explanation as to how we are "in the True One" by being "in his Son Jesus Christ."</p>
<p><b>This </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>). Grammatically <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span> may refer to Jesus Christ or to "the True One." It is a bit tautological to refer it to God, but that is probably correct, God in Christ, at any rate. God is eternal life (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:26">John 5:26</span>) and he gives it to us through Christ. </p>
