 This  (αυτη)--that  (ινα). Explanatory use of ινα with αυτη, as in John 17:3, to show what "the love of God" (1 John 4:9; 1 John 4:12) in the objective sense is, not mere declamatory boasting (1 John 4:20), but obedience to God's commands, "that we keep on keeping (present active subjunctive as in 1 John 2:3) his commandments." This is the supreme test.Are not grievous  (βαρεια ουκ εισιν). "Not heavy," the adjective in Matthew 23:4 with φορτια (burdens), with λυπο (wolves) in Acts 20:29, of Paul's letters in 2 Corinthians 10:10, of the charges against Paul in Acts 25:7. Love for God lightens his commands.
