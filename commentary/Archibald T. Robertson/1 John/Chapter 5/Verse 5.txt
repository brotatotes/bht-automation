<p><b> And who is he that overcometh? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις εστιν δε ο νικων?</span></span>). Not a mere rhetorical question (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:22">1 John 2:22</span>), but an appeal to experience and fact. Note the present active articular participle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νικων</span></span>) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νικα</span></span> (present active indicative in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span>), "the one who keeps on conquering the world." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:57">1 Corinthians 15:57</span> for the same note of victory (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νικος</span></span>) through Christ. See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1">1 John 5:1</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πιστευων</span></span> (the one who believes) as here.</p>
<p><b>Jesus is the Son of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησους εστιν ο υιος του θεου</span></span>). As in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1">1 John 5:1</span> save that here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο υιος του θεου</span></span> in place of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος</span></span> and see both in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:22">1 John 2:22</span>. Here there is sharp antithesis between "Jesus" (humanity) and "the Son of God" (deity) united in the one personality. </p>
