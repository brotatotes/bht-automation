 And who is he that overcometh?  (τις εστιν δε ο νικων?). Not a mere rhetorical question (1 John 2:22), but an appeal to experience and fact. Note the present active articular participle (νικων) like νικα (present active indicative in verse 1 John 5:4), "the one who keeps on conquering the world." See 1 Corinthians 15:57 for the same note of victory (νικος) through Christ. See verse 1 John 5:1 for ο πιστευων (the one who believes) as here.Jesus is the Son of God  (Ιησους εστιν ο υιος του θεου). As in verse 1 John 5:1 save that here ο υιος του θεου in place of Χριστος and see both in 1 John 2:22. Here there is sharp antithesis between "Jesus" (humanity) and "the Son of God" (deity) united in the one personality.
