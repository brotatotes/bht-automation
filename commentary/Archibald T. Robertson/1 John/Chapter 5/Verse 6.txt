<p><b> This </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>). Jesus the Son of God (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:5">1 John 5:5</span>).</p>
<p><b>He that came </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ελθων</span></span>). Second aorist active articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, referring to the Incarnation as a definite historic event, the preexistent Son of God "sent from heaven to do God's will" (Brooke).</p>
<p><b>By water and blood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' υδατος κα αιματος</span></span>). Accompanied by (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> used with the genitive both as instrument and accompaniment, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:13">Galatians 5:13</span>) water (as at the baptism) and blood (as on the Cross). These two incidents in the Incarnation are singled out because at the baptism Jesus was formally set apart to his Messianic work by the coming of the Holy Spirit upon him and by the Father's audible witness, and because at the Cross his work reached its culmination ("It is finished," Jesus said). There are other theories that do not accord with the language and the facts. It is true that at the Cross both water and blood came out of the side of Jesus when pierced by the soldier, as John bore witness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:34">John 19:34</span>), a complete refutation of the Docetic denial of an actual human body for Jesus and of the Cerinthian distinction between Jesus and Christ. There is thus a threefold witness to the fact of the Incarnation, but he repeats the twofold witness before giving the third. The repetition of both preposition (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> this time rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) and the article (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω</span></span> locative case) argues for two separate events with particular emphasis on the blood ("not only" <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ μονον</span></span>, "but" <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ'</span></span>) which the Gnostics made light of or even denied.</p>
<p><b>It is the Spirit that beareth witness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πνευμα εστιν το μαρτυρουν</span></span>). Present active articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρεω</span></span> with article with both subject and predicate, and so interchangeable as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:4">1 John 3:4</span>. The Holy Spirit is the third and the chief witness at the baptism of Jesus and all through his ministry.</p>
<p><b>Because </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). Or declarative "that." Either makes sense. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span> Jesus spoke of "the Spirit of truth" (whose characteristic is truth). Here John identifies the Spirit with truth as Jesus said of himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>) without denying personality for the Holy Spirit. </p>
