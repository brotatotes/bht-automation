<p><b> Peter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πετρος</span></span>). Greek form for the Aramaic (Chaldaic) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χηφας</span></span>, the nickname given Simon by Jesus when he first saw him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:42">John 1:42</span>) and reaffirmed in the Greek form on his great confession (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>), with an allusion to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πετρα</span></span>, another form for a rock, ledge, or cliff. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1">2 Peter 1:1</span> we have both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σιμων</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πετρος</span></span>. Paul in his Epistles always terms himself Paul, not Saul. So Peter uses this name, not Cephas or Simon, because he is writing to Christians scattered over Asia Minor. The nominative absolute occurs here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>, but without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρειν</span></span> as there, the usual form of greeting in letters (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:26">Acts 23:26</span>) so common in the papyri.</p>
<p><b>An apostle of Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολος Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). This is his official title, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1">2 Peter 1:1</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span> is added, which occurs alone in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>. In II and III John we have only <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πρεσβυτερος</span></span> (the elder), as Peter terms himself <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνπρεσβυτερος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:1">1 Peter 5:1</span>. Paul's usage varies greatly: only the names in I and II Thessalonians, the title <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολος</span></span> added and defended in Galatians and Romans as also in I and II Corinthians and Colossians and Ephesians and II Timothy with "by the will of God" added, and in I Timothy with the addition of "according to the command of God." In Philippians Paul has only "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span> (slave) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστου Ιησου</span></span>," like James and Jude. In Romans and Titus Paul has both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολος</span></span>, like II Peter, while in Philemon he uses only <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεσμιος</span></span> (prisoner) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>To the elect </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεκτοις</span></span>). Without article (with the article in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:22">Matthew 24:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>) and dative case, "to elect persons" (viewed as a group). Bigg takes <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεκτοις</span></span> (old, but rare verbal adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεγω</span></span>, to pick out, to select) as an adjective describing the next word, "to elect sojourners." That is possible and is like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενος εκλεκτον</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>. See the distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλητο</span></span> (called) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεκτο</span></span> (chosen) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:14">Matthew 22:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Who are sojourners </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεπιδημοις</span></span>). Late double compound adjective (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα, επιδημουντες</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:10">Acts 2:10</span>, to sojourn by the side of natives), strangers sojourning for a while in a particular place. So in Polybius, papyri, in LXX only twice (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+23:4">Genesis 23:4</span>; 38 or 39 12), in N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:11">1 Peter 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>. The picture in the metaphor here is that heaven is our native country and we are only temporary sojourners here on earth.</p>
<p><b>Of the Dispersion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασπορας</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:35">John 7:35</span> for literal sense of the word for scattered (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασπειρω</span></span>, to scatter abroad, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span>) Jews outside of Palestine, and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span> for the sense here to Jewish Christians, including Gentile Christians (only N T. examples). Note absence of the article, though a definite conception (of the Dispersion). The Christian is a pilgrim on his way to the homeland. These five Roman provinces include what we call Asia Minor north and west of the Taurus mountain range (Hort). Hort suggests that the order here suggests that Silvanus (bearer of the Epistle) was to land in Pontus from the Euxine Sea, proceed through Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, to Bithynia, where he would re-embark for Rome. This, he holds, explains the separation of Pontus and Bithynia, though the same province. Only Galatia and Asia are mentioned elsewhere in the N.T. as having Christian converts, but the N.T. by no means gives a full account of the spread of the Gospel, as can be judged from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>. </p>
