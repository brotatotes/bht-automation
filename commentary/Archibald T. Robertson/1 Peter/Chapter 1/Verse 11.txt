The prophets knew what they prophesied, but not at what time the Messianic prophecies would be fulfilled.</p>
<p><b>The Spirit of Christ which was in them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το εν αυτοις πνευμα Χριστου</span></span>). Peter definitely asserts here that the Spirit of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) was in the Old Testament prophets, the Holy Spirit called the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span>), who spoke to the prophets as he would speak to the apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:14">John 16:14</span>).</p>

Present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προμαρτυρομα</span></span>, a late compound unknown elsewhere save in a writer of the fourteenth century (Theodorus Mech.) and now in a papyrus of the eighth. It is neuter here because <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span> is neuter, but this grammatical gender should not be retained as "it" in English, but should be rendered "he" (and so as to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:15">Acts 8:15</span>). Here we have predictive prophecy concerning the Messiah, though some modern critics fail to find predictions of the Messiah in the Old Testament.</p>
