 Wherefore  (διο). "Because of which thing," the glorious free grace opened for Gentiles and Jews in Christ (verses 1 Peter 1:3-12).Girding up  (αναζωσαμενο). First aorist middle participle of αναζωννυμ, late and rare verb (Judges 18:16; Proverbs 29:35; Proverbs 31:17), here only in N.T., vivid metaphor for habit of the Orientals, who quickly gathered up their loose robes with a girdle when in a hurry or starting on a journey.The loins  (τας οσφυας). Old word for the part of the body where the girdle (ζωνη) was worn. Metaphor here as in Luke 12:35; Ephesians 6:14.Mind  (διανοιας). Old word for the faculty of understanding, of seeing through a thing (δια, νοεω) as in Matthew 22:37.Be sober  (νηφοντες). "Being sober" (present active participle of νηφω, old verb, but in N.T. always as metaphor (1 Thessalonians 5:6; 1 Thessalonians 5:8, etc., and so in 1 Peter 4:7).Perfectly  (τελειως). Adverb, old word (here alone in N.T.), from adjective τελειος (perfect), connected with ελπισατε (set your hope, first aorist active imperative of ελπιζω) in the Revised Version, but Bigg, Hort, and most modern commentators take it according to Peter's usual custom with the preceding verb, νηφοντες ("being perfectly sober," not "hope perfectly").That is to be brought  (την φερομενην). Present passive articular participle of φερω, picturing the process, "that is being brought." For "revelation" (αποκαλυψε) see end of verse 1 Peter 1:7.
