 As children of obedience  (ως τεκνα υπακοης). A common Hebraism (descriptive genitive frequent in LXX and N.T., like υιο της απειθειας, children of disobedience, in Ephesians 2:2) suggested by υπακοην in verse 1 Peter 1:2, "children marked by obedience."Not fashioning yourselves  (μη συνσχηματιζομενο). Usual negative μη with the participle (present direct middle of συνσχηματιζω, a rare (Aristotle, Plutarch) compound (συν, σχηματιζω, from σχημα from εχω), in N.T. only here and Romans 12:2 (the outward pattern in contrast with the inward change μεταμορφοω). See Philippians 2:6 for contrast between σχημα (pattern) and μορφη (form).According to your former lusts  (ταις προτερον επιθυμιαις). Associative instrumental case after συνσχηματιζομενο and the bad sense of επιθυμια as in 1 Peter 4:2; 2 Peter 1:4; James 1:14.In the time of your ignorance  (εν τη αγνοια υμων). "In your ignorance," but in attributive position before "lusts." Αγνοια (from αγνοεω, to be ignorant) is old word, in N.T. only here, Acts 3:17; Acts 17:30; Ephesians 4:18.
