<p><b> But like as he which called you is holy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα κατα τον καλεσαντα υμας αγιον</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> is a regular Greek idiom (here in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνσχηματιζομενο</span></span>). "But according to the holy one calling you or who called you" (first aorist articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλεω</span></span>, to call). God is our standard or pattern (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>), not our lusts.</p>
<p><b>Be ye yourselves also holy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αυτο αγιο γενηθητε</span></span>). First aorist (ingressive) passive imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>, to become with allusion (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> also) to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> (God as our example), "Do ye also become holy." For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστροφη</span></span> (manner of life) see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18">1 Peter 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:12">1 Peter 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:1-16">1 Peter 3:1-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:13">James 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:7">2 Peter 2:7</span>. Peter uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστροφη</span></span> eight times. The original meaning (turning up and down, back and forth) suited the Latin word <i>conversatio</i> (<i>converto</i>), but not our modern "conversation" (talk, not walk). </p>
