 Because it is written  (διοτ γεγραπτα). "Because (διοτ stronger than οτ below) it stands written" (regular formula for O.T. quotation, perfect passive indicative of γραφω). The quotation is from Leviticus 11:44; Leviticus 19:2; Leviticus 20:7. Reenforced by Jesus in Matthew 5:48. The future εσεσθε here is volitive like an imperative.
