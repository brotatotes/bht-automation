 If ye call  (ε επικαλεισθε). Condition of first class and present middle indicative of επικαλεω, to call a name on, to name (Acts 10:18).As Father  (πατερα). Predicate accusative in apposition with τον--κρινοντα.Without respect of persons  (απροσωπολημπτως). Found nowhere else except in the later Ep. of Clem. of Rome and Ep. of Barn., from alpha privative and προσωπολημπτης (Acts 10:34. See James 2:9 for προσωπολημπτεω and 1 Peter 1:1 for προσωπολημψια) from προσωπον λαμβανω (in imitation of the Hebrew).According to each man's work  (κατα το εκαστου εργον). "According to the deed of each one" God judges (κρινοντα) just as Christ judges also (2 Corinthians 5:10).Pass  (αναστραφητε). Second aorist passive imperative of αναστρεφω, metaphorical sense as in 2 Corinthians 1:12; 2 Peter 2:18.The time  (τον χρονον). Accusative case of extent of time.Of your sojourning  (της παροικιας υμων). A late word, found in LXX (Psalms 119:5) and in N.T. only here and Acts 13:17 and in ecclesiastical writers (one late Christian inscription). It comes from παροικεω, old verb, to dwell beside (in one's neighbourhood), and so of pilgrims or strangers (παροικος Acts 7:6) as of Jews away from Palestine or of Christians here on earth, then of a local region (our "parish"). Peter here recurs to 1 Peter 1:1 ("sojourners of the Dispersion").In fear  (εν φοβω). Emphatic position at beginning of the clause with αναστραφητε at the end.
