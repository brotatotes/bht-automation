 But with precious blood  (αλλα τιμιω αιματ). Instrumental case of αιμα after ελυτρωθητε (repeated from verse 1 Peter 1:18). Peter here applies the old adjective τιμιος (from τιμη, of Christ in 1 Peter 2:7) to Christ as in 1 Peter 1:7 πολυτιμοτερον to testing of faith. The blood of anyone is "precious" (costly), far above gold or silver, but that of Jesus immeasurably more so.As of a lamb  (ως αμνου). This word occurs in Leviticus 12:8; Numbers 15:11; Deuteronomy 14:4 of the lamb prescribed for the passover sacrifice (Exodus 12:5). John the Baptist applies it to Jesus (John 1:29; John 1:36). It occurs also in Acts 8:32 quoted from Isaiah 53:7. Undoubtedly both the Baptist and Peter have this passage in mind. Elsewhere in the N.T. αρνιον is used of Christ (Revelation 5:6; Revelation 5:12). Jesus is the Paschal Lamb. Peter sees clearly that it was by the blood of Christ that we are redeemed from sin.Without blemish  (αμωμου). Without (alpha privative) spot (μωμος) as the paschal lamb had to be (Leviticus 22:21). So Hebrews 9:14.Without spot  (ασπιλου). Without (alpha privative) stain (σπιλος spot) as in James 1:27; 2 Peter 3:14; 1 Peter 6:14.Even the blood of Christ  (Χριστου). Genitive case with αιματ, but in unusual position for emphasis and clearness with the participles following.
