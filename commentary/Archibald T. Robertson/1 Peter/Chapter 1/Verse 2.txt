<p><b> According to </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>). Probably to be connected with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεκτοις</span></span> rather than with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολος</span></span> in spite of a rather loose arrangement of words and the absence of articles in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>The foreknowledge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προγνωσιν</span></span>). Late substantive (Plutarch, Lucian, papyri) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προγινωσκω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span>), to know beforehand, only twice in N.T. (here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span> in Peter's sermon). In this Epistle Peter often uses substantives rather than verbs (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>).</p>
<p><b>Of God the Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεου πατρος</span></span>). Anarthous again and genitive case. See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατηρ</span></span> applied to God also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:17">1 Peter 1:17</span> as often by Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span>, etc.). Peter here presents the Trinity (God the Father, the Spirit, Jesus Christ).</p>
<p><b>In sanctification of the Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αγιασμω πνευματος</span></span>). Clearly the Holy Spirit, though anarthrous like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεου πατρος</span></span>. Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιαζω</span></span>, to render holy (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιος</span></span>), to consecrate, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:7">1 Thessalonians 4:7</span>. The subjective genitive here, sanctification wrought by the Spirit as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span> (where the Trinity mentioned as here).</p>
<p><b>Unto obedience </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις υπακοην</span></span>). Obedience (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπακουω</span></span>, to hear under, to hearken) to the Lord Jesus as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22">1 Peter 1:22</span> "to the truth," result of "the sanctification."</p>
<p><b>And sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραντισμον αιματος Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). Late substantive from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραντιζω</span></span>, to sprinkle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13">Hebrews 9:13</span>), a word used in the LXX of the sacrifices (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:9">Numbers 19:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:13">Numbers 19:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:20">Numbers 19:20</span>, etc.), but not in any non-biblical source so far as known, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:24">Hebrews 12:24</span> (of the sprinkling of blood). Reference to the death of Christ on the Cross and to the ratification of the New Covenant by the blood of Christ as given in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:19">Hebrews 9:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:24">Hebrews 12:24</span> with allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:3-8">Exodus 24:3-8</span>. Paul does not mention this ritual use of the blood of Christ, but Jesus does (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:28">Matthew 26:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:24">Mark 14:24</span>). Hence it is not surprising to find the use of it by Peter and the author of Hebrews. Hort suggests that Peter may also have an ulterior reference to the blood of the martyrs as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:14">Revelation 7:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:11">Revelation 12:11</span>, but only as illustration of what Jesus did for us, not as having any value. The whole Epistle is a commentary upon <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προγνωσις θεου, αγιασμος πνευματοσ, αιμα Χριστου</span></span> (Bigg). Peter is not ashamed of the blood of Christ.</p>
<p><b>Be multiplied </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληθυνθειη</span></span>). First aorist passive optative (volitive) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληθυνω</span></span>, old verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληθυς</span></span>, fulness), in a wish. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:2">2 Peter 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:2">Judges 1:2</span>, but nowhere else in N.T. salutations. Grace and peace (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις κα ειρηνη</span></span>) occur together in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:2">2 Peter 1:2</span>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:2">2 John 1:2</span> (with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεος</span></span>), and in all Paul's Epistles (with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεος</span></span> added in I and II Timothy). </p>
