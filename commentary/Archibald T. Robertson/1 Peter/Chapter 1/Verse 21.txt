 Who through him are believers in God  (τους δι' αυτου πιστους εις θεον). Accusative case in apposition with υμας (you), "the through him (that is Christ as in 1 Peter 1:8; Acts 3:16) believers (πιστους correct text of A B) in God."Which raised  (τον εγειραντα). Accusative singular articular (agreeing with θεον) first aorist active participle of εγειρω (cf. δι' αναστασεως Ιησου in verse 1 Peter 1:3).Gave glory to him  (δοξαν αυτω δοντα). Second aorist active participle of διδωμ agreeing also with θεον. See Peter's speech in Acts 3:13 about God glorifying (εδοξασεν) Jesus and also the same idea by Peter in Acts 2:33-36; Acts 5:31.So that your faith and hope might be in God  (ωστε την πιστιν υμων κα ελπιδα εις θεον). Hωστε with the infinitive (εινα) and the accusative of general reference (πιστιν κα ελπιδα) is used in the N.T. as in the Koine for either purpose (Matthew 10:1) or usually result (Mark 4:37). Hence here result (so that is) is more probable than design.
