<p><b> Unto an inheritance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις κληρονομιαν</span></span>). Old word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κληρονομος</span></span>, heir) for the property received by the heir (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:38">Matthew 21:38</span>), here a picture of the blessedness in store for us pilgrims (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:18">Galatians 3:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>Incorruptible </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφθαρτον</span></span>). Old compound adjective (alpha privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθειρω</span></span>, to corrupt), imperishable. So many inheritances vanish away before they are obtained.</p>
<p><b>Undefiled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμιαντον</span></span>). Old verbal adjective (note alliteration) from alpha privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιαινω</span></span>, to defile, without defect or flaw in the title, in N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:27">James 1:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:4">Hebrews 13:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>That fadeth not away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαραντον</span></span>). Alliterative and verbal adjective again from alpha privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαραινω</span></span> (to dry up, to wither, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:11">James 1:11</span>), late and rare word in several inscriptions on tombs, here only in N.T. These inscriptions will fade away, but not this inheritance in Christ. It will not be like a faded rose.</p>
<p><b>Reserved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετηρημενην</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρεω</span></span>, old verb, to take care of, to guard. No burglars or bandits can break through where this inheritance is kept (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19">Matthew 6:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:11">John 17:11</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>, where laid away" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκειμενην</span></span>) occurs.</p>
<p><b>For you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις υμας</span></span>). More graphic than the mere dative. </p>
