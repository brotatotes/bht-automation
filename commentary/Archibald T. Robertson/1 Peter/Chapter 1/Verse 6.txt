 Wherein  (εν ω). This translation refers the relative ω to καιρω, but it is possible to see a reference to Χριστου (verse 1 Peter 1:3) or to θεου (verse 1 Peter 1:5) or even to the entire content of verses 1 Peter 1:3-5. Either makes sense, though possibly καιρω is correct.Ye greatly rejoice  (αγαλλιασθε). Present middle indicative (rather than imperative) of αγαλλιαομα, late verb from αγαλλομα, to rejoice, only in LXX, N.T., and ecclesiastical literature as in Matthew 5:12.Now for a little while  (ολιγον αρτ). Accusative case of time (ολιγον) probably as in Mark 6:31, though it can be used of space (to a small extent) as in Luke 5:3.If need be  (ε δεον). Present active neuter singular participle of δε (it is necessary). Some MSS. have εστιν after δεον (periphrastic construction). Condition of first class.Though ye have been put to grief  (λυπηθεντες). First aorist passive participle (concessive circumstantial use) of λυπεω, to make sorrowful (from λυπη, sorrow), old and common verb. See 2 Corinthians 6:10.In manifold temptations  (εν ποικιλοις πειρασμοις). Just the phrase in James 1:2, which see for discussion. "Trials" clearly right here as there. Seven N.T. writers use ποικιλος (varied).
