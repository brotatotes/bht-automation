 Whom  (ον). Relative referring to Christ just before and accusative case, object of both ιδοντες and αγαπατε (ye love).Not having seen  (ουκ ιδοντες). Second aorist active participle of οραω, to see, with ουκ rather than μη because it negatives an actual experience in contrast with μη ορωντες (though not seeing, hypothetical case).

It is possible that Peter here has in mind the words of Jesus to Thomas as recorded in John 20:29 ("Happy are those not seeing and yet believing"). Peter was present and heard the words of Jesus to Thomas, and so he could use them before John wrote his Gospel.Ye rejoice greatly  (αγαλλιατε). Same form as in verse 1 Peter 1:6, only active here instead of middle.With joy  (χαρα). Instrumental case (manner).Unspeakable  (ανεκλαλητω). Late and rare double compound verbal (alpha privative and εκλαλεω), here only in N.T., in Dioscorides and Heliodorus, "unutterable," like Paul's "indescribable" (ανεκδιηγητος) gift (2 Corinthians 9:15, here alone in N.T.).Full of glory  (δεδοξασμενη). Perfect passive participle of δοξαζω, to glorify, "glorified joy," like the glorified face of Moses (Exodus 34:29; 2 Corinthians 3:10.
