<p><b> Whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον</span></span>). Relative referring to Christ just before and accusative case, object of both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδοντες</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπατε</span></span> (ye love).</p>
<p><b>Not having seen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ιδοντες</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>, to see, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> because it negatives an actual experience in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ορωντες</span></span> (though not seeing, hypothetical case). On whom (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ον</span></span>) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευοντες</span></span> common construction for "believing on" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω εις</span></span>). It is possible that Peter here has in mind the words of Jesus to Thomas as recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:29">John 20:29</span> ("Happy are those not seeing and yet believing"). Peter was present and heard the words of Jesus to Thomas, and so he could use them before John wrote his Gospel.</p>

<p><b>Full of glory </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεδοξασμενη</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαζω</span></span>, to glorify, "glorified joy," like the glorified face of Moses (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:29">Exodus 34:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:10">2 Corinthians 3:10</span>. </p>
