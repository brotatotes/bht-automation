 Honour all men  (παντας τιμησατε). Not with the same honour. Constative use of the aorist imperative.Love the brotherhood  (την αδελφοτητα αγαπατε). Present active imperative of αγαπαω, keep on doing it. Note the abstract αδελφοτης (from αδελφος, brother) in the collective sense, rare save in ecclesiastical literature, though in I Macc. 12:10; IV Macc. 10:3, and in late papyri. It is a word for all Christians.Fear God  (τον θεον φοβεισθε). In both senses of reverence and dread, and keep it up (present middle imperative).Honour the king  (τον βασιλεα τιματε). Keep that up also. A fine motto in this verse.
