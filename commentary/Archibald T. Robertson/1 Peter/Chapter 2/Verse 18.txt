 Servants  (ο οικετα). Note article with the class as with ανδρες (1 Peter 3:7), though not with γυναικες (1 Peter 3:1). Οικετης, old word from οικος (house), means one in the same house with another (Latin domesticus), particularly house servants (slaves) in distinction from the general term δουλος (slave). "Ye domestics." See similar directions to Christian servants (slaves) in Colossians 3:22-25; Ephesians 6:5-7; 1 Timothy 6:1; Titus 2:9. Οικετης in N.T. occurs only here, Luke 16:13; Acts 10:7; Romans 14:4.Be in subjection  (υποτασσομενο). Present middle participle of υποτασσω, common late compound to subject oneself to one (Luke 2:51). Either the participle is here used as an imperative (so in 1 Peter 3:1; 1 Peter 3:7) as in Romans 12:16, or the imperative εστε has to be supplied (Robertson, Grammar, p. 945).To your masters  (τοις δεσποταις). Dative case of δεσποτης, old word for absolute owner in contrast with δουλος. It is used also of God (Luke 2:29; Acts 4:24; Acts 4:29) and of Christ (2 Peter 2:1; Judges 1:4). Κυριος has a wider meaning and not necessarily suggesting absolute power.To the good and gentle  (τοις αγαθοις κα επιεικεσιν). Dative case also with the article with class. For επιεικης see on James 3:17. There were slave-owners (masters) like this as there are housekeepers and employers of workmen today. This is no argument for slavery, but only a sidelight on a condition bad enough at its best.To the froward  (τοις σκολιοις). "To the crooked." Old word, also in Luke 3:5; Acts 2:40; Philippians 2:15. Unfortunately there were slave-holders as there are employers today, like this group. The test of obedience comes precisely toward this group.
