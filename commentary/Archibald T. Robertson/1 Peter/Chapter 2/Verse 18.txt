<p><b> Servants </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο οικετα</span></span>). Note article with the class as with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανδρες</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:7">1 Peter 3:7</span>), though not with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυναικες</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:1">1 Peter 3:1</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Οικετης</span></span>, old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικος</span></span> (house), means one in the same house with another (Latin <i>domesticus</i>), particularly house servants (slaves) in distinction from the general term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span> (slave). "Ye domestics." See similar directions to Christian servants (slaves) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:22-25">Colossians 3:22-25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5-7">Ephesians 6:5-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:1">1 Timothy 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:9">Titus 2:9</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Οικετης</span></span> in N.T. occurs only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:13">Luke 16:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:7">Acts 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:4">Romans 14:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>Be in subjection </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσομενο</span></span>). Present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσω</span></span>, common late compound to subject oneself to one (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:51">Luke 2:51</span>). Either the participle is here used as an imperative (so in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:1">1 Peter 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:7">1 Peter 3:7</span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:16">Romans 12:16</span>, or the imperative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστε</span></span> has to be supplied (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 945).</p>
<p><b>To your masters </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις δεσποταις</span></span>). Dative case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεσποτης</span></span>, old word for absolute owner in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span>. It is used also of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:29">Luke 2:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:24">Acts 4:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:29">Acts 4:29</span>) and of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:4">Judges 1:4</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span> has a wider meaning and not necessarily suggesting absolute power.</p>
<p><b>To the good and gentle </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις αγαθοις κα επιεικεσιν</span></span>). Dative case also with the article with class. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιεικης</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:17">James 3:17</span>. There were slave-owners (masters) like this as there are housekeepers and employers of workmen today. This is no argument for slavery, but only a sidelight on a condition bad enough at its best.</p>
<p><b>To the froward </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις σκολιοις</span></span>). "To the crooked." Old word, also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:5">Luke 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:40">Acts 2:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:15">Philippians 2:15</span>. Unfortunately there were slave-holders as there are employers today, like this group. The test of obedience comes precisely toward this group. </p>
