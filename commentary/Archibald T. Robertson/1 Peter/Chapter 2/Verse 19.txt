 For this is acceptable  (τουτο γαρ χαρις). "For this thing (neuter singular τουτο, obedience to crooked masters) is grace" (χαρις is feminine, here "thanks" as in Romans 7:25). "Acceptable" calls for ευπροσδεκτον (1 Peter 2:5), which is not the text here.If a man endureth griefs  (ε υοφερε τις λυπας). Condition of first class with ε and present active indicative of υποφερω, old verb, to bear up under, in N.T. only here, 1 Corinthians 10:13; 2 Timothy 3:11. Note plural of λυπη (grief).For conscience toward God  (δια συνειδησιν θεου). Suffering is not a blessing in and of itself, but, if one's duty to God is involved (Acts 4:20), then one can meet it with gladness of heart. Θεου (God) is objective genitive. For συνειδησις (conscience) see on Acts 23:1; 1 Corinthians 8:7. It occurs again in 1 Peter 3:16.Suffering wrongfully  (πασχων αδικως). Present active participle of πασχω and the common adverb αδικως, unjustly, here alone in N.T. This is the whole point, made clear already by Jesus in Matthew 5:10-12, where Jesus has also "falsely" (ψευδομενο). See also Luke 6:32-34.
