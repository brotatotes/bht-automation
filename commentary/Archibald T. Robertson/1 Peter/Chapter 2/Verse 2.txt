<p><b> As newborn babes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως αρτιγεννητα βρεφη</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βρεφος</span></span>, old word, originally unborn child (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:41-44">Luke 1:41-44</span>), then infant (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:12">Luke 2:12</span>), here figuratively, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηπιο</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αρτιγεννητα</span></span> is a late and rare compound (Lucian, imperial inscription) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενναω</span></span>, with evident allusion to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγεγεννημενο</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:23">1 Peter 1:23</span>, probably meaning that they were recent converts, possibly slight proof that the Epistle written before Romans by Paul (Kuhl).</p>
<p><b>Long for </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιποθησατε</span></span>). First aorist (constative) active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιποθεω</span></span>, old verb for intense yearning (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:26">Philippians 2:26</span>).</p>
<p><b>The spiritual milk which is without guile </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το λογικον αδολον γαλα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γαλα</span></span> is old word for milk as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:7">1 Corinthians 9:7</span> and as metaphor in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:2">1 Corinthians 3:2</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αδολος</span></span> is an old compound (here alone in N.T.) adjective (alpha privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δολος</span></span> deceit), unadulterated milk which, alas, is so hard to get. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογικον</span></span> is an old adjective in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ικος</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span> (reason, speech), in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>, used here with allusion to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογου</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:23">1 Peter 1:23</span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρημα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:25">1 Peter 1:25</span>), "the sincere milk of the word" ("the milk belonging to the word," either the milk which is the word or the milk contained in the word, that is Christ). So Bigg holds. But in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span> Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογικον</span></span> in the sense of "rational" or "spiritual," and that idea is possible here as Hort holds. In the Pelagia legend (Usener) we have the phrase <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των λογικων προβατων του Χριστου</span></span> (the spiritual or rational sheep of Christ).</p>
<p><b>That ye may grow thereby </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα εν αυτω αυξηθητε</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυξανω</span></span>, old and common verb to grow. See this same metaphor in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:19">Colossians 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:15">Ephesians 4:15</span>. Peter uses the word of God as the food for growth, especially for babes in Christ, not emphasizing the distinction from solid food (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βρωμα</span></span>) made in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:2">1 Corinthians 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:13">Hebrews 5:13</span>. Salvation (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωτηριαν</span></span>) here is final salvation. </p>
