 As newborn babes  (ως αρτιγεννητα βρεφη). Βρεφος, old word, originally unborn child (Luke 1:41-44), then infant (Luke 2:12), here figuratively, like νηπιο. Αρτιγεννητα is a late and rare compound (Lucian, imperial inscription) from αρτ and γενναω, with evident allusion to αναγεγεννημενο in 1 Peter 1:23, probably meaning that they were recent converts, possibly slight proof that the Epistle written before Romans by Paul (Kuhl).Long for  (επιποθησατε). First aorist (constative) active imperative of επιποθεω, old verb for intense yearning (Philippians 2:26).The spiritual milk which is without guile  (το λογικον αδολον γαλα). Γαλα is old word for milk as in 1 Corinthians 9:7 and as metaphor in 1 Corinthians 3:2. Αδολος is an old compound (here alone in N.T.) adjective (alpha privative and δολος deceit), unadulterated milk which, alas, is so hard to get. Λογικον is an old adjective in -ικος, from λογος (reason, speech), in N.T. only here and Romans 12:1, used here with allusion to λογου (1 Peter 1:23) and ρημα (1 Peter 1:25), "the sincere milk of the word" ("the milk belonging to the word," either the milk which is the word or the milk contained in the word, that is Christ). So Bigg holds. But in Romans 12:1 Paul uses λογικον in the sense of "rational" or "spiritual," and that idea is possible here as Hort holds. In the Pelagia legend (Usener) we have the phrase των λογικων προβατων του Χριστου (the spiritual or rational sheep of Christ).That ye may grow thereby  (ινα εν αυτω αυξηθητε). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist passive subjunctive of αυξανω, old and common verb to grow. See this same metaphor in Colossians 2:19; Ephesians 4:15. Peter uses the word of God as the food for growth, especially for babes in Christ, not emphasizing the distinction from solid food (βρωμα) made in 1 Corinthians 3:2; Hebrews 5:13. Salvation (σωτηριαν) here is final salvation.
