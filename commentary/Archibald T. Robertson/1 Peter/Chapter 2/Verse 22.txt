 Who did no sin  (ος αμαρτιαν ουκ εποιησεν). Quotation from Isaiah 53:9. He has already expressed the sinlessness of Christ in 1 Peter 1:19. The next clause is a combination of Isaiah 53:9; Zephaniah 3:13. For "guile" (δολος) see verse 1 Peter 2:1.Was found  (ευρεθη). First aorist passive indicative of ευρισκω. Christ's guilelessness stood the test of scrutiny (Vincent), as Peter knew (Matthew 26:60; John 18:38; John 19:4; John 19:6).
