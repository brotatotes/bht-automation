 When he was reviled  (λοιδορουμενος). Present passive participle of λοιδορεω, old verb (from λοιδορος, reviler, 1 Corinthians 5:11) as in John 9:28.Reviled not again  (ουκ αντελοιδορε). Imperfect active (for repeated incidents) of αντιλοιδορεω, late and rare compound (Plutarch, Lucian, one papyrus example with compound following the simplex verb as here, Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary), here only in N.T. Idiomatic use of αντ (in turn, return, back).Threatened not  (ουκ ηπειλε). Imperfect again (repeated acts) of απειλεω, old compound (from απειλη, threat, Acts 9:1), in N.T. only here and Acts 4:17.But committed himself  (παρεδιδου δε). Imperfect active again (kept on committing himself) of παραδιδωμ, to hand over, usually of one to a judge, but here not of another (as the Sanhedrin), but himself (supply εαυτον), for Jesus uses this very idea in Luke 23:46 as he dies. Jesus thus handed himself and his cause over to the Father who judges righteously (τω κρινοντ δικαιως, dative of present active articular participle of κρινω).
