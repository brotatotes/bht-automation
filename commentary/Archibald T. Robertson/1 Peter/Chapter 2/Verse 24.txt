 Who his own self  (ος αυτος). Intensive pronoun with the relative referring to Christ (note relatives also in verses 1 Peter 2:22; 1 Peter 2:23).Bare our sins  (ανηνεγκεν τας αμαρτιας ημων). Second aorist active indicative of αναφερω, common verb of bringing sacrifice to the altar. Combination here of Isaiah 53:12; Deuteronomy 21:23. Jesus is the perfect sin offering (Hebrews 9:28). For Christ's body (σωμα) as the offering see 1 Corinthians 11:24. "Here St. Peter puts the Cross in the place of the altar" (Bigg).Upon the tree  (επ το ξυλον). Not tree here as in Luke 23:31, originally just wood (1 Corinthians 3:12), then something made of wood, as a gibbet or cross. So used by Peter for the Cross in Acts 5:30; Acts 10:39; and by Paul in Galatians 3:13 (quoting Deuteronomy 21:23).Having died unto sins  (ταις αμαρτιαις απογενομενο). Second aorist middle participle of απογινομα, old compound to get away from, with dative (as here) to die to anything, here only in N.T.That we might live unto righteousness  (ινα τη δικαιοσυνη ζησωμεν). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of ζαω with the dative (cf. Romans 6:20). Peter's idea here is like that of Paul in Romans 6:1-23, especially verses 1 Peter 2:2; 1 Peter 2:10).By whose stripes ye were healed  (ου τω μωλωπ ιαθητε). From Isaiah 53:5. First aorist passive indicative of ιαομα, common verb to heal (James 5:16) and the instrumental case of μωλωπς, rare word (Aristotle, Plutarch) for bruise or bloody wound, here only in N.T. Cf. 1 Peter 1:18. Writing to slaves who may have received such stripes, Peter's word is effective.
