<p><b> For ye were going astray like sheep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητε γαρ ως προβατα πλανωμενο</span></span>). Brought from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:6">Isaiah 53:6</span>, but changed to periphrastic imperfect indicative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητε</span></span> and present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλαναω</span></span>, to wander away. Recall the words of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:4-7">Luke 15:4-7</span>.</p>
<p><b>But are now returned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα επεστραφητε</span></span>). Second aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστρεφω</span></span>, old verb, to turn, to return (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:13">Matthew 10:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>Unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τον ποιμενα κα επισκοπον των ψυχων υμων</span></span>). Jesus called himself the Good Shepherd (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>, and see also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:20">Hebrews 13:20</span>). Here alone is Christ called our "Bishop" (overseer). See both ideas combined in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:11">Ezekiel 34:11</span>. Philo calls God <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Επισχοπος</span></span>. Jesus is also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αποστολος</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>) and he deserves all other titles of dignity that we can give him. </p>
