 If ye have tasted  (ε εγευσασθε). Condition of first class with ε and first aorist middle indicative of γευω in figurative sense as in Hebrews 6:4. "A taste excites the appetite" (Bengel).Gracious  (χρηστος). Quotation from Psalms 34:8. The Hebrew for the LXX χρηστος is simply tobh (good). Plato used the word for food also, and Peter carries out the metaphor in γαλα (milk) as in Luke 5:39.
