<p><b> Ye also as living stones </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αυτο ως λιθο ζωντες</span></span>). Peter applies the metaphor about Christ as the living stone to the readers, "ye yourselves also."</p>
<p><b>Are built up a spiritual house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδομεισθε οικος πνευματικος</span></span>). Present passive indicative second person plural of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδομεω</span></span>, the very verb used by Jesus to Peter in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδομησω</span></span>) of building his church on the rock. If the metaphor of a house of living stones seems "violent" (Vincent), it should be remembered that Jesus employed the figure of a house of believers. Peter just carried it a bit farther and Paul uses a temple for believers in one place (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>) and for the kingdom of God in general (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:22">Ephesians 2:22</span>), as does the author of Hebrews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span>). This "spiritual house" includes believers in the five Roman provinces of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span> and shows clearly how Peter understood the metaphor of Christ in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> to be not a local church, but the church general (the kingdom of Christ).</p>
<p><b>To be a holy priesthood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ιερατευμα αγιον</span></span>). Late word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερατευω</span></span>, to serve as priest, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:8">Luke 1:8</span> alone in N.T.), in LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:6">Exodus 19:6</span>), in N.T. only here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>, either the office of priest (Hort) or an order or body of priests. At any rate, Peter has the same idea of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:6">Revelation 1:6</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερεις</span></span>, priests) that all believers are priests (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span>) and can approach God directly.</p>
<p><b>To offer up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανενεγκα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive (of purpose here) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναφερω</span></span>, the usual word for offering sacrifices (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:27">Hebrews 7:27</span>). Only these are "spiritual" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικας</span></span>) as pictured also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:15">Hebrews 13:15</span>.</p>
<p><b>Acceptable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευπροσδεκτους</span></span>). Late (Plutarch) double compound verbal adjective (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ, προσ, δεχομα</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:2">2 Corinthians 6:2</span>. </p>
