<p><b> It is contained </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεχε</span></span>). Present active (here intransitive, to contain, only N.T. example) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεχω</span></span>, old verb, to surround, transitive in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:9">Luke 5:9</span> to seize (only other N.T. example). The formula with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεχε</span></span> is in Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. XI. 7). This Scripture (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν γραφη</span></span>) is <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span> with some changes. Peter had in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4">1 Peter 2:4</span> already quoted <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεκτον</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντιμον</span></span>. Now note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακρογωνιαιον</span></span> (a chief corner stone), a word apparently invented by Isaiah (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακρος</span></span>, highest, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γωνιαιος</span></span>, Attic word for corner stone). Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span> uses the same word, making Christ the chief corner stone (the only other N.T. example). In Isaiah the metaphor is rather a foundation stone. Peter and Paul make it "the primary foundation stone at the structure" (W. W. Lloyd).</p>
<p><b>On him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ' αυτω</span></span>). That is, "on it" (this corner stone, that is, Christ).</p>
<p><b>Shall not be put to shame </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη καταισχυνθη</span></span>). Strong negatives <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span> with first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταισχυνω</span></span>, old verb, to put to shame (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:5">Romans 5:5</span>). </p>
