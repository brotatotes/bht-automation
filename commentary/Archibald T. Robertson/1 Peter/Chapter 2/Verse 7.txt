 The preciousness  (η τιμη). Or "the honour." Explanation of εντιμον and ου μη καταισχυνθη and only true "for you which believe" (τοις πιστευουσιν ethical dative of articular present active participle of πιστευω to believe).But for such as disbelieve  (απιστουσιν δε). Dative present active participle again of απιστεω, opposite of πιστευω (Luke 24:11).Was made the head of the corner  (εγενηθη εις κεφαλην γωνιας). This verse is from Psalms 118:22 with evident allusion to Isaiah 28:16 (κεφαλην γωνιασ=ακρογωνιαιον). See Matthew 21:42; Mark 12:10; Luke 20:17, where Jesus himself quotes Psalms 118:22 and applies the rejection of the stone by the builders (ο οικοδομουντες, the experts) to the Sanhedrin's conduct toward him. Peter quoted it also (and applied it as Jesus had done) in his speech at the Beautiful Gate (Acts 4:11). Here he quotes it again to the same purpose.
