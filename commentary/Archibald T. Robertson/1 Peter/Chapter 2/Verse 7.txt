<p><b>Was made the head of the corner </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενηθη εις κεφαλην γωνιας</span></span>). This verse is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span> with evident allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφαλην γωνιασ=ακρογωνιαιον</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:10">Mark 12:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:17">Luke 20:17</span>, where Jesus himself quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span> and applies the rejection of the stone by the builders (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο οικοδομουντες</span></span>, the experts) to the Sanhedrin's conduct toward him.

Here he quotes it again to the same purpose. </p>
