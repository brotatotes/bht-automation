<p><b> And </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>). Peter now quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:14">Isaiah 8:14</span> and gives a new turn to the previous quotation. To the disbelieving, Christ was indeed "a stone of stumbling (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθος προσκομματος</span></span>) and rock of offence (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πετρα σκανδαλου</span></span>)," quoted also by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:32">Romans 9:32</span>, which see for discussion. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προσκομμα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκοπτω</span></span>, to cut against) is an obstacle against which one strikes by accident, while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκανδαλον</span></span> is a trap set to trip one, but both make one fall. Too much distinction need not be made between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθος</span></span> (a loose stone in the path) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πετρα</span></span> (a ledge rising out of the ground).</p>
<p><b>For they </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span>). Causal use of the relative pronoun.</p>
<p><b>Stumble at the word, being disobedient </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκοπτουσιν τω λογω απειθουντες</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκοπτω</span></span> with dative case, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογω</span></span>, and present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απειθεω</span></span> (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιστουσιν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:7">1 Peter 2:7</span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:1">1 Peter 3:1</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τω λογω</span></span> can be construed with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απειθουντες</span></span> (stumble, being disobedient to the word).</p>
<p><b>Whereunto also they were appointed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ο κα ετεθησαν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>. See this idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:7">1 Timothy 2:7</span>. "Their disobedience is not ordained, the penalty of their disobedience is" (Bigg). They rebelled against God and paid the penalty. </p>
