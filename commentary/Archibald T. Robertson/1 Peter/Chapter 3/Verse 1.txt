<p><b> In like manner </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιως</span></span>). Adverb closely connected with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσομενο</span></span>, for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18">1 Peter 2:18</span>.</p>
<p><b>Ye wives </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυναικες</span></span>). Without article. About wives see also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:18">Colossians 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:22">Ephesians 5:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:4">Titus 2:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>To your own husbands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις ιδιοις ανδρασιν</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιδιοις</span></span> occurs also in Ephesians and Titus, but not in Colossians. It strengthens the idea of possession in the article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις</span></span>. Wives are not enjoined to be in subjection to the husbands of other women, as some think it fine to be (affinities!)</p>
<p><b>Even if any obey not the word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ε τινες απειθουσιν τω λογω</span></span>). Condition of first class and dative case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:23">1 Peter 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:25">1 Peter 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:8">1 Peter 2:8</span>), that is, remain heathen.</p>
<p><b>That they be gained </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα κερδηθησοντα</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and first future passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδαινω</span></span>, old verb, to gain (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδος</span></span>, gain, interest) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:15">Matthew 18:15</span>. See the future with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:10">Luke 20:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>Without the word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανευ λογου</span></span>). Probably here "word from their wives" (Hart), the other sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span> (talk, not technical "word of God").</p>
<p><b>By the behaviour of their wives </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια της των γυναικων αναστροφης</span></span>). Won by pious living, not by nagging. Many a wife has had this blessed victory of grace. </p>
