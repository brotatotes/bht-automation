 In like manner  (ομοιως). Adverb closely connected with υποτασσομενο, for which see 1 Peter 2:18.Ye wives  (γυναικες). Without article. About wives see also Colossians 3:18; Ephesians 5:22; Titus 2:4.To your own husbands  (τοις ιδιοις ανδρασιν). Ιδιοις occurs also in Ephesians and Titus, but not in Colossians. It strengthens the idea of possession in the article τοις. Wives are not enjoined to be in subjection to the husbands of other women, as some think it fine to be (affinities!)Even if any obey not the word  (κα ε τινες απειθουσιν τω λογω). Condition of first class and dative case of λογος (1 Peter 1:23; 1 Peter 1:25; 1 Peter 2:8), that is, remain heathen.That they be gained  (ινα κερδηθησοντα). Purpose clause with ινα and first future passive indicative of κερδαινω, old verb, to gain (from κερδος, gain, interest) as in Matthew 18:15. See the future with ινα also in Luke 20:10; Revelation 3:9.Without the word  (ανευ λογου). Probably here "word from their wives" (Hart), the other sense of λογος (talk, not technical "word of God").By the behaviour of their wives  (δια της των γυναικων αναστροφης). Won by pious living, not by nagging. Many a wife has had this blessed victory of grace.
