 Let him turn away  (εκκλινατω). First aorist active imperative third person singular of εκκλινω, where the LXX has εκκλινον (second person singular). Old verb, in N.T. only here, Romans 3:12; Romans 16:17. Peter adapted the passage all through to his own construction and use. So as to ποιησατω (let him do) for ποιησον (do thou), ζητησατω (let him seek) for ζητησον (do thou seek), διωξατω (let him pursue) for διωξον (do thou pursue), all first aorist active imperatives (of ποιεω, ζητεω, διωκω). See Hebrews 12:14 for "pursuing peace." If men only did!
