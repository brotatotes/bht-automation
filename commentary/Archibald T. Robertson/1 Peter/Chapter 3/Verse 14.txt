 But and if ye should suffer  (αλλ' ε κα πασχοιτε). "But if ye should also (or even) suffer." Condition of the fourth class with ε and the optative (undetermined with less likelihood), a rare condition in the vernacular Koine, since the optative was a dying mode. If matters, in spite of the prophetic note of victory in verse 1 Peter 3:13, should come to actual suffering "for righteousness' sake" (δια δικαιοσυνην) as in Matthew 5:10 (ενεκεν, not δια), then "blessed" (μακαριο, the very word of Jesus there which see, a word meaning "happy," not ευλογητο) "are ye" (not in the Greek). If the conclusion were expressed regularly, it would be ειητε αν (ye would be), not εστε (ye are). It is interesting to note the third-class condition in verse 1 Peter 3:13 just before the fourth-class one in verse 1 Peter 3:14.Fear not their fear  (τον φοβον αυτων μη φοβηθητε). Prohibition with μη and the first aorist (ingressive) passive subjunctive of φοβεομα, to fear, and the cognate accusative φοβον (fear, terror). "Do not fear their threats" (Bigg). Quotation from Isaiah 8:12.Neither be troubled  (μηδε ταραξθητε). Prohibition with μηδε and the first aorist (ingressive) subjunctive of ταρασσω, to disturb (Matthew 2:6; John 12:27). Part of the same quotation. Cf. 1 Peter 3:6.
