<p><b> But and if ye should suffer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ε κα πασχοιτε</span></span>). "But if ye should also (or even) suffer." Condition of the fourth class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and the optative (undetermined with less likelihood), a rare condition in the vernacular <i>Koine</i>, since the optative was a dying mode. If matters, in spite of the prophetic note of victory in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:13">1 Peter 3:13</span>, should come to actual suffering "for righteousness' sake" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια δικαιοσυνην</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:10">Matthew 5:10</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεκεν</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>), then "blessed" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακαριο</span></span>, the very word of Jesus there which see, a word meaning "happy," not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευλογητο</span></span>) "are ye" (not in the Greek). If the conclusion were expressed regularly, it would be <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειητε αν</span></span> (ye would be), not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστε</span></span> (ye are). It is interesting to note the third-class condition in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:13">1 Peter 3:13</span> just before the fourth-class one in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:14">1 Peter 3:14</span>.</p>

Prohibition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the first aorist (ingressive) passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβεομα</span></span>, to fear, and the cognate accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβον</span></span> (fear, terror). "Do not fear their threats" (Bigg). Quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:12">Isaiah 8:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>Neither be troubled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδε ταραξθητε</span></span>).
