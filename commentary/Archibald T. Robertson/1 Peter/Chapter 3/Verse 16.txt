 Having a good conscience  (συνειδησιν εχοντες αγαθην). Present active participle of εχω. See 1 Peter 2:18 for συνειδησιν and 1 Peter 3:21 for συνειδησις αγαθη again ("a quasi-personification," Hart).That they may be put to shame  (ινα καταισχυνθωσιν). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist passive subjunctive of καταισχυνω, old verb, to put to shame (Luke 13:17; 1 Peter 2:6).Wherein ye are spoken against  (εν ω καταλαλεισθε). Present passive indicative of καταλαλεω, for which see 1 Peter 2:12 with εν ω also. Peter may be recalling (Hart) his own experience at Pentecost when the Jews first scoffed and others were cut to the heart (Acts 2:13; Acts 2:37).Who revile  (ο επηρεαζοντες). Articular present active participle of επηρεαζω, old verb (from επηρεια, spiteful abuse), to insult, in N.T. only here and Luke 6:28.In Christ  (εν Χριστω). Paul's common mystical phrase that Peter has three times (here, 1 Peter 5:10; 1 Peter 5:14), not in John, though the idea is constantly in John. Peter here gives a new turn (cf. 1 Peter 2:12) to αναστροφη (manner of life). "Constantly the apostle repeats his phrases with new significance and in a new light" (Bigg).
