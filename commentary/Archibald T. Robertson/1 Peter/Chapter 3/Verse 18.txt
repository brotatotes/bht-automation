<p><b> Because Christ also died </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ κα Χριστος απεθανεν</span></span>). So the best MSS.; later ones <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαθεν</span></span> (suffered). The example of Christ should stir us to patient endurance.</p>
<p><b>For sins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ αμαρτιων</span></span>). "Concerning sins" (not his, but ours, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18">1 Peter 1:18</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Περ</span></span> (around, concerning) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιας</span></span> in the regular phrase for the sin offering (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+5:7">Leviticus 5:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+6:30">Leviticus 6:30</span>), though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ αμαρτιας</span></span> does occur (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+43:25">Ezekiel 43:25</span>). So in the N.T. we find both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ αμαρτιων</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:3">Hebrews 5:3</span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ αμαρτιων</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:1">Hebrews 5:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>Once </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαξ</span></span>). Once for all (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:28">Hebrews 9:28</span>), not once upon a time (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποτε</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>The righteous for the unrighteous </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιος υπερ αδικων</span></span>). Literally, "just for unjust" (no articles). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:19">1 Peter 2:19</span> for the sinlessness of Christ as the one perfect offering for sin. This is what gives Christ's blood value. He has no sin himself. Some men today fail to perceive this point.</p>
<p><b>That he might bring us to God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ημας προσαγαγη τω θεω</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>, with second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσαγω</span></span> and the dative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω θεω</span></span>. The MSS. vary between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημας</span></span> (us) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμας</span></span> (you). The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσαγω</span></span> means to lead or bring to (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:24">Matthew 18:24</span>), to approach God (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσαγωγην</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:18">Ephesians 2:18</span>), to present us to God on the basis of his atoning death for us, which has opened the way (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19">Hebrews 10:19</span>.)</p>
<p><b>Being put to death in the flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θανατωθεις μεν σαρκ</span></span>). First aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θανατοω</span></span>, old verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θανατος</span></span> death), to put to death. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σαρκ</span></span> is locative case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρξ</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>But quickened in the spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωοποιηθεις δε πνευματ</span></span>). First aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωοποιεω</span></span> rare (Aristotle) verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωοποιος</span></span> making alive), to make alive. The participles are not antecedent to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεθανεν</span></span>, but simultaneous with it. There is no such construction as the participle of subsequent action. The spirit of Christ did not die when his flesh did, but "was endued with new and greater powers of life" (Thayer). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:22">1 Corinthians 15:22</span> for the use of the verb for the resurrection of the body. But the use of the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματ</span></span> (locative case) in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκ</span></span> starts Peter's mind off in a long comparison by way of illustration that runs from verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:19-22">1 Peter 3:19-22</span>. The following verses have caused more controversy than anything in the Epistle. </p>
