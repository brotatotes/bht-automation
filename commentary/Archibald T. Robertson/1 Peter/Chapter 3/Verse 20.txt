First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απειθεω</span></span> (for which verb see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:20">1 Peter 3:20</span>) in the dative plural agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμασιν</span></span>.

Imperfect middle of the double compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκδεχομα</span></span>, late verb, probably first by Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span>), though in the apocryphal <i>Acta Pauli</i> (iii) and other late writings cited by Nageli (p. 43). Perfective use of the two prepositions (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο, εκ</span></span>) to wait out to the end, as for Christ's Second Coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:20">Philippians 3:20</span>). A hundred years apparently after the warning (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+5:32">Genesis 5:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:3">Genesis 6:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+7:6">Genesis 7:6</span>) Noah was preparing the ark and Noah as a preacher of righteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>) forewarned the people, who disregarded it.</p>

<p><b>Wherein </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ην</span></span>). "Into which" (the ark).</p>
<p><b>That is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτ' εστιν</span></span>). Explanatory expression like our English idiom (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:6">Romans 10:6</span>, etc.).</p>

<p><b>Through water </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' υδατος</span></span>). "By means of water" as the intermediate agent, an apparent change in the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> in composition just before (local use) to the instrumental use here. They came through the water in the ark and so were saved by the water in spite of the flood around them. Peter lays stress (Hart) on the water rather than on the ark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:7">Hebrews 11:7</span>) for the sake of the following illustration. </p>
