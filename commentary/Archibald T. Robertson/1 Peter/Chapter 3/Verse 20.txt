 Which aforetime were disobedient  (απειθησασιν ποτε). First aorist active participle of απειθεω (for which verb see 1 Peter 3:20) in the dative plural agreeing with πνευμασιν. These spirits now in prison once upon a time (ποτε) were disobedient (typical rebels, Hart calls them).Waited  (απεξεδεχετο). Imperfect middle of the double compound απεκδεχομα, late verb, probably first by Paul (1 Corinthians 1:7), though in the apocryphal Acta Pauli (iii) and other late writings cited by Nageli (p. 43). Perfective use of the two prepositions (απο, εκ) to wait out to the end, as for Christ's Second Coming (Philippians 3:20). A hundred years apparently after the warning (Genesis 5:32; Genesis 6:3; Genesis 7:6) Noah was preparing the ark and Noah as a preacher of righteousness (2 Peter 2:5) forewarned the people, who disregarded it.While the ark was a preparing  (κατασκευαζομενης κιβωτου). Genitive absolute with present passive participle of κατασκευαζω, old compound (Matthew 11:10), for κιβωτος (ark) see on Matthew 24:38.Wherein  (εις ην). "Into which" (the ark).That is  (τουτ' εστιν). Explanatory expression like our English idiom (Romans 10:6, etc.).Souls  (ψυχα). Persons of both sexes (living men) as in Acts 2:41; Acts 27:37, etc.Were saved  (διεσωθησαν). First aorist passive indicative of διασωζω, old compound, to bring safe through as in Acts 27:44.Through water  (δι' υδατος). "By means of water" as the intermediate agent, an apparent change in the use of δια in composition just before (local use) to the instrumental use here. They came through the water in the ark and so were saved by the water in spite of the flood around them. Peter lays stress (Hart) on the water rather than on the ark (Hebrews 11:7) for the sake of the following illustration.
