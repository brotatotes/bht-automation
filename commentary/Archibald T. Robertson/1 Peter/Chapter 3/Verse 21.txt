<p><b> Which also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κα</span></span>). Water just mentioned.</p>
<p><b>After a true likeness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιτυπον</span></span>). Water in baptism now as an anti-type of Noah's deliverance by water. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισμα</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιτυπον</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:24">Hebrews 9:24</span> (only other N.T. example) where the word is used of the earthly tabernacle corresponding (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιτυπα</span></span>) to the heavenly, which is the pattern (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπον</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>) for the earthly. So here baptism is presented as corresponding to (prefigured by) the deliverance of Noah's family by water. It is only a vague parallel, but not over-fanciful.</p>
<p><b>Doth now save you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμας νυν σωζε</span></span>). Simplex verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωζω</span></span>, not the compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασωζω</span></span>). The saving by baptism which Peter here mentions is only symbolic (a metaphor or picture as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:2-6">Romans 6:2-6</span>), not actual as Peter hastens to explain.</p>
<p><b>Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου σαρκος αποθεσις ρυπου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αποθεσις</span></span> is old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποτιθημ</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:1">1 Peter 2:1</span>), in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:14">2 Peter 1:14</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ρυπου</span></span> (genitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυπος</span></span>) is old word (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυπαρος</span></span>, filthy, in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:2">James 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:11">Revelation 22:11</span>), here only in N.T. (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+3:3">Isaiah 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:4">Isaiah 4:4</span>). Baptism, Peter explains, does not wash away the filth of the flesh either in a literal sense, as a bath for the body, or in a metaphorical sense of the filth of the soul. No ceremonies really affect the conscience (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13">Hebrews 9:13</span>). Peter here expressly denies baptismal remission of sin.</p>
<p><b>But the interrogation of a good conscience toward God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα συνειδησεως αγαθης επερωτημα εις θεον</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επερωταω</span></span> (to question as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:32">Mark 9:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span>), here only in N.T. In ancient Greek it never means answer, but only inquiry. The inscriptions of the age of the Antonines use it of the Senate's approval after inquiry. That may be the sense here, that is, avowal of consecration to God after inquiry, having repented and turned to God and now making this public proclamation of that fact by means of baptism (the symbol of the previous inward change of heart). Thus taken, it matters little whether <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις θεον</span></span> (toward God) be taken with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επερωτημα</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνειδησεως</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' αναστασεως Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). For baptism is a symbolic picture of the resurrection of Christ as well as of our own spiritual renewal (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:2-6">Romans 6:2-6</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span> for regeneration made possible by the resurrection of Jesus. </p>
