<p><b> Whose adorning </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων κοσμος</span></span>). Genitive plural of the relative referring to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυναικων</span></span> (wives). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κοσμος</span></span> has here its old meaning of ornament (cf. our cosmetics), not the common one of world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>) considered as an orderly whole. <i>Mundus</i> in Latin is used in this double sense (ornament, world).</p>
<p><b>Let it be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστω</span></span>). Imperative third singular of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span>. Not the outward adorning of plaiting the hair (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ ο εξωθεν εμπλοκης τριχων</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ</span></span> here rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> (usual negative with the imperative) because of the sharp contrast in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:4">1 Peter 3:4</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ'</span></span>). The old adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξωθεν</span></span> (from without) is in the attributive position like an adjective. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εμπλοκη</span></span> is a late word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπλεκω</span></span>, to inweave, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:4">2 Timothy 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:20">2 Peter 2:20</span>) in Strabo, but often in the papyri for struggle as well as plaiting, here only in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Of wearing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιθεσεως</span></span>).

Ornaments of gold were worn round the hair as nets and round the finger, arm, or ankle.</p>
<p><b>Or of putting on </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδυσεως</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδυω</span></span> (to put on), here only in N.T. Peter is not forbidding the wearing of clothes and ornaments by women, but the display of finery by contrast. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:9-13">1 Timothy 2:9-13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+3:16">Isaiah 3:16</span>. </p>
