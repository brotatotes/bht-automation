 Whose adorning  (ων κοσμος). Genitive plural of the relative referring to γυναικων (wives). Κοσμος has here its old meaning of ornament (cf. our cosmetics), not the common one of world (John 17:5) considered as an orderly whole. Mundus in Latin is used in this double sense (ornament, world).Let it be  (εστω). Imperative third singular of ειμ. Not the outward adorning of plaiting the hair (ουχ ο εξωθεν εμπλοκης τριχων). The use of ουχ here rather than μη (usual negative with the imperative) because of the sharp contrast in verse 1 Peter 3:4 (αλλ'). The old adverb εξωθεν (from without) is in the attributive position like an adjective. Εμπλοκη is a late word (from εμπλεκω, to inweave, 2 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 2:20) in Strabo, but often in the papyri for struggle as well as plaiting, here only in N.T.Of wearing  (περιθεσεως). Late and rare word (Galen, Arrian) from περιτιθημ (Matthew 27:28), to put around, a placing around. Ornaments of gold were worn round the hair as nets and round the finger, arm, or ankle.Or of putting on  (ενδυσεως). Old word from ενδυω (to put on), here only in N.T. Peter is not forbidding the wearing of clothes and ornaments by women, but the display of finery by contrast. Cf. 1 Timothy 2:9-13; Isaiah 3:16.
