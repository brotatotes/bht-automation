<p><b>And are not put in fear by any terror </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μη φοβουμενα μηδεμιαν πτοησιν</span></span>). Free quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:25">Proverbs 3:25</span>, "and not fearing any terror" (cognate accusative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πτοησις</span></span>, after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβουμενα</span></span>, present middle participle, late and rare word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πτοεω</span></span>, to terrify, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:9">Luke 21:9</span>, here only in N.T.). Perhaps Peter regards Sarah's falsehood as the yielding to a sudden terror (Hart). Hannah could also be named along with Sarah. The women somehow do not organize "daughters of Sarah" societies. </p>
