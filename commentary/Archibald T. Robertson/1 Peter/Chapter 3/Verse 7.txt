<p><b> Ye husbands likewise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ανδρες ομοιως</span></span>). Probably "likewise" here refers to honouring all men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:17">1 Peter 2:17</span>), not "likewise" of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:1">1 Peter 3:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Dwell with </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνοικουντες</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνοικεω</span></span>, old verb for domestic association, here only in N.T. Used as imperative here like the participle in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18">1 Peter 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:1">1 Peter 3:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>According to knowledge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα γνωσιν</span></span>). "With an intelligent recognition of the nature of the marriage relation" (Vincent).</p>
<p><b>Giving honour unto the woman as unto the weaker vessel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ασθενεστερω σκευε τω γυναικειω απονεμοντες τιμην</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απονεμω</span></span>, old verb, to assign, to portion out (or off), here only in N.T. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σκευος</span></span> is an old and common word for vessel, furniture, utensil (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:29">Matthew 12:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:20">2 Timothy 2:20</span>). Here both husband and wife are termed vessels or "parts of the furniture of God's house" (Bigg). See Paul's use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκευος</span></span> for ministers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:7">2 Corinthians 4:7</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γυναικειω</span></span> here is an adjective (female, feminine) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυνη</span></span> (woman, wife). She is termed "the weaker" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω ασθενεστερω</span></span>), not for intellectual or moral weakness, but purely for physical reasons, which the husband must recognize with due consideration for marital happiness.</p>
<p><b>Joint-heirs of the grace of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνκληρονομο χαριτος ζωης</span></span>). Late double compound found in an Ephesian inscription and the papyri, in N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:6">Ephesians 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:9">Hebrews 11:9</span>. God's gift of life eternal belongs to woman as well as to man. In the eyes of God the wife may be superior to the husband, not merely equal.</p>
<p><b>To the end that your prayers be not hindered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το μη εγκοπτεσθα τας προσευχας υμων</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το</span></span> and the present passive infinitive (with negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγκοπτω</span></span>, to cut in, to interrupt, late verb (Polybius), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:22">Romans 15:22</span>, etc. Very vivid to us now with our telephones and radios when people cut in on us. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προσευχας</span></span> (prayers) is the accusative of general reference. Husbands surely have here cause to consider why their prayers are not answered. </p>
