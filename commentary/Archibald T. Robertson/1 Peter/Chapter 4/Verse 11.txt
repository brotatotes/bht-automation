 If any man speaketh  (ε τις λαλε). Condition of first class, assumed as a fact.Speaking as it were oracles of God  (ως λογια θεου). No predicate in this conclusion of the condition. For λογια θεου see Acts 7:38 (Mosaic law); Romans 3:2 (the Old Testament); Hebrews 5:12 (the substance of Christian teaching), here of the utterances of God through Christian teachers. Λογιον (old word) is a diminutive of λογος (speech, word). It can be construed here as nominative or as accusative. The verb has to be supplied.If any one ministereth  (ε τις διακονε). First-class condition again. See Acts 6:2-4 for the twofold division of service involved here.Which God supplieth  (ης χορηγε ο θεος). Ablative case (ης) of the relative attracted from the accusative ην, object of χορηγε (present active indicative of χορηγεω, old verb, to supply from χορηγος, chorus leader, in N.T. only here and 2 Corinthians 9:10). Peter has the compound επιχορηγεω in 2 Peter 1:5; 2 Peter 1:11. God is the supplier of strength.That God may be glorified  (ινα δοξαζητα ο θεος). Purpose clause with ινα and the present passive subjunctive of δοξαζω. See John 15:8.Whose is  (ω εστιν).
