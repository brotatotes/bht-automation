<p><b> Let no one of you suffer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη τις υμων πασχετω</span></span>). Prohibition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and present active imperative (habit prohibited).</p>
<p><b>As </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span>). Charged as and being so. Two specific crimes (murderer, thief) and one general phrase (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακοποιος</span></span>, evildoer, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:12">1 Peter 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:14">1 Peter 2:14</span>), and one unusual term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλοτριεπισχοπος</span></span> (a meddler in other men's matters). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ως</span></span> (or as) = or "also only as" (Wohlenberg). The word was apparently coined by Peter (occurring elsewhere only in Dionys. Areop. and late eccles. writers) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλοτριος</span></span> (belonging to another, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:15">2 Corinthians 10:15</span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισκοπος</span></span>, overseer, inspector, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:25">1 Peter 2:25</span>). The idea is apparently one who spies out the affairs of other men. Deissmann (<i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 224) gives a second-century papyrus with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλοτριων επιθυμητης</span></span> a <i>speculator alienorum</i>. Epictetus has a like idea (iii. 22. 97). Biggs takes it to refer to "things forbidden." Clement of Alexandria tells of a disciple of the Apostle John who became a bandit chief. Ramsay (<i>Church in the Roman Empire</i>, pp. 293, 348) thinks the word refers to breaking up family relationships. Hart refers us to the gadders-about in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:11">1 Thessalonians 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:11">2 Thessalonians 3:11</span> and women as gossipers in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:13">1 Thessalonians 5:13</span>. It is interesting to note also that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισκοπος</span></span> here is the word for "bishop" and so suggests also preachers meddling in the work of other preachers. </p>
