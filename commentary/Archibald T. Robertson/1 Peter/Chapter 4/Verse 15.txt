 Let no one of you suffer  (μη τις υμων πασχετω). Prohibition with μη and present active imperative (habit prohibited).As  (ως). Charged as and being so. Two specific crimes (murderer, thief) and one general phrase (κακοποιος, evildoer, 1 Peter 2:12; 1 Peter 2:14), and one unusual term αλλοτριεπισχοπος (a meddler in other men's matters). Note η ως (or as) = or "also only as" (Wohlenberg). The word was apparently coined by Peter (occurring elsewhere only in Dionys. Areop. and late eccles. writers) from αλλοτριος (belonging to another, 2 Corinthians 10:15) and επισκοπος, overseer, inspector, 1 Peter 2:25). The idea is apparently one who spies out the affairs of other men. Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 224) gives a second-century papyrus with αλλοτριων επιθυμητης a speculator alienorum. Epictetus has a like idea (iii. 22. 97). Biggs takes it to refer to "things forbidden." Clement of Alexandria tells of a disciple of the Apostle John who became a bandit chief. Ramsay (Church in the Roman Empire, pp. 293, 348) thinks the word refers to breaking up family relationships. Hart refers us to the gadders-about in 1 Thessalonians 4:11; 2 Thessalonians 3:11 and women as gossipers in 1 Thessalonians 5:13. It is interesting to note also that επισκοπος here is the word for "bishop" and so suggests also preachers meddling in the work of other preachers.
