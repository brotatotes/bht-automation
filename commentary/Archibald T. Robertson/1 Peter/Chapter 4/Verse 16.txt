<p><b> But if as a Christian </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δε ως Χριστιανος</span></span>). Supply the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασχε</span></span> (condition of first class, "if one suffer as a Christian"). This word occurs only three times in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:28">Acts 26:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:16">1 Peter 4:16</span>). It is word of Latin formation coined to distinguish followers of Christ from Jews and Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>). Each instance bears that idea. It is not the usual term at first like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαθητα</span></span> (disciples), saints (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιο</span></span>), believers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευοντες</span></span>), etc. The Jews used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ναζωραιο</span></span> (Nazarenes) as a nickname for Christians (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:5">Acts 24:5</span>). By A.D. 64 the name Christian was in common use in Rome (Tacitus, Ann. XV. 44). Owing to itacism it was sometimes spelled <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χρηστιανο</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ι, ε</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span> pronounced alike).</p>
<p><b>Let him not be ashamed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη αισχυνεσθω</span></span>). Prohibition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and present passive imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αισχυνω</span></span>. Peter had once been ashamed to suffer reproach or even a sneer for being a disciple of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:68">Mark 14:68</span>). See the words of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:38">Mark 8:38</span> and Paul's in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>. Peter is not ashamed now. In this name (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ονοματ τουτω</span></span>). Of Christian as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:41">Mark 9:41</span>, "because ye are Christ's." </p>
