<p><b> For the time is come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ο καιρος</span></span>). No predicate, probably <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> (is) to be supplied. The phrase that follows comes from the vision of Ezekiel (chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:9">1 Peter 4:9</span>). The construction is unusual with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του αρξασθα</span></span> (genitive articular aorist middle infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχω</span></span>), not exactly purpose or result, and almost in apposition (epexegetic), but note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ελθειν</span></span> used as subject in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:1">Luke 17:1</span>. The persecution on hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>) was a foretaste of more to come. By "house of God" he can mean the same as the "spiritual house" of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span> or a local church. Biggs even takes it to refer to the family.</p>
<p><b>And if it begin first at us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δε πρωτον αφ'ημων</span></span>). Condition of first class again, with the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχετα</span></span> understood. "From us" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφ' ημων</span></span>) more exactly.</p>
<p><b>End </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελος</span></span>). Final fate.</p>
<p><b>Of them that obey not the gospel of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των απειθουντων τω του θεου ευαγγελιω</span></span>). "Of those disobeying the gospel of God." See the same idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:8">Romans 2:8</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:14">Mark 1:14</span> for believing in the gospel. </p>
