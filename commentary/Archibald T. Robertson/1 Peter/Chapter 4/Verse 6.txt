<p><b> Was the gospel preached </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευηγγελισθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιζω</span></span>. Impersonal use.</p>
<p><b>Even to the dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα νεκροις</span></span>). Does Peter here mean preached to men after they are dead or to men once alive but dead now or when the judgment comes? There are those (Augustine, Luther, etc.) who take "dead" here in the spiritual sense (dead in trespasses and sins as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:13">Colossians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>), but consider it "impossible" for Peter to use the same word in two senses so close together; but Jesus did it in the same sentence, as in the case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span> (life) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span>. Bigg takes it to mean that all men who did not hear the gospel message in this life will hear it in the next before the final judgment.</p>
<p><b>That they might be judged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα κριθωσιν μεν</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>, to judge, whereas <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωσιν δε</span></span> (by contrast) is the present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζαω</span></span>, to live. There is contrast also between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα ανθρωπους</span></span> (according to men) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα θεον</span></span> (according to God). </p>
