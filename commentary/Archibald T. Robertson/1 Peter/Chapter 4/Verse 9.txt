 Using hospitality  (φιλοξενο). "Friendly to strangers," old word (from φιλοσ, ξενος), in N.T. only here and 1 Timothy 3:2; Titus 1:8. No verb here in the Greek.Without murmuring  (ανευ γογγυσμου). Like χωρις γογγυσμων in Philippians 2:14. Complaint spoils hospitality. Jesus enjoined the entertainment of strangers (Matthew 25:35). Inns were rare and very poor. Hospitality made mission work possible (3 John 1:5).
