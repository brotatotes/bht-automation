<p><b> Who am a fellow-elder </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο συνπρεσβυτερος</span></span>). Earliest use of this compound in an inscription of B.C. 120 for fellow-elders (alderman) in a town, here only in N.T., in eccles. writers. For the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτερος</span></span> in the technical sense of officers in a Christian church (like elder in the local synagogues of the Jews) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17">Acts 20:17</span>. It is noteworthy that here Peter the Apostle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span>) calls himself an elder along with (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span>) the other "elders."</p>
<p><b>A witness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυς</span></span>). This is what Jesus had said they must be (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8">Acts 1:8</span>) and what Peter claimed to be (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:15">Acts 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:39">Acts 10:39</span>). So Paul was to be a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυς</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:15">Acts 22:15</span>).</p>
<p><b>Who am also a partaker </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κα κοινωνος</span></span>). "The partner also," "the partaker also." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:10">Luke 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:7">2 Corinthians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>. See same idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23">Galatians 3:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18">Romans 8:18</span> we have almost this about the glory about to be revealed to us where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλω</span></span> as here is used with the infinitive. </p>
