<p><b> She that is in Babylon, elect together with you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η εν Βαβυλων συνεκλεκτη</span></span>). Either actual Babylon or, as most likely, mystical Babylon (Rome) as in the Apocalypse. If Peter is in Rome about A.D. 65, there is every reason why he should not make that fact plain to the world at large and least of all to Nero. It is also uncertain whether <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η συνεκλεκτη</span></span> (found here alone), "the co-elect woman," means Peter's wife (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:5">1 Corinthians 9:5</span>) or the church in "Babylon." The natural way to take it is for Peter's wife. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεκτη κυρια</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:1">2 John 1:1</span> (also verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:13">2 John 1:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>Mark my son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μαρκος ο υιος μου</span></span>). So this fact agrees with the numerous statements by the early Christian writers that Mark, after leaving Barnabas, became Peter's "interpreter" and under his influence wrote his Gospel. We know that Mark was with Paul in Rome some years before this time (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>). </p>
