 Tend  (ποιμανατε). First aorist active imperative of ποιμαινω, old verb, from ποιμην (shepherd) as in Luke 17:7. Jesus used this very word to Peter in the interview by the Sea of Galilee (John 21:16) and Peter doubtless has this fact in mind here. Paul used the word to the elders at Miletus (Acts 20:28). See 1 Peter 2:25 for the metaphor.Flock  (ποιμνιον). Old word, likewise from ποιμην, contraction of ποιμενιον (Luke 12:32).Exercising the oversight  (επισκοπουντες). Present active participle of επισκοπεω, old word (in Hebrews 12:15 alone in N.T.), omitted here by Aleph B.Not by constraint  (μη αναγκαστως). Negative μη because of the imperative. Old adverb from verbal adjective αναγκαστος, here alone in N.T.But willingly  (αλλα εκουσιως). By contrast. Old adverb, in N.T. only here and Hebrews 10:26.Nor yet for filthy lucre  (μηδε αισχροκερδως). A compound adverb not found elsewhere, but the old adjective αισχροκερδης is in 1 Timothy 3:8; Titus 1:7. See also Titus 1:11 "for the sake of filthy lucre" (αισχρου κερδους χαριν). Clearly the elders received stipends, else there could be no such temptation.But of a ready mind  (αλλα προθυμως). Old adverb from προθυμος (Matthew 26:41), here only in N.T.
