 When the chief Shepherd shall be manifested  (φανερωθεντος του αρχιποιμενος). Genitive absolute with first aorist passive participle of φανεροω, to manifest, and genitive of αρχιποιμην, a compound (αρχι, ποιμην) after analogy of αρχιερευς, here only in N.T., but in Testam. of Twelve Patrs. (Jud. 8) and on a piece of wood around an Egyptian mummy and also on a papyrus A.D. 338 (Deissmann, Light, etc., p. 100). See Hebrews 13:20 for ο ποιμην ο μεγας (the Shepherd the great).Ye shall receive  (κομιεισθε). Future of κομιζω (1 Peter 1:9, which see).The crown of glory that fadeth not away  (τον αμαραντινον της δοξης στεφανον). For "crown" (στεφανος) see James 1:12; 1 Corinthians 9:25; 2 Timothy 4:8; Revelation 2:10; Revelation 3:10; Revelation 4:4. In the Gospels it is used only of the crown of thorns, but Jesus is crowned with glory and honor (Hebrews 2:9). In all these passages it is the crown of victory as it is here. See 1 Peter 1:4 for αμαραντος, unfading. Αμαραντινος is made from that word as the name of a flower αμαρανθ (so called because it never withers and revives if moistened with water and so used as a symbol of immortality), "composed of amaranth" or "amarantine," "the amarantine (unfading) crown of glory."
