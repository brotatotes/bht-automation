<p><b> Whom withstand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω αντιστητε</span></span>). Imperative second aorist active (intransitive) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθιστημ</span></span>; same form in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:7">James 4:7</span>, which see. Dative case of relative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω</span></span>). For the imperative in a subordinate clause see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:12">1 Peter 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:10">2 Thessalonians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:15">2 Timothy 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7">Hebrews 13:7</span>. Cowardice never wins against the devil (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:7">2 Timothy 1:7</span>), but only courage.</p>
<p><b>Steadfast in your faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στερεο τη πιστε</span></span>). Locative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστε</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Στερεος</span></span> is old adjective for solid like a foundation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:19">2 Timothy 2:19</span>).</p>
<p><b>The same sufferings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα αυτα των παθηματων</span></span>). An unusual construction with the genitive rather than the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα αυτα παθηματα</span></span>, perhaps as Hofmann suggests, "the same tax of sufferings" ("the same things in sufferings"). Probably this is correct and is like Xenophon's phrase in the <i>Memorabilia</i> (IV. 8. 8), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα του γηρως επιτελεισθα</span></span> (to pay the tax of old age).</p>
<p><b>Are accomplished </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτελεισθα</span></span>). Present (and so process) middle (you are paying) or passive (is paid) infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτελεω</span></span>, old verb, to accomplish (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:1">2 Corinthians 7:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>In your brethren who are in the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εν τω κοσμω υμων αδελφοτητ</span></span>). Associate-instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδελφοτητ</span></span> (in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:17">1 Peter 2:17</span>, which see) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα αυτα</span></span> (like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:5">1 Corinthians 11:5</span>) or dative after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτελεισθα</span></span>. Even so <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδοτες</span></span> (second perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span>) with an infinitive usually means "knowing how to" (object infinitive) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:56">Luke 12:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:18">Philippians 3:18</span> rather than "knowing that" (indirect assertion) as taken above. </p>
