<p><b> Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παυλος κα Σιλουανος κα Τιμοθεος</span></span>). Nominative absolute as customary in letters. Paul associates with himself Silvanus (Silas of Acts, spelled <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σιλβανος</span></span> in D and the papyri), a Jew and Roman citizen, and Timothy, son of Jewish mother and Greek father, one of Paul's converts at Lystra on the first tour. They had both been with Paul at Thessalonica, though Timothy is not mentioned by Luke in Acts in Macedonia till Beroea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:14">Acts 17:14</span>). Timothy had joined Paul in Athens (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:1">1 Thessalonians 3:1</span>), had been sent back to Thessalonica, and with Silas had rejoined Paul in Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:5">1 Thessalonians 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:5">Acts 18:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:19">2 Corinthians 1:19</span>). Silas is the elder and is mentioned first, but neither is in any sense the author of the Epistle any more than Sosthenes is co-author of I Corinthians or Timothy of II Corinthians, though Paul may sometimes have them in mind when he uses "we" in the Epistle. Paul does not here call himself "apostle" as in the later Epistles, perhaps because his position has not been so vigorously attacked as it was later. Ellicott sees in the absence of the word here a mark of the affectionate relations existing between Paul and the Thessalonians.</p>
<p><b>Unto the church of the Thessalonians </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εκκλησια Θεσσαλονικεων</span></span>). The dative case in address. Note absence of the article with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θεσσαλονικεων</span></span> because a proper name and so definite without it. This is the common use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησια</span></span> for a local body (church). The word originally meant "assembly" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:39">Acts 19:39</span>, but it came to mean an organization for worship whether assembled or unassembled (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>). The only superscription in the oldest Greek manuscripts (Aleph B A) is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προς Θεσσαλονικεις Α</span></span> (<b> To the Thessalonians First </b>). But probably Paul wrote no superscription and certainly he would not write A to it before he had written II Thessalonians (B). His signature at the close was the proof of genuineness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>) against all spurious claimants (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span>). Unfortunately the brittle papyrus on which he wrote easily perished outside of the sand heaps and tombs of Egypt or the lava covered ruins of Herculaneum. What a treasure that autograph would be!</p>
<p><b>In God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν θεω πατρ κα κυριω Jησου Χριστω</span></span>). This church is grounded in (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>, with the locative case) and exists in the sphere and power of</p>
<p><b>God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ </b>. No article in the Greek, for both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεω πατρ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριω Jησου Χριστω</span></span> are treated as proper names. In the very beginning of this first Epistle of Paul we meet his Christology. He at once uses the full title, "Lord Jesus Christ," with all the theological content of each word. The name "Jesus" (Saviour, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>) he knew, as the "Jesus of history," the personal name of the Man of Galilee, whom he had once persecuted (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:5">Acts 9:5</span>), but whom he at once, after his conversion, proclaimed to be "the Messiah," (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Χριστος</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:22">Acts 9:22</span>). This position Paul never changed. In the great sermon at Antioch in Pisidia which Luke has preserved (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:23">Acts 13:23</span>) Paul proved that God fulfilled his promise to Israel by raising up "Jesus as Saviour" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωτηρα Ιησουν</span></span>). Now Paul follows the Christian custom by adding <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος</span></span> (verbal from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χριω</span></span>, to anoint) as a proper name to Jesus (Jesus Christ) as later he will often say "Christ Jesus" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:1">Colossians 1:1</span>). And he dares also to apply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριος</span></span> (Lord) to "Jesus Christ," the word appropriated by Claudius (<i>Dominus</i>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span>) and other emperors in the emperor-worship, and also common in the Septuagint for God as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+32:1">Psalms 32:1</span> (quoted by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:8">Romans 4:8</span>). Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span> of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5">1 Corinthians 3:5</span>) or of Jesus Christ as here. In fact, he more frequently applies it to Christ when not quoting the Old Testament as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:8">Romans 4:8</span>. And here he places "the Lord Jesus Christ" in the same category and on the same plane with "God the father." There will be growth in Paul's Christology and he will never attain all the knowledge of Christ for which he longs (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:10-12">Philippians 3:10-12</span>), but it is patent that here in his first Epistle there is no "reduced Christ" for Paul. He took Jesus as "Lord" when he surrendered to Jesus on the Damascus Road: "And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:10">Acts 22:10</span>). It is impossible to understand Paul without seeing clearly this first and final stand for the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul did not get this view of Jesus from current views of Mithra or of Isis or any other alien faith. The Risen Christ became at once for Paul the Lord of his life.</p>
<p><b>Grace to you and peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις υμιν κα ειρηνη</span></span>). These words, common in Paul's Epistles, bear "the stamp of Paul's experience" (Milligan). They are not commonplace salutations, but the old words "deepened and spiritualised" (Frame). The infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρειν</span></span>) so common in the papyri letters and seen in the New Testament also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:23">Acts 15:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:26">Acts 23:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>) here gives place to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις</span></span>, one of the great words of the New Testament (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span>) and particularly of the Pauline Epistles. Perhaps no one word carries more meaning for Paul's messages than this word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρω</span></span>, rejoice) from which <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριζομα</span></span> comes.</p>
<p><b>Peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρηνη</span></span>) is more than the Hebrew <i>shalom</i> so common in salutations. One recalls the "peace" that Christ leaves to us (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27">John 14:27</span>) and the peace of God that passes all understanding (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:7">Philippians 4:7</span>). This introduction is brief, but rich and gracious and pitches the letter at once on a high plane. </p>
