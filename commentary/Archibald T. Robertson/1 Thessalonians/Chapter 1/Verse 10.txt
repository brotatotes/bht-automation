<p><b> To wait for his Son from heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναμενειν τον υιον αυτου εκ των ουρανων</span></span>). Present infinitive, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλευειν</span></span>, and so linear, to keep on waiting for. The hope of the second coming of Christ was real and powerful with Paul as it should be with us. It was subject to abuse then as now as Paul will have to show in this very letter. He alludes to this hope at the close of each chapter in this Epistle.</p>
<p><b>Whom he raised from the dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον ηγειρεν εκ [των] νεκρων</span></span>). Paul gloried in the fact of the resurrection of Jesus from the dead of which fact he was himself a personal witness. This fact is the foundation stone for all his theology and it comes out in this first chapter.</p>
<p><b>Jesus which delivereth us from the wrath to come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησουν τον ρυομενον ημας εκ της οργης της ερχομενης</span></span>). It is the historic, crucified, risen, and ascended Jesus Christ, God's Son, who delivers from the coming wrath. He is our Saviour (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>) true to his name Jesus. He is our Rescuer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:26">Romans 11:26</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ρυομενος</span></span>, from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:20">Isaiah 59:20</span>). It is eschatological language, this coming wrath of God for sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:16">1 Thessalonians 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:5">Romans 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:9">Romans 5:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:22">Romans 9:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:5">Romans 13:5</span>). It was Paul's allusion to the day of judgment with Jesus as Judge whom God had raised from the dead that made the Athenians mock and leave him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:31">Acts 17:31</span>). But Paul did not change his belief or his preaching because of the conduct of the Athenians. He is certain that God's wrath in due time will punish sin. Surely this is a needed lesson for our day. It was coming then and it is coming now. </p>
