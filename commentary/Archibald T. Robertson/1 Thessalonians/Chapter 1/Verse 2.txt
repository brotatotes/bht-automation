<p><b> We give thanks </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστουμεν</span></span>). Late denominative verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστεω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστος</span></span> (grateful) and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ</span></span>, well and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριζομα</span></span>, to show oneself kind. See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span>. "The plural implies that all three missionaries prayed together" (Moffatt).</p>
<p><b>Always </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντοτε</span></span>). Late word, rare in LXX. So with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστεω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:3">2 Thessalonians 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:4">1 Corinthians 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:20">Ephesians 5:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:3">Philippians 1:3</span>. Moffatt takes it to mean "whenever Paul was at his prayers." Of course, he did not make audible prayer always, but he was always in the spirit of prayer, "a constant attitude" (Milligan), "in tune with the Infinite."</p>
<p><b>For you all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ παντων υμων</span></span>). Paul "encircled (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span>, around) them all," including every one of them and the church as a whole. Distance lends enchantment to the memory of slight drawbacks. Paul is fond of this phrase "you all," particularly in Phil. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:3">Philippians 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:7">Philippians 1:7</span>).</p>
<p><b>Making mention </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνειαν ποιουμενο</span></span>). Paul uses this very idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:9">Romans 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:16">Ephesians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:4">Philemon 1:4</span>. Milligan cites a papyrus example of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνειαν ποιουμενο</span></span> in prayer (B. Y. U. 652, 5). Did Paul have a prayer list of the Thessalonian disciples which he read over with Silas and Timothy?</p>
<p><b>In </b> here is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι=</span></span>"in the time of our prayers." "Each time that they are engaged in prayers the writers mention the names of the converts" (Frame). </p>
