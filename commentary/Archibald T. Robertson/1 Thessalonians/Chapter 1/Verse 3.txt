<p><b> Remembering </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνημονευοντες</span></span>). Present active participle of old verb from adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνημων</span></span> (mindful) and so to call to mind, to be mindful of, used either with the accusative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span> or the genitive as here.</p>
<p><b>Without ceasing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδιαλειπτως</span></span>). Double compound adverb of the <i>Koine</i> (Polybius, Diodorus, Strabo, papyri) from the verbal adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α-δια-λειπτος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια-λειπω</span></span>, to leave off). In the N.T. alone by Paul and always connected with prayer. Milligan prefers to connect this adverb (amphibolous in position) with the preceding participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιουμενο</span></span> rather than with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνημονευοντες</span></span> as Revised Version and Westcott and Hort rightly do.</p>
<p><b>Your work of faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμων του εργου της πιστεως</span></span>). Note article with both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργου</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστεως</span></span> (correlation of the article, both abstract substantives). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εργου</span></span> is genitive case the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνημονευοντες</span></span> as is common with verbs of emotion (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 508f.), though the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπον</span></span> occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span> according to common Greek idiom allowing either case. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εργου</span></span> is the general term for work or business, employment, task. Note two genitives with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργου</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυμων</span></span> is the usual possessive genitive,</p>
<p><b>your work </b>, while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της πιστεως</span></span> is the descriptive genitive, marked by, characterized by, faith, "the activity that faith inspires" (Frame). It is interesting to note this sharp conjunction of these two words by Paul. We are justified by faith, but faith produces works (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:6-8">1 Thessalonians 1:6-8</span>) as the Baptist taught and as Jesus taught and as James does in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:2">1 Thessalonians 1:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>Labour of love </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του κοπου της αγαπης</span></span>). Note article with both substantives. Here again <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του κοπου</span></span> is the genitive the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνημονευοντες</span></span> while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της αγαπης</span></span> is the descriptive genitive characterizing the "labour" or "toil" more exactly. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κοπος</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπτω</span></span>, to cut, to lash, to beat the bread, to toil. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:13">Revelation 14:13</span> the distinction is drawn between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπου</span></span> (toil) from which the saints rest and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργα</span></span> (works, activities) which follow with them into heaven. So here it is the labour that love prompts, assuming gladly the toil. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αγαπη</span></span> is one of the great words of the N.T. (Milligan) and no certain example has yet been found in the early papyri or the inscriptions. It occurs in the Septuagint in the higher sense as with the sensuous associations. The Epistle of Aristeas calls love (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπη</span></span>) God's gift and Philo uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπη</span></span> in describing love for God. "When Christianity first began to think and speak in Greek, it took up <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπη</span></span> and its group of terms more freely, investing them with the new glow with which the N.T. writings make us familiar, a content which is invariably religious" (Moffatt, <i>Love in the New Testament</i>, p. 40). The New Testament never uses the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερως</span></span> (lust).</p>
<p><b>Patience of hope </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της υπομονης της ελπιδος</span></span>). Note the two articles again and the descriptive genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της ελπιδος</span></span>. It is patience marked by hope, "the endurance inspired by hope" (Frame), yes, and sustained by hope in spite of delays and set-backs. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυπομονη</span></span> is an old word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο, μενω</span></span>, to remain under), but it "has come like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπη</span></span> to be closely associated with a distinctively Christian virtue" (Milligan). The same order as here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργου, κοποσ, υπομονη</span></span>) appears in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2">Revelation 2:2</span> and Lightfoot considers it" an ascending scale as practical proofs of self-sacrifice." The church in Thessalonica was not old, but already they were called upon to exercise the sanctifying grace of hope (Denney).</p>
<p><b>In our Lord Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του Κυριου ημων Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). The objective genitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελπιδος</span></span> (hope) and so translated by "in" here (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 499f.). Jesus is the object of this hope, the hope of his second coming which is still open to us. Note "Lord Jesus Christ" as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Before our God and Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπροσθεν του θεου κα πατρος ημων</span></span>). The one article with both substantives precisely as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:4">Galatians 1:4</span>, not "before God and our Father," both article and possessive genitive going with both substantives as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1">2 Peter 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:11">2 Peter 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 785f.). The phrase is probably connected with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελπιδος</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εμπροσθεν</span></span> in the N.T. occurs only of place, but it is common in the papyri of time. The picture here is the day of judgment when all shall appear before God. </p>
