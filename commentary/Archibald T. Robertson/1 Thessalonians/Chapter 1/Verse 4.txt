<p><b> Knowing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδοτες</span></span>). Second perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον</span></span>), a so-called causal participle=since we know, the third participle with the principal verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστουμεν</span></span>, the Greek being fond of the circumstantial participle and lengthening sentences thereby (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, P. 1128).</p>
<p><b>Beloved by God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγαπημενο υπο [του] θεου</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαω</span></span>, the verb so common in the N.T. for the highest kind of love. Paul is not content with the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδελφο</span></span> here (often in this Epistle as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:1">1 Thessalonians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:14">1 Thessalonians 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:17">1 Thessalonians 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:7">1 Thessalonians 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:1">1 Thessalonians 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:10">1 Thessalonians 4:10</span>), but adds this affectionate phrase nowhere else in the N.T. in this form (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:3">Jude 1:3</span>) though in Sirach 45:1 and on the Rosetta Stone. But in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span> he quotes "beloved by the Lord" from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+33:12">Deuteronomy 33:12</span>. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδελφο</span></span> for members of the same brotherhood can be derived from the Jewish custom (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:29">Acts 2:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:37">Acts 2:37</span>) and the habit of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:48">Matthew 12:48</span>) and is amply illustrated in the papyri for burial clubs and other orders and guilds (Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>).</p>
<p><b>Your election </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την εκλογην υμων</span></span>). That is the election of you by God. It is an old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεγομα</span></span> used by Jesus of his choice of the twelve disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:16">John 15:16</span>) and by Paul of God's eternal selection (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλογη</span></span> is not in the LXX and only seven times in the N.T. and always of God's choice of men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:4">1 Thessalonians 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:11">Romans 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:5">Romans 11:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:7">Romans 11:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:58">Romans 11:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:10">2 Peter 1:10</span>). The divine <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλογη</span></span> was manifested in the Christian qualities of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:3">1 Thessalonians 1:3</span> (Moffatt). </p>
