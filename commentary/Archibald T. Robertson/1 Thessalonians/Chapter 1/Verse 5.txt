<p><b> How that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). It is not certain whether <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> here means "because" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυια</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:7">2 Thessalonians 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14">1 Corinthians 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:27">Romans 8:27</span> or declarative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> "how that," knowing the circumstances of your election (Lightfoot) or explanatory, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:3">Acts 16:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:1">1 Thessalonians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15">1 Corinthians 16:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:3">2 Corinthians 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:11">Romans 13:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>Our gospel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ευαγγελιον ημων</span></span>). The gospel (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23">Matthew 4:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:1">Mark 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:15">Mark 1:15</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιον</span></span>) which we preach, Paul's phrase also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:14">2 Thessalonians 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:3">2 Corinthians 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:16">Romans 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:8">2 Timothy 2:8</span>. Paul had a definite, clear-cut message of grace that he preached everywhere including Thessalonica. This message is to be interpreted in the light of Paul's own sermons in Acts and Epistles, not by reading backward into them the later perversions of Gnostics and sacramentarians. This very word was later applied to the books about Jesus, but Paul is not so using the term here or anywhere else. In its origin Paul's gospel is of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:8">1 Thessalonians 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span>), in its substance it is Christ's (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:2">1 Thessalonians 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:8">2 Thessalonians 1:8</span>), and Paul is only the bearer of it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:4">1 Thessalonians 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:14">2 Thessalonians 2:14</span>) as Milligan points out. Paul and his associates have been entrusted with this gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:4">1 Thessalonians 2:4</span>) and preach it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:2">Galatians 2:2</span>). Elsewhere Paul calls it God's gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:7">2 Corinthians 11:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:16">Romans 15:16</span>) or Christs (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:12">1 Corinthians 9:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:13">2 Corinthians 9:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:14">2 Corinthians 10:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7">Galatians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:19">Romans 15:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:27">Philippians 1:27</span>). In both instances it is the subjective genitive.</p>
<p><b>Came unto you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενηθη εις υμας</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span> in practically same sense as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span> (second aorist middle indicative as in the late Greek generally). So also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις υμας</span></span> like the <i>Koine</i> is little more than the dative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν</span></span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 594).</p>
<p><b>Not only--but also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ--μονον, αλλα κα</span></span>). Sharp contrast, negatively and positively. The contrast between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span> (word) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις</span></span> (power) is seen also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:4">1 Corinthians 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:20">1 Corinthians 4:20</span>. Paul does not refer to miracles by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>In the Holy Spirit and much assurance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πνευματ αγιω κα πληροφορια πολλη</span></span>). Preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> repeated with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογωι, δυναμε</span></span>, but only once here thus uniting closely</p>
<p><b>Holy Spirit </b> and</p>
<p><b>much assurance </b>. No article with either word. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροφορια</span></span> is not found in ancient Greek or the LXX. It appears once in Clement of Rome and one broken papyrus example. For the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροφορεω</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:1">Luke 1:1</span>. The substantive in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:11">Hebrews 6:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:22">Hebrews 10:22</span>. It means the full confidence which comes from the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><b>Even as ye know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως οιδατε</span></span>). Paul appeals to the Thessalonians themselves as witnesses to the character of his preaching and life among them.</p>
<p><b>What manner of men we showed ourselves toward you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιο εγενηθημεν υμιν</span></span>). Literally,</p>
<p><b>What sort of men we became to you </b>. Qualitative relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιο</span></span> and dative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν</span></span> and first aorist passive indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενηθημεν</span></span>, (not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεθα</span></span>, we were). An epexegetical comment with</p>
<p><b>for your sake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' υμας</span></span>) added. It was all in their interest and for their advantage, however it may have seemed otherwise at the time. </p>
