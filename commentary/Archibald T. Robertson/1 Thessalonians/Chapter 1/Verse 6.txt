 Imitators of us and of the Lord  (μιμητα ημων κα του κυριου). Μιμητης (-της expresses the agent) is from μιμεομα, to imitate and that from μιμος (μιμιχ, actor). Old word, more than "followers," in the N.T. only six times (1 Thessalonians 1:6; 1 Thessalonians 2:14; 1 Corinthians 4:16; 1 Corinthians 11:1; Ephesians 5:1; Hebrews 6:12). Again Paul uses γινομα, to become, not ειμ, to be. It is a daring thing to expect people to "imitate" the preacher, but Paul adds "and of the Lord," for he only expected or desired "imitation" as he himself imitated the Lord Jesus, as he expressly says in 1 Corinthians 11:1. The peril of it all is that people so easily and so readily imitate the preacher when he does not imitate the Lord. The fact of the "election" of the Thessalonians was shown by the character of the message given them and by this sincere acceptance of it (Lightfoot).Having received the word  (δεξαμενο τον λογον). First aorist middle participle of δεχομα, probably simultaneous action (receiving), not antecedent.In much affliction  (εν θλιψε πολλη). Late word, pressure. Tribulation (Latin tribulum) from θλιβω, to press hard on. Christianity has glorified this word. It occurs in some Christian papyrus letters in this same sense. Runs all through the N.T. (2 Thessalonians 1:4; Romans 5:3). Paul had his share of them (Colossians 1:24; 2 Corinthians 2:4) and so he understands how to sympathize with the Thessalonians (1 Thessalonians 3:3). They suffered after Paul left Thessalonica (1 Thessalonians 2:14).With joy of the Holy Spirit  (μετα χαρας πνευματος αγιου). The Holy Spirit gives the joy in the midst of the tribulations as Paul learned (Romans 5:3). "This paradox of experience" (Moffatt) shines along the pathway of martyrs and saints of Christ.
