<p><b> Imitators of us and of the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμητα ημων κα του κυριου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μιμητης</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-της</span></span> expresses the agent) is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμεομα</span></span>, to imitate and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμιχ</span></span>, actor). Old word, more than "followers," in the N.T. only six times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:6">1 Thessalonians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:14">1 Thessalonians 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:16">1 Corinthians 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:1">1 Corinthians 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:1">Ephesians 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:12">Hebrews 6:12</span>). Again Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>, to become, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span>, to be. It is a daring thing to expect people to "imitate" the preacher, but Paul adds "and of the Lord," for he only expected or desired "imitation" as he himself imitated the Lord Jesus, as he expressly says in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:1">1 Corinthians 11:1</span>. The peril of it all is that people so easily and so readily imitate the preacher when he does not imitate the Lord. The fact of the "election" of the Thessalonians was shown by the character of the message given them and by this sincere acceptance of it (Lightfoot).</p>
<p><b>Having received the word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεξαμενο τον λογον</span></span>). First aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεχομα</span></span>, probably simultaneous action (receiving), not antecedent.</p>
<p><b>In much affliction </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν θλιψε πολλη</span></span>). Late word, pressure. Tribulation (Latin <i>tribulum</i>) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιβω</span></span>, to press hard on. Christianity has glorified this word. It occurs in some Christian papyrus letters in this same sense. Runs all through the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:4">2 Thessalonians 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:3">Romans 5:3</span>). Paul had his share of them (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:4">2 Corinthians 2:4</span>) and so he understands how to sympathize with the Thessalonians (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:3">1 Thessalonians 3:3</span>). They suffered after Paul left Thessalonica (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:14">1 Thessalonians 2:14</span>).</p>
<p><b>With joy of the Holy Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα χαρας πνευματος αγιου</span></span>). The Holy Spirit gives the joy in the midst of the tribulations as Paul learned (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:3">Romans 5:3</span>). "This paradox of experience" (Moffatt) shines along the pathway of martyrs and saints of Christ. </p>
