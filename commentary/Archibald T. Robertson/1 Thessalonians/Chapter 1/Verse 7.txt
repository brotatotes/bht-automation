<p><b> So that ye became </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε γενεσθα υμας</span></span>). Definite result expressed by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span> and the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσθα</span></span> (second aorist middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>) as is common in the <i>Koine</i>.</p>
<p><b>An ensample </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπον</span></span>). So B D, but Aleph A C have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπους</span></span> (plural). The singular looks at the church as a whole, the plural as individuals like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμας</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τυπος</span></span> is an old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπτω</span></span>, to strike, and so the mark of a blow, print as in John <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+20:25">1 Thessalonians 20:25</span>. Then the figure formed by the blow, image as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:43">Acts 7:43</span>. Then the mould or form (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:17">Romans 6:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:25">Acts 23:25</span>). Then an example or pattern as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:44">Acts 7:44</span>, to be imitated as here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:17">Philippians 3:17</span>, etc. It was a great compliment for the church in Thessalonica to be already a model for believers in Macedonia and Achaia. Our word <i>type</i> for printers is this same word with one of its meanings. Note separate article with both Macedonia (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη Μακεδονια</span></span>) and Achaia (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη Αχαια</span></span>) treated as separate provinces as they were. </p>
