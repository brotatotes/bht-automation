 So that ye became  (ωστε γενεσθα υμας). Definite result expressed by ωστε and the infinitive γενεσθα (second aorist middle of γινομα) as is common in the Koine.An ensample  (τυπον). So B D, but Aleph A C have τυπους (plural). The singular looks at the church as a whole, the plural as individuals like υμας. Τυπος is an old word from τυπτω, to strike, and so the mark of a blow, print as in John 1 Thessalonians 20:25. Then the figure formed by the blow, image as in Acts 7:43. Then the mould or form (Romans 6:17; Acts 23:25). Then an example or pattern as in Acts 7:44, to be imitated as here, Philippians 3:17, etc. It was a great compliment for the church in Thessalonica to be already a model for believers in Macedonia and Achaia. Our word type for printers is this same word with one of its meanings. Note separate article with both Macedonia (τη Μακεδονια) and Achaia (τη Αχαια) treated as separate provinces as they were.
