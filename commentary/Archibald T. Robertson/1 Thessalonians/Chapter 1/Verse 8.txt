<p><b> From you hath sounded forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφ' υμων εξηχητα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηχεω</span></span>, late compound verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ, ηχοσ, ηχω, ηχη</span></span>, our echo) to sound out of a trumpet or of thunder, to reverberate like our echo. Nowhere else in the N.T. So "from you" as a sounding board or radio transmitting station (to use a modern figure). It marks forcibly "both the clear and the persuasive nature of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος του Κυριου</span></span>" (Ellicott). This phrase, the word of the Lord, may be subjective with the Lord as its author or objective with the Lord as the object. It is both. It is a graphic picture with a pardonable touch of hyperbole (Moffatt) for Thessalonica was a great commercial and political centre for disseminating the news of salvation (on the Egnation Way).</p>
<p><b>But in every place </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' εν παντ τοπω</span></span>). In contrast to Macedonia and Achaia. The sentence would naturally stop here, but Paul is dictating rapidly and earnestly and goes on.</p>
<p><b>Your faith to God-ward </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η πιστις υμων η προς τον θεον</span></span>). Literally,</p>
<p><b>the faith of you that toward the God </b>. The repeated article makes clear that their faith is now directed toward the true God and not toward the idols from which they had turned (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:10">1 Thessalonians 1:10</span>).</p>
<p><b>Is gone forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεληλυθεν</span></span>). Second perfect active indicative of old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξερχομα</span></span>, to go out, state of completion like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηχητα</span></span> above.</p>
<p><b>So that we need not to speak anything </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε μη χρειαν εχειν ημας λαλειν τ</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hωστε</span></span> with the infinitive for actual result as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:7">1 Thessalonians 1:7</span>. No vital distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλειν</span></span> (originally to chatter as of birds) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγειν</span></span>, both being used in the <i>Koine</i> for speaking and preaching (in the N.T.). </p>
