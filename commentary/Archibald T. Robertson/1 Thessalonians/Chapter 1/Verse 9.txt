 They themselves  (αυτο). The men of Macedonia, voluntarily.Report  (απαγγελλουσιν). Linear present active indicative, keep on reporting.What manner of entering in  (οποιαν εισοδον). What sort of entrance, qualitative relative in an indirect question.We had  (εσχομεν). Second aorist active (ingressive) indicative of the common verb εχω.And how  (κα πως). Here the interrogative adverb πως in this part of the indirect question. This part about "them" (you) as the first part about Paul. The verb επιστρεφω is an old verb for turning and is common in the Acts for Gentiles turning to God, as here from idols, though not by Paul again in this sense. In Galatians 4:9 Paul uses it for turning to the weak and beggarly elements of Judaism.From idols  (απο των ειδολων). Old word from ειδος (figure) for image or likeness and then for the image of a heathen god (our idol). Common in the LXX in this sense. In Acts 14:15 Paul at Lystra urged the peopleto turn from these vain things to the living God  (απο τουτων των ματαιων επιστρεφειν επ θεον ζωντα), using the same verb επιστρεφειν. Here also Paul has a like idea,to serve a living and true God  (δουλευειν θεω ζωντ κα αληθινω). No article, it is true, but should be translated "the living and true God" (cf. Acts 14:15). Not "dead" like the idols from which they turned, but alive and genuine (αληθινος, not αληθης).
