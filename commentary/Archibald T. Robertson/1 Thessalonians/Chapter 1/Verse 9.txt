<p><b> They themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτο</span></span>). The men of Macedonia, voluntarily.</p>
<p><b>Report </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαγγελλουσιν</span></span>). Linear present active indicative, keep on reporting.</p>
<p><b>What manner of entering in </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οποιαν εισοδον</span></span>). What sort of entrance, qualitative relative in an indirect question.</p>
<p><b>We had </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσχομεν</span></span>). Second aorist active (ingressive) indicative of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>And how </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα πως</span></span>). Here the interrogative adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πως</span></span> in this part of the indirect question. This part about "them" (you) as the first part about Paul. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστρεφω</span></span> is an old verb for turning and is common in the Acts for Gentiles turning to God, as here from idols, though not by Paul again in this sense. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:9">Galatians 4:9</span> Paul uses it for turning to the weak and beggarly elements of Judaism.</p>
<p><b>From idols </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο των ειδολων</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδος</span></span> (figure) for image or likeness and then for the image of a heathen god (our <i>idol</i>). Common in the LXX in this sense. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:15">Acts 14:15</span> Paul at Lystra urged the people</p>
<p><b>to turn from these vain things to the living God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο τουτων των ματαιων επιστρεφειν επ θεον ζωντα</span></span>), using the same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστρεφειν</span></span>. Here also Paul has a like idea,</p>
<p><b>to serve a living and true God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλευειν θεω ζωντ κα αληθινω</span></span>). No article, it is true, but should be translated "the living and true God" (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:15">Acts 14:15</span>). Not "dead" like the idols from which they turned, but alive and genuine (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθινος</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθης</span></span>). </p>
