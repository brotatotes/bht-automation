<p><b> How holily and righteously and unblameably </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως οσιως κα δικαιως κα αμεμπτως</span></span>). Paul calls the Thessalonians and God as witnesses (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρες</span></span>) to his life toward you the believers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν τοις πιστευουσιν</span></span>) dative of personal interest. He employs three common adverbs that show how holily toward God and how righteously toward men so that they did not blame him and his associates in either respect. So there is a reason for each adverb. All this argues that Paul spent a considerable time in Thessalonica, more than the three sabbaths mentioned by Luke. The pastor ought to live so that his life will bear close inspection. </p>
