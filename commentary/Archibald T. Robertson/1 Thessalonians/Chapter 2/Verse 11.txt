<p><b> As a father with his own children </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως πατηρ τεκνα εαυτου</span></span>). Change from the figure of the mother-nurse in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:7">1 Thessalonians 2:7</span>. There is ellipse of a principal verb with the participles <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλουντεσ, παραμυθουμενοι, μαρτυρουμενο</span></span>. Lightfoot suggests <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενουθετουμεν</span></span> (we admonished) or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενηθημεν</span></span> (we became). The three participles give three phases of the minister's preaching (exhorting, encouraging or consoling, witnessing or testifying). They are all old verbs, but only the first (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλεω</span></span>) is common in the N.T. </p>
