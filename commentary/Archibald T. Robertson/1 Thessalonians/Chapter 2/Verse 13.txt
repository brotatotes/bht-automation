<p><b> And for this cause we also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα δια τουτο κα ημεις</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> twice. We as well as you are grateful for the way the gospel was received in Thessalonica.</p>
<p><b>Without ceasing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδιαλειπτως</span></span>). Late adverb for which see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:2">1 Thessalonians 1:2</span> and for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστουμεν</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:2">1 Thessalonians 1:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>The word of the message </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογον ακοης</span></span>). Literally,</p>
<p><b>the word of </b> hearing, as in Sir. 42:1 and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:2">Hebrews 4:2</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λογος της ακοης</span></span>, the word marked by hearing (genitive case), the word which you heard. Here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θεου</span></span> (of God) added as a second descriptive genitive which Paul expands and justifies.</p>
<p><b>Ye received it so </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαβοντες</span></span>) and</p>
<p><b>accepted or welcomed it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδεξασθε</span></span>) so,</p>
<p><b>not as the word of men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου λογου ανθρωπων</span></span>),</p>
<p><b>but as the word of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα λογον θεου</span></span>),</p>
<p><b>as it is in truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως αληθως εστιν</span></span>). This last clause is literally,</p>
<p><b>as it truly is </b>. Paul had not a doubt that he was proclaiming God's message. Should any preacher preach his doubts if he has any? God's message can be found and Paul found it.</p>
<p><b>Worketh in you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργειτα εν υμιν</span></span>). Perhaps middle voice of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν, εργον</span></span>, work) late verb, not in ancient Greek or LXX, but in papyri and late writers (Polybius, etc.) and in N.T. only by Paul and James. If it is passive, as Milligan thinks, it means "is set in operation," as Polybius has it. The idea then is that the word of God is set in operation in you that believe. </p>
