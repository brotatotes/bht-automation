<p><b> Imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμητα των εκκλησιων του θεου των ουσων εν τη Ιουδαια</span></span>). On <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμητα</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:5">1 Thessalonians 1:5</span>. "This passage, implying an affectionate admiration of the Jewish churches on the part of St. Paul, and thus entirely bearing out the impression produced by the narrative in the Acts, is entirely subversive of the theory maintained by some and based on a misconception of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span>, and by the fiction of the Pseudo-Clementines, of the feud existing between St. Paul and the Twelve" (Lightfoot).</p>
<p><b>In Christ Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Χριστω Ιησου</span></span>). It takes this to make a <i>Christian</i> church of God. Note order here</p>
<p><b>Christ Jesus </b> as compared with</p>
<p><b>Jesus Christ </b> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:3">1 Thessalonians 1:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Ye also--even as they </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υμεισ--κα αυτο</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> twice (correlative use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Countrymen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφυλετων</span></span>). Fellow-countrymen or tribesmen. Late word that refers primarily to Gentiles who no doubt joined the Jews in Thessalonica who instigated the attacks on Paul and Silas so that it "was taken up by the native population, without whose co-operation it would have been powerless" (Lightfoot).</p>
<p><b>Own </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιων</span></span>) here has apparently a weakened force. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο</span></span> here with the ablative both with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφυλετων</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιουδαιων</span></span> after the intransitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαθετε</span></span> (suffered). The persecution of the Christians by the Jews in Judea was known everywhere. </p>
