<p><b> Who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των κα τον Κυριον αποκτειναντων Ιησουν κα τους προφητας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκτεινω</span></span>. Vivid justification of his praise of the churches in Judea. The Jews killed the prophets before the Lord Jesus who reminded them of their guilt (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:29">Matthew 23:29</span>). Paul, as Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>), lays the guilt of the death of Christ on the Jews.</p>
<p><b>And drove us out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ημας εκδιωξαντων</span></span>). An old verb to drive out or banish, to chase out as if a wild beast. Only here in N.T. It is Paul's vivid description of the scene told in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span> when the rabbis and the hoodlums from the agora chased him out of Thessalonica by the help of the politarchs.</p>
<p><b>Please not God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θεω μη αρεσκοντων</span></span>). The rabbis and Jews thought that they were pleasing God by so doing as Paul did when he ravaged the young church in Jerusalem. But Paul knows better now.</p>
<p><b>And are contrary to all men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα πασιν ανθρωποις εναντιων</span></span>). Dative case with the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εναντιων</span></span> (old and common word, face to face, opposite). It seems like a bitter word about Paul's countrymen whom he really loved (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:1-5">Romans 9:1-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:1-6">Romans 10:1-6</span>), but Paul knew only too well the middle wall of partition between Jew and Gentile as he shows in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span> and which only the Cross of Christ can break down. Tacitus (<i>Hist</i>. V. 5) says that the Jews are <i>adversus omnes alios hostile odium</i>. </p>
