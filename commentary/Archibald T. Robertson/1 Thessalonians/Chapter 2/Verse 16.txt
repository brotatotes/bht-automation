<p><b> Forbidding us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωλυοντων ημας</span></span>). Explanatory participle of the idea in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εναντιων</span></span>. They show their hostility to Paul at every turn. Right here in Corinth, where Paul is when he writes, they had already shown venomous hostility toward Paul as Luke makes plain (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:6">Acts 18:6</span>). They not simply oppose his work among the Jews, but also to the Gentiles (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνεσ</span></span>, nations outside of the Abrahamic covenant as they understood it).</p>
<p><b>That they may be saved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα σωθωσιν</span></span>). Final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> with first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωζω</span></span> old verb to save. It was the only hope of the Gentiles, Christ alone and not the mystery-religions offered any real hope.</p>
<p><b>To fill up their sins alway </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το αναπληρωσα αυτων τας αμαρτιας παντοτε</span></span>). Another example of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το</span></span> and the infinitive as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:12">1 Thessalonians 2:12</span>. It may either be God's conceived plan to allow the Jews to go on and fill up (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπληρωσα</span></span>, note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα</span></span>, fill up full, old verb) or it may be the natural result from the continual (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντοτε</span></span>) sins of the Jews.</p>
<p><b>Is come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφθασεν</span></span>). First aorist (timeless aorist) active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθανω</span></span> which no longer means to come before as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span> where alone in the N.T. it retains the old idea of coming before. Some MSS. have the perfect active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφθακεν</span></span>, prophetic perfect of realization already. Frame translates it: "But the wrath has come upon them at last." This is the most likely meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τελος</span></span>. Paul vividly foresees and foretells the final outcome of this attitude of hate on the part of the Jews. <i>Tristis exitus</i>, Bengel calls it. Paul speaks out of a sad experience. </p>
