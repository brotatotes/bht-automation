<p><b> Crown of glorying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στεφανος καυχησεως</span></span>). When a king or conqueror came on a visit he was given a chaplet of glorying. Paul is answering the insinuation that he did not really wish to come.</p>
<p><b>At his coming </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη αυτου παρουσια</span></span>). This word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρουσια</span></span> is untechnical (just <i>presence</i> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρειμ</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:9">2 Thessalonians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:17">1 Corinthians 16:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:6">2 Corinthians 7:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:26">Philippians 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:12">Philippians 2:12</span>. But here (also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1">2 Thessalonians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:23">1 Corinthians 15:23</span>) we have the technical sense of the second coming of Christ. Deissmann (<i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, pp. 372ff.) notes that the word in the papyri is almost technical for the arrival of a king or ruler who expects to receive his "crown of coming." The Thessalonians, Paul says, will be his crown, glory, joy when Jesus comes. </p>
