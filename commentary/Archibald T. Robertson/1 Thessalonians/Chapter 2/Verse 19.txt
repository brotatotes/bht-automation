 Crown of glorying  (στεφανος καυχησεως). When a king or conqueror came on a visit he was given a chaplet of glorying. Paul is answering the insinuation that he did not really wish to come.At his coming  (εν τη αυτου παρουσια). This word παρουσια is untechnical (just presence from παρειμ) in 2 Thessalonians 2:9; 1 Corinthians 16:17; 2 Corinthians 7:6; 2 Corinthians 10:10; Philippians 1:26; Philippians 2:12. But here (also 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 1 Thessalonians 4:15; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; 2 Thessalonians 2:1; 2 Thessalonians 2:8; 1 Corinthians 15:23) we have the technical sense of the second coming of Christ. Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, pp. 372ff.) notes that the word in the papyri is almost technical for the arrival of a king or ruler who expects to receive his "crown of coming." The Thessalonians, Paul says, will be his crown, glory, joy when Jesus comes.
