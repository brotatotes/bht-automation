<p><b> But having suffered before </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα προπαθοντες</span></span>). Strong adversative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span>, antithesis to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κενη</span></span>. Appeal to his personal experiences in Thessalonica known to them (<b> as ye know </b>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως οιδατε</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προπασχω</span></span>, old compound verb, but here alone in the N.T. The force of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ-</span></span> (before) is carried over to the next verb. The participle may be regarded as temporal (Ellicott) or concessive (Moffatt).</p>
<p><b>And been shamefully entreated in Philippi </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υβρισθεντες εν Φιλιπποις</span></span>). First aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υβριζω</span></span>, old verb, to treat insolently. "More than the bodily suffering it was the personal indignity that had been offered to him as a Roman citizen" (Milligan), for which account see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:16-40">Acts 16:16-40</span>, an interesting example of how Acts and the Epistles throw light on each other. Luke tells how Paul resented the treatment accorded to him as a Roman citizen and here Paul shows that the memory still rankled in his bosom.</p>
<p><b>We waxed bold in our God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαρρησιασαμεθα εν τω θεω ημων</span></span>). Ingressive first aorist middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησιαζομα</span></span>, old deponent verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησια</span></span> (full story, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν-, ρησια</span></span>). In his reply to Festus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:26">Acts 26:26</span>) Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησιαζομενος λαλω</span></span>,</p>
<p><b>being bold I speak </b>, while here he has</p>
<p><b>we waxed bold to speak </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαρρησιασαμεθα λαλησα</span></span>). The insult in Philippi did not close Paul's mouth, but had precisely the opposite effect "in our God." It was not wild fanaticism, but determined courage and confidence in God that spurred Paul to still greater boldness in Thessalonica,</p>
<p><b>unto you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς υμας</span></span>), be the consequences what they might,</p>
<p><b>the gospel of God in much conflict </b>, (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ευαγγελιον του θεου εν πολλω αγων</span></span>). This figure of the athletic games (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγων</span></span>) may refer to outward conflict like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:30">Philippians 1:30</span> or inward anxiety (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1">Colossians 2:1</span>). He had both in Thessalonica. </p>
