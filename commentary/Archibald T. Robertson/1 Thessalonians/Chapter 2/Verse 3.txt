<p><b> Exhortation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακλησις</span></span>). Persuasive discourse, calling to one's side, for admonition, encouragement, or comfort.</p>
<p><b>Not of error </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εκ πλανης</span></span>). This word is same as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλαναω</span></span>, to lead astray (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:13">2 Timothy 3:13</span>) like Latin <i>errare</i>. Passive idea of</p>
<p><b>error </b> here rather than deceit. That is seen in</p>
<p><b>nor in guile </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε εν δολω</span></span>) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δελω</span></span>, to catch with bait. Paul is keenly sensitive against charges against the correctness of his message and the purity of his life.</p>
<p><b>Nor of uncleanness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε εξ ακαθαρσιας</span></span>). "This disclaimer, startling as it may seem, was not unneeded amidst the impurities consecrated by the religions of the day" (Lightfoot). There was no necessary connection in the popular mind between religion and morals. The ecstatic initiations in some of the popular religions were grossly sensual. </p>
