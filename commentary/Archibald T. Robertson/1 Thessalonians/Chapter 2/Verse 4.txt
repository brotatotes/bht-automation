<p><b> But even as we have been approved by God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα καθως δεδοκιμασμεθα υπο του θεου</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμαζω</span></span>, old verb to put to the test, but here the tense for completed state means tested and proved and so approved by God. Paul here claims the call of God for his ministry and the seal of God's blessing on his work and also for that of Silas and Timothy.</p>
<p><b>To be entrusted with the gospel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευθηνα το ευαγγελιον</span></span>). First aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>, common verb for believing, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span> (faith), but here to entrust rather than to trust. The accusative of the thing is retained in the passive according to regular Greek idiom as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:17">1 Corinthians 9:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:7">Galatians 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:2">Romans 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:11">1 Timothy 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:3">Titus 1:3</span>, though the active had the dative of the person.</p>
<p><b>So we speak </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως λαλουμεν</span></span>). Simple, yet confident claim of loyalty to God's call and message. Surely this should be the ambition of every preacher of the gospel of God.</p>
<p><b>Not as pleasing men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ ως ανθρωποις αρεσκοντες</span></span>). Dative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρεσκω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:10">Galatians 1:10</span>. Few temptations assail the preacher more strongly than this one to please men, even if God is not pleased, though with the dim hope that God will after all condone or overlook. Nothing but experience will convince some preachers how fickle is popular favour and how often it is at the cost of failure to please God. And yet the preacher wishes to win men to Christ. It is all as subtle as it is deceptive. God tests our hearts (the very verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμαζω</span></span> used in the beginning of this verse) and he is the only one whose approval matters in the end of the day (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:5">1 Corinthians 4:5</span>). </p>
