<p><b> Using words of flattery </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν λογω κολακειας</span></span>). Literally,</p>
<p><b>in speech of flattery or fawning </b>. Old word, only here in N.T., from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολακς</span></span>, a flatterer. An Epicurean, Philodemus, wrote a work <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Περ Κολακειας</span></span> (Concerning Flattery). Milligan (<i>Vocabulary</i>, etc.) speaks of "the selfish conduct of too many of the rhetoricians of the day," conduct extremely repugnant to Paul. The third time (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:1">1 Thessalonians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:5">1 Thessalonians 2:5</span>) he appeals to their knowledge of his work in Thessalonica. Frame suggests "cajolery."</p>
<p><b>Nor a cloke of covetousness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτε προφασε πλεονεξιας</span></span>). Pretext (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφασις</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφαινω</span></span>, to show forth, or perhaps from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ-φημ</span></span>, to speak forth). This is the charge of self-interest rather than the mere desire to please people. Pretext of greediness is Frame's translation. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πλεονεξια</span></span> is merely "having more" from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεονεκτης</span></span>, one eager for more, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεονεκτεω</span></span>, to have more, then to over-reach, all old words, all with bad meaning as the result of the desire for more. In a preacher this sin is especially fatal. Paul feels so strongly his innocence of this charge that he calls God as witness as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:23">2 Corinthians 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:1">Romans 9:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:8">Philippians 1:8</span>, a solemn oath for his own veracity. </p>
