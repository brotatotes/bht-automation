<p><b> Nor seeking glory of men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτε ζητουντες εξ ανθρωπων δοξαν</span></span>). "Upon the repudiation of covetousness follows naturally the repudiation of worldly ambition" (Milligan). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:19">Acts 20:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:5">2 Corinthians 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:2">Ephesians 4:2</span>. This third disclaimer is as strong as the other two. Paul and his associates had not tried to extract praise or glory out of (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span>) men.</p>
<p><b>Neither from you nor from others </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτε αφ' υμων ουτε αφ' αλλων</span></span>). He widens the negation to include those outside of the church circles and changes the preposition from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span> (out of) to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> (from).</p>
<p><b>When we might have been burdensome, as apostles of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμενο εν βαρε εινα ως Χριστου αποστολο</span></span>). Westcott and Hort put this clause in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:7">1 Thessalonians 2:7</span>. Probably a concessive participle,</p>
<p><b>though being able to be in a position of weight </b> (either in matter of finance or of dignity, or a burden on your funds or "men of weight" as Moffatt suggests). Milligan suggests that Paul "plays here on the double sense of the phrase" like the Latin proverb: <i>Honos propter onus</i>. So he adds, including Silas and Timothy,</p>
<p><b>as Christ's apostles </b>, as missionaries clearly, whether in the technical sense or not (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:4">Acts 14:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:14">Acts 14:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23">2 Corinthians 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:13">2 Corinthians 11:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:7">Romans 16:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2">Revelation 2:2</span>). They were entitled to pay as "Christ's apostles" (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:1">1 Thessalonians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:7">2 Corinthians 11:7</span>), though they had not asked for it. </p>
