 But we were gentle in the midst of you  (αλλα εγενηθημεν νηπιο εν μεσω υμων). Note εγενηθημεν (became), not ημεθα (were). This rendering follows ηπιο instead of νηπιο (Aleph B D C Vulg. Boh.) which is clearly correct, though Dibelius, Moffatt, Ellicott, Weiss prefer ηπιο as making better sense. Dibelius terms νηπιο unmoglich (impossible), but surely that is too strong. Paul is fond of the word νηπιο (babes). Lightfoot admits that he here works the metaphor to the limit in his passion, but does not mar it as Ellicott holds.As when a nurse cherishes her own children  (ως εαν τροφος θαλπη τα εαυτης τεκνα). This comparative clause with ως εαν (Mark 4:26; Galatians 6:10 without εαν or αν) and the subjunctive (Robertson, Grammar, p. 968) has a sudden change of the metaphor, as is common with Paul (1 Timothy 5:24; 2 Corinthians 3:13) frombabes  tonurse  (τροφος), old word, here only in the N.T., from τρεφω, to nourish, τροφη, nourishment. It is really the mother-nurse "who suckles and nurses her own children" (Lightfoot), a use found in Sophocles, and a picture of Paul's tender affection for the Thessalonians. Θαλπω is an old word to keep warm, to cherish with tender love, to foster. In N.T. only here and Ephesians 5:29.
