<p><b> But we were gentle in the midst of you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα εγενηθημεν νηπιο εν μεσω υμων</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενηθημεν</span></span> (became), not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεθα</span></span> (were). This rendering follows <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηπιο</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηπιο</span></span> (Aleph B D C Vulg. Boh.) which is clearly correct, though Dibelius, Moffatt, Ellicott, Weiss prefer <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηπιο</span></span> as making better sense. Dibelius terms <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηπιο</span></span> <i>unmoglich</i> (impossible), but surely that is too strong. Paul is fond of the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηπιο</span></span> (babes). Lightfoot admits that he here works the metaphor to the limit in his passion, but does not mar it as Ellicott holds.</p>
<p><b>As when a nurse cherishes her own children </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως εαν τροφος θαλπη τα εαυτης τεκνα</span></span>). This comparative clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως εαν</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:26">Mark 4:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:10">Galatians 6:10</span> without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span>) and the subjunctive (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 968) has a sudden change of the metaphor, as is common with Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:24">1 Timothy 5:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:13">2 Corinthians 3:13</span>) from</p>
<p><b>babes </b> to</p>
<p><b>nurse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τροφος</span></span>), old word, here only in the N.T., from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρεφω</span></span>, to nourish, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τροφη</span></span>, nourishment. It is really the mother-nurse "who suckles and nurses her own children" (Lightfoot), a use found in Sophocles, and a picture of Paul's tender affection for the Thessalonians. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θαλπω</span></span> is an old word to keep warm, to cherish with tender love, to foster. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:29">Ephesians 5:29</span>. </p>
