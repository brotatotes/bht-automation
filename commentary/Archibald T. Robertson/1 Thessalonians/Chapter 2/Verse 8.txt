<p><b> Even so, being affectionately desirous of you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως ομειρομενο υμων</span></span>). Clearly the correct text rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιμειρομενο</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιμειρω</span></span>, old verb to long for. But the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομειρομα</span></span> (Westcott and Hort <i>om</i>., smooth breathing) occurs nowhere else except MSS. in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+3:21">Job 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+62:2">Psalms 62:2</span> (Symmachus) and the Lycaonian sepulchral inscription (4th cent. A.D.) about the sorrowing parents <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομειρομενο περ παιδος</span></span>,</p>
<p><b>greatly desiring their son </b> (Moulton and Milligan, <i>Vocabulary</i>). Moulton suggests that it comes from a root <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σμερ</span></span>, remember, and that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο-</span></span> is a derelict preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο-δυρομαι, ο-κελλω, ω-κεανος</span></span>. Wohlenberg (Zahn, <i>Kommentar</i>) calls the word "a term of endearment," "derived from the language of the nursery" (Milligan).</p>
<p><b>We were well pleased </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηυδοκουμεν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδοκεω</span></span>, common verb in later Greek and in N.T. (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>), picturing Paul's idea of their attitude while in Thessalonica. Paul often has it with the infinitive as here.</p>
<p><b>To impart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταδουνα</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταδιδωμ</span></span>, old verb to share with (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:11">Luke 3:11</span>). Possible zeugma with</p>
<p><b>souls </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχας</span></span>), though Lightfoot renders "lives." Paul and his associates held nothing back.</p>
<p><b>Because ye were become very dear to us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διοτ αγαπητο ημιν εγενηθητε</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διοτ</span></span> (double cause, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια, οτ</span></span>, for that), use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span> again for become, and dative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημιν</span></span> with verbal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπητο</span></span>, beloved and so dear. A beautiful picture of the growth of Paul's affection for them as should be true with every pastor. </p>
