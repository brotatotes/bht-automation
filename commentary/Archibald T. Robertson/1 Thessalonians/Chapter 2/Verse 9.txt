<p><b> Travail </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μοχθον</span></span>). Old word for difficult labour, harder than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπος</span></span> (toil). In the N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:8">2 Thessalonians 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:27">2 Corinthians 11:27</span>. Note accusative case here though genitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνημονευω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:3">1 Thessalonians 1:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Night and day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυκτος κα ημερας</span></span>). Genitive case, both by day and by night, perhaps beginning before dawn and working after dark. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:10">1 Thessalonians 3:10</span>.</p>
<p><b>That we might not burden any of you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς το μη επιβαρησα τινα υμων</span></span>). Use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> with the articular infinitive to express purpose (only four times by Paul). The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιβαρεω</span></span> is late, but in the papyri and inscriptions for laying a burden (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρος</span></span>) on (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι-</span></span>) one. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:8">2 Thessalonians 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:5">2 Corinthians 2:5</span>. Paul boasted of his financial independence where he was misunderstood as in Thessalonica and Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span>), though he vindicated his right to remuneration.</p>
<p><b>We preached </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκηρυξαμεν</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>We heralded </b> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυξ</span></span>, herald) to you, common verb for preach. </p>
