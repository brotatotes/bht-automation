 Our God and Father himself  (αυτος ο θεος κα πατηρ ημων). Note one article with both substantives for one person.And our Lord Jesus  (κα ο Κυριος ημων Ιησους). Separate article here with Ιησους. In Titus 2:13; 2 Peter 1:1 only one article (not two) treating "our God and Saviour Jesus Christ" as one just like "our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ" in 2 Peter 1:11; 2 Peter 2:20; 2 Peter 3:18.Direct our way  (κατευθυνα την οδον ημων). First aorist optative (acute accent on penult, not circumflex first aorist active infinitive) of κατευθυνω, old verb to make straight path. Singular verb also, though both God and Christ mentioned as subject (unity in the Godhead). Apart from μη γενοιτο ( may it not come to pass ) the optative in a wish of the third person is found in N.T. only in 1 Thessalonians 3:11; 1 Thessalonians 3:12; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; 2 Thessalonians 2:17; 2 Thessalonians 3:5; 2 Thessalonians 3:16; Romans 15:5; Romans 15:13.
