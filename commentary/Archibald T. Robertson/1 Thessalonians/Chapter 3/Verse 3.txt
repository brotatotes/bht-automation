<p><b> That no man be moved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μηδενα σαινεσθα</span></span>). Epexegetical articular infinitive in accusative case of general reference. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σαινω</span></span> is old word to wag the tail, to flatter, beguile and this sense suits here (only N.T. example).

<p><b>We are appointed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κειμεθα</span></span>). Present middle, used here as passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>. We Christians are set</p>
<p><b>hereunto </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τουτο</span></span>) to be beguiled by tribulations. We must resist. </p>
