<p><b> We told you beforehand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προελεγομεν υμιν</span></span>). Imperfect active, we used to tell you beforehand. Old verb, rare in N.T. (only in Paul).</p>
<p><b>That we are to suffer persecution </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ μελλομεν θλιβεσθα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μελλω</span></span> and present passive infinitive. Not mere prediction, but God's appointed will as it turned out in Thessalonica. </p>
