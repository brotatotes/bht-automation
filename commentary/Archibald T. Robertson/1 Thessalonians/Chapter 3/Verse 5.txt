<p><b> That I might know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το γνωνα</span></span>). Paul's common idiom (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:2">1 Thessalonians 3:2</span>), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το</span></span> and the infinitive of purpose (second aorist ingressive active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, come to know).</p>
<p><b>Lest by any means the tempter had tempted you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πως επειρασεν υμας ο πειραζων</span></span>). Findlay takes this as a question with negative answer, but most likely negative final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πως</span></span> about a past action with aorist indicative according to the classic idiom as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:2">Galatians 2:2</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πωσ--εδραμον</span></span>) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:11">Galatians 4:11</span> after verb of fearing (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 988). It is a fear that the thing may turn out to be so about the past.</p>
<p><b>Should be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενητα</span></span>). Here the usual construction appears (aorist subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πως</span></span>) about the future. </p>
