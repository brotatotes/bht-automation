 Finally  (λοιπον). Accusative of general reference of λοιπος, as for the rest. It does not mean actual conclusion, but merely a colloquial expression pointing towards the end (Milligan) as in 2 Corinthians 13:11; 2 Timothy 4:8. So το λοιπον in 2 Thessalonians 3:1; Philippians 3:1; Philippians 4:8.We beseech  (ερωτωμεν). Not "question" as in ancient Greek, but as often in N.T. (1 Thessalonians 5:12; 2 Thessalonians 2:1; Philippians 4:3) and also in papyri to make urgent request of one.How ye ought  (το πως δε υμας). Literally, explanatory articular indirect question (το πως) after παρελαβητε according to common classic idiom in Luke (Luke 1:62; Luke 22:2; Luke 22:4; Luke 22:23; Luke 22:24) and Paul (Romans 8:26).That ye abound  (ινα περισσευητε). Loose construction of the ινα clause with present subjunctive after two subordinate clauses with καθως (as, even as) to be connected with "beseech and exhort."More and more  (μαλλον). Simplymore , but added to same idea in περισσευητε. See also verse 1 Thessalonians 4:11.
