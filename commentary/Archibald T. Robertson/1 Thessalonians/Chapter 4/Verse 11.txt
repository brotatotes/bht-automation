<p><b> That ye study to be quiet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλοτιμεισθα ησυχαζειν</span></span>). First infinitive dependent on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλουμεν</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:10">1 Thessalonians 4:10</span>, we exhort you), the second on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλοτιμεισθα</span></span> (old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλοτιμος</span></span>, fond of honour, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλοσ, τιμη</span></span>). The notion of ambition appears in each of the three N.T. examples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:11">1 Thessalonians 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:9">2 Corinthians 5:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:20">Romans 5:20</span>), but it is ambition to do good, not evil. The word ambition is Latin (<i>ambitio</i> from <i>ambo, ire</i>), to go on both sides to accomplish one's aims and often evil). A preacher devoid of ambition lacks power. There was a restless spirit in Thessalonica because of the misapprehension of the second coming. So Paul urges an ambition to be quiet or calm, to lead a quiet life, including silence (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:18">Acts 11:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>To do your own business </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρασσειν τα ιδια</span></span>). Present infinitive like the others, to have the habit of attending to their own affairs (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα ιδια</span></span>). This restless meddlesomeness here condemned Paul alludes to again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:11">2 Thessalonians 3:11</span> in plainer terms. It is amazing how much wisdom people have about other people's affairs and so little interest in their own.</p>
<p><b>To work with your own hands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργαζεσθα ταις χερσιν υμων</span></span>). Instrumental case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χερσιν</span></span>). Paul gave a new dignity to manual labour by precept and example. There were "pious" idlers in the church in Thessalonica who were promoting trouble. He had commanded them when with them. </p>
