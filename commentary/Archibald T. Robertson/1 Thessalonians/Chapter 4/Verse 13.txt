<p><b> We would not have </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου θελομεν</span></span>). We do not wish.</p>
<p><b>You ignorant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμας αγνοειν</span></span>). Old word, not to know (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνο-</span></span>, root of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>). No advantage in ignorance of itself.</p>
<p><b>Concerning them that fall asleep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ των κοιμωμενων</span></span>). Present passive (or middle) participle (Aleph B) rather than the perfect passive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεκοιμημενων</span></span> of many later MSS. From old <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοιμαω</span></span>, to put to sleep. Present tense gives idea of repetition, from time to time fall asleep. Greeks and Romans used this figure of sleep for death as Jesus does (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:11">John 11:11</span>) and N.T. generally (cf. our word <i>cemetery</i>). Somehow the Thessalonians had a false notion about the dead in relation to the second coming.</p>
<p><b>Even as the rest which have no hope </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως ο λοιπο ο μη εχοντες ελπιδα</span></span>). This picture of the hopelessness of the pagan world about the future life is amply illustrated in ancient writings and particularly by inscriptions on tombs (Milligan). Some few pagans clung to this hope, but most had none. </p>
