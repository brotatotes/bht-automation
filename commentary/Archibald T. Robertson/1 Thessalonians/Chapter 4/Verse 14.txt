<p><b> For if we believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε γαρ πιστευομεν</span></span>). Condition of first class, assuming the death and resurrection of Jesus to be true.</p>
<p><b>In Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του Ιησου</span></span>). Literally, through or by means of Jesus. It is amphibolous in position and can be taken either with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους κοιμηθεντας</span></span> (that are fallen asleep in or through Jesus) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κοιμηθεντες εν Χριστω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:18">1 Corinthians 15:18</span> and probably correct or with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξε</span></span> (through Jesus with God).</p>
<p><b>With him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν αυτω</span></span>). Together with Jesus. Jesus is the connecting link (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) for those that sleep (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοιμηθεντας</span></span> first aorist passive, but with middle sense) and their resurrection. </p>
