<p><b> By the word of the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν λογω Κυριου</span></span>). We do not know to what word of the Lord Jesus Paul refers, probably Paul meaning only the point in the teaching of Christ rather than a quotation. He may be claiming a direct revelation on this important matter as about the Lord's Supper in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23">1 Corinthians 11:23</span>. Jesus may have spoken on this subject though it has not been preserved to us (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:1">Mark 9:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>Ye that are alive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις ο ζωντες</span></span>). Paul here includes himself, but this by no means shows that Paul knew that he would be alive at the Parousia of Christ. He was alive, not dead, when he wrote.</p>
<p><b>Shall in no wise precede </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη φθασωμεν</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθανω</span></span>, to come before, to anticipate. This strong negative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span> (double negative) and the subjunctive is the regular idiom (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 929). Hence there was no ground for uneasiness about the dead in Christ. </p>
