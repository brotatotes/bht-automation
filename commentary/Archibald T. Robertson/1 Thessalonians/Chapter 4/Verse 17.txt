<p><b> Then </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επειτα</span></span>). The next step, not the identical time (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε</span></span>), but immediately afterwards.</p>
<p><b>Together with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμα συν αυτοις</span></span>). Note both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμα</span></span> (at the same time) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span> (together with) with the associative instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοις</span></span> (the risen saints).</p>
<p><b>Shall be caught up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαγησομεθα</span></span>). Second future passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαζω</span></span>, old verb to seize, to carry off like Latin <i>rapio</i>.</p>
<p><b>To meet the Lord in the air </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις απαντησιν του Κυριου εις αερα</span></span>). This special Greek idiom is common in the LXX like the Hebrew, but Polybius has it also and it occurs in the papyri (Moulton, <i>Proleg</i>., p. 14, n. 3). This rapture of the saints (both risen and changed) is a glorious climax to Paul's argument of consolation.</p>
<p><b>And so </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουτως</span></span>). This is the outcome, to be forever with the Lord, whether with a return to earth or with an immediate departure for heaven Paul does not say. To be with Christ is the chief hope of Paul's life (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:10">1 Thessalonians 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4">Colossians 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:8">2 Corinthians 5:8</span>). </p>
