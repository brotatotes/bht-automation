<p><b> Your sanctification </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αγιασμος υμων</span></span>). Found only in the Greek Bible and ecclesiastical writers from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιαζω</span></span> and both to take the place of the old words <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιζω, αγισμος</span></span> with their technical ideas of consecration to a god or goddess that did not include holiness in life. So Paul makes a sharp and pointed stand here for the Christian idea of sanctification as being "the will of God" (apposition) and as further explained by the epexegetic infinitive</p>
<p><b>that ye abstain from fornication </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεχεσθα υμας απο της πορνειας</span></span>). Pagan religion did not demand sexual purity of its devotees, the gods and goddesses being grossly immoral. Priestesses were in the temples for the service of the men who came. </p>
