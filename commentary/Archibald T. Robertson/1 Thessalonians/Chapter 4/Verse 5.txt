<p><b>That know not God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα μη ειδοτα τον θεον</span></span>). Second perfect participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span>. The heathen knew gods as licentious as they are themselves, but not God. One of the reasons for the revival of paganism in modern life is professedly this very thing that men wish to get rid of the inhibitions against licentiousness by God. </p>
