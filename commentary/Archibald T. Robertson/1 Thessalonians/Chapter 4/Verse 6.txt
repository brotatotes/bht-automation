<p><b> That no man transgress </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μη υπερβαινειν</span></span>). Old verb to go beyond. Final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το</span></span> (accusative of general reference) and the infinitive (negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>), parallel to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεχεσθα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδενα κτασθα</span></span> above.</p>
<p><b>And wrong his brother </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα πλεονεκτειν τον αδελφον αυτου</span></span>). To take more, to overreach, to take advantage of, to defraud.</p>
<p><b>In the matter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω πραγματ</span></span>). The delicacy of Paul makes him refrain from plainer terms and the context makes it clear enough as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:11">2 Corinthians 7:11</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω πραγματ</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>An avenger </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκδικος</span></span>). Regular term in the papyri for legal avenger. Modern men and women need to remember that God is the avenger for sexual wrongs both in this life and the next. </p>
