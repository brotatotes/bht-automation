<p><b> Admonish the disorderly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουθετειτε τους ατακτους</span></span>). Put sense into the unruly mob who break ranks (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τακτος</span></span>, verbal adjective of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τασσω</span></span>, to keep military order). Recall the idlers from the market-place used against Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span>). This is a challenging task for any leader.</p>
<p><b>Encourage the fainthearted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραμυθεισθε τους ολιγοψυχους</span></span>). Old verb to encourage or console as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:31">John 11:31</span>, though not so common in N.T. as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλεω</span></span>, the compound adjective (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολιγος</span></span>, little or small, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span>, soul), small-souled, little-souled, late word in LXX. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολιγοψυχεω</span></span> occurs in the papyri. Local conditions often cause some to lose heart and wish to drop out, be quitters. These must be held in line.</p>
<p><b>Support the weak </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντεχεσθε των ασθενων</span></span>). Middle voice with genitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντεχω</span></span>, old verb, in N.T. only in middle, to cling to, to hold on to (with genitive). The weak are those tempted to sin (immorality, for instance).</p>
<p><b>Be long-suffering toward all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακροθυμειτε προς παντας</span></span>). These disorderly elements try the patience of the leaders. Hold out with them. What a wonderful ideal Paul here holds up for church leaders! </p>
