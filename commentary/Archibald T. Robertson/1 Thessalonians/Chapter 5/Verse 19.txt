<p><b> Quench not the spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πνευμα μη σβεννυτε</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη</span></span> with the present imperative means to stop doing it or not to have the habit of doing it. It is a bold figure. Some of them were trying to put out the fire of the Holy Spirit, probably the special gifts of the Holy Spirit as verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:20">1 Thessalonians 5:20</span> means. But even so the exercise of these special gifts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:1">1 Thessalonians 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:2-4">2 Corinthians 12:2-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:6-9">Romans 12:6-9</span>) was to be decently (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευσχημονως</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:12">1 Thessalonians 4:12</span>) and in order (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα ταξιν</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:40">1 Corinthians 14:40</span>) and for edification (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς οικοδομην</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:26">1 Corinthians 14:26</span>). Today, as then, there are two extremes about spiritual gifts (cold indifference or wild excess). It is not hard to put out the fire of spiritual fervor and power. </p>
