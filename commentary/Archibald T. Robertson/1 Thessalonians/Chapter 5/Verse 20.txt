<p><b> Despise not prophesyings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητειας μη εξουθενειτε</span></span>). Same construction, stop counting as nothing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουθενεω</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουθεν=ουδεν</span></span>), late form in LXX. Plutarch has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουδενιζω</span></span>. Plural form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητειας</span></span> (accusative). Word means</p>
<p><b>forth-telling </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ-φημ</span></span>) rather than</p>
<p><b>fore-telling </b> and is the chief of the spiritual gifts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:1">1 Thessalonians 5:1</span>) and evidently depreciated in Thessalonica as in Corinth later. </p>
