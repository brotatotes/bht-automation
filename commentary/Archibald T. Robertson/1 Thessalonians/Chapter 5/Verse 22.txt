<p><b> Abstain from every form of evil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο παντος ειδους πονηρου απεχεσθε</span></span>). Present middle (direct) imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ-εχω</span></span> (contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ-εχω</span></span>) and preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> repeated with ablative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:3">1 Thessalonians 4:3</span>. Note use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονηρου</span></span> here for evil without the article, common enough idiom. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ειδος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον</span></span>) naturally means look or appearance as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:23">Luke 3:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:29">Luke 9:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:37">John 5:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:7">2 Corinthians 5:7</span>. But, if so taken, it is not semblance as opposed to reality (Milligan). The papyri give several examples of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδος</span></span> in the sense of class or kind and that idea suits best here. Evil had a way of showing itself even in the spiritual gifts including prophecy. </p>
