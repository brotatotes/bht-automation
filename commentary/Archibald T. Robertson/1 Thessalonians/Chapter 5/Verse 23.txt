<p><b> The God of peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος της ειρηνης</span></span>). The God characterized by peace in his nature, who gladly bestows it also. Common phrase (Milligan) at close of Paul's Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11">2 Corinthians 13:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:33">Romans 15:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:20">Romans 16:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:9">Philippians 4:9</span>) and</p>
<p><b>the Lord of peace </b> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:6">2 Thessalonians 3:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>Sanctify you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιασα υμας</span></span>). First aorist active optative in a wish for the future. New verb in LXX and N.T. for the old <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιζω</span></span>, to render or to declare holy (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιος</span></span>), to consecrate, to separate from things profane.</p>
<p><b>Wholly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολοτελεις</span></span>). Predicate adjective in plural (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολος</span></span>, whole, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελος</span></span>, end), not adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολοτελως</span></span>. Late word in Plutarch, Hexapla, and in inscription A.D. 67 (Moulton and Milligan, <i>Vocabulary</i>). Here alone in N.T. Here it means the whole of each of you, every part of each of you, "through and through" (Luther), qualitatively rather than quantitatively.</p>
<p><b>Your spirit and soul and body </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμων το πνευμα κα η ψυχη κα το σωμα</span></span>). Not necessarily trichotomy as opposed to dichotomy as elsewhere in Paul's Epistles. Both believers and unbelievers have an inner man (soul <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span>, mind <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νους</span></span>, heart <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρδια</span></span>, the inward man <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εσω ανθρωπος</span></span>) and the outer man (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωμα, ο εξω ανθρωπος</span></span>). But the believer has the Holy Spirit of God, the renewed spirit of man (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:11">1 Corinthians 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9-11">Romans 8:9-11</span>).</p>
<p><b>Be preserved entire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολοκληρον τηρηθειη</span></span>). First aorist passive optative in wish for the future. Note singular verb and singular adjective (neuter) showing that Paul conceives of the man as "an undivided whole" (Frame), prayer for the consecration of both body and soul (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:1">1 Thessalonians 5:1</span>). The adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολοκληρον</span></span> is in predicate and is an old form and means complete in all its parts (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολος</span></span>, whole, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κληρος</span></span>, lot or part). There is to be no deficiency in any part. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τελειος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελος</span></span>, end) means final perfection.</p>
<p><b>Without blame </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμεμπτως</span></span>). Old adverb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεμπτος</span></span>, verbal of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεμφομα</span></span>, to blame) only in I Thess. in N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:10">1 Thessalonians 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>). Milligan notes it in certain sepulchral inscriptions discovered in Thessalonica.</p>
<p><b>At the coming </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη παρουσια</span></span>). The Second Coming which was a sustaining hope to Paul as it should be to us and mentioned often in this Epistle (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:19">1 Thessalonians 2:19</span>). </p>
