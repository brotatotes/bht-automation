<p><b> Pray for us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευχεσθε [και] περ ημων</span></span>). He has made his prayer for them. He adds this "human touch" (Frame) and pleads for the prayers of his converts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:1">2 Thessalonians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:2">Colossians 4:2</span>). Probably <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> also is genuine (B D). </p>
