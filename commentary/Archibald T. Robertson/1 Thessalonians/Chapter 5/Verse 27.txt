 I adjure you by the Lord  (ενορκιζω υμας τον Κυριον). Late compound for old ορκιζω (Mark 5:7), to put one on oath, with two accusatives (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 483f.). Occurs in inscriptions.That this epistle be read unto all the brethren  (αναγνωσθηνα την επιστολην πασιν τοις αδελφοις). First aorist passive infinitive of αναγινωσκω with accusative of general reference in an indirect command. Clearly Paul wrote for the church as a whole and wished the epistles read aloud at a public meeting. In this first epistle we see the importance that he attaches to his epistles.
