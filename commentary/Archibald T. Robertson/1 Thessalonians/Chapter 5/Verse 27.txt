<p><b> I adjure you by the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενορκιζω υμας τον Κυριον</span></span>). Late compound for old <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορκιζω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:7">Mark 5:7</span>), to put one on oath, with two accusatives (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 483f.). Occurs in inscriptions.</p>
<p><b>That this epistle be read unto all the brethren </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγνωσθηνα την επιστολην πασιν τοις αδελφοις</span></span>). First aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγινωσκω</span></span> with accusative of general reference in an indirect command. Clearly Paul wrote for the church as a whole and wished the epistles read aloud at a public meeting. In this first epistle we see the importance that he attaches to his epistles. </p>
