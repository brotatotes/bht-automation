<p><b> So then </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα ουν</span></span>). Two inferential particles, accordingly therefore, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:15">2 Thessalonians 2:15</span> and only in Paul in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Let us not sleep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη καθευδωμεν</span></span>). Present active subjunctive (volitive), let us not go on sleeping.</p>
<p><b>Let us watch </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γρηγορωμεν</span></span>). Present active subj. (volitive) again, let us keep awake (late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γρηγορεω</span></span> from perfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγρηγορα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Be sober </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηφωμεν</span></span>). Present active subjunctive (volitive). Old verb not to be drunk. In N.T. only in figurative sense, to be calm, sober-minded. Also in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:8">1 Thessalonians 5:8</span> with the metaphor of drunkenness in contrast. </p>
