<p><b> But unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα εις περιποιησιν σωτηριας δια του Κυριου ημων Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). The difficult word here is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιποιησιν</span></span> which may be passive, God's possession as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>, or active, obtaining, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:14">2 Thessalonians 2:14</span>. The latter is probably the idea here. We are to keep awake so as to fulfil God's purpose (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθετο</span></span>, appointed, second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>) in calling us. That is our hope of final victory (salvation in this sense). </p>
