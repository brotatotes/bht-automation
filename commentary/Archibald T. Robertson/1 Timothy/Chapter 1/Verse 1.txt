 According to the commandment  (κατ' επιταγην). A late Koine word (Polybius, Diodorus), but a Pauline word also in N.T. This very idiom ("by way of command") in 1 Corinthians 7:6; 2 Corinthians 8:8; Romans 16:26; 1 Timothy 1:1; Titus 1:3. Paul means to say that he is an apostle under orders.Of God our Saviour  (θεου σωτηρος ημων). Genitive case with επιταγην. In the LXX σωτηρ (old word from σωζω for agent in saving, applied to deities, princes, kings, etc.) occurs 20 times, all but two to God. The Romans called the emperor "Saviour God." In the N.T. the designation of God as Saviour is peculiar to Luke 1:47; Judges 1:25; 1 Timothy 1:3; 1 Timothy 2:3; 1 Timothy 4:10; Titus 1:3; Titus 2:10; Titus 3:4. In the other Epistles Paul uses it of Christ (Philippians 3:20; Ephesians 5:23) as in 2 Timothy 1:10. In 2 Peter 1:1 we have "our God and Saviour Jesus Christ" as in Titus 2:13.Our hope  (της ελπιδος ημων). Like Colossians 1:27. More than the author and object of hope, "its very substance and foundation" (Ellicott).
