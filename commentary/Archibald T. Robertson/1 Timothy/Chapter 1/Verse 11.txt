 Of the blessed God  (του μακαριου θεου). Applied to God only here and 1 Timothy 6:15, but in Titus 2:13 μακαριος occurs with ελπις (hope) of the "epiphany of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ."Which was committed to my trust  (ο επιστευθην εγω). "with which (ο accusative retained with first aorist passive verb επιστευθην) I was entrusted."
