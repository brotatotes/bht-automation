<p><b> Faithful is the saying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστος ο λογος</span></span>). Five times in the Pastorals (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:1">1 Timothy 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:9">1 Timothy 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:8">Titus 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11">2 Timothy 2:11</span>). It will pay to note carefully <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστισ, πιστευω, πιστος</span></span>. Same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστος</span></span> (trustworthy) applied to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:9">Titus 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:5">Revelation 21:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span>. Here and probably in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11">2 Timothy 2:11</span> a definite saying seems to be referred to, possibly a quotation (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>) of a current saying quite like the Johannine type of teaching. This very phrase (Christ coming into the world) occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:37">John 9:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:27">John 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:28">John 16:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:37">John 18:37</span>. Paul, of course, had no access to the Johannine writings, but such "sayings" were current among the disciples. There is no formal quotation, but "the whole phrase implies a knowledge of Synoptic and Johannine language" (Lock) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:32">Luke 5:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:47">John 12:47</span>.</p>
<p><b>Acceptation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδοχης</span></span>). Genitive case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιος</span></span> (worthy of). Late word (Polybius, Diod., Jos.) in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:9">1 Timothy 4:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>Chief </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτος</span></span>). Not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> (I was), but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span> (I am). "It is not easy to think of any one but St. Paul as penning these words" (White). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:9">1 Corinthians 15:9</span> he had called himself "the least of the apostles" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαχιστος των αποστολων</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span> he refers to himself as "the less than the least of all saints" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω ελαχιστοτερω παντων αγιων</span></span>). On occasion Paul would defend himself as on a par with the twelve apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:6-10">Galatians 2:6-10</span>) and superior to the Judaizers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:5">2 Corinthians 11:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:11">2 Corinthians 12:11</span>). It is not mock humility here, but sincere appreciation of the sins of his life (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:24">Romans 7:24</span>) as a persecutor of the church of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:13">Galatians 1:13</span>), of men and even women (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:4">Acts 22:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:11">Acts 26:11</span>). He had sad memories of those days. </p>
