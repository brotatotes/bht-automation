<p><b> In me as chief </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εμο πρωτω</span></span>). Probably starts with the same sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτος</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span> (rank), but turns to order (first in line). Paul becomes the "specimen" sinner as an encouragement to all who come after him.</p>
<p><b>Might shew forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδειξητα</span></span>). First aorist middle subjunctive (purpose with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδεικνυμ</span></span>, to point out, for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:7">Ephesians 2:7</span> (same form with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Longsuffering </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακροθυμιαν</span></span>). Common Pauline word (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:6">2 Corinthians 6:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>For an ensample </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς υποτυπωσιν</span></span>). Late and rare word (in Galen, Sext. Emp., Diog. Laert., here only in N.T.) from late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτυποω</span></span> (in papyri) to outline. So substantive here is a sketch, rough outline. Paul is a sample of the kind of sinners that Jesus came to save. See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποδειγμα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:6">2 Peter 2:6</span>. </p>
