 In me as chief  (εν εμο πρωτω). Probably starts with the same sense of πρωτος as in verse 1 Timothy 1:15 (rank), but turns to order (first in line). Paul becomes the "specimen" sinner as an encouragement to all who come after him.Might shew forth  (ενδειξητα). First aorist middle subjunctive (purpose with ινα) of ενδεικνυμ, to point out, for which see Ephesians 2:7 (same form with ινα).Longsuffering  (μακροθυμιαν). Common Pauline word (2 Corinthians 6:6).For an ensample  (προς υποτυπωσιν). Late and rare word (in Galen, Sext. Emp., Diog. Laert., here only in N.T.) from late verb υποτυποω (in papyri) to outline. So substantive here is a sketch, rough outline. Paul is a sample of the kind of sinners that Jesus came to save. See υποδειγμα in 2 Peter 2:6.
