This noble doxology is a burst of gratitude for God's grace to Paul. For other doxologies see Galatians 1:5; Romans 11:36; Romans 16:27; Philippians 4:20; Ephesians 3:21; 1 Timothy 6:16. White suggests that Paul may have often used this doxology in his prayers. Lock suggests "a Jewish liturgical formula" (a needless suggestion in view of Paul's wealth of doxologies seen above). For God's creative activity (King of the ages) see 1 Corinthians 10:11; Ephesians 2:7; Ephesians 3:9; Ephesians 3:11.Incorruptible  (αφθαρτω). As an epithet of God also in Romans 1:23.Invisible  (αορατω). Epithet of God in Colossians 1:15.The only God  (μονω θεω). So Romans 16:27; John 5:44; John 17:3.For ever and ever  (εις τους αιωνας των αιωνων). "Unto the ages of ages." Cf. Ephesians 3:21 "of the age of the ages."
