 As I exhorted  (καθως παρεκαλεσα). There is an ellipse of the principal clause in verse 1 Timothy 1:4 ( so do I now  not being in the Greek).To tarry  (προσμεινα). First aorist active infinitive of προσμενω, old verb, attributed by Luke to Paul in Acts 13:43.That thou mightest charge  (ινα παραγγειληις). Subfinal clause with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of παραγγελλω, old verb, to transmit a message along (παρα) from one to another. See 2 Thessalonians 3:4; 2 Thessalonians 3:6; 2 Thessalonians 3:10. Lock considers this idiom here an elliptical imperative like Ephesians 4:29; Ephesians 5:33.Certain men  (τισιν). Dative case. Expressly vague (no names as in 1 Timothy 1:20), though Paul doubtless has certain persons in Ephesus in mind.Not to teach a different doctrine  (μη ετεροδιδασκαλειν). Earliest known use of this compound like κακοδιδασκαλειν of Clement of Rome. Only other N.T. example in 1 Timothy 6:3. Eusebius has ετεροδιδασκαλος. Same idea in Galatians 1:6; 2 Corinthians 11:4; Romans 16:17. Perhaps coined by Paul.
