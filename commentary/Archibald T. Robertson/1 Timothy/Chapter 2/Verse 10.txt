<p><b> Becometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεπε</span></span>). Old word for seemly. Paul wishes women to wear "becoming" clothes, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεοσεβειαν</span></span> (godliness, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεοσεβης</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:31">John 9:31</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεοσ, σεβομα</span></span>, worship) is part of the "style" desired. Only here in N.T. Good dress and good works combined. </p>
