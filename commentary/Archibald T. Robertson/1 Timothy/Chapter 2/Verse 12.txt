<p><b> I permit not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ επιτρεπω</span></span>). Old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτρεπω</span></span>, to permit, to allow (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:7">1 Corinthians 16:7</span>). Paul speaks authoritatively.</p>
<p><b>To teach </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκειν</span></span>). In the public meeting clearly. And yet all modern Christians allow women to teach Sunday school classes. One feels somehow that something is not expressed here to make it all clear.</p>
<p><b>Nor to have dominion over a man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε αυθεντειν ανδρος</span></span>). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυθεντεω</span></span> is now cleared up by Kretschmer (<i>Glotta</i>, 1912, pp. 289ff.) and by Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>. See also Nageli, <i>Der Wortschatz des Apostels Paulus</i> and Deissmann, <i>Light, etc.</i>, pp. 88f. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αυτοδικεω</span></span> was the literary word for playing the master while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυθεντεω</span></span> was the vernacular term. It comes from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτ-εντες</span></span>, a self-doer, a master, autocrat. It occurs in the papyri (substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυθεντης</span></span>, master, verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυθεντεω</span></span>, to domineer, adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυθεντικος</span></span>, authoritative, "authentic"). Modern Greek has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεντες</span></span> = Effendi = "Mr." </p>
