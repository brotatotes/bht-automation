 Through the child-bearing  (δια της τεκνογονιας). Late and rare word (in Aristotle). Here alone in N.T. From τεκνογονος and this from τεκνον and root γενω. This translation makes it refer to the birth of the Saviour as glorifying womanhood. That is true, but it is not clear that Paul does not have mostly in mind that child-bearing, not public teaching, is the peculiar function of woman with a glory and dignity all its own. "She will be saved" (σωθησετα) in this function, not by means of it.If they continue  (εαν μεινωσιν). Condition of third class, εαν with first aorist active subjunctive of μενω, to continue. Note change to plural from the singular (σωθησετα).
