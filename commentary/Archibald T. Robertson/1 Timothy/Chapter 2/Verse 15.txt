<p><b> Through the child-bearing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια της τεκνογονιας</span></span>). Late and rare word (in Aristotle). Here alone in N.T. From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνογονος</span></span> and this from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνον</span></span> and root <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενω</span></span>. This translation makes it refer to the birth of the Saviour as glorifying womanhood. That is true, but it is not clear that Paul does not have mostly in mind that child-bearing, not public teaching, is the peculiar function of woman with a glory and dignity all its own. "She will be saved" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωθησετα</span></span>) in this function, not by means of it.</p>
<p><b>If they continue </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μεινωσιν</span></span>). Condition of third class, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> with first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενω</span></span>, to continue. Note change to plural from the singular (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωθησετα</span></span>). </p>
