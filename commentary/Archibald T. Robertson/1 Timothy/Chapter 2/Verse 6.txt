<p><b> A ransom for all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιλυτρον υπερ παντων</span></span>). "A reminiscence of the Lord's own saying" (Lock) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:45">Mark 10:45</span>) where we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυτρον αντ πολλων</span></span>. In the papyri <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> is the ordinary preposition for the notion of substitution where benefit is involved as in this passage. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αντ</span></span> has more the idea of exchange and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιλυτρον υπερ</span></span> combines both ideas. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λυτρον</span></span> is the common word for ransom for a slave or a prisoner. Paul may have coined <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιλυτρον</span></span> with the saying of Christ in mind (only one MS. of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+48:9">Psalms 48:9</span> and Orph. <i>Litt</i>. 588). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:4">Galatians 1:4</span> "who gave himself for our sins."</p>
<p><b>The testimony </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μαρτυριον</span></span>). Either the nominative absolute or the accusative absolute in apposition to the preceding clause like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το αδυνατον</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>In its own times </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιροις ιδιοις</span></span>). Locative case as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:15">1 Timothy 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:3">Titus 1:3</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:9">Galatians 6:9</span> for "due season." There is no predicate or participle here, "the testimony in its due seasons" (plural). </p>
