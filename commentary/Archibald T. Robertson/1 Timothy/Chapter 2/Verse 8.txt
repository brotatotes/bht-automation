<p><b> I desire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομα</span></span>). So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:12">Philippians 1:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>The men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους ανδρας</span></span>). Accusative of general reference with the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευχεσθα</span></span>. The men in contrast to "women" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυναικας</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:9">1 Timothy 2:9</span>. It is public worship, of course, and "in every place" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν παντ τοπω</span></span>) for public worship. Many modern Christians feel that there were special conditions in Ephesus as in Corinth which called for strict regulations on the women that do not always apply now.</p>
<p><b>Lifting up holy hands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαιροντας οσιους χειρας</span></span>). Standing to pray. Note also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσιους</span></span> used as feminine (so in Plato) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρας</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσιας</span></span>. The point here is that only men should lead in public prayer who can lift up "clean hands" (morally and spiritually clean). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:50">Luke 24:50</span>. Adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσιως</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:10">1 Thessalonians 2:10</span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσιοτης</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span>.</p>
<p><b>Without wrath and disputing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρις οργης κα διαλογισμου</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:14">Philippians 2:14</span>. </p>
