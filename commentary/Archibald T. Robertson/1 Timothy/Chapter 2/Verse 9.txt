 In like manner that women  (οσαυτως γυναικας). Βουλομα must be repeated from verse 1 Timothy 2:8, involved in οσαυτως (old adverb, as in Romans 8:26). Parry insists that προσευχομενας (when they pray) must be supplied also. Grammatically that is possible (Lock), but it is hardly consonant with verses 1 Timothy 2:11-15 (White).Adorn themselves  (κοσμειν εαυτας). Present active infinitive after βουλομα understood. Old word from κοσμος (arrangement, ornament, order, world). See Luke 21:5; Titus 2:10.

Καταστολη is a late word (a letting down, καταστελλω, of demeanour or dress, arrangement of dress). Only here in N.T. Κοσμιος is old adjective from κοσμος and means well-arranged, becoming. W. H. have adverb in margin (κοσμιως).With shamefastness  (μετα αιδους). Old word for shame, reverence, in N.T. only here and Hebrews 12:28.Sobriety  (σωφροσυνης). Old word, in N.T. only here, verse 1 Timothy 2:15, and Acts 26:15 (Paul also).Not with braided hair  (μη εν πλεγμασιν). Old word from πλεκω, to plait, to braid, for nets, baskets, here only in N.T. Cf. 1 Peter 3:1 (εμπλοκης).And gold  (εν χρυσιω). Locative case with εν repeated. Some MSS. read χρυσω. Both used for gold ornaments.Or pearls  (η μαργαριταις). See Matthew 7:6 for this word.Or costly raiment  (η ιματισμω πολυτελε). Hιματισμος a common Koine word from ιματιζω, to clothe. Πολυτελης, old word from πολυς and τελος (great price). See Mark 14:3.
