<p><b> Women </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυναικας</span></span>). Accusative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε εινα</span></span> understood (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσαυτως</span></span>, likewise) as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span>. Apparently "women as deacons" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:1">Romans 16:1</span> about Phoebe) and not women in general or just "wives of deacons." See Pliny (<i>Ep</i>. X. 97) <i>ministrae</i>.</p>
<p><b>Not slanderers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη διαβολους</span></span>). Original meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαβολος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαβαλλω</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:1">Luke 16:1</span>), the devil being the chief slanderer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11">Ephesians 6:11</span>). "She-devils" in reality (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:3">Titus 2:3</span>). "While men are more prone to be <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διλογους</span></span>, double-tongued, women are more prone than men to be slanderers" (White).</p>
<p><b>Faithful in all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστας εν πασιν</span></span>). Perhaps as almoners (Ellicott) the deaconesses had special temptations. </p>
