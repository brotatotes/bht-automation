<p><b> Shortly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ταχε</span></span>). Old idiom (locative case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταχος</span></span>, quickness, speed). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:20">Romans 16:20</span>. A pseudonymous writer would hardly have put in this phrase. Paul's hopes were not to be realized, but he did not know that. </p>
