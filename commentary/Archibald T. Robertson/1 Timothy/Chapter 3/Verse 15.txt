<p><b> But if I tarry long </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν δε βραδυνω</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and the present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βραδυνω</span></span>, old verb, to be slow (usually intransitive), from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βραδυς</span></span> (slow, dull, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:25">Luke 24:25</span>), in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:9">2 Peter 3:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>That thou mayest know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ειδηις</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and second perfect active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span>, to know.</p>
<p><b>How men ought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πως δε</span></span>). "How it is necessary for thee" (supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σε</span></span> more naturally than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινα</span></span>, any one). Indirect question.</p>
<p><b>To behave themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστρεφεσθα</span></span>). Present middle (direct) infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστρεφω</span></span>, old verb, to turn up and down. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:3">Ephesians 2:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>In the house of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν οικω θεου</span></span>). Probably here "household of God," that is "the family of God" rather than "the house (or temple) of God." Christians as yet had no separate houses of worship and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικος</span></span> commonly means "household." Christians are the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναος</span></span> (sanctuary) of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:16">2 Corinthians 6:16</span>), and Paul calls them <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικειο του θεου</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:19">Ephesians 2:19</span>) "members of God's family." It is conduct as members of God's family (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικος</span></span>) that Paul has in mind.</p>
<p><b>Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητις</span></span>). "Which very house of God," agreeing (feminine) with the predicate word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησια</span></span> (church).</p>
<p><b>The church of the living God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησια θεου ζωντος</span></span>). Probably here the general church or kingdom as in Colossians and Ephesians, though the local church in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:5">1 Timothy 3:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>The pillar and ground of the truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στυλος κα εδραιωμα της αληθειας</span></span>). Paul changes the metaphor again as he often does. Those words are in apposition to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησια</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικος</span></span>. On <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στυλος</span></span>, old word for pillar, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span> (only other N.T. examples). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hεδραιωμα</span></span>, late and rare word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδραιοω</span></span>, to make stable) occurs here first and only in ecclesiastical writers later. Probably it means stay or support rather than foundation or ground. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:19">2 Timothy 2:19</span> for similar idea. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>. </p>
