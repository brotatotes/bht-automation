 But if I tarry long  (εαν δε βραδυνω). Condition of third class with εαν and the present active subjunctive of βραδυνω, old verb, to be slow (usually intransitive), from βραδυς (slow, dull, Luke 24:25), in N.T. only here and 2 Peter 3:9.That thou mayest know  (ινα ειδηις). Final clause with ινα and second perfect active subjunctive of οιδα, to know.How men ought  (πως δε). "How it is necessary for thee" (supply σε more naturally than τινα, any one). Indirect question.To behave themselves  (αναστρεφεσθα). Present middle (direct) infinitive of αναστρεφω, old verb, to turn up and down. See 2 Corinthians 1:12; Ephesians 2:3.In the house of God  (εν οικω θεου). Probably here "household of God," that is "the family of God" rather than "the house (or temple) of God." Christians as yet had no separate houses of worship and οικος commonly means "household." Christians are the ναος (sanctuary) of God (1 Corinthians 3:16; 2 Corinthians 6:16), and Paul calls them οικειο του θεου (Ephesians 2:19) "members of God's family." It is conduct as members of God's family (οικος) that Paul has in mind.Which  (ητις). "Which very house of God," agreeing (feminine) with the predicate word εκκλησια (church).The church of the living God  (εκκλησια θεου ζωντος). Probably here the general church or kingdom as in Colossians and Ephesians, though the local church in verse 1 Timothy 3:5.The pillar and ground of the truth  (στυλος κα εδραιωμα της αληθειας). Paul changes the metaphor again as he often does. Those words are in apposition to εκκλησια and οικος. On στυλος, old word for pillar, see Galatians 2:9; Revelation 3:12 (only other N.T. examples). Hεδραιωμα, late and rare word (from εδραιοω, to make stable) occurs here first and only in ecclesiastical writers later. Probably it means stay or support rather than foundation or ground. See Colossians 1:23; 2 Timothy 2:19 for similar idea. See also Matthew 16:18.
