<p><b> Without controversy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογουμενως</span></span>). Old adverb from the participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογουμενος</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογεω</span></span>. Here only in N.T. "Confessedly."</p>
<p><b>Great </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγα</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:32">Ephesians 5:32</span>. "A great mystery."</p>
<p><b>The mystery of godliness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το της ευσεβειας μυστηριον</span></span>). See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:9">1 Timothy 3:9</span> "the mystery of the faith," and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:2">1 Timothy 2:2</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευσεβεια</span></span>. Here the phrase explains "a pillar and stay of the truth" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span>). See in particular <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:27">Colossians 1:27</span>. "The revealed secret of true religion, the mystery of Christianity, the Person of Christ" (Lock).</p>
<p><b>He who </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span>). The correct text, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span> (God) the reading of the Textus Receptus (Syrian text) nor <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> (neuter relative, agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυστηριον</span></span>) the reading of the Western documents. Westcott and Hort print this relative clause as a fragment of a Christian hymn (like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:14">Ephesians 5:14</span>) in six strophes. That is probably correct. At any rate <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span> (who) is correct and there is asyndeton (no connective) in the verbs. Christ, to whom <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span> refers, is the mystery (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:27">Colossians 1:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>).</p>
<p><b>Was manifested </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφανερωθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανεροω</span></span>, to manifest. Here used to describe the incarnation (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν σαρκ</span></span>) of Christ (an answer also to the Docetic Gnostics). The verb is used by Paul elsewhere of the incarnation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:26">Romans 16:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</span>) as well as of the second coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4">Colossians 3:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>Justified in the spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδικαιωθη εν πνευματ</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοω</span></span>, to declare righteous, to vindicate. Christ was vindicated in his own spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>) before men by overcoming death and rising from the dead (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:3">Romans 1:3</span>).</p>
<p><b>Seen of angels </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφθη αγγελοις</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>, to see, with either the instrumental or the dative case of angels (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελοις</span></span>). The words were probably suggested by the appearance of Jesus (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφθη</span></span>, the usual form for the resurrection appearances of Christ) of the angels at the tomb and at the ascension of Christ. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:10">Philippians 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span> for the appearance of Jesus to the angels in heaven at the ascension. Some would take "angels" here to be "messengers" (the women).</p>
<p><b>Preached among the nations </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκηρυχθη εν εθνεσιν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυσσω</span></span>, to proclaim. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνος</span></span> may mean "all creation" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>) and not just Gentiles as distinct from Jews. Paul had done more of this heralding of Christ among the Gentiles than any one else. It was his glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:7">1 Timothy 2:7</span>.</p>
<p><b>Believed on in the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευθη εν κοσμω</span></span>). First aorist indicative passive again of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>, to believe (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:10">2 Thessalonians 1:10</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19">2 Corinthians 5:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>Received up in glory </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανελημφθη εν δοξη</span></span>). First aorist passive again (six verbs in the same voice and tense in succession, a rhythmic arrangement like a hymn). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>. This time the verb is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναλαμβανω</span></span>, the verb used of the ascension (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:11">Acts 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span>, which see). In a wonderful way this stanza of a hymn presents the outline of the life of Christ. </p>
