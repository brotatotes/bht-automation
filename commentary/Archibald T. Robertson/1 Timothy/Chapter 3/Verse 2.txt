 The bishop  (τον επισκοπον). The overseer. Old word, in LXX, and inscriptions and papyri. Deissmann (Bible Studies, pp. 230f.) has shown it is applied to communal officials in Rhodes. See Acts 20:28 for its use for the elders (presbyters) in verse 1 Timothy 3:17. So also in Titus 1:5; Titus 1:7. See Philippians 1:1. The word does not in the N.T. have the monarchical sense found in Ignatius of a bishop over elders.Without reproach  (ανεπιλημπτον). Accusative case of general reference with δε and εινα.

One at a time, clearly.Temperate  (νηφαλιον). Old adjective. In N.T. only here, verse 1 Timothy 3:11; Titus 2:2.

Another old adjective (from σαος or σως, sound, φρην, mind) in N.T. only here, Titus 1:8; Titus 2:2; Titus 2:5.Orderly  (κοσμιον). See on 1 Timothy 2:9. Seemly, decent conduct.Given to hospitality  (φιλοξενον). Old word (see φιλοξενια in Romans 12:13), from φιλος and ξενος, in N.T. only here, Titus 1:8; 1 Peter 4:9.Apt to teach  (διδακτικον). Late form for old διδασκαλικος, one qualified to teach. In Philo and N.T. only (1 Timothy 3:2; 2 Timothy 2:24).
