 Not a novice  (μη νεοφυτον). Our "neophyte." Vernacular word from Aristophanes on, in LXX, and in papyri in the original sense of "newly-planted" (νεοσ, φυω). Only here in N.T.Lest  (ινα μη). "That not."Being puffed up  (τυφωθεις). First aorist passive participle of τυφοω, old word (from τυφος, smoke, pride), to raise a smoke or mist (a smoke-screen of pride). In N.T. only here; 1 Timothy 6:4; 2 Timothy 3:4.He fall into  (εμπεση εις). Second aorist active subjunctive with ινα μη, negative purpose, of εμπιπτω, old verb, to fall into. Note both εν and εις as in Matthew 12:11; Luke 10:36.The condemnation of the devil  (κριμα του διαβολου). See Romans 3:8 for κριμα. Best to take του διαβολου as objective genitive, though subjective in verse 1 Timothy 3:7, "the condemnation passed on or received by the devil" (not just "the slanderer," any slanderer).
