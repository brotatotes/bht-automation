 Deacons  (διακονους). Accusative case of general reference like the preceding with δε εινα understood. Technical sense of the word here as in Philippians 1:1 which see (two classes of church officers, bishops or elders, deacons).Grave  (σεμνους). See Philippians 4:8. Repeated in verse 1 Timothy 3:11; Titus 2:2.Not double-tongued  (μη διλογους). Rare word (δισ, λεγω) saying same thing twice. Xenophon has διλογεω and διλογια. In Pollux, but LXX has διγλωσσος (double-tongued, Latin bilinguis). Only here in N.T. One placed between two persons and saying one thing to one, another to the other. Like Bunyan's Parson "Mr. Two-Tongues."Not given to much wine  (μη οινω πολλω προσεχοντας). "Not holding the mind (τον νουν understood as usual with προσεχω, 1 Timothy 1:4) on much wine" (οινω, dative case). That attitude leads to over-indulgence.Not greedy of filthy lucre  (μη αισχροκερδεις). Old word from αισχρος (Ephesians 5:12) and κερδος (Philippians 1:21). "Making small gains in mean ways" (Parry). Not genuine in verse 1 Timothy 3:3. In N.T. only here and Titus 1:7 (of bishops).
