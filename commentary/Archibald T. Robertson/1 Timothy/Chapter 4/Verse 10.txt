 To this end  (εις τουτο). The godliness (ευσεβεια) of verse 1 Timothy 4:8. See 2 Corinthians 6:10 as Paul's own commentary.We labour  (κοπιωμεν, Colossians 1:29)and strive  (κα αγωνιζομεθα, Colossians 1:29). Both Pauline words.Because we have set our hope  (οτ ελπικαμεν). Perfect active indicative of ελπιζω (Romans 15:12).Saviour of all men  (σωτηρ παντων ανθρωπων). See 1 Timothy 1:1 for σωτηρ applied to God as here. Not that all men "are saved" in the full sense, but God gives life (1 Timothy 6:13) to all (Acts 17:28).Specially of them that believe  (μαλιστα πιστων). Making a distinction in the kinds of salvation meant. "While God is potentially Saviour of all, He is actually Saviour of the πιστο" (White). So Jesus is termed "Saviour of the World" (John 4:42). Cf. Galatians 6:10.
