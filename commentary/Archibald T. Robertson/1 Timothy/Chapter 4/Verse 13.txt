 Till I come  (εως ερχομα). "While I am coming" (present indicative with εως), not "till I come" (εως ελθω).Give heed  (προσεχε). Present active imperative, supply τον νουν, "keep on putting thy mind on."The reading  (τη αναγνωσε). Old word from αναγινωσκω. See 2 Corinthians 3:14. Probably in particular the public reading of the Scriptures (Acts 13:15), though surely private reading is not to be excluded.To exhortation  (τη παρακλησε),to teaching  (τη διδασκαλια). Two other public functions of the minister. Probably Paul does not mean for the exhortation to precede the instruction, but the reverse in actual public work. Exhortation needs teaching to rest it upon, a hint for preachers today.
