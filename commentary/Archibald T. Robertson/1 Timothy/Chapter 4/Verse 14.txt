<p><b> Neglect not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη αμελε</span></span>). Present active imperative in prohibition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμελεω</span></span>, old verb, rare in N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:5">Matthew 22:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:3">Hebrews 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:9">Hebrews 8:9</span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμελης</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελε</span></span>, not to care). Use with genitive.</p>
<p><b>The gift that is in thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του εν σο χαρισματος</span></span>). Late word of result from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριζομα</span></span>, in papyri (Preisigke), a regular Pauline word in N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:11">2 Corinthians 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:11">Romans 1:11</span>; etc.). Here it is God's gift to Timothy as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>By prophecy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια προφητειας</span></span>). Accompanied by prophecy (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>), not bestowed by prophecy.</p>
<p><b>With the laying on of the hands of the presbytery </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα επιθεσεως των χειρων του πρεσβυτεριου</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span>, when Barnabas and Saul were formally set apart to the mission campaign (not then ordained as ministers, for they were already that), there was the call of the Spirit and the laying on of hands with prayer. Here again <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα</span></span> does not express instrument or means, but merely accompaniment. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span> Paul speaks only of his own laying on of hands, but the rest of the presbytery no doubt did so at the same time and the reference is to this incident. There is no way to tell when and where it was done, whether at Lystra when Timothy joined Paul's party or at Ephesus just before Paul left Timothy there (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Επιθεσις</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρομ επιτιθημ</span></span>, to lay upon) is an old word, in LXX, etc. In the N.T. we find it only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:16">2 Timothy 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:18">Acts 8:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:2">Hebrews 6:2</span>, but the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτιθημ</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας χειρας</span></span> more frequently (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:6">Acts 6:6</span> of the deacons; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+8:19">1 Timothy 8:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+13:3">1 Timothy 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:22">1 Timothy 5:22</span>, etc.). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πρεσβυτεριον</span></span> is a late word (ecclesiastical use also), first for the Jewish Sanhedrin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:66">Luke 22:66</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:5">Acts 22:5</span>), then (here only in N.T.) of Christian elders (common in Ignatius), though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτερος</span></span> (elder) for preachers (bishops) is common (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:2">Acts 15:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17">Acts 20:17</span>, etc.). </p>
