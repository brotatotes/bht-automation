 Through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies  (εν υποκρισε ψευδολογων). For υποκρισις, see Galatians 2:13. Ψευδολογος (ψευδησ, λεγω) Koine word from Aristophanes on. Here only in N.T. "A good classical word for liars on a large scale" (Parry).Branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron  (κεκαυστηριασμενων την ιδιαν συνειδησιν). Accusative case συνειδησιν retained with the perfect passive participle of καυστηριαζω, a rare verb only here and once in Strabo. Branded with the mark of Satan (2 Timothy 2:26) as Paul was with the marks of Christ (Galatians 6:17). Agreeing in case with ψευδολογων.
