 Rebuke not an elder  (πρεσβυτερω μη επιπληξηις). Dative case πρεσβυτερω used in the usual sense of an older man, not a minister (bishop as in 1 Timothy 3:2) as is shown by "as a father." First aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive with negative μη (prohibition against committing the act) of επιπλησσω, to strike upon, old verb, but here only in N.T. and in figurative sense with words rather than with fists. Respect for age is what is here commanded, an item appropriate to the present time.The younger men as brethren  (νεωτερους ως αδελφους). Comparative adjective νεωτερος from νεος (young). No article, "younger men." Wise words for the young minister to know how to conduct himself with old men (reverence) and young men (fellowship, but not stooping to folly with them).
