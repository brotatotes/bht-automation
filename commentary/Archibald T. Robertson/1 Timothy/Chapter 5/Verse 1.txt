<p><b> Rebuke not an elder </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτερω μη επιπληξηις</span></span>). Dative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτερω</span></span> used in the usual sense of an older man, not a minister (bishop as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>) as is shown by "as a father." First aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive with negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> (prohibition against committing the act) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιπλησσω</span></span>, to strike upon, old verb, but here only in N.T. and in figurative sense with words rather than with fists. Respect for age is what is here commanded, an item appropriate to the present time.</p>
<p><b>The younger men as brethren </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεωτερους ως αδελφους</span></span>). Comparative adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεωτερος</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεος</span></span> (young). No article, "younger men." Wise words for the young minister to know how to conduct himself with old men (reverence) and young men (fellowship, but not stooping to folly with them). </p>
