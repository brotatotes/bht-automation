 But younger widows refuse  (νεωτερας δε χηρας παραιτου). Present middle imperative as in 1 Timothy 4:7. "Beg off from." They lack experience as above and they have other ambitions.When they have waxed wanton  (οταν καταστρηνιασωσιν). First aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of καταστρηνιαω, late compound (only here and Ignatius), to feel the impulse of sexual desire, but simplex στρηνιαω (Revelation 18:7; Revelation 18:9). Souter renders it here "exercise youthful vigour against Christ" (του Χριστου, genitive case after κατα in composition).
