 Condemnation  (κριμα). See 1 Timothy 3:6.They have rejected  (ηθετησαν). First aorist passive of αθετεω, late verb (first in LXX and Polybius), to reject, set aside (from αθετος). See 1 Thessalonians 4:8; Galatians 2:21.Their first faith  (την πρωτην πιστιν). "Their first pledge" (promise, contract) to Christ. It is like breaking the marriage contract. Evidently one of the pledges on joining the order of widows was not to marry. Parry suggests a kind of ordination as with deacons and bishops (technical use of κριμα and πιστις).
