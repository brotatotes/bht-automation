<p><b> Condemnation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριμα</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:6">1 Timothy 3:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>They have rejected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηθετησαν</span></span>). First aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αθετεω</span></span>, late verb (first in LXX and Polybius), to reject, set aside (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αθετος</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:8">1 Thessalonians 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:21">Galatians 2:21</span>.</p>
<p><b>Their first faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την πρωτην πιστιν</span></span>). "Their first pledge" (promise, contract) to Christ. It is like breaking the marriage contract. Evidently one of the pledges on joining the order of widows was not to marry. Parry suggests a kind of ordination as with deacons and bishops (technical use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριμα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span>). </p>
