Old word (from περι, εργον), busy about trifles to the neglect of important matters. In N.T. only here and Acts 19:19. See 2 Thessalonians 3:11 for περιεργαζομα.Things which they ought not  (τα μη δεοντα). "The not necessary things," and, as a result, often harmful. See Titus 1:11 α μη δε (which things are not necessary).
