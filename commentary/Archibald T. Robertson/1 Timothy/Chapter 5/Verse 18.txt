<p><b> Thou shalt not muzzle </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου φιμωσεις</span></span>). Prohibition by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> and future (volitive) indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιμοω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιμος</span></span>, muzzle), old word, quoted also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:9">1 Corinthians 9:9</span> as here from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+25:4">Deuteronomy 25:4</span>, and for the same purpose, to show the preacher's right to pay for his work. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:9">1 Corinthians 9:9</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλοωντα</span></span> (<b> when he treadeth out the corn </b>).</p>
<p><b>The labourer is worthy of his hire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιος ο εργατης του μισθου αυτου</span></span>). These words occur in precisely this form in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:7">Luke 10:7</span>. It appears also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:10">Matthew 10:10</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της τροφης</span></span> (food) instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του μισθου</span></span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:14">1 Corinthians 9:14</span> Paul has the sense of it and says: "so also the Lord ordained," clearly meaning that Jesus had so said. It only remains to tell whether Paul here is quoting an unwritten saying of Jesus as he did in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:35">Acts 20:35</span> or even the Gospel of Luke or Q (the Logia of Jesus). There is no way to decide this question. If Luke wrote his Gospel before A.D. 62 as is quite possible and Acts by A.D. 63, he could refer to the Gospel. It is not clear whether Scripture is here meant to apply to this quotation from the Lord Jesus. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργατης</span></span> (labourer) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:2">Philippians 3:2</span>. </p>
