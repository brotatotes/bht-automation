<p><b> The elder women as mothers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτερας ως μητερας</span></span>). Anarthrous again, "older women as mothers." Respect and reverence once more.</p>
<p><b>The younger as sisters, in all purity </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεωτερας ως αδελφας εν παση αγνια</span></span>). Anarthrous also and comparative form as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:1">1 Timothy 5:1</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνια</span></span>. No sort of behavior will so easily make or mar the young preacher as his conduct with young women. </p>
