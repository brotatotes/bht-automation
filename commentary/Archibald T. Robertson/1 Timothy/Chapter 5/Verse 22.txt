 Lay hands hastily  (χειρας ταχεως επιτιθε). Present active imperative of επιτιθημ in the sense of approval (ordination) as in Acts 6:6; Acts 13:3. But it is not clear whether it is the case of ministers just ordained as in 1 Timothy 4:14 (επιθεσις), or of warning against hasty ordination of untried men, or the recognition and restoration of deposed ministers (verse 1 Timothy 5:20) as suits the context. The prohibition suits either situation, or both.Be partakers of other men's sins  (κοινωνε αμαρτιαις αλλοτριαις). Present active imperative of κοινωνεω (from κοινωνος, partner) with μη in prohibition with associative instrumental case as in 2 John 1:11; Romans 12:13. On αλλοτριος (belonging to another) see Romans 14:4.Keep thyself pure  (σεαυτον αγνον τηρε). "Keep on keeping thyself pure." Present active imperative of τηρεω.
