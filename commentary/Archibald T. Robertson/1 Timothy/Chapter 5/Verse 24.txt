<p><b> Evident </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προδηλο</span></span>). "Openly plain," "plain before all." Old word, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:24">Hebrews 7:24</span>.</p>
<p><b>Going before unto judgment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προαγουσα εις κρισιν</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προαγω</span></span>. The sins are so plain that they receive instant condemnation.</p>
<p><b>And some men also they follow after </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τισιν δε κα επακολουθουσιν</span></span>). Associative instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τισιν</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επακολουθουσιν</span></span> for which verb see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:10">1 Timothy 5:10</span>, "dog their steps" (Parry) like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:21">1 Peter 2:21</span>, not clearly manifest at first, but come out plainly at last. How true that is of secret sins. </p>
