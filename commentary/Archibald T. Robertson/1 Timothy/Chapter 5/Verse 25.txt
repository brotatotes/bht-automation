<p><b> Such as are otherwise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα αλλως εχοντα</span></span>). "Those (deeds, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργα</span></span>) which have it otherwise." That is good deeds not clearly manifest.</p>
<p><b>Cannot be hid </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρυβηνα ου δυναντα</span></span>). Second aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρυπτω</span></span>. There is comfort here for modest preachers and other believers whose good deeds are not known and not blazoned forth. They will come out in the end. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:14-16">Matthew 5:14-16</span>. </p>
