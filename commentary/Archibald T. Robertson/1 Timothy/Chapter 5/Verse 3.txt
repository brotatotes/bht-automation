<p><b> That are widows indeed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας οντως χηρας</span></span>). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οντως</span></span> (actually, really), see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:47">Luke 23:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:25">1 Corinthians 14:25</span>; and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:5">1 Timothy 5:5</span>. For widows (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χηρα</span></span>) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:40">Mark 12:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:42">Mark 12:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:8">1 Corinthians 7:8</span>. Parry notes that in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:3-8">1 Timothy 5:3-8</span> Paul discusses widows who are in distress and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:9-16">1 Timothy 5:9-16</span> those who are in the employment of the local church for certain work. Evidently, as in Acts <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:1-6">1 Timothy 6:1-6</span>, so here in Ephesus there had arisen some trouble over the widows in the church. Both for individual cases of need and as a class Timothy is to show proper respect (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμα</span></span>, keep on honouring) the widows. </p>
