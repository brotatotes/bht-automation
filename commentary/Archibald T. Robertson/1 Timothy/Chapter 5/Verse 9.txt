 Let none be enrolled as a widow  (χηρα καταλεγεσθω). Present passive imperative of καταλεγω, old verb, to set down in an official list, only here in N.T. "Let a widow be enrolled," the negative coming later, "having become of no less than sixty years" (μη ελαττον ετων εξηκοντα γεγονυια). Second perfect active participle of γινομα. For the case of ετων, see Luke 2:42. This list of genuine widows (verses 1 Timothy 5:3; 1 Timothy 5:5) apparently had some kind of church work to do (care for the sick, the orphans, etc.).The wife of one man  (ενος ανδρος γυνη). Widows on this list must not be married a second time. This interpretation is not so clear for 1 Timothy 3:2; 1 Timothy 3:12; Titus 1:6.
