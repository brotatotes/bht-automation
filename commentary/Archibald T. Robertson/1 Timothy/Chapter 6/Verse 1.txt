 Under the yoke  (υπο ζυγον). As slaves (δουλο, bondsmen). Perhaps under heathen masters (1 Peter 2:18). For the slave problem, see also 1 Timothy 6:1; Colossians 3:22; Ephesians 6:5; Titus 2:9. See Matthew 11:29 for Christ's "yoke" (ζυγον, from ζευγνυμ, to join).Their own masters  (τους ιδιους δεσποτας). That is always where the shoe pinches. Our "despot" is this very Greek word, the strict correlative of slave (δουλος), while κυριος has a wider outlook. Old word only here, Titus 2:9; 2 Timothy 2:21; 1 Peter 2:18 for human masters. Applied to God in Luke 2:29; Acts 4:24; Acts 4:29 and to Christ in 2 Peter 2:1.The name of God  (το ονομα του θεου). See Romans 2:24. If the heathen could say that Christian slaves were not as dependable as non-Christian slaves. Negative purpose with ινα μη and present passive subjunctive (βλασφημητα).
