 The love of money  (η φιλαργυρια). Vulgate, avaritia. Common word (from φιλαργυρος, 2 Timothy 3:12, and that from φιλοσ, αργυρος), only here in N.T. Refers to verse 1 Timothy 6:9 (βουλομενο πλουτειν).A root of all kinds of evil  (ριζα παντων των κακων). A root (ριζα). Old word, common in literal (Matthew 3:10) and metaphorical sense (Romans 11:11-18). Field (Ot. Norv.) argues for "the root" as the idea of this predicate without saying that it is the only root. Undoubtedly a proverb that Paul here quotes, attributed to Bion and to Democritus (την φιλαργυριαν εινα μητροπολιν παντων των κακων), where "metropolis" takes the place of "root." Surely men today need no proof of the fact that men and women will commit any sin or crime for money.Reaching after  (ορεγομενο). Present middle participle of ορεγω (see 1 Timothy 3:1) with genitive ης (which).Have been led astray  (απεπλανηθησαν). First aorist passive indicative of αποπλαναω, old compound verb, in N.T. only here and Mark 13:22.Have pierced themselves through  (εαυτους περιεπειραν). First aorist active (with reflexive pronoun) of late compound περιπειρω, only here in N.T. Perfective use of περ (around, completely to pierce).With many sorrows  (οδυναις πολλαις). Instrumental case of οδυνη (consuming, eating grief). In N.T. only here and Romans 9:2.
