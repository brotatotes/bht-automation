<p><b> And Timothy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα Τιμοθεος</span></span>). Timothy is with Paul, having been sent on to Macedonia from Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>). He is in no sense co-author any more than Sosthenes was in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>In all Achaia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ολη τη Αχαια</span></span>). The Romans divided Greece into two provinces (Achaia and Macedonia). Macedonia included also Illyricum, Epirus, and Thessaly. Achaia was all of Greece south of this (both Attica and the Peloponnesus). The restored Corinth was made the capital of Achaia where the pro-consul resided (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:12">Acts 18:12</span>). He does not mention other churches in Achaia outside of the one in Corinth, but only "saints" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιοις</span></span>). Athens was in Achaia, but it is not clear that there was as yet a church there, though some converts had been won (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:34">Acts 17:34</span>), and there was a church in Cenchreae, the eastern port of Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:1">Romans 16:1</span>). Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:2">2 Corinthians 9:2</span> speaks of Achaia and Macedonia together. His language here would seem to cover the whole (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολη</span></span>, all) of Achaia in his scope and not merely the environment around Corinth. </p>
