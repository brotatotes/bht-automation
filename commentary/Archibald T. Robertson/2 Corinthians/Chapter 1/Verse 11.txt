 Ye also helping together on our behalf  (συνυπουργουντων κα υμων υπερ ημων). Genitive absolute with present active participle of late compound verb (συν and υπουργεω for υπο and εργον). Paul relied on God and felt the need of the prayer of God's people.By means of many  (εκ πολλων προσωπων). Προσωπον means face (προσ, οπς). The word is common in all Greek. The papyri use it for face, appearance, person. It occurs twelve times in II Corinthians. It certainly means face in eight of them (2 Corinthians 3:7; 2 Corinthians 3:13; 2 Corinthians 3:18; 2 Corinthians 8:24; 2 Corinthians 10:1; 2 Corinthians 10:7; 2 Corinthians 11:20). In 2 Corinthians 5:12 it means outward appearance. It may mean face or person here, 2 Corinthians 2:10; 2 Corinthians 4:6. It is more pictorial to take it here as face "that out of many upturned faces" thanks may be given (ινα--ευχαριστηθη first aorist passive subjunctive) for the gift to us by means of many (δια πολλον). It is indeed a difficult sentence to understand.
