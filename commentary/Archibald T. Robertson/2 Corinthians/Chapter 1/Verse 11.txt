<p><b> Ye also helping together on our behalf </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνυπουργουντων κα υμων υπερ ημων</span></span>). Genitive absolute with present active participle of late compound verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπουργεω</span></span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργον</span></span>). Paul relied on God and felt the need of the prayer of God's people.</p>
<p><b>By means of many </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ πολλων προσωπων</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προσωπον</span></span> means face (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσ, οπς</span></span>). The word is common in all Greek. The papyri use it for face, appearance, person. It occurs twelve times in II Corinthians. It certainly means face in eight of them (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:13">2 Corinthians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:24">2 Corinthians 8:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:1">2 Corinthians 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:7">2 Corinthians 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:20">2 Corinthians 11:20</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:12">2 Corinthians 5:12</span> it means outward appearance. It may mean face or person here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:10">2 Corinthians 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>. It is more pictorial to take it here as face "that out of many upturned faces" thanks may be given (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα--ευχαριστηθη</span></span> first aorist passive subjunctive) for the gift to us by means of many (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια πολλον</span></span>). It is indeed a difficult sentence to understand. </p>
