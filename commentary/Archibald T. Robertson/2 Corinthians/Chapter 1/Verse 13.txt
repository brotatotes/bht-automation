<p><b> Than what ye read </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' η α αναγινωσκετε</span></span>). Note comparative conjunction <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span> (than) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ'</span></span> and that after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span> (other things, same word in reality), "other than." Read in Greek (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγινωσκω</span></span>) is knowing again, recognizing. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:30">Acts 8:30</span>.</p>
<p><b>Or even acknowledge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η κα επιγινωσκετε</span></span>). Paul is fond of such a play on words (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγινωσκετε, επιγινωσκετε</span></span>) or paronomasia. Does he mean "read between the lines," as we say, by the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> (additional knowledge)?</p>
<p><b>Unto the end </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως τελους</span></span>). The report of Titus showed that the majority now at last understood Paul. He hopes that it will last (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:8">1 Corinthians 1:8</span>). </p>
