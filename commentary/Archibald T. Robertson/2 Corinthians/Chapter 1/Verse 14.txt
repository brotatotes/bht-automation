<p><b> As also ye did acknowledge us in part </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως κα επεγνωτε ημας απο μερους</span></span>). Gracious acknowledgment (second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγνωσκω</span></span>) to the original Pauline party (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:4">1 Corinthians 3:4</span>) that he had seemed to care so little for them. And now in his hour of victory he shows that, if he is their ground of glorying, they are his also (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:19">1 Thessalonians 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:16">Philippians 2:16</span>). </p>
