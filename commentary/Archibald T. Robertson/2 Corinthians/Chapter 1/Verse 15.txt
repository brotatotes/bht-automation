<p><b> Confidence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεποιθησε</span></span>). This late word (LXX Philo, Josephus) is condemned by the Atticists, but Paul uses it a half dozen times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:4">2 Corinthians 3:4</span> also).</p>
<p><b>I was minded to come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβουλομην ελθειν</span></span>). Imperfect, I was wishing to come, picturing his former state of mind.</p>
<p><b>Before unto you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προτερον προς υμας</span></span>). This was his former plan (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προτερον</span></span>) while in Ephesus to go to Achaia directly from Ephesus. This he confesses in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:16">2 Corinthians 1:16</span> "and by you to pass into Macedonia."</p>
<p><b>That ye might have a second benefit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα δευτεραν χαριν σχητε</span></span>). Or second "joy" if we accept <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαραν</span></span> with Westcott and Hort. This would be a real second blessing (or joy) if they should have two visits from Paul. </p>
