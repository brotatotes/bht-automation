<p><b> Did I shew fickleness? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητ αρα τη ελαφριαι?</span></span>). An indignant negative answer is called for by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητ</span></span>. The instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαφρια</span></span> is regular after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχρησαμην</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χραομα</span></span>, to use. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ελαφρια</span></span> is a late word for levity from the old adjective, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαφρος</span></span>, light, agile (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:17">2 Corinthians 10:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:30">Matthew 11:30</span>). Here only in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Purpose </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλευομα</span></span>). Paul raises the question of fickleness about any of his plans.</p>
<p><b>Yea yea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Να να</span></span>)</p>
<p><b>--nay nay </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου ου</span></span>). See a similar repetition in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:37">Matthew 5:37</span>. It is plain in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:12">James 5:12</span> where "the yea" is "yea" and "the nay" is "nay." That seems to be Paul's meaning here, "that the Yea may be yea and the Nay may be nay." </p>
