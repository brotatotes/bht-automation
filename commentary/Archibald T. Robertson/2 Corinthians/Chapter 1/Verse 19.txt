<p><b> Was not Yea and Nay </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εγενετο να κα ου</span></span>). "Did not become Yes and No."</p>
<p><b>But in him is yea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα Να εν αυτω γεγονεν</span></span>). Rather, "But in him Yes has become yes," has proved true. So Paul appeals to the life of Christ to sustain his own veracity. </p>
