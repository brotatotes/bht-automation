<p><b> Establishes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεβαιων</span></span>). Present active participle from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεβαιος</span></span>, firm. An apt metaphor in Corinth where confirmation of a bargain often took place (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεβαιωσις</span></span>) as Deissmann shows (<i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 109) and as verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:22">2 Corinthians 1:22</span> makes plain.</p>
<p><b>Anointed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρισας</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χριω</span></span>, to anoint, old verb, to consecrate, with the Holy Spirit here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:20">1 John 2:20</span>. </p>
