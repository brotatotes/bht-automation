 Establishes  (βεβαιων). Present active participle from βεβαιος, firm. An apt metaphor in Corinth where confirmation of a bargain often took place (βεβαιωσις) as Deissmann shows (Bible Studies, p. 109) and as verse 2 Corinthians 1:22 makes plain.Anointed  (χρισας). From χριω, to anoint, old verb, to consecrate, with the Holy Spirit here as in 1 John 2:20.
