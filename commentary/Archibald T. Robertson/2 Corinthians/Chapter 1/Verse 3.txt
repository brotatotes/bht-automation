<p><b> Blessed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευλογητος</span></span>). From old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευλογεω</span></span>, to speak well of, but late verbal in LXX and Philo. Used of men in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+24:31">Genesis 24:31</span>, but only of God in N.T. as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:68">Luke 1:68</span> and chiefly in Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:31">2 Corinthians 11:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:25">Romans 1:25</span>). Paul has no thanksgiving or prayer as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:4-9">1 Corinthians 1:4-9</span>, but he finds his basis for gratitude in God, not in them.</p>
<p><b>The God and Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος κα πατηρ</span></span>). So rightly, only one article with both substantives as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1">2 Peter 1:1</span>. Paul gives the deity of Jesus Christ as our Lord (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριου</span></span>), but he does not hesitate to use the language here as it occurs. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span> where the language is identical with that here.</p>
<p><b>The father of mercies </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πατηρ των οικτιρμων</span></span>) and God of all comfort (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα θεος πασης παρακλησεως</span></span>). Paul adds an item to each word. He is the compassionate Father characterized by mercies (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικτιρμων</span></span>, old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικτειρω</span></span>, to pity, and here in plural, emotions and acts of pity). He is the God of all comfort (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακλησεως</span></span>, old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλεω</span></span>, to call to one's side, common with Paul). Paul has already used it of God who gave eternal comfort (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:16">2 Thessalonians 2:16</span>). The English word comfort is from the Latin <i>confortis</i> (brave together). The word used by Jesus of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter or Paraklete is this very word (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>). Paul makes rich use of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλεω</span></span> and the substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακλησις</span></span> in this passage (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:3-7">2 Corinthians 1:3-7</span>). He urges all sorrowing and troubled hearts to find strength in God. </p>
