<p><b> In all our affliction </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ παση τη θλιψε ημων</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θλιψις</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιβω</span></span>, to press, old and common word, as tribulation is from Latin <i>tribulum</i> (roller). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:21">Matthew 13:21</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:6">1 Thessalonians 1:6</span>. The English affliction is Latin <i>afflictio</i> from <i>ad-fligere</i>, to strike on.</p>
<p><b>That we may be able to comfort </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το δυνασθα ημας παρακαλειν</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> and the articular infinitive with the accusative of general reference, a common idiom. Paul here gives the purpose of affliction in the preacher's life, in any Christian's life, to qualify him for ministry to others. Otherwise it will be professional and perfunctory.</p>
<p><b>Wherewith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ης</span></span>). Genitive case of the relative attracted to that of the antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακλησεως</span></span>. The case of the relative here could have been either the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> with the passive verb retained as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:38">Mark 10:38</span> or the instrumental <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span>. Either is perfectly good Greek (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:6">Ephesians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>). Personal experience of God's comfort is necessary before we can pass it on to others. </p>
