<p><b> The sufferings of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα παθηματα του Χριστου</span></span>). Subjective genitive, Christ's own sufferings.</p>
<p><b>Abound unto us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσευε εις ημας</span></span>). Overflow unto us so that we suffer like sufferings and become fellow sufferers with Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:10">Philippians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>).</p>
<p><b>Through Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του Χριστου</span></span>). The overflow (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσευε</span></span>) of comfort comes also through Christ. Is Paul thinking of how some of the Jewish Christians in Corinth have become reconciled with him through Christ? Partnership with Christ in suffering brings partnership in glory also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:13">1 Peter 4:13</span>). </p>
