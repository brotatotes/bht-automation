<p><b> Concerning our affliction </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ της θλιψεως ημων</span></span>). Manuscripts read also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> for in the <i>Koine</i> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> (over) often has the idea of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> (around). Paul has laid down his philosophy of afflictions and now he cites a specific illustration in his own recent experience.</p>
<p><b>In Asia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Ασια</span></span>). Probably in Ephesus, but what it was we do not know whether sickness or peril. We do know that the disciples and the Asiarchs would not allow Paul to face the mob in the amphitheatre gathered by Demetrius (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:30">Acts 20:30</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:4">Romans 16:4</span> Paul says that Prisca and Aquila laid down their necks for him, risked their very lives for him. It may have been a later plot to kill Paul that hastened his departure from Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:1">Acts 20:1</span>). He had a trial so great that "we were weighed down exceedingly beyond our power" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθ' υπερβολην υπερ δυναμιν εβαρηθημεν</span></span>). Old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρος</span></span>, weight, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρυς</span></span>, weighty. First aorist passive indicative. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθ' υπερβολην</span></span> (cf. our hyperbole). It was beyond Paul's power to endure if left to himself.</p>
<p><b>Insomuch that we despaired even of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε εξαπορηθηνα ημας κα του ζηιν</span></span>). Usual clause of result with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span> and the infinitive. First aorist passive infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαπορηθηνα</span></span>, late compound for utter despair (perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span> and at a complete loss, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορος</span></span>, way). There seemed no way out.</p>
<p><b>Of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ζηιν</span></span>). Ablative case of the articular infinitive, of living. </p>
