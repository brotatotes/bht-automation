<p><b> Yea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span>). Confirmatory use as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:11">2 Corinthians 7:11</span>, rather than adversative.</p>
<p><b>The answer of death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το αποκριμα του θανατου</span></span>) This late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκρινομα</span></span>, to reply, occurs nowhere else in N.T., but is in Josephus, Polybius, inscriptions and papyri (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 257; Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>), and always in the sense of decision or judgment rendered. But Vulgate renders it by <i>responsum</i> and that idea suits best here, unless Paul conceives God as rendering the decision of death.</p>
<p><b>We ourselves have had within ourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτο εν εαυτοις εσχηκαμεν</span></span>). Regular perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>, to have. And still have the vivid recollection of that experience. For this lively dramatic use of the present perfect indicative for a past experience see also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσχηκα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:13">2 Corinthians 2:13</span> (Moulton, <i>Prolegomena</i>, p. 143f.; Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 896f.).</p>
<p><b>That we should not trust in ourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη πεποιθοτες ωμεν εφ' εαυτοις</span></span>). A further purpose of God in affliction beyond that in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:4">2 Corinthians 1:4</span>. "This dreadful trial was sent to him in order to give him a precious spiritual lesson (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7-10">2 Corinthians 12:7-10</span>)" (Robertson and Plummer). Note periphrastic perfect active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθω</span></span>, to persuade.</p>
<p><b>In </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>), upon, both ourselves and God. </p>
