<p><b> Now I Paul myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αυτος δε εγω Παυλος</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:2">Galatians 5:2</span>. Paul now turns to the third part of the epistle in chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10-13">2 Corinthians 10:10-13</span> in which he vigorously defends himself against the accusations of the stubborn minority of Judaizers in Corinth. Great ministers of Christ through the ages have had to pass through fiery trials like these. Paul has shown the way for us all. He speaks of himself now plainly, but under compulsion, as is clear. It may be that at this point he took the pen from the amanuensis and wrote himself as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:11">Galatians 6:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>By the meekness and gentleness of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τες πραυτητος κα επιεικιας του Χριστου</span></span>). This appeal shows (Plummer) that Paul had spoken to the Corinthians about the character of Christ. Jesus claimed meekness for himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>) and felicitated the meek (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:5">Matthew 5:5</span>) and he exemplified it abundantly (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:34">Luke 23:34</span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:15">Matthew 5:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:21">1 Corinthians 4:21</span> for this great word that has worn thin with us. Plutarch combines <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πραυτης</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιεικια</span></span> as Paul does here. Matthew Arnold suggested "sweet reasonableness" for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιεικεια</span></span> in Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch. It is in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:4">Acts 24:4</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το επιεικες</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:5">Philippians 4:5</span>). In Greek Ethics the equitable man was called <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιεικης</span></span>, a man who does not press for the last farthing of his rights (Bernard).</p>
<p><b>Lowly among you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταπεινος εν υμιν</span></span>). The bad use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταπεινος</span></span>, the old use, but here alone in N.T. in that meaning. Socrates and Aristotle used it for littleness of soul. Probably Paul here is quoting one of the sneers of his traducers in Corinth about his humble conduct while with them (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:23">1 Corinthians 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:6">2 Corinthians 7:6</span>) and his boldness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απων θαρρω</span></span>) when away (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:16">1 Corinthians 7:16</span>). "It was easy to satirize and misrepresent a depression of spirits, a humility of demeanour, which were either the direct results of some bodily affliction, or which the consciousness of this affliction had rendered habitual" (Farrar). The words stung Paul to the quick. </p>
