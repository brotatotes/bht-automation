<p><b> They say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φασιν</span></span>). Reading of B old Latin Vulgate, but Westcott and Hort prefer <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φησιν</span></span> (says one, the leader). This charge Paul quotes directly.</p>
<p><b>Weighty and strong </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρεια κα ισχυρα</span></span>). These adjectives can be uncomplimentary and mean "severe and violent" instead of "impressive and vigorous." The adjectives bear either sense.</p>
<p><b>His bodily presence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η παρουσια του σωματος</span></span>). This certainly is uncomplimentary. "The presence of his body." It seems clear that Paul did not have a commanding appearance like that of Barnabas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:12">Acts 14:12</span>). He had some physical defect of the eyes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:14">Galatians 4:14</span>) and a thorn in the flesh (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span>). In the second century <i>Acts of Paul and Thecla</i> he is pictured as small, short, bow-legged, with eye-brows knit together, and an aquiline nose. A forgery of the fourth century in the name of Lucian describes Paul as "the bald-headed, hook-nosed Galilean." However that may be, his accusers sneered at his personal appearance as "weak" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασθενης</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>His speech of no account </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λογος εξουθενημενος</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουθενεω</span></span>, to treat as nothing (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:28">1 Corinthians 1:28</span>). The Corinthians (some of them) cared more for the brilliant eloquence of Apollos and did not find Paul a trained rhetorician (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:17">1 Corinthians 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1">1 Corinthians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:4">1 Corinthians 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:6">2 Corinthians 11:6</span>). He made different impressions on different people. "Seldom has any one been at once so ardently hated and so passionately loved as St. Paul" (Deissmann, <i>St. Paul</i>, p. 70). "At one time he seemed like a man, and at another he seemed like an angel" (<i>Acts of Paul and Thecla</i>). He spoke like a god at Lystra (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:8-12">Acts 14:8-12</span>), but Eutychus went to sleep on him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:9">Acts 20:9</span>). Evidently Paul winced under this biting criticism of his looks and speech. </p>
