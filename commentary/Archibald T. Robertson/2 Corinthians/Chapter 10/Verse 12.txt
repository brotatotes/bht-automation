<p><b> To number or compare ourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενκρινα η συνκρινα</span></span>). Paronomasia here, play on the two words. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ενκρινα</span></span> is first aorist active infinitive of old verb, but here only in N.T., to judge among, to judge one as worthy to be numbered among as here. The second verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνκρινα</span></span> (first aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνκρινω</span></span>, old verb, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:13">1 Corinthians 2:13</span>) originally meant to combine as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:13">1 Corinthians 2:13</span> (which see), but here it has the sense of "compare" not found in the old Greek. The papyri use it to mean to decide. Plummer suggests "to pair and compare" for the play on the words here.</p>
<p><b>Measuring themselves by themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εαυτοις εαυτους μετρουντες</span></span>). Or "in themselves." Keenest sarcasm. Setting themselves up as the standards of orthodoxy these Judaizers always measure up to the standard while Paul falls short.</p>
<p><b>Comparing themselves with themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνκρινοντες εαυτους εαυτοις</span></span>). Associate instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτοις</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνκρινοντες</span></span> (verb just explained). Paul is not keen to fall into the trap set for him.</p>
<p><b>Are without understanding </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου συνιασιν</span></span>). The regular form for present active indicative third plural of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιημ</span></span>, to comprehend, to grasp. Some MSS. have the late form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιουσιν</span></span> (omega form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιω</span></span>). It is a hard thing to see, but it is true. These men do not see their own picture so obvious to others (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:17">Ephesians 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:7">1 Timothy 1:7</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:17">Mark 8:17</span>. </p>
