<p><b> We stretch not ourselves overmuch </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου υπερεκτεινομεν εαυτους</span></span>). Apparently Paul made this double compound verb to express his full meaning (only in Gregory Nazianzen afterwards). "We do not stretch ourselves out beyond our rights."</p>
<p><b>We came even as far as unto you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ κα υμων εφθασαμεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθανω</span></span>, to come before, to precede, the original idea which is retained in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:28">Matthew 12:28</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:20">Luke 11:20</span>) and may be so here. If so, it means "We were the first to come to you" (which is true, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:1-18">Acts 18:1-18</span>). </p>
