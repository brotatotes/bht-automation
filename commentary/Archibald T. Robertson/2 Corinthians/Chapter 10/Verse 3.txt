<p><b> In the flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν σαρκ</span></span>). But that is a very different thing from walking <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα σαρκα</span></span> according to the standards of the flesh as his enemies charged. It is easy enough to make insinuations.</p>
<p><b>We war </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατευομεθα</span></span>). Literary plural again after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογιζομα</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:2">2 Corinthians 10:2</span>. Old word to lead an army (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατος</span></span>). In N.T. only in the middle as here. Paul admits that he fights, but only the devil and his agents even if wearing the livery of heaven. Paul knew the Roman army well. He knows how to use the military metaphor. </p>
