 As if I would terrify you by my letters  (ως αν εκφοβειν υμας δια των επιστολων). This use of ως αν with the infinitive is seen in the papyri (Moulton, Prolegomena, p. 167) and it is not αν in the apodosis (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 974, 1040). The active of this old compound verb means to frighten, to terrify. Here only in N.T. It is common in the LXX (Job 7:14; Job 33:16). Note plural (letters) here and cf. 1 Corinthians 5:9; 2 Corinthians 2:3.
