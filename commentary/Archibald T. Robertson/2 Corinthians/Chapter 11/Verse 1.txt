 Would that ye could bear with me  (οφελον ανειχεσθε μου). Koine way of expressing a wish about the present, οφελον (as a conjunction, really second aorist active indicative of οφειλω without augment) and the imperfect indicative instead of ειθε or ε γαρ (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1003). Cf. Revelation 3:15. See Galatians 5:12 for future indicative with οφελον and 1 Corinthians 4:8 for aorist. Μου is ablative case after ανειχεσθε (direct middle, hold yourselves back from me). There is a touch of irony here.Bear with me  (ανεχεσθε μου). Either imperative middle or present middle indicative (ye do bear with me). Same form.In a little foolishness  (μικρον τ αφροσυνης). Accusative of general reference (μικρον τ). "Some little foolishness" (from αφρων, foolish). Old word only in this chapter in N.T.
