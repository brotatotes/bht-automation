 False apostles  (ψευδαποστολο). From ψευδης, false, and αποστολος. Paul apparently made this word (cf. Revelation 2:2). In verse 2 Corinthians 11:26 we have ψευδαδελφος, a word of like formation (Galatians 2:4). See also ψευδοχριστο and ψευδοπροφητα in Mark 13:22.Deceitful  (δολιο). Old word from δολος (lure, snare), only here in N.T. (cf. Romans 16:18).Fashioning themselves  (μετασχηματιζομενο). Present middle (direct) participle of the old verb μετασχηματιζω for which see on 1 Corinthians 4:6. Masquerading as apostles of Christ by putting on the outward habiliments, posing as ministers of Christ ("gentlemen of the cloth," nothing but cloth). Paul plays with this verb in verses 2 Corinthians 11:13; 2 Corinthians 11:14; 2 Corinthians 11:15.
