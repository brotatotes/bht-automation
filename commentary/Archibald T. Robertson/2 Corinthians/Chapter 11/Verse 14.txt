 An angel of light  (αγγελον φωτος). The prince of darkness puts on the garb of light and sets the fashion for his followers in the masquerade to deceive the saints. "Like master like man." Cf. 2 Corinthians 2:11; Galatians 1:8. This terrible portrayal reveals the depth of Paul's feelings about the conduct of the Judaizing leaders in Corinth. In Galatians 2:4 he terms those in Jerusalem "false brethren."
