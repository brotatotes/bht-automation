<p><b> An angel of light </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελον φωτος</span></span>). The prince of darkness puts on the garb of light and sets the fashion for his followers in the masquerade to deceive the saints. "Like master like man." Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:11">2 Corinthians 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span>. This terrible portrayal reveals the depth of Paul's feelings about the conduct of the Judaizing leaders in Corinth. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:4">Galatians 2:4</span> he terms those in Jerusalem "false brethren." </p>
