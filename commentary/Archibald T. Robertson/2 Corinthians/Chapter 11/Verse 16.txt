<p><b> Let no man think me foolish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη τις με δοξη αφρονα εινα</span></span>). Usual construction in a negative prohibition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the aorist subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξη</span></span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 933).</p>
<p><b>But if ye do </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δε μη γε</span></span>). Literally, "But if not at least (or otherwise)," that is, If you do think me foolish.</p>
<p><b>Yet as foolish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καν ως αφρονα</span></span>). "Even if as foolish." Paul feels compelled to boast of his career and work as an apostle of Christ after the terrible picture just drawn of the Judaizers. He feels greatly embarrassed in doing it. Some men can do it with complete composure (<i>sang froid</i>). </p>
