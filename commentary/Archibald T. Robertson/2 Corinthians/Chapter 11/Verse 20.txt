<p><b> For ye bear with a man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεχεσθε γαρ</span></span>). " You tolerate tyranny, extortion, craftiness, arrogance, violence, and insult" (Plummer). Sarcasm that cut to the bone. Note the verb with each of the five conditional clauses (enslaves, devours, takes captive, exalteth himself, smites on the face). The climax of insult, smiting on the face. </p>
