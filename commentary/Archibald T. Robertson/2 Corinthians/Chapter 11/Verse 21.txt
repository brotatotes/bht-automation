<p><b> By way of disparagement </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα ατιμιαν</span></span>). Intense irony. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:8">2 Corinthians 6:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>As though </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως οτ</span></span>). Presented as the charge of another. "They more than tolerate those who trample on them while they criticize as 'weak' one who shows them great consideration" (Plummer). After these prolonged explanations Paul "changes his tone from irony to direct and masterful assertion" (Bernard).</p>
<p><b>I am bold also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τολμω καγω</span></span>). Real courage. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:2">2 Corinthians 10:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:12">2 Corinthians 10:12</span>. </p>
