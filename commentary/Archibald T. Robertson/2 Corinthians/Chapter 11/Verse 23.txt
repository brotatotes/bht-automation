<p><b> As one beside himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραφρονων</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραφρονεω</span></span>. Old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραφρων</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα, φρην</span></span>), beside one's wits. Only here in N.T. Such open boasting is out of accord with Paul's spirit and habit.</p>
<p><b>I more </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ εγω</span></span>). This adverbial use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> appears in ancient Greek (Euripides). It has no effect on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω</span></span>, not "more than I," but "I more than they." He claims superiority now to these "superextra apostles."</p>
<p><b>More abundant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσοτερως</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:15">2 Corinthians 7:15</span>. No verbs with these clauses, but they are clear.</p>
<p><b>In prisons </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν φυλακαις</span></span>). Plural also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:5">2 Corinthians 6:5</span>. Clement of Rome (<i>Cor</i>. V.) says that Paul was imprisoned seven times. We know of only five (Philippi, Jerusalem, Caesarea, twice in Rome), and only one before II Corinthians (Philippi). But Luke does not tell them all nor does Paul. Had he been in prison in Ephesus? So many think and it is possible as we have seen.</p>
<p><b>Above measure </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερβαλλοντως</span></span>). Old adverb from the participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερβαλλοντων</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερβαλλω</span></span>, to hurl beyond). Here only in N.T.</p>
<p><b>In deaths oft </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν θανατοις πολλακις</span></span>). He had nearly lost his life, as we know, many times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:9">2 Corinthians 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:11">2 Corinthians 4:11</span>). </p>
