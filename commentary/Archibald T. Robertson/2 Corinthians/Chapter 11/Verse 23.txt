 As one beside himself  (παραφρονων). Present active participle of παραφρονεω. Old verb from παραφρων (παρα, φρην), beside one's wits. Only here in N.T. Such open boasting is out of accord with Paul's spirit and habit.I more  (υπερ εγω). This adverbial use of υπερ appears in ancient Greek (Euripides). It has no effect on εγω, not "more than I," but "I more than they." He claims superiority now to these "superextra apostles."More abundant  (περισσοτερως). See on 2 Corinthians 7:15. No verbs with these clauses, but they are clear.In prisons  (εν φυλακαις). Plural also in 2 Corinthians 6:5. Clement of Rome (Cor. V.) says that Paul was imprisoned seven times. We know of only five (Philippi, Jerusalem, Caesarea, twice in Rome), and only one before II Corinthians (Philippi). But Luke does not tell them all nor does Paul. Had he been in prison in Ephesus? So many think and it is possible as we have seen.Above measure  (υπερβαλλοντως). Old adverb from the participle υπερβαλλοντων (υπερβαλλω, to hurl beyond). Here only in N.T.In deaths oft  (εν θανατοις πολλακις). He had nearly lost his life, as we know, many times (2 Corinthians 1:9; 2 Corinthians 4:11).
