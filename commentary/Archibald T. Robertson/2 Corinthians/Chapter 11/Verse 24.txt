 Five times received I forty stripes save one  (πεντακις τεσσερακοντα παρα μιαν ελαβον). The Acts and the Epistles are silent about these Jewish floggings (Matthew 27:36). See on Luke 12:47 for omission of πληγας (stripes). Thirty-nine lashes was the rule for fear of a miscount (Deuteronomy 25:1-3). Cf. Josephus (Ant. IV. 8, 1, 21).
