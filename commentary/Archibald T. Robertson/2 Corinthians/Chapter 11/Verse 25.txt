<p><b> Thrice was I beaten with rods </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρις ερραβδισθην</span></span>). Roman (Gentile) punishment. It was forbidden to Roman citizens by the <i>Lex Porcia</i>, but Paul endured it in Philippi (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:23">Acts 16:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:37">Acts 16:37</span>), the only one of the three named in Acts. First aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραβδιζω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραβδος</span></span>, rod, <i>Koine</i> word, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:22">Acts 16:22</span> which see.</p>
<p><b>Once was I stoned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαξ ελιθασθην</span></span>). Once for all <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαξ</span></span> means. At Lystra (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:5-19">Acts 14:5-19</span>). On <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθαζω</span></span> <i>Koine</i> verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθος</span></span>, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:26">Acts 5:26</span>.</p>
<p><b>Thrice I suffered shipwreck </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρις εναυαγησα</span></span>). First aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναυαγεω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναυαγος</span></span>, shipwrecked (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναυς</span></span>, ship, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνυμ</span></span>, to break). Old and common verb, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:19">1 Timothy 1:19</span>. We know nothing of these. The one told in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:27">2 Corinthians 11:27</span> was much later. What a pity that we have no data for all these varied experiences of Paul.</p>
<p><b>Night and day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυχθημερον</span></span>) Rare word. Papyri give <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυκτημαρ</span></span> with the same idea (night-day).</p>
<p><b>Have I been in the deep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω βυθω πεποιηκα</span></span>). Vivid dramatic perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>, "I have done a night and day in the deep." The memory of it survives like a nightmare. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βυθος</span></span> is old word (only here in N.T.) for bottom, depth of the sea, then the sea itself. Paul does not mean that he was a night and day under the water, not a Jonah experience, only that he was far out at sea and shipwrecked. This was one of the three shipwrecks-already named. </p>
