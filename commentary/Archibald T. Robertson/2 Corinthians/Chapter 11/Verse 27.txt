 In labour and travail  (κοπω κα μοχθω). Both old words for severe work, combined here as in 1 Thessalonians 2:9; 2 Thessalonians 3:8, "by toil and moil" (Plummer). The rest of the list is like the items in 2 Corinthians 6:4.In cold  (εν ψυχε). Old word from ψυχω, to cool by blowing. See Acts 28:2. See the picture of the aged Paul later in the Roman dungeon (2 Timothy 4:9-18).
