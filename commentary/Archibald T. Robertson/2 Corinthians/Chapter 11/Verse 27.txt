<p><b> In labour and travail </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπω κα μοχθω</span></span>). Both old words for severe work, combined here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:8">2 Thessalonians 3:8</span>, "by toil and moil" (Plummer). The rest of the list is like the items in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:4">2 Corinthians 6:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>In cold </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ψυχε</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχω</span></span>, to cool by blowing. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:2">Acts 28:2</span>. See the picture of the aged Paul later in the Roman dungeon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:9-18">2 Timothy 4:9-18</span>). </p>
