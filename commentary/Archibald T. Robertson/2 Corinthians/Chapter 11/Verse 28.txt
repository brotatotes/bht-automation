<p><b> Besides those things that are without </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρις των παρεκτος</span></span>). Probably, "apart from those things beside these just mentioned." Surely no man ever found glory in such a peck of troubles as Paul has here recounted. His list should shame us all today who are disposed to find fault with our lot.</p>
<p><b>That which presseth upon me daily </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η επιστασις μο η καθ' ημεραν</span></span>). For this vivid word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστασις</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:12">Acts 24:12</span>, the only other place in the N.T. where it occurs. It is like the rush of a mob upon Paul.</p>
<p><b>Anxiety for all the churches </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η μεριμνα πασων των εκκλησιων</span></span>). Objective genitive after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεριμνα</span></span> (distractions in different directions, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεριζω</span></span>) for which word see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:22">Matthew 13:22</span>. Paul had the shepherd heart. As apostle to the Gentiles he had founded most of these churches. </p>
