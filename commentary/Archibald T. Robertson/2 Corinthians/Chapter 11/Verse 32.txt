<p><b> The governor under Aretas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εθναρχης Hαρετα</span></span>). How it came to pass that Damascus, ruled by the Romans after B.C. 65, came at this time to be under the rule of Aretas, fourth of the name, King of the Nabatheans (II Macc. 5:8), we do not know. There is an absence of Roman coins in Damascus from A.D. 34 to 62. It is suggested (Plummer) that Caligula, to mark his dislike for Antipas, gave Damascus to Aretas (enemy of Antipas).</p>
<p><b>Guarded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφρουρε</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρουρεω</span></span>, old verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρουρος</span></span>, a guard) to guard by posting sentries. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:24">Acts 9:24</span> we read that the Jews kept watch to seize Paul, but there is no conflict as they cooperated with the guard set by Aretas at their request.</p>
<p><b>To seize </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιασα</span></span>). Doric first aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιεζω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:38">Luke 6:38</span>) for which see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:7">Acts 3:7</span>. </p>
