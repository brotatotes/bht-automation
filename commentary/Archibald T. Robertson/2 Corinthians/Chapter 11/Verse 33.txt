<p><b> Through a window </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια θυριδος</span></span>). For this late word see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:9">Acts 20:9</span>, the only N.T. example.</p>
<p><b>Was I let down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχαλασθην</span></span>). First aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλαω</span></span>, the very word used by Luke in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:25">Acts 9:25</span>.</p>
<p><b>In a basket </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν σαργανη</span></span>). Old word for rope basket whereas Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:25">Acts 9:25</span>) has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν σφυριδ</span></span> (the word for the feeding of the 4,000 while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοφινος</span></span> is the one for the 5,000). This was a humiliating experience for Paul in this oldest city of the world whither he had started as a conqueror over the despised Christians. </p>
