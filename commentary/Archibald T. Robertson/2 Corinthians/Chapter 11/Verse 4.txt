<p><b> Another Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλον Ιησουν</span></span>). Not necessarily a different Jesus, but any other "Jesus" is a rival and so wrong. That would deny the identity.</p>
<p><b>A different spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα ετερον</span></span>). This is the obvious meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερον</span></span> in distinction from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλον</span></span> as seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:12">Acts 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>. But this distinction in nature or kind is not always to be insisted on.</p>
<p><b>A different gospel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιον ετερον</span></span>). Similar use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερον</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Ye do well to bear with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλως ανεχεσθε</span></span>). Ironical turn again. "Well do you hold yourselves back from him" (the coming one, whoever he is). Some MSS. have the imperfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανειχεσθε</span></span> (did bear with). </p>
