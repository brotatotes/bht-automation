<p><b> That I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν υστερηκενα των υπερλιαν αποστολων</span></span>). Perfect active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υστερεω</span></span>, old verb to fall short with the ablative case. The rare compound adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερλιαν</span></span> (possibly in use in the vernacular) is probably ironical also, "the super apostles" as these Judaizers set themselves up to be. "The extra-super apostles" (Farrar). Also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:11">2 Corinthians 12:11</span>. He is not referring to the pillar-apostles of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>. </p>
