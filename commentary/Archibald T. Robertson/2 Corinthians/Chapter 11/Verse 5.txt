 That I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles  (μηδεν υστερηκενα των υπερλιαν αποστολων). Perfect active infinitive of υστερεω, old verb to fall short with the ablative case. The rare compound adverb υπερλιαν (possibly in use in the vernacular) is probably ironical also, "the super apostles" as these Judaizers set themselves up to be. "The extra-super apostles" (Farrar). Also in 2 Corinthians 12:11. He is not referring to the pillar-apostles of Galatians 2:9.
