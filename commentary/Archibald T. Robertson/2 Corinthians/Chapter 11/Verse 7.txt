<p><b> In abasing myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμαυτον ταπεινων</span></span>). Humbling myself by making tents for a living while preaching in Corinth. He is ironical still about "doing a sin" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιαν εποιησα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>For nought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωρεαν</span></span>). <i>Gratis</i>. Accusative of general reference, common adverb. It amounts to sarcasm to ask if he did a sin in preaching the gospel free of expense to them "that ye may be exalted." </p>
