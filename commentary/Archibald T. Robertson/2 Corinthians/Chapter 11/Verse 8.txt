<p><b> I robbed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσυλησα</span></span>). Old verb to despoil, strip arms from a slain foe, only here in N.T. He allowed other churches to do more than their share.</p>
<p><b>Taking wages </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαβων οψωνιον</span></span>). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψωνιον</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:7">1 Corinthians 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:17">Romans 6:17</span>. He got his "rations" from other churches, not from Corinth while there. </p>
