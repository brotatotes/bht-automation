 I was not a burden to any man  (ου κατεναρκησα ουθενος). First aorist active indicative of καταναρκαω. Jerome calls this word one of Paul's cilicisms which he brought from Cilicia. But the word occurs in Hippocrates for growing quite stiff and may be a medical term in popular use. Ναρκαω means to become numb, torpid, and so a burden. It is only here and 2 Corinthians 12:13. Paul "did not benumb the Corinthians by his demand for pecuniary aid" (Vincent).From being burdensome  (αβαρη). Old adjective, free from weight or light (α privative and βαρος, weight) . See on 1 Thessalonians 2:9 for same idea. Paul kept himself independent.
