<p><b> I am become foolish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγονα αφρων</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>. In spite of what he said in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:6">2 Corinthians 12:6</span> that he would not be foolish if he gloried in the other Paul. But he feels that he has dropped back to the mood of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:1">2 Corinthians 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:16">2 Corinthians 11:16</span>. He has been swept on by the memory of the ecstasy.</p>
<p><b>For I ought to have been commended by you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω γαρ ωφειλον υφ' υμων συνιστασθα</span></span>). Explanation of "ye compelled me." Imperfect active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφειλον</span></span> of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειλω</span></span>, to be under obligation, and the tense here expresses an unfulfilled obligation about the present. But <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιστασθα</span></span> is present passive infinitive, not aorist or perfect passive. He literally means, "I ought now to be commended by you" instead of having to glorify myself. He repeats his boast already made (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:5">2 Corinthians 11:5</span>), that he is no whit behind "the super-extra apostles" (the Judaizers), "though I am nothing" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε κα ουδεν ειμ</span></span>). Even boasting himself against those false apostles causes a reaction of feeling that he has to express (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:9">1 Corinthians 15:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span>). </p>
