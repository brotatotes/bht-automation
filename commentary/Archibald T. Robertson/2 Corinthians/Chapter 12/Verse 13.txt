 Wherein ye were made inferior  (ο ησσωθητε). First aorist passive indicative of ησσοομα, the text of Aleph B D instead of the usual ηττηθητε from the common ητταομα to be inferior or less from the comparative ηττων. See ησσων in verse 2 Corinthians 12:15. Hο is the neuter accusative with the passive verb (Robertson, Grammar, p. 479).Forgive me this wrong  (χαρισασθε μο την αδικιαν ταυτην). Consummate irony to the stingy element in this church (cf. 2 Corinthians 11:9).
