<p><b> Third time I am ready to come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τριτον τουτο ετοιμως εχω</span></span>). Had he been already twice or only once? He had changed his plans once when he did not go (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:15">2 Corinthians 1:15</span>). He will not change his plans now. This looks as if he had only been once (that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:18">2 Corinthians 12:18</span>). Note the third use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταναρκαω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:9">2 Corinthians 11:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:13">2 Corinthians 12:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:14">2 Corinthians 12:14</span>). They need not be apprehensive. He will be as financially independent of them as before. "I shall not sponge on you."</p>
<p><b>Not yours, but you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου τα υμων, αλλα υμας</span></span>). The motto of every real preacher.</p>
<p><b>To lay up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θησαυριζειν</span></span>). For this use of the verb see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:2">1 Corinthians 16:2</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19-21">Matthew 6:19-21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:3">James 5:3</span>). </p>
