<p><b>Crafty </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πανουργος</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν</span></span>, all, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργο</span></span>, to do anything (good or bad). Good sense is skilful, bad sense cunning. Only here in N.T. and Paul is quoting the word from his enemies.</p>
<p><b>With guile </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δολω</span></span>). Instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δολος</span></span>, bait to catch fish with. The enemies of Paul said that he was raising this big collection for himself. Moffatt has done well to put these charges in quotation marks to make it plain to readers that Paul is ironical. </p>
