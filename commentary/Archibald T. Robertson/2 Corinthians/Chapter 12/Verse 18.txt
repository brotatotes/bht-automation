<p><b> The brother </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αδελφον</span></span>). Probably the brother of Titus (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:18">2 Corinthians 8:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>Did Titus take advantage of you? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητ επλεονεκτησεν υμας Τιτοσ?</span></span>). That puts the issue squarely.</p>
<p><b>By the same Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω αυτω πνευματ</span></span>). That translation refers to the Holy Spirit and makes the case instrumental. The locative case, "in the same spirit," makes it mean that Paul's attitude is the same as that of Titus and most likely is correct, for "in the same steps" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις αυτοις ιχνεσιν</span></span>) is in locative case. </p>
