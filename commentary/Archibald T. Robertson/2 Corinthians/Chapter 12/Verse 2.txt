<p><b> I know a man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα ανθρωπον</span></span>). Paul singles out one incident of ecstasy in his own experience that he declines to describe. He alludes to it in this indirect way as if it were some other personality.</p>
<p><b>Fourteen years ago </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ ετων δεκατεσσαρων</span></span>). Idiomatic way of putting it, the preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ</span></span> (before) before the date (Robertson, Grammar, p. 621f.) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span>. The date was probably while Paul was at Tarsus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:30">Acts 9:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:25">Acts 11:25</span>). We have no details of that period.</p>
<p><b>Caught up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαγεντα</span></span>). Second aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαζω</span></span>, to seize (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:12">Matthew 11:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>Even to the third heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εω τριτου ουρανου</span></span>). It is unlikely that Paul alludes to the idea of seven heavens held by some Jews (Test. of the Twelve Pat._, Levi ii. iii.). He seems to mean the highest heaven where God is (Plummer). </p>
