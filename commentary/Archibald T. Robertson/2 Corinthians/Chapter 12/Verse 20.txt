<p><b> Lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πως ελθων ουχ οιους θελω ευρω υμας</span></span>). An idiomatic construction after the verb of fearing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβουμα</span></span>) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πως</span></span> as the conjunction and with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ</span></span> as the negative of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρω</span></span> (second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκω</span></span>), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> the conjunction, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ</span></span> the negative. See Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 995.</p>
<p><b>And I be found </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καγω ευρεθω</span></span>). Same construction with first aorist passive subjunctive.</p>
<p><b>Such as ye would not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιον ου θελετε</span></span>). Neat change in voice just before and position of the negative here.</p>
<p><b>Lest by any means </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πως</span></span>). Still further negative purpose by repeating the conjunction. With graphic pen pictures Paul describes what had been going on against him during his long absence.</p>
<p><b>Backbitings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλαλια</span></span>). Late and rare word. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:1">1 Peter 2:1</span>. If it only existed nowhere else!</p>
<p><b>Whisperings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψιθυρισμο</span></span>). Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψιθυριζω</span></span>, to whisper into one's ear. An onomatopoetic word for the sibilant murmur of a snake charmer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ec+10:11">Ecclesiastes 10:11</span>). Only here in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Swellings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσιωσεις</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσιοω</span></span>, to swell up, late word only here and in ecclesiastical writers. Did Paul make up the word for the occasion? See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:6">1 Corinthians 4:6</span> for verb.</p>
<p><b>Tumults </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακαταστασια</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:5">2 Corinthians 6:5</span>. </p>
