<p><b> I shall not be foolish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εσομα αφρων</span></span>). Apparent contradiction to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:1">2 Corinthians 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:16">2 Corinthians 11:16</span>. But he is here speaking of the Paul "caught up" in case he should tell the things heard (condition of the third class, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and first aorist subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελησω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Of me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις εμε</span></span>). To my credit, almost like dative (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εμο</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:11">1 Corinthians 14:11</span>). </p>
