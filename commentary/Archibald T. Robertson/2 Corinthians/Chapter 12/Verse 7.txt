<p><b> By reason of the exceeding greatness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη υπερβολη</span></span>). Instrumental case, "by the excess."</p>
<p><b>That I should not be exalted overmuch </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη υπεραιρωμα</span></span>). Present passive subjunctive in final clause of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεραιρω</span></span>, old verb to lift up beyond, only here in N.T. This clause is repeated at the end of the sentence.</p>
<p><b>A thorn in the flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκολοπς τη σαρκ</span></span>). This old word is used for splinter, stake, thorn. In the papyri and inscriptions examples occur both for splinter and thorn as the meaning. In the LXX it is usually thorn. The case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη σαρκ</span></span> can be either locative (in) or dative (for). What was it? Certainly it was some physical malady that persisted. All sorts of theories are held (malaria, eye-trouble, epilepsy, insomnia, migraine or sick-headache, etc.). It is a blessing to the rest of us that we do not know the particular affliction that so beset Paul. Each of us has some such splinter or thorn in the flesh, perhaps several at once.</p>
<p><b>Messenger of Satan </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελος Σατανα</span></span>). Angel of Satan, the affliction personified.</p>
<p><b>Buffet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολαφιζη</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:67">Matthew 26:67</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:11">1 Corinthians 4:11</span> for this late and rare word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολαφος</span></span>, fist. The messenger of Satan kept slapping Paul in the face and Paul now sees that it was God's will for it to be so. </p>
