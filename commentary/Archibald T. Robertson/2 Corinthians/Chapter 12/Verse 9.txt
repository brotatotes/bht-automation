<p><b> He hath said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρηκεν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative, as if a final word. Paul probably still has the thorn in his flesh and needs this word of Christ.</p>
<p><b>Is sufficient </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρκε</span></span>). Old word of rich meaning, perhaps kin to Latin <i>arceo</i>, to ward off against danger. Christ's grace suffices and abides.</p>
<p><b>Is perfected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειτα</span></span>). Present passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελεω</span></span>, to finish. It is linear in idea. Power is continually increased as the weakness grows. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:13">Philippians 4:13</span> for this same noble conception. The human weakness opens the way for more of Christ's power and grace.</p>
<p><b>Most gladly rather </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδιστα μαλλον</span></span>). Two adverbs, one superlative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδιστα</span></span>), one comparative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλλον</span></span>). "Rather" than ask any more (thrice already) for the removal of the thorn or splinter "most gladly will I glory in my weaknesses." Slowly Paul had learned this supreme lesson, but it will never leave him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:6-8">2 Timothy 4:6-8</span>).</p>
<p><b>May rest upon me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισκηνωση επ' εμε</span></span>). Late and rare verb in first aorist active subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> (final clause), to fix a tent upon, here upon Paul himself by a bold metaphor, as if the Shechinah of the Lord was overshadowing him (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:34">Luke 9:34</span>), the power (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις</span></span>) of the Lord Jesus. </p>
