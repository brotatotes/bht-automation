 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all  (η χαρις του Κυριου Ιησου Χριστου κα η αγαπη του θεου κα η κοινωνια του αγιου πνευματος μετα παντων υμων). This benediction is the most complete of them all. It presents the persons of the Trinity in full form. From 2 Thessalonians 3:17 it appears that Paul wrote the greeting or benediction with his own hand. We know from Romans 15:19 that Paul went round about unto Illyricum before, apparently, he came on to Corinth. When he did arrive (Acts 20:1-3) the troubles from the Judaizers had disappeared. Probably the leaders left after the coming of Titus and the brethren with this Epistle. The reading of it in the church would make a stir of no small proportions. But it did the work.
