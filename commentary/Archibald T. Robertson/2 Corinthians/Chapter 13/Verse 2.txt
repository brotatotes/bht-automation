<p><b> As when I was present the second time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως παρων το δευτερον</span></span>). This translation assumes the second visit as already made. It is a natural way to take the Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως παρων</span></span>. But <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρων</span></span> can also mean "as if present" the second time (Authorized Version). Probably "as when" is the more natural rendering, but the other cannot be ruled entirely out in view of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:15-23">2 Corinthians 1:15-23</span>.</p>
<p><b>If I come again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ελθω εις το παλιν</span></span>). Condition of third class. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν</span></span> of itself suits the idea that Paul had not yet made the second visit as it means simply "again" or "back," but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:44">Matthew 26:44</span> we find <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν εκ τριτου</span></span> (again a third time) and so it is not decisive. </p>
