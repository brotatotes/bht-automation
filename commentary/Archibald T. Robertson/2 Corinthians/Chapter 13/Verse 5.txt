<p><b> Unless indeed ye be reprobate </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μητ αδοκιμο εστε</span></span>). Paul challenged his opposers in Corinth to try (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζετε</span></span>) themselves, to test (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμαζετε</span></span>) themselves, whether they were "in the faith" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη πιστε</span></span>), a much more vital matter for them than trying to prove Paul a heretic. Such tests can be made, unless, alas, they are "reprobate" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδοκιμο</span></span>, the very adjective that Paul held up before himself as a dreadful outcome to be avoided, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27">1 Corinthians 9:27</span>). </p>
