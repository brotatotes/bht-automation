<p><b> Though we be as reprobate </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις δε ως αδοκιμο ωμεν</span></span>). Literally, "And that" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα δε</span></span>). Paul wishes them to do no wrong (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακον μηδεν</span></span>). He has no desire to exercise his apostolic authority and "appear approved" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμο φανωμεν</span></span>, second aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαινω</span></span>). He had far rather see them do "the noble thing" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το καλον</span></span>) even if it should make him appear disapproved after all that he has said. </p>
