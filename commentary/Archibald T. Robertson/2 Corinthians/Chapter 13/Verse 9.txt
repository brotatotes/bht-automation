<p><b> For we rejoice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρομεν γαρ</span></span>). Paul had far rather be weak in the sense of failing to exercise his apostolic power because they did the noble thing. He is no Jonah who lamented when Ninevah repented.</p>
<p><b>Your perfecting </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμων καταρτισιν</span></span>). Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταρτιζω</span></span>, to fit, to equip (see verb in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11">2 Corinthians 13:11</span>). In Plutarch, only here in N.T. </p>
