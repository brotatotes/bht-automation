<p><b> That I would not come again to you with sorrow </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μη παλιν εν λυπη προς υμας ελθειν</span></span>). Articular second aorist active infinitive with negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο</span></span> (this) preceding. What does Paul mean by "again" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν</span></span>)? Had he paid another visit besides that described in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:18">2 Corinthians 2:18</span> which was in sorrow (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν λυπη</span></span>)? Or does he mean that having had one joyful visit (that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:18">2 Corinthians 2:18</span>) he does not wish the second one to be in sorrow? Either interpretation is possible as the Greek stands and scholars disagree. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:14">2 Corinthians 12:14</span> "The third time I am ready to come" may refer to the proposed second visit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:15">2 Corinthians 1:15</span>) and the present plan (a third). And so as to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1">2 Corinthians 13:1</span>. There is absolutely no way to tell clearly whether Paul had already made a second visit. If he had done so, it is a bit odd that he did not plainly say so in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:15">2 Corinthians 1:15</span> when he is apologizing for not having made the proposed visit ("a second benefit"). </p>
