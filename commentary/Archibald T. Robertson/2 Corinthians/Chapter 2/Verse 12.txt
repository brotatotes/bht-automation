 To Troas  (εις την Τρωιαδα). Luke does not mention this stop at Troas on the way from Ephesus to Macedonia (Acts 20:1), though he does mention two other visits there (Acts 16:8; Acts 20:6).When a door was opened unto me  (θυρας μο ανεωιγμενης). Genitive absolute with second perfect passive participle of ανοιγνυμ. Paul used this very metaphor in 1 Corinthians 16:9. He will use it again in Colossians 4:3. Here was an open door that he could not enter.
