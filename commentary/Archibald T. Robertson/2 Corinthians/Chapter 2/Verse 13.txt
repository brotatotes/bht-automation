 I had no relief  (ουκ εσχηκα ανεσιν). Perfect active indicative like that in 2 Corinthians 1:9, vivid dramatic recital, not to be treated as "for" the aorist (Robertson, Grammar, p. 896, 898ff.). He still feels the shadow of that restlessness. Ανεσις, from ανιημ, to let up, to hold back, is old word for relaxing or release (Acts 24:34).For my spirit  (τω πνευματ μου). Dative of interest.Because I found not Titus  (τω μη ευρειν με Τιτον). Instrumental case of the articular infinitive with negative μη and accusative of general reference με, "by the not finding Titus as to me."Taking my leave of them  (αποταξαμενος αυτοις). First aorist middle participle of αποτασσω, old verb, to set apart, in middle in late Greek to separate oneself, to bid adieu to as in Mark 6:46.
