<p><b> But thanks be unto God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω δε θεω χαρις</span></span>). Sudden outburst of gratitude in contrast to the previous dejection in Troas. Surely a new paragraph should begin here. In point of fact Paul makes a long digression from here to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:10">2 Corinthians 6:10</span> on the subject of the Glory of the Christian Ministry as Bachmann points out in his <i>Kommentar</i> (p. 124), only he runs it from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12-7">2 Corinthians 2:12-7</span> (<i>Aus der Tiefe in die Hohe</i>, Out of the Depths to the Heights). We can be grateful for this emotional outburst, Paul's rebound of joy on meeting Titus in Macedonia, for it has given the world the finest exposition of all sides of the Christian ministry in existence, one that reveals the wealth of Paul's nature and his mature grasp of the great things in service for Christ. See my <i>The Glory of the Ministry (An Exposition of II Cor. 2:12-6:10</i>).</p>
<p><b>Always </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντοτε</span></span>). The sense of present triumph has blotted out the gloom at Troas.</p>
<p><b>Leadeth in triumph </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θριαμβευοντ</span></span>). Late common <i>Koine</i> word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θριαμβος</span></span> (Latin <i>triumphus</i>, a hymn sung in festal processions to Bacchus). Verbs in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ευω</span></span> (like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαθητευω</span></span>, to make disciples) may be causative, but no example of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θριαμβευω</span></span> has been found with this meaning. It is always to lead in triumph, in papyri sometimes to make a show of. Picture here is of Paul as captive in God's triumphal procession.</p>
<p><b>The savour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την οσμην</span></span>). In a Roman triumph garlands of flowers scattered sweet odour and incense bearers dispensed perfumes. The knowledge of God is here the aroma which Paul had scattered like an incense bearer. </p>
