<p><b> A sweet savour of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστου ευωδια</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ</span></span>, well, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οζω</span></span>, to smell. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:18">Philippians 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</span>. In spreading the fragrance of Christ the preacher himself becomes fragrant (Plummer).</p>
<p><b>In them that are perishing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις απολλυμενοις</span></span>). Even in these if the preacher does his duty. </p>
