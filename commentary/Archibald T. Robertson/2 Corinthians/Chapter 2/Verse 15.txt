 A sweet savour of Christ  (Χριστου ευωδια). Old word from ευ, well, and οζω, to smell. In N.T. only here and Philippians 4:18; Ephesians 5:2. In spreading the fragrance of Christ the preacher himself becomes fragrant (Plummer).In them that are perishing  (εν τοις απολλυμενοις). Even in these if the preacher does his duty.
