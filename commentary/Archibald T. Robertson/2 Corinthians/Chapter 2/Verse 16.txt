<p><b> From death unto death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ θανατου εις θανατον</span></span>). From one evil condition to another. Some people are actually hardened by preaching.</p>
<p><b>And who is sufficient for these things? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα προς ταυτα τις ικανοσ?</span></span>). Rhetorical question. In himself no one is. But some one has to preach Christ and Paul proceeds to show that he is sufficient.</p>
<p><b>For we are not as the many </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γαρ εσμεν ως ο πολλο</span></span>). A bold thing to say, but necessary and only from God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>). </p>
