<p><b> Corrupting </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καπηλευοντες</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καπηλος</span></span>, a huckster or peddlar, common in all stages of Greek for huckstering or trading. It is curious how hucksters were suspected of corrupting by putting the best fruit on top of the basket. Note Paul's solemn view of his relation to God as a preacher (<b> from God </b> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ θεου</span></span>,</p>
<p><b>in the sight of God </b> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεναντ θεου</span></span>,</p>
<p><b>in Christ </b> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Χριστω</span></span>). </p>
