 Who then?  (κα τισ?). For this use of κα see on Mark 10:26; John 9:36. The κα accepts the condition (first class ει--λυπω) and shows the paradox that follows. Λυπεω is old word from λυπη (sorrow) in causative sense, to make sorry.Maketh glad  (ευφραινων). Present active participle of old word from ευ, well, and φρην, mind, to make joyful, causative idea like λυπεω.
