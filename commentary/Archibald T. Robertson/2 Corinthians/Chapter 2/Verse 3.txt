<p><b> I wrote this very thing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγραψα τουτο αυτο</span></span>). Is this (and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγραψα</span></span> in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:4">2 Corinthians 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:9">2 Corinthians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span>) the epistolary aorist referring to the present letter? In itself that is possible as the epistolary aorist does occur in the N.T. as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:18">2 Corinthians 8:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:3">2 Corinthians 9:3</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 854f.). If not epistolary aorist as seems improbable from the context and from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:8-12">2 Corinthians 7:8-12</span>, to what Epistle does he refer? To <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:1">2 Corinthians 2:1</span> or to a lost letter? It is possible, of course, that, when Paul decided not to come to Corinth, he sent a letter. The language that follows in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:3">2 Corinthians 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:4">2 Corinthians 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:8-12">2 Corinthians 7:8-12</span> can hardly apply to I Corinthians.</p>
<p><b>Should have sorrow </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυπην σχω</span></span>). Second aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>, should get sorrow, after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη</span></span> negative final particles.</p>
<p><b>From them of whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφ' ων</span></span>). Antecedent omitted, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο τουτων αφ' ων</span></span> (from those from whom).</p>
<p><b>I ought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδε με</span></span>). Imperfect for unrealized present obligation as often and like English.</p>
<p><b>Having confidence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεποιθως</span></span>). Second perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:9">2 Corinthians 1:9</span>). </p>
