<p><b> If any </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τις</span></span>). Scholars disagree whether Paul refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1">1 Corinthians 5:1</span>, where he also employs <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τισ, τοιουτος</span></span>, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σατανας</span></span> as here, or to the ringleader of the opposition to him. Either view is possible. In both cases Paul shows delicacy of feeling by not mentioning the name.</p>
<p><b>But in part </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα απο μερους</span></span>). "But to some extent to you all." The whole Corinthian Church has been injured in part by this man's wrongdoing. There is a parenthesis (<b> that I press not too heavily </b>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη επιβαρω</span></span>) that interrupts the flow of ideas. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Επιβαρεω</span></span>, to put a burden on (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι, βαρος</span></span>), is a late word, only in Paul in N.T. (here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:8">2 Thessalonians 3:8</span>). He does not wish to give pain by too severe language. </p>
