<p><b> Punishment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτιμια</span></span>). Late word for old Greek to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτιμιον</span></span> (so papyri), from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτιμαω</span></span>, to show honour to, to award, to adjudge penalty. Only here in N.T.</p>
<p><b>By the many </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο των πλειονων</span></span>). By the more, the majority. If Paul refers to the case in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:1">2 Corinthians 2:1</span>, they had taken his advice and expelled the offender. </p>
