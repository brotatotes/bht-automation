 It shall turn  (επιστρεψε). The heart of Israel.The veil is taken away  (περιαιρειτα το καλυμμα). Present passive indicative of περιαιρεω, old verb, to take from around, as of anchors (Acts 27:40), to cut loose (Acts 28:13), for hope to be taken away (Acts 27:20). Here Paul has in mind Exodus 34:34 where we find of Moses that περιηιρειτο το καλυμμα (the veil was taken from around his face) whenever he went before the Lord. After the ceremony the veil is taken from around (περι-) the face of the bride.
