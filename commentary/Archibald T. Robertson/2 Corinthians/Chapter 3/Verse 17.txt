<p><b> Now the Lord is the Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε Κυριος το πνευμα εστιν</span></span>). Some, like E. F. Scott (<i>The Spirit in the N.T.</i>), take <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span> here to be Christ and interpret Paul as denying the personality of the Holy Spirit, identifying Christ and the Holy Spirit. But is not Bernard right here in taking <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span> (Lord) in the same sense here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:34">Exodus 34:34</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εναντ Κυριου</span></span>, before the Lord), the very passage that Paul is quoting? Certainly, the Holy Spirit is interchangeably called in the N.T. the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span>). Christ dwells in us by the Holy Spirit, but the language here in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span> should not be pressed unduly (Plummer. See also P. Gardner, <i>The Religious Experience of St. Paul</i>, p. 176f.). Note "the Spirit of the Lord" here.</p>
<p><b>Liberty </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελευθερια</span></span>). Freedom of access to God without fear in opposition to the fear in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:30">Exodus 34:30</span>. We need no veil and we have free access to God. </p>
