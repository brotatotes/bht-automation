 We all  (ημεις παντες). All of us Christians, not merely ministers.With unveiled face  (ανακεκαλυμμενω προσωπω). Instrumental case of manner. Unlike and like Moses.Reflecting as in a mirror  (κατοπτριζομενο). Present middle participle of κατοπτριζω, late verb from κατοπτρον, mirror (κατα, οπτρον, a thing to see with). In Philo (Legis Alleg. iii. 33) the word means beholding as in a mirror and that idea suits also the figure in 1 Corinthians 13:12. There is an inscription of third century B.C. with εγκατοπτρισασθα εις το υδωρ, to look at one's reflection in the water. Plutarch uses the active for mirroring or reflecting and Chrysostom takes it so here. Either makes good sense. The point that Paul is making is that we shall not lose the glory as Moses did. But that is true if we keep on beholding or keep on reflecting (present tense). Only here in N.T.Are transformed  (μεταμορφουμεθα). Present passive (are being transformed) of μεταμορφοω, late verb and in papyri. See on Matthew 17:2; Mark 9:2 where it is translated "transfigured." It is the word used for heathen mythological metamorphoses.Into the same image  (την αυτην εικονα). Accusative retained with passive verb μεταμορφουμεθα. Into the likeness of God in Christ (1 Corinthians 15:48-53; Romans 8:17; Romans 8:29; Colossians 3:4; 1 John 3:2).As from the Lord the Spirit  (καθαπερ απο Κυριου πνευματος). More likely, "as from the Spirit of the Lord."
