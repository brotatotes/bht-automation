<p><b> Ye are our epistle </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η επιστολη ημων υμεις εστε</span></span>). Bold turn. Paul was writing in their hearts.</p>
<p><b>Known and read </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκομενη κα αναγινωσκομενη</span></span>). Play on the word. Literally true. Professing Christians are the Bible that men read and know. </p>
