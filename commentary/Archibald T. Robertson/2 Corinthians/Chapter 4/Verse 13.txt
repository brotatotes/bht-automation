<p><b> According to that which is written </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα το γεγραμμενον</span></span>). This formula in legal documents in the papyri (<i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 250). Paul makes adaptation of the words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:1">Psalms 95:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>We also believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ημεις πιστευομεν</span></span>). Like the Psalmist. And therefore can speak with effect. Otherwise useless.</p>
<p><b>Shall present us with you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα παραστησε συν ημιν</span></span>). This shows that Paul was not certain that he would be alive when Jesus comes as has been wrongly inferred from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:29">1 Corinthians 7:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:11">1 Corinthians 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:51">1 Corinthians 15:51</span>. </p>
