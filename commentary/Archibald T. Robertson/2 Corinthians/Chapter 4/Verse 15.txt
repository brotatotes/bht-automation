<p><b> Being multiplied through the many </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεονασασα δια των πλειονων</span></span>). Late word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεοναζω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεον</span></span>, more, "making more through the more," with play on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεον</span></span>. One can think of Bunyan's <i>Grace Abounding</i>. </p>
