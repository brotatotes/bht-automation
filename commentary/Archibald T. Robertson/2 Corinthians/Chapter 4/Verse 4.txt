<p><b> The god of this world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος του αιωνος τουτου</span></span>). "Age," more exactly, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:20">1 Corinthians 1:20</span>. Satan is "the god of this age," a phrase nowhere else in the N.T., but Jesus uses the same idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:31">John 12:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:30">John 14:30</span> and Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span> and John in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:19">1 John 5:19</span>. Satan claimed the rule over the world in the temptations with Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Blinded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετυφλωσεν</span></span>). First aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυφλοω</span></span>, old verb to blind (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυφλος</span></span>, blind). They refused to believe (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιστων</span></span>) and so Satan got the power to blind their thoughts. That happens with wilful disbelievers.</p>
<p><b>The light </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον φωτισμον</span></span>). The illumination, the enlightening. Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοτιζω</span></span>, to give light, in Plutarch and LXX. In N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>. Accusative case of general reference here with the articular infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το μη αυγασα</span></span> that should not dawn). That is, if <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυγασα</span></span> is intransitive as is likely, though it is transitive in the old poets (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυγη</span></span>, radiance. Cf. German <i>Auge</i>=eye). If it is transitive, the idea would be "that they should not see clearly the illumination, etc." </p>
