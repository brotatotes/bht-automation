<p><b> This treasure </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον θησαυρον τουτον</span></span>). On <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θησαυρον</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19-21">Matthew 6:19-21</span>. It is the power of giving the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>). "The power is limitless, but it is stored in very unlikely receptacles" (Plummer). This warning Paul gives in contrast (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>) with the exultation of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span> (Bernard).</p>
<p><b>In earthen vessels </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν οστρακινοις σκευεσιν</span></span>). This adjective is common in the LXX with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκευοσ, αγγος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγειον</span></span>. It occurs again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:20">2 Timothy 2:20</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκευη</span></span>. It is found also in the papyri with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκευος</span></span> as here. It is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οστρακον</span></span>, baked clay (same root as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οστεον</span></span>, bone), so many fragments of which are found in Egypt with writing on them. We are but earthen jars used of God for his purposes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:20">Romans 9:20</span>) and so fragile.</p>
<p><b>The exceeding greatness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η υπερβολη</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span> for this word, "the preeminence of the power." This is God's purpose (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα--η</span></span>). God, not man, is the</p>
<p><b>dynamo </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις</span></span>). It comes from God (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θεου</span></span>, ablative) and does not originate with us (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη εξ ημων</span></span>). </p>
