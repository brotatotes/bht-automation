 Pressed  (θλιβομενο). From θλιβω, to press as grapes, to contract, to squeeze. Series of present passive participles here through verse 2 Corinthians 4:9 that vividly picture Paul's ministerial career.Yet not straitened  (αλλ' ου στενοχωρουμενο). Each time the exception is stated by αλλ' ου. From στενοχωρεω (στενοχωρος, from στενος, narrow, χωρος, space), to be in a narrow place, to keep in a tight place. Late verb, in LXX and papyri. In N.T. only here and 2 Corinthians 6:12.Yet not unto despair  (αλλ' ουκ εξαπορουμενο). Late perfective compound with εξ- of εξαπορεω. A very effective play on words here, lost, but not lost out.
