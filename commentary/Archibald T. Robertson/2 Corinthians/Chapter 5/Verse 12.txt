<p><b>That ye may have wherewith to answer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα εχητε προς</span></span>). Literally, "That ye may have something against (for facing those, etc.)." Paul wishes his champions in Corinth to know the facts.</p>
<p><b>In appearance, and not in heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν προσωπω κα μη εν καρδια</span></span>). He means the Judaizers who were braggarts about their orthodox Judaism. </p>
