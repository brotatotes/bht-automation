<p><b> Whether we are beside ourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειτε εξεστημεν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξιστημ</span></span>, old verb, here to stand out of oneself (intransitive) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκστασις</span></span>, ecstasy, comes as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:42">Mark 5:42</span>. It is literary plural, for Paul is referring only to himself. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:6">2 Corinthians 1:6</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειτε--ειτε</span></span>. It is a condition of the first class and Paul assumes as true the charge that he was crazy (if I was crazy) for the sake of argument. Festus made it later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:24">Acts 26:24</span>). He spoke with tongues (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:18">1 Corinthians 14:18</span>) and had visions (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:1-6">2 Corinthians 12:1-6</span>) which probably the Judaizers used against him. A like charge was made against Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:21">Mark 3:21</span>). People often accuse those whom they dislike with being a bit off. </p>
