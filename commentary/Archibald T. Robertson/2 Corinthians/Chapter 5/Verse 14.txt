<p><b> The love of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αγαπη του Χριστου</span></span>). Subjective genitive, Christ's love for Paul as shown by verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:15">2 Corinthians 5:15</span>.</p>
<p><b>Constraineth us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεχε ημας</span></span>). Old and common verb, to hold together, to press the ears together (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:57">Acts 7:57</span>), to press on every side (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:45">Luke 8:45</span>), to hold fast (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:63">Luke 22:63</span>), to hold oneself to (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:5">Acts 18:5</span>), to be pressed (passive, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:50">Luke 12:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span>). So here Paul's conception of Christ's love for him holds him together to his task whatever men think or say.</p>
<p><b>Judging this </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριναντας τουτο</span></span>). Having reached this conclusion, ever since his conversion (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:17">Galatians 1:17</span>).</p>
<p><b>One died for all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις υπερ παντων απεθανεν</span></span>). This is the central tenet in Paul's theology and Christology. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυπερ</span></span> (over) here is used in the sense of substitution as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:50">John 11:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span>, death in behalf so that the rest will not have to die. This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> is common in the papyri (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 631). In fact, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> in this sense is more usual in Greek than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντι, προ</span></span> or any other preposition.</p>
<p><b>Therefore all died </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα ο παντες απεθανον</span></span>). Logical conclusion (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα</span></span>, corresponding), the one died for the all and so the all died when he did, all the spiritual death possible for those for whom Christ died. This is Paul's gospel, clear-cut, our hope today. </p>
