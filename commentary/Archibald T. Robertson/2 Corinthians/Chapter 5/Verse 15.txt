<p><b> Should no longer live unto themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μηκετ εαυτοις ζωσιν</span></span>). The high doctrine of Christ's atoning death carries a correspondingly high obligation on the part of those who live because of him. Selfishness is ruled out by our duty to live "unto him who for their sakes died and rose again." </p>
