 Henceforth  (απο του νυν). From the time that we gained this view of Christ's death for us.After the flesh  (κατα σαρκα). According to the flesh, the fleshy way of looking at men. He, of course, knows men "in the flesh (εν τη σαρκ), but Paul is not speaking of that. Worldly standards and distinctions of race, class, cut no figure now with Paul (Galatians 3:28) as he looks at men from the standpoint of the Cross of Christ.Even though we have known Christ after the flesh  (ε κα εγνωκαμεν κατα σαρκα Χριστον). Concessive clause (ε κα, if even or also) with perfect active indicative. Paul admits that he had once looked at Christ κατα σαρκα, but now no longer does it. Obviously he uses κατα σαρκα in precisely the same sense that he did in verse 2 Corinthians 5:15 about men. He had before his conversion known Christ κατα σαρκα, according to the standards of the men of his time, the Sanhedrin and other Jewish leaders. He had led the persecution against Jesus till Jesus challenged and stopped him (Acts 9:4). That event turned Paul clean round and he no longer knows Christ in the old way κατα σαρκα. Paul may or may not have seen Jesus in the flesh before his death, but he says absolutely nothing on that point here.
