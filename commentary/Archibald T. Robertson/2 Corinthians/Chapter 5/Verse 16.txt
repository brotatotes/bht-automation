<p><b> Henceforth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο του νυν</span></span>). From the time that we gained this view of Christ's death for us.</p>
<p><b>After the flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα σαρκα</span></span>). According to the flesh, the fleshy way of looking at men. He, of course, knows men "in the flesh (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη σαρκ</span></span>), but Paul is not speaking of that. Worldly standards and distinctions of race, class, cut no figure now with Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:28">Galatians 3:28</span>) as he looks at men from the standpoint of the Cross of Christ.</p>
<p><b>Even though we have known Christ after the flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε κα εγνωκαμεν κατα σαρκα Χριστον</span></span>). Concessive clause (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε κα</span></span>, if even or also) with perfect active indicative. Paul admits that he had once looked at Christ <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα σαρκα</span></span>, but now no longer does it. Obviously he uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα σαρκα</span></span> in precisely the same sense that he did in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:15">2 Corinthians 5:15</span> about men. He had before his conversion known Christ <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα σαρκα</span></span>, according to the standards of the men of his time, the Sanhedrin and other Jewish leaders. He had led the persecution against Jesus till Jesus challenged and stopped him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:4">Acts 9:4</span>). That event turned Paul clean round and he no longer knows Christ in the old way <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα σαρκα</span></span>. Paul may or may not have seen Jesus in the flesh before his death, but he says absolutely nothing on that point here. </p>
