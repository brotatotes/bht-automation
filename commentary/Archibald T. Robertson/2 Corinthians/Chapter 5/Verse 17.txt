<p><b> A new creature </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινη κτισις</span></span>). A fresh start is made (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινη</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κτισις</span></span> is the old word for the act of creating (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>), but in N.T. by metonymy it usually bears the notion of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτισμα</span></span>, the thing created or creature as here.</p>
<p><b>The old things are passed away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα αρχαια παρηλθεν</span></span>). Did pass by, he means. Second aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρερχομα</span></span>, to go by. The ancient (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχαια</span></span>) way of looking at Christ among other things. And yet today there are scholars who are trying to revive the old prejudiced view of Jesus Christ as a mere man, a prophet, to give us "a reduced Christ." That was once Paul's view, but it passed by forever for him. It is a false view and leaves us no gospel and no Saviour.</p>
<p><b>Behold, they are become new </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδου, γεγονε καινα</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>, have become new (fresh, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινα</span></span>) to stay so. </p>
