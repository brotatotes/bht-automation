<p><b> Who reconciled us to himself through Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του καταλλαξαντος ημας εαυτω δια Χριστου</span></span>). Here Paul uses one of his great doctrinal words, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλλασσω</span></span>, old word for exchanging coins. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διαλλασσω</span></span>, to change one's mind, to reconcile, occurs in N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:24">Matthew 5:24</span> though in papyri (Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 187), and common in Attic. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Καταλλασσω</span></span> is old verb, but more frequent in later writers. We find <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναλλασσω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:26">Acts 7:26</span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαταλλασσω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:16">Ephesians 2:16</span> and the substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλλαγη</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:11">Romans 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:15">Romans 11:15</span> as well as here. It is hard to discuss this great theme without apparent contradiction. God's love (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>) provided the means and basis for man's reconciliation to God against whom he had sinned. It is all God's plan because of his love, but God's own sense of justice had to be satisfied (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:26">Romans 3:26</span>) and so God gave his Son as a propitiation for our sins (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:10">1 John 4:10</span>). The point made by Paul here is that God needs no reconciliation, but is engaged in the great business of reconciling us to himself. This has to be done on God's terms and is made possible through (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) Christ.</p>
<p><b>And gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα δοντος ημιν την διακονιαν της καταλλαγης</span></span>). It is a ministry marked by reconciliation, that consists in reconciliation. God has made possible through Christ our reconciliation to him, but in each case it has to be made effective by the attitude of each individual. The task of winning the unreconciled to God is committed to us. It is a high and holy one, but supremely difficult, because the offending party (the guilty) is the hardest to win over. We must be loyal to God and yet win sinful men to him. </p>
