<p><b> To wit, that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως οτ</span></span>). Latin puts it <i>quoniam quidem</i>. It is an unclassical idiom, but occurs in the papyri and inscriptions (Moulton, <i>Prol</i>., p. 212; Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1033). It is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="es+4:14">Esther 4:14</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:21">2 Corinthians 11:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span>. It probably means "how that."</p>
<p><b>Not reckoning </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη λογιζομενος</span></span>). What Jesus did (his death for us) stands to our credit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:32">Romans 8:32</span>) if we make our peace with God. This is our task, "the word of reconciliation," that we may receive "the righteousness of God" and be adopted into the family of God. </p>
