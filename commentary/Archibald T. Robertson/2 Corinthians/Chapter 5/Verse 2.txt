 To be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven  (το οικητηριον ημων το εξ ουρανου επενδυσασθα). First aorist middle infinitive of late verb επενδυω, double compound (επ, εν) to put upon oneself. Cf. επενδυτης for a fisherman's linen blouse or upper garment (John 21:7). Οικητηριον is old word used here of the spiritual body as the abode of the spirit. It is a mixed metaphor (putting on as garment the dwelling-place).
