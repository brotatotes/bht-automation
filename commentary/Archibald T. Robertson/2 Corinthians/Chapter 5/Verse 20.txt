<p><b> We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ Χριστου ουν πρεσβευομεν</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυς</span></span>, an old man, first to be an old man, then to be an ambassador (here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:20">Ephesians 6:20</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αλυση</span></span> in a chain added), common in both senses in the Greek. "The proper term in the Greek East for the Emperor's Legate" (Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 374), in inscriptions and papyri. So Paul has a natural pride in using this dignified term for himself and all ministers. The ambassador has to be <i>persona grata</i> with both countries (the one that he represents and the one to which he goes). Paul was Christ's <i>Legate</i> to act in his behalf and in his stead.</p>
<p><b>As though God were intreating by us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως του θεου παρακαλουντος δι' ημων</span></span>). Genitive absolute with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> used with the participle as often to give the reason (apparent or real). Here God speaks through Christ's Legate.</p>
<p><b>Be ye reconciled to God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλλαγητε τω θεω</span></span>). Second aorist passive imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλλασσω</span></span> and used with the dative case. "Get reconciled to God," and do it now. This is the ambassador's message as he bears it to men from God. </p>
