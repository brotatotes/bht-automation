<p><b> Him who knew no sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον μη γνοντα αμαρτιαν</span></span>). Definite claim by Paul that Jesus did not commit sin, had no personal acquaintance (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη γνοντα</span></span>, second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>) with it. Jesus made this claim for himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:46">John 8:46</span>). This statement occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:22">1 Peter 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26">Hebrews 7:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:5">1 John 3:5</span>. Christ was and is "a moral miracle" (Bernard) and so more than mere man.</p>
<p><b>He made to be sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιαν εποιησεν</span></span>). The words "to be" are not in the Greek. "Sin" here is the substantive, not the verb. God "treated as sin" the one "who knew no sin." But he knew the contradiction of sinners (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:3">Hebrews 12:3</span>). We may not dare to probe too far into the mystery of Christ's suffering on the Cross, but this fact throws some light on the tragic cry of Jesus just before he died: "My God, My God, why didst thou forsake me?" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:46">Matthew 27:46</span>).</p>
<p><b>That we might become </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ημεις γενωμεθα</span></span>). Note "become." This is God's purpose (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>) in what he did and in what Christ did. Thus alone can we obtain God's righteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>). </p>
