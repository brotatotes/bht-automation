<p><b> Not for that we would be unclothed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφ' ω ου θελομεν εκδυσασθα</span></span>). Rather, "For that (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφ' ω</span></span>) we do not wish to put off the clothing, but to put it on" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' επενδυσασθα</span></span>). The transposition of the negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> weakens the sense. Paul does not wish to be a mere disembodied spirit without his spiritual garment.</p>
<p><b>That what is mortal may be swallowed up of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα καταποθη το θνητον υπο της ζωης</span></span>). "Only what is mortal perishes; the personality, consisting of soul and body, survives," (Plummer). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:22">2 Corinthians 1:22</span> for "the earnest of the spirit." </p>
