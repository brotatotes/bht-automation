 Not for that we would be unclothed  (εφ' ω ου θελομεν εκδυσασθα). Rather, "For that (εφ' ω) we do not wish to put off the clothing, but to put it on" (αλλ' επενδυσασθα). The transposition of the negative ου weakens the sense. Paul does not wish to be a mere disembodied spirit without his spiritual garment.That what is mortal may be swallowed up of life  (ινα καταποθη το θνητον υπο της ζωης). "Only what is mortal perishes; the personality, consisting of soul and body, survives," (Plummer). See on 2 Corinthians 1:22 for "the earnest of the spirit."
