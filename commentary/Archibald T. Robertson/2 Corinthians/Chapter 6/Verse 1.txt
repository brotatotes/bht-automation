<p><b> Working together with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεργουντες</span></span>). We are co-workers, partners with God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>), in this work of grace.</p>
<p><b>In vain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις κενον</span></span>). Into emptiness. The plan of God, the work of Christ on the Cross, the pleas of the ambassador may all be nullified by the recipient of the message. </p>
