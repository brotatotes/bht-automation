<p><b> Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη γινεσθε ετεροζυγουντες απιστοις</span></span>). No other example of this verb has yet been found, though the adjective from which it is apparently formed, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετεροζυγος</span></span> (yoked with a different yoke) occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+19:19">Leviticus 19:19</span> of the union of beasts of different kinds. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+22:10">Deuteronomy 22:10</span> we read: "Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together." Literally, "Stop becoming (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη γινεσθε</span></span> present imperative, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη γενησθε</span></span> aorist subj.) unequally yoked with unconverted heathen (unbelievers)." Some were already guilty. Marriage is certainly included, but other unions may be in mind. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:7">Ephesians 5:7</span>. Paul gives as the reason (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>) for this prohibition five words in questions to distinguish the contrasts.</p>
<p><b>Fellowship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετοχη</span></span>). Sharing with and followed by associative instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη</span></span> (righteousness) and iniquity (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανομια</span></span>). A pertinent challenge today when church members wink at violations of laws of the land and laws of God.</p>
<p><b>Communion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνια</span></span>). Partnership to light (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωτ</span></span> dative case) with (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span>), facing darkness. </p>
