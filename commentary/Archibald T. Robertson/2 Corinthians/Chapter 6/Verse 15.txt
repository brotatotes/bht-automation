<p><b> Concord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφωνησις</span></span>). Symphony. Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφωνεω</span></span>, only here and ecclesiastical writers, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφωνημα</span></span> in the papyri.</p>
<p><b>Belial </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βελιαλ</span></span>). Transliteration of Hebrew word for worthlessness and applied to Satan (<i>Book of Jubilees</i> 1.20) as here. Paul graphically sums up the contrast between Christ and Belial (Satan), the heads of the contending forces of good and evil.</p>
<p><b>Portion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μερις</span></span>). The fourth of the words. Here by "unbeliever" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιστου</span></span>) Paul means "disbeliever," not just an unconverted man who yet approves Christ. </p>
