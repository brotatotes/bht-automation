 By glory and dishonour  (δια δοξης κα ατιμιας). Here δια is no longer instrument, but state or condition. Δοξα here is glory. See Romans 9:21; 2 Timothy 2:20 for contrast between honour and dishonour (τιμη, ατιμια).By evil report and good report  (δια δυσφημιας κα ευφημιας). Play on the words with prefixes δυσ- and ευ- and φημη. Δυσφημια is a late word, only here in N.T. Ευφημια, old and common word, only here in N.T.As deceivers and yet true  (ως πλανο κα αληθεις). Paul takes up ως now in place of δια which succeeded εν. Note use of κα in sense of "and yet" (adversative). Πλανος is late word (Diodorus, Josephus) for wandering, vagabond, impostor (cf. πλαναω, to lead astray, used of Christ, John 7:12). In N.T. only here; Matthew 27:63 (of Christ by Pharisees); 2 John 1:7. "In the Clementines St. Paul is expressly described by his adversaries as πλανος and as disseminating deceit (πλανην)" (Bernard). Such slander from one's enemies is praise.
