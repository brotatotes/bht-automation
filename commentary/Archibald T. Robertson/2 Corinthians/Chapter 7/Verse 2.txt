<p><b>We took advantage of no man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδενα επλεονεκτησαμεν</span></span>). That charge was made in Thessalonica (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:6">1 Thessalonians 4:6</span>) which see for this late verb and also on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:11">2 Corinthians 2:11</span>.
