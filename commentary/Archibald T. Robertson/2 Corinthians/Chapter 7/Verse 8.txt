<p><b> Though </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε κα</span></span>). If also. Paul treats it as a fact.</p>
<p><b>With my epistle </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη επιστολη</span></span>). The one referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:3">2 Corinthians 2:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>I do not regret it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μεταμελομα</span></span>). This verb really means "repent" (be sorry again) which meaning we have transferred to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοεω</span></span>, to change one's mind (not to be sorry at all). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:30">Matthew 21:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:3">Matthew 27:3</span> for the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταμελομα</span></span>, to be sorry, to regret as here. Paul is now glad that he made them sorry.</p>
<p><b>Though I did regret </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε κα μετεμελομην</span></span>). Imperfect indicative in the concessive clause. I was in a regretful mood at first.</p>
<p><b>For I see </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπω γαρ</span></span>). A parenthetical explanation of his present joy in their sorrow. B D do not have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>. The Latin Vulgate has <i>videns</i> (seeing) for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπων</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>For a season </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς ωραν</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:17">1 Thessalonians 2:17</span>. It was only "for an hour." </p>
