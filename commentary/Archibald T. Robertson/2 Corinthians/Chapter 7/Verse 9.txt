<p><b> Now I rejoice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν χαιρω</span></span>). Now that Titus has come and told him the good news from Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span>). This was the occasion of the noble outburst in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12-6">2 Corinthians 2:12-6</span>.</p>
<p><b>Unto repentance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις μετανοιαν</span></span>). Note the sharp difference here between "sorrow" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυπη</span></span>) which is merely another form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταμελομα</span></span> (regret, remorse) and "repentance" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοια</span></span>) or change of mind and life. It is a linguistic and theological tragedy that we have to go on using "repentance" for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοια</span></span>. But observe that the "sorrow" has led to "repentance" and was not Itself the repentance.</p>
<p><b>After a godly sort </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα θεον</span></span>). In God's way. "God's way as opposed to man's way and the devil's way" (Plummer). It was not mere sorrow, but a change in their attitude that counted.</p>
<p><b>That ye might suffer loss by us in nothing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα εν μηδεν ζημιωθητε εξ υμων</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζημιοω</span></span>, old verb to suffer damage. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:26">Matthew 16:26</span>. This was God's intention and so he overruled their sorrow to good. </p>
