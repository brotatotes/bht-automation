<p><b> We have sent with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεπεμψαμεν μετ' αυτου</span></span>). Epistolary aorist.</p>
<p><b>The brother </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αδελφον</span></span>). This may be, probably is, Luke who may also be the brother of Titus (see also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:18">2 Corinthians 12:18</span>) according to a common Greek idiom where the article is used as "his." But this idiom is not necessary. As a matter of fact, we do not know who this brother is.</p>
<p><b>Is spread through all the churches </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια πασων των εκκλησιων</span></span>). No verb in the Greek (ellipsis). </p>
