<p><b> But who was also appointed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα κα χειροτονηθεις</span></span>). Anacoluthon. The first aorist passive participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειροτονηθεις</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειροτονεω</span></span>, old verb to stretch out the hands (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρ τεινω</span></span>) and so to vote in public. The idea is that this brother was chosen by the churches, not by Paul. Only here in N.T. save <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span> where it means to appoint without notion of raising the hands. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:41">Acts 10:41</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προχειροτονεω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>To travel with us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεκδημος</span></span>). Late word for travelling companion. So in the inscriptions (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span>, together with, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκδημος</span></span>, away from home). </p>
