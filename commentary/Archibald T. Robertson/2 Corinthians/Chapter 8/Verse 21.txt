<p><b> We take thought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προνουμεν</span></span>). Old verb, to plan beforehand (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ-</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:17">Romans 12:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:8">1 Timothy 5:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>But also in the sight of men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα κα ενωπιον ανθρωπων</span></span>). It is not enough for one's financial accounts to be honourable (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλα</span></span>) as God sees them, but they should be so kept that men can understand them also. A timely warning. Paul took the utmost pains that no suspicion could be attached to him in this collection. </p>
