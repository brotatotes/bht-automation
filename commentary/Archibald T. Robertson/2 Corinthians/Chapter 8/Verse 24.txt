 The proof of your love  (την ενδειξιν της αγαπης υμων). There is a word here for pastors and deacons who try to protect the churches from the denominational representatives of kingdom causes.In the face of the churches  (εις προσωπον των εκκλησιων). A great host is pictured as watching how the Corinthians will treat these duly accredited agents in the collection (Titus and the other two brethren). It requires courage to stand by such representatives of great causes before stingy saints.
