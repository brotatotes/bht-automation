 Beseeching us with much intreaty in regard of this grace  (μετα πολλης παρακλησεως δεομενο ημων την χαριν). Literally, "with much intreaty begging of us the favour and the partnership in the ministry to the saints." The accusative (χαριν) after δεομα is unusual. By χαρις Paul means the privilege of giving (cf. Acts 24:27). Apparently Paul had been reluctant to press the Macedonians because of their manifest poverty. They demanded the right to have a share in it.
