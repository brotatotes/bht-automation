<p><b> Beseeching us with much intreaty in regard of this grace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα πολλης παρακλησεως δεομενο ημων την χαριν</span></span>). Literally, "with much intreaty begging of us the favour and the partnership in the ministry to the saints." The accusative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριν</span></span>) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεομα</span></span> is unusual. By <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις</span></span> Paul means the privilege of giving (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:27">Acts 24:27</span>). Apparently Paul had been reluctant to press the Macedonians because of their manifest poverty. They demanded the right to have a share in it. </p>
