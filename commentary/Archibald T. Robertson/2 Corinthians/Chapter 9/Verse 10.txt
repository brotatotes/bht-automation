 Supplieth  (επιχορηγων). Late Koine compound verb from επ and χορηγεω, just below (1 Peter 4:11). Χορηγος is old word for leader of a chorus (χοροσ, ηγεομα) or chorus-leader. The verb means to furnish a chorus at one's own expense, then to supply in general. N.T. examples of επιχορηγεω are 2 Corinthians 9:10; Galatians 3:15; Colossians 2:19; 2 Peter 1:5.Shall multiply  (πληθυνε). Future active indicative of πληθυνω, old verb from πληθυς, fulness. Cf. Acts 6:1.Fruits  (γενηματα). Correct reading (from γινομα, to become) and not γεννηματα (from γενναω, to beget). This spelling is supported by LXX where Thackeray shows that γενηματα in LXX refers to vegetables and γεννηματα to animals. The papyri support this distinction (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary).
