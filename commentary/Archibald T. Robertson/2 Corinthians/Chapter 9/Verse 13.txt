<p><b> Seeing that they glorify God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαζοντες τον θεον</span></span>). Anacoluthon again. The nominative participle used independently like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλουτιζομενο</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:11">2 Corinthians 9:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>Obedience </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποταγη</span></span>). Late and rare word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσω</span></span>, to subject, middle to obey. Only in Paul in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Of your confession </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της ομολογιας υμων</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογοσ, ομου, λεγω</span></span>), to say together. It is either to profess (Latin <i>profiteor</i>, to declare openly) or to confess (Latin <i>confiteor</i>, to declare fully, to say the same thing as another). Both confess and profess are used to translate the verb and each idea is present in the substantive. Only the context can decide. Actions speak louder than words. The brethren in Jerusalem will know by this collection that Gentiles make as good Christians as Jews.</p>
<p><b>For the liberality of your contribution </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απλοτητ της κοινωνιας</span></span>). This is the point that matters just now. Paul drives it home. On this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνια</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:4">2 Corinthians 8:4</span>. </p>
