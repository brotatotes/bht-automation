<p><b> Thanks be to God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις τω θεω</span></span>). Third time (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:11">2 Corinthians 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:12">2 Corinthians 9:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:15">2 Corinthians 9:15</span>).</p>
<p><b>For his unspeakable gift </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τη ανεκδιηγητω αυτου δωρεα</span></span>). One of Paul's gems flashed out after the somewhat tangled sentence (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:10-14">2 Corinthians 9:10-14</span>) like a gleam of light that clears the air. Words fail Paul to describe the gift of Christ to and for us. He may have coined this word as it is not found elsewhere except in ecclesiastical writers save as a variant (B L) for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδιηγητον</span></span> in Aristeas 99 (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαυμασμον ανεκδιηγητον</span></span>, "wonder beyond description," Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>). See similar word in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:33">Romans 11:33</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεξιχνιαστα</span></span>, unsearchable) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span>. </p>
