<p><b> I sent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεμψα</span></span>). Not literary plural with this epistolary aorist as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:18">2 Corinthians 9:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:22">2 Corinthians 9:22</span>.</p>
<p><b>That ye may be prepared </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα παρεσκευασμενο ητε</span></span>). Perfect passive subjunctive in the final clause, "that ye may really be prepared," "as I said" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως ελεγον</span></span>) and not just say that ye are prepared. Paul's very syntax tells against them. </p>
