 If there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared  (εαν ελθωσιν συν εμο Μακεδονες κα ευρωσιν υμας απαρασκευαστους). Condition of third class (undetermined, but stated as a lively possibility) with εαν and the second aorist active subjunctive (ελθωσιν, ευρωσιν), a bold and daring challenge. Απαρασκευαστος is a late and rare verbal adjective from παρασκευαζω with α privative, only here in the N.T.Lest by any means we should be put to shame  (μη πως καταισχυνθωμεν ημεις). Negative purpose with first aorist passive subjunctive of καταισχυνω (see on 2 Corinthians 7:14) in the literary plural.That we say not, ye  (ινα μη λεγωμεν υμεις). A delicate syntactical turn for what he really has in mind. He does wish that they become ashamed of not paying their pledges.Confidence  (υποστασε). This word, common from Aristotle on, comes from υφιστημ, to place under. It always has the notion of substratum or foundation as here; 2 Corinthians 11:17; Hebrews 1:3. The papyri give numerous examples (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary) of the word for "property" in various aspects. So in Hebrews 11:1 "faith is the title-deed of things hoped for." In the LXX it represents fifteen different Hebrew words.
