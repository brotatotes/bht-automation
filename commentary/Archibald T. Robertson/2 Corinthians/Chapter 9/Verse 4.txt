<p><b> If there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ελθωσιν συν εμο Μακεδονες κα ευρωσιν υμας απαρασκευαστους</span></span>). Condition of third class (undetermined, but stated as a lively possibility) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and the second aorist active subjunctive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελθωσιν, ευρωσιν</span></span>), a bold and daring challenge. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Απαρασκευαστος</span></span> is a late and rare verbal adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρασκευαζω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative, only here in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Lest by any means we should be put to shame </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πως καταισχυνθωμεν ημεις</span></span>). Negative purpose with first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταισχυνω</span></span> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:14">2 Corinthians 7:14</span>) in the literary plural.</p>
<p><b>That we say not, ye </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη λεγωμεν υμεις</span></span>). A delicate syntactical turn for what he really has in mind. He does wish that they become ashamed of not paying their pledges.</p>
<p><b>Confidence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποστασε</span></span>). This word, common from Aristotle on, comes from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υφιστημ</span></span>, to place under. It always has the notion of substratum or foundation as here; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:17">2 Corinthians 11:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>. The papyri give numerous examples (Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>) of the word for "property" in various aspects. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span> "faith is the title-deed of things hoped for." In the LXX it represents fifteen different Hebrew words. </p>
