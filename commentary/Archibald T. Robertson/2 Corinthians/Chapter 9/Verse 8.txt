<p><b> Is able </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνατε</span></span>). Late verb, not found except here; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:3">2 Corinthians 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:4">Romans 14:4</span>. So far a Pauline word made from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνατος</span></span>, able.</p>
<p><b>All sufficiency </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασαν αυταρκειαν</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυταρκης</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:11">Philippians 4:11</span>), common word, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:6">1 Timothy 6:6</span>). The use of this word shows Paul's acquaintance with Stoicism. Paul takes this word of Greek philosophy and applies it to the Christian view of life as independent of circumstances. But he does not accept the view of the Cynics in the avoidance of society. Note threefold use of "all" here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν παντι, παντοτε, πασαν</span></span>, in everything, always, all sufficiency). </p>
