<p><b> And her children </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τοις τεκνοις αυτης</span></span>). As with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεκτη κυρια</span></span>, so here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνα</span></span> may be understood either literally as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:4">1 Timothy 3:4</span>, or spiritually, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:19">Galatians 4:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:25">Galatians 4:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2">1 Timothy 1:2</span>. For the spiritual sense in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνια</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:12">1 John 2:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>Whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ους</span></span>). Masculine accusative plural, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνοις</span></span> is neuter plural (dative), construction according to sense, not according to grammatical gender, "embracing the mother and the children of both sexes" (Vincent). See thus <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ους</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:19">Galatians 4:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>I </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω</span></span>). Though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πρεσβυτερος</span></span> is third person, he passes at once after the Greek idiom to the first and there is also special emphasis here in the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπω</span></span> with the addition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αληθεια</span></span> (in truth, in the highest sphere, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19">John 17:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:1">3 John 1:1</span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εγω μονος</span></span> (not I only, "not I alone"). Brooke argues that this language is unsuitable if to a single family and not to a church. But Paul employs this very phrase in sending greetings to Prisca and Aquila (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:4">Romans 16:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>That know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εγνωκοτες</span></span>). Perfect active articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, "those that have come to know and still know." </p>
