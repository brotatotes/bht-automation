 And her children  (κα τοις τεκνοις αυτης). As with εκλεκτη κυρια, so here τεκνα may be understood either literally as in 1 Timothy 3:4, or spiritually, as in Galatians 4:19; Galatians 4:25; 1 Timothy 1:2. For the spiritual sense in τεκνια see 1 John 2:1; 1 John 2:12.Whom  (ους). Masculine accusative plural, though τεκνοις is neuter plural (dative), construction according to sense, not according to grammatical gender, "embracing the mother and the children of both sexes" (Vincent). See thus ους in Galatians 4:19.I  (Εγω). Though ο πρεσβυτερος is third person, he passes at once after the Greek idiom to the first and there is also special emphasis here in the use of αγαπω with the addition of εν αληθεια (in truth, in the highest sphere, as in John 17:19; 3 John 1:1) and ουκ εγω μονος (not I only, "not I alone"). Brooke argues that this language is unsuitable if to a single family and not to a church. But Paul employs this very phrase in sending greetings to Prisca and Aquila (Romans 16:4).That know  (ο εγνωκοτες). Perfect active articular participle of γινωσκω, "those that have come to know and still know."
