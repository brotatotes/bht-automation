<p><b> If any one cometh and bringeth not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τις ερχετα κα ου φερε</span></span>). Condition of first class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and two present indicatives (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχεται, φερε</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>This teaching </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτην την διδαχην</span></span>). This teaching of Christ of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:9">2 John 1:9</span>, which is the standard by which to test Gnostic deceivers (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:7">2 John 1:7</span>). John does not refer to entertaining strangers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:2">Hebrews 13:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:10">1 Timothy 5:10</span>), but to the deceiving propagandists who were carrying dissension and danger with them.</p>
<p><b>Receive him not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη λαμβανετε αυτον</span></span>). Present active imperative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span> in this sense see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:12">John 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:21">John 6:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:20">John 13:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>Into your house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις οικιαν</span></span>). Definite without the article like our at home, to town.</p>
<p><b>Give him no greeting </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρειν αυτω μη λεγετε</span></span>). "Say not farewell to him." Apparently <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρειν</span></span> here (present active infinitive, object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγετε</span></span> present active imperative with negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>) is used of farewell as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11">2 Corinthians 13:11</span>, though usually in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:23">Acts 15:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:26">Acts 23:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>) of the salutation. But here the point turns on the stranger bringing into the house (or trying to do so) his heretical and harmful teaching which seems to be after the salutation is over. The usual greeting to a house is given in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:5">Luke 10:5</span>. On the other hand, if <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρειν</span></span> means greeting, not farewell, here, it can very well be understood of the peril of allowing these Gnostic propagandists to spread their pernicious teachings (cf. Mormons or Bolshevists) in home and church (usually meeting in the home). This is assuming that the men were known and not mere strangers. </p>
