 If any one cometh and bringeth not  (ε τις ερχετα κα ου φερε). Condition of first class with ε and two present indicatives (ερχεται, φερε).This teaching  (ταυτην την διδαχην). This teaching of Christ of verse 2 John 1:9, which is the standard by which to test Gnostic deceivers (verse 2 John 1:7). John does not refer to entertaining strangers (Hebrews 13:2; 1 Timothy 5:10), but to the deceiving propagandists who were carrying dissension and danger with them.Receive him not  (μη λαμβανετε αυτον). Present active imperative with μη. For λαμβανω in this sense see John 1:12; John 6:21; John 13:20.Into your house  (εις οικιαν). Definite without the article like our at home, to town.Give him no greeting  (χαιρειν αυτω μη λεγετε). "Say not farewell to him." Apparently χαιρειν here (present active infinitive, object of λεγετε present active imperative with negative μη) is used of farewell as in 2 Corinthians 13:11, though usually in the N.T. (Acts 15:23; Acts 23:26; James 1:1) of the salutation. But here the point turns on the stranger bringing into the house (or trying to do so) his heretical and harmful teaching which seems to be after the salutation is over. The usual greeting to a house is given in Luke 10:5. On the other hand, if χαιρειν means greeting, not farewell, here, it can very well be understood of the peril of allowing these Gnostic propagandists to spread their pernicious teachings (cf. Mormons or Bolshevists) in home and church (usually meeting in the home). This is assuming that the men were known and not mere strangers.
