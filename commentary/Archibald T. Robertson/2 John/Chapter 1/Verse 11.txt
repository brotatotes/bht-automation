<p><b> Partaketh in his evil works </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνε τοις εργοις αυτου τοις πονηροις</span></span>). Associative instrumental case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνε</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:22">1 Timothy 5:22</span>, common verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνος</span></span> (partner). It is to be borne in mind that the churches often met in private homes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:15">Colossians 4:15</span>), and if these travelling deceivers were allowed to spread their doctrines in these homes and then sent on with endorsement as Apollos was from Ephesus to Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:27">Acts 18:27</span>), there was no way of escaping responsibility for the harm wrought by these propagandists of evil. It is not a case of mere hospitality to strangers. </p>
