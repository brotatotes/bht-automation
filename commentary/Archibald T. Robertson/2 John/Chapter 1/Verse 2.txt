<p><b> For the truth's sake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια την αληθειαν</span></span>). Repetition of the word, one of which John is very fond (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:6">1 John 1:6</span>, "the truth, as revealed by the Christ, and gradually unfolded by the Spirit, who is truth" (Brooke).</p>
<p><b>Which abideth in us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την μενουσαν εν ημιν</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19">John 17:19</span> for "sanctified in truth" and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:6">1 John 2:6</span> for abiding in Christ, and so it includes all who are in Christ.</p>
<p><b>It shall be with us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθ' ημων εστα</span></span>). Confident assertion, not a mere wish. Note the order of the words, "With us it shall be" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστα</span></span> future middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span>). </p>
