<p><b> Shall be with us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστα μεθ' ημων</span></span>). He picks up the words before in reverse order. Future indicative here, not a wish with the optative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειε</span></span>) as we have in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:2">2 Peter 1:2</span>. The salutation is like that in the Pastoral Epistles: "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χαρις</span></span>, the wellspring in the heart of God; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεος</span></span>, its outpourings; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρηνη</span></span>, its blessed effect" (David Smith).</p>
<p><b>And from Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα παρα Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). The repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> (with the ablative) is unique. "It serves to bring out distinctly the twofold personal relation of man to the Father and to the Son" (Westcott). "The Fatherhood of God, as revealed by one who being His Son <i>can</i> reveal the Father, and who as man (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησου</span></span>) can make him known to men" (Brooke). </p>
