 Deceivers  (πλανο). Late adjective (Diodorus, Josephus) meaning wandering, roving (1 Timothy 4:1). As a substantive in N.T. of Jesus (Matthew 27:63), of Paul (2 Corinthians 6:8), and here. See the verb (των πλανοντων υμας) in 1 John 2:26 of the Gnostic deceivers as here and also of Jesus (John 7:12). Cf. 1 John 1:8.Are gone forth  (εξηλθαν, alpha ending). Second aorist active indicative of εξερχομα, perhaps an allusion to the crisis when they left the churches (1 John 2:19, same form).Even they that confess not  (ο μη ομολογουντες). "The ones not confessing" (μη regular negative with the participle). The articular participle describes the deceivers (πλανο).That Jesus Christ cometh in the flesh  (Ιησουν Χριστον ερχομενον εν σαρκ). "Jesus Christ coming in the flesh." Present middle participle of ερχομα treating the Incarnation as a continuing fact which the Docetic Gnostics flatly denied. In 1 John 4:2 we have εληλυθοτα (perfect active participle) in this same construction with ομολογεω, because there the reference is to the definite historical fact of the Incarnation. There is no allusion here to the second coming of Christ.This  (ουτος). See 1 John 2:18; 1 John 2:22; 1 John 5:6; 1 John 5:20.The deceiver and the antichrist  (ο πλανος κα ο αντιχριστος). Article with each word, as in Revelation 1:17, to bring out sharply each separate phrase, though one individual is referred to. The one par excellence in popular expectation (1 John 2:22), though many in reality (1 John 2:18; 3 John 1:7).
