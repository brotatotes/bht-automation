<p><b> Look to yourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπετε εαυτους</span></span>). Imperative active with reflexive pronoun as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:9">Mark 13:9</span>. The verb often used absolutely (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:2">Philippians 3:2</span>) like our "look out."</p>
<p><b>That ye lose not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη απολεσητε</span></span>). Negative purpose with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη</span></span> and first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολλυμ</span></span>. This is the correct text (B), not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολεσωμεν</span></span> (we). Likewise <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολαβητε</span></span> (that ye receive), not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολαβωμεν</span></span> (we).</p>
<p><b>Which we have wrought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α ηργασαμεθα</span></span>). This is also correct, first aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργαζομα</span></span>, to work (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:27">John 6:27</span>). John does not wish his labour to be lost. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:27">Romans 1:27</span> for this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολαμβανω</span></span> for receiving. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:36">John 4:36</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθος</span></span> in the harvest. The "full reward" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθον πληρη</span></span>) is the full day's wages which each worker will get (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:8">1 Corinthians 3:8</span>). John is anxious that they shall hold on with him to the finish. </p>
