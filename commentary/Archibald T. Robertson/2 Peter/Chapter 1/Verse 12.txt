<p><b> Wherefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διο</span></span>). Since they are possessed of faith that conduces to godliness which they are diligently practising now he insists on the truth and proposes to do his part by them about it.</p>
<p><b>I shall be ready always </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλησω αε</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:6">Matthew 24:6</span>), old verb, to be on the point of doing and used with the infinitive (present, aorist, or future).

<p><b>Though ye know them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιπερ ειδοτας</span></span>). Second perfect active concessive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span>, agreeing (acc. plural), with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμας</span></span>. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:8">Hebrews 5:8</span>.</p>

The very verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηρισον</span></span>) used by Jesus to Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:32">Luke 22:32</span>).</p>
<p><b>In the truth which is with you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη παρουση αληθεια</span></span>).
