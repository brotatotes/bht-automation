Peter may also have had an intimation by vision of his approaching death (cf. the legend Domine quo vadis) as Paul often did (Acts 16:9; Acts 18:9; Acts 21:11; Acts 23:11; Acts 27:23).At every time  (εκαστοτε). As need arises, old adverb, here alone in N.T.After my decease  (μετα την εμην εξοδον). For εξοδος meaning death see Luke 9:31, and for departure from Egypt (way out, εξ, οδος) see Hebrews 11:22, the only other N.T. examples. Here again Peter was present on the Transfiguration mount when the talk was about the "exodus" of Jesus from earth.That ye may be able  (εχειν υμας). Literally, "that ye may have it," the same idiom with εχω and the infinitive in Mark 14:8; Matthew 18:25. It is the object-infinitive after σπουδασω (I will give diligence, for which see verse 2 Peter 1:10).To call these things to remembrance  (την τουτων μνημην ποιεισθα). Present middle infinitive of ποιεω (as in verse 2 Peter 1:10). Μνημη is an old word (from μναομα), here alone in N.T. This idiom, like the Latin mentionem facere, is common in the old writers (papyri also both for "mention" and "remembrance"), here only in N.T., but in Romans 1:20 we have μνειαν ποιουμα (I make mention). Either sense suits here. It is possible, as Irenaeus (iii. I. I) thought, that Peter had in mind Mark's Gospel, which would help them after Peter was gone. Mark's Gospel was probably already written at Peter's suggestion, but Peter may have that fact in mind here.
