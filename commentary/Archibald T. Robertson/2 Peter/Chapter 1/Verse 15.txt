<p>Peter may also have had an intimation by vision of his approaching death (cf. the legend <i>Domine quo vadis</i>) as Paul often did (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:9">Acts 16:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:9">Acts 18:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:11">Acts 21:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:11">Acts 23:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:23">Acts 27:23</span>).</p>
<p><b>At every time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαστοτε</span></span>). As need arises, old adverb, here alone in N.T.</p>
<p><b>After my decease </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα την εμην εξοδον</span></span>). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξοδος</span></span> meaning death see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:31">Luke 9:31</span>, and for departure from Egypt (way out, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ, οδος</span></span>) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:22">Hebrews 11:22</span>, the only other N.T. examples. Here again Peter was present on the Transfiguration mount when the talk was about the "exodus" of Jesus from earth.</p>
<p><b>That ye may be able </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχειν υμας</span></span>). Literally, "that ye may have it," the same idiom with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span> and the infinitive in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:8">Mark 14:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:25">Matthew 18:25</span>. It is the object-infinitive after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπουδασω</span></span> (I will give diligence, for which see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:10">2 Peter 1:10</span>).</p>
<p><b>To call these things to remembrance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την τουτων μνημην ποιεισθα</span></span>). Present middle infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span> (as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:10">2 Peter 1:10</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μνημη</span></span> is an old word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μναομα</span></span>), here alone in N.T. This idiom, like the Latin <i>mentionem facere</i>, is common in the old writers (papyri also both for "mention" and "remembrance"), here only in N.T., but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνειαν ποιουμα</span></span> (I make mention). Either sense suits here. It is possible, as Irenaeus (iii. I. I) thought, that Peter had in mind Mark's Gospel, which would help them after Peter was gone. Mark's Gospel was probably already written at Peter's suggestion, but Peter may have that fact in mind here. </p>
