 For he received  (λαβων γαρ). Second aorist active participle nominative singular of λαμβανω, "he having received," but there is no finite verb, anacoluthon, changing in verse 2 Peter 1:19 (after parenthesis in 2 Peter 1:18) to εχομεν βεβαιοτερον rather than εβεβαιωσεν.When there came such a voice to him  (φωνης ενεχθεισης αυτω τοιασδε). Genitive absolute with first aorist passive participle feminine singular of φερω (cf. 1 Peter 1:13), repeated ενεχθεισαν in verse 2 Peter 1:18. Φωνη (voice) is used also of Pentecost (Acts 2:6). Τοιοσδε (classical demonstrative) occurs here alone in the N.T.From the excellent glory  (υπο της μεγαλοπρεπους δοξης). "By the majestic glory." Μεγαλοπρεπης, old compound (μεγας, great, πρεπε, it is becoming), here only in N.T., several times in O.T., Apocr. (II Macc. 8:15), adverb in the inscriptions. Probably a reference to νεφελη φωτεινη (bright cloud, shekinah) in Matthew 17:5. The words given here from the "voice" agree exactly with Matthew 17:5 except the order and the use of εις ον rather than εν ω. Mark (Mark 9:7) and Luke (Luke 9:35) have ακουετε. But Peter did not need any Gospel for his report here.
