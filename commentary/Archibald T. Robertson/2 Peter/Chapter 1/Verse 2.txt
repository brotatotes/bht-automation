<p><b> Be multiplied </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληθυνθειη</span></span>). First aorist passive optative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληθυνω</span></span> in a wish for the future (volitive use) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:2">Judges 1:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>In the knowledge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν επιγνωσε</span></span>). Full (additional, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>) knowledge as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:8">2 Peter 1:8</span> (only <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωσις</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5">2 Peter 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:6">2 Peter 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:18">2 Peter 3:18</span>), but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγνωσιν</span></span> again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:3">2 Peter 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:8">2 Peter 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:20">2 Peter 2:20</span>. As in Colossians, so here full knowledge is urged against the claims of the Gnostic heretics to special <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωσις</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Of God and of Jesus our Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θεου κα Ιησου του κυριου ημων</span></span>). At first sight the idiom here seems to require one person as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1">2 Peter 1:1</span>, though there is a second article (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του</span></span>) before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριου</span></span>, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησου</span></span> is a proper name. But the text here is very uncertain. Bengel, Spitta, Zahn, Nestle accept the short reading of P and some Vulgate MSS. and some minuscles with only <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του κυριου ημων</span></span> (our Lord) from which the three other readings may have come. Elsewhere in II Peter <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωσις</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγνωσις</span></span> are used of Christ alone. The text of II Peter is not in a good state of preservation. </p>
