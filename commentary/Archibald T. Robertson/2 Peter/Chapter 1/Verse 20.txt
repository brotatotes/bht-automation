 Knowing this first  (τουτο πρωτον γινωσκοντες). Agreeing with ποιειτε like προσεχοντες in verse 2 Peter 1:19.No prophecy of Scripture  (πασα προφητεια ου). Like the Hebrew lo-kol, but also in the papyri as in 1 John 2:21 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 753).Is  (γινετα). Rather "comes," "springs" (Alford), not "is" (εστιν).Of private interpretation  (ιδιας επιλυσεως). Ablative case of origin or source in the predicate as with γνωμης in Acts 20:3 and with του θεου and εξ ημων in 2 Corinthians 4:7. "No prophecy of Scripture comes out of private disclosure," not "of private interpretation." The usual meaning of επιλυσις is explanation, but the word does not occur elsewhere in the N.T. It occurs in the papyri in the sense of solution and even of discharge of a debt. Spitta urges "dissolved" as the idea here. The verb επιλυω, to unloose, to untie, to release, occurs twice in the N.T., once (Mark 4:34) where it can mean "disclose" about parables, the other (Acts 19:39) where it means to decide. It is the prophet's grasp of the prophecy, not that of the readers that is here presented, as the next verse shows.
