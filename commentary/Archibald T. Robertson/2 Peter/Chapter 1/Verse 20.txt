<p><b> Knowing this first </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο πρωτον γινωσκοντες</span></span>). Agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιειτε</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεχοντες</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:19">2 Peter 1:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>No prophecy of Scripture </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασα προφητεια ου</span></span>). Like the Hebrew <i>lo-kol</i>, but also in the papyri as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:21">1 John 2:21</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 753).</p>
<p><b>Is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινετα</span></span>). Rather "comes," "springs" (Alford), not "is" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Of private interpretation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιας επιλυσεως</span></span>). Ablative case of origin or source in the predicate as with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωμης</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:3">Acts 20:3</span> and with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θεου</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ ημων</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:7">2 Corinthians 4:7</span>. "No prophecy of Scripture comes out of private disclosure," not "of private interpretation." The usual meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιλυσις</span></span> is explanation, but the word does not occur elsewhere in the N.T. It occurs in the papyri in the sense of solution and even of discharge of a debt. Spitta urges "dissolved" as the idea here. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιλυω</span></span>, to unloose, to untie, to release, occurs twice in the N.T., once (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:34">Mark 4:34</span>) where it can mean "disclose" about parables, the other (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:39">Acts 19:39</span>) where it means to decide. It is the prophet's grasp of the prophecy, not that of the readers that is here presented, as the next verse shows. </p>
