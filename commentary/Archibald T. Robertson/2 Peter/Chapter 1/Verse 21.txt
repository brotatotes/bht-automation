<p><b> For </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>). The reason for the previous statement that no prophet starts a prophecy himself. He is not a self-starter.</p>
<p><b>Came </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηνεχθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερω</span></span> (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:17">2 Peter 1:17</span>).</p>
<p><b>By the will of man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεληματ ανθρωπου</span></span>). Instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελημα</span></span>. Prophecy is of divine origin, not of one's private origination (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιας επιλυσεως</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Moved by the Holy Ghost </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο πνευματος αγιου φερομενο</span></span>). Present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερω</span></span>, moved from time to time. There they "spoke from God." Peter is not here warning against personal interpretation of prophecy as the Roman Catholics say, but against the folly of upstart prophets with no impulse from God. </p>
