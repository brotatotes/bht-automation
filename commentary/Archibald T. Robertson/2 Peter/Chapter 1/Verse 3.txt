<p><b> Seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ημιν της θειας δυναμεως αυτου δεδωρημενης</span></span>). Genitive absolute with the causal particle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> and the perfect middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωρεω</span></span>, old verb, to bestow (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωρεα</span></span>, gift), usually middle as here, in N.T. elsewhere only <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:45">Mark 15:45</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αυτου</span></span> refers to Christ, who has "divine power" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της θειας δυναμεως</span></span>), since he is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1">2 Peter 1:1</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θειος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span>) is an old adjective in N.T. here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span> only, except <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:29">Acts 17:29</span>, where Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το θειον</span></span> for deity, thus adapting his language to his audience as the papyri and inscriptions show. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θειος</span></span> with an imperial connotation is very common in the papyri and the inscriptions. Deissmann (<i>Bible Studies</i>, pp. 360-368) has shown the singular linguistic likeness between <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:3-11">2 Peter 1:3-11</span> and a remarkable inscription of the inhabitants of Stratonicea in Caria to Zeus Panhemerios and Hecate dated A.D. 22 (in full in C I H ii No. 2715 a b). One of the likenesses is the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της θειας δυναμεως</span></span>. Peter may have read this inscription (cf. Paul in Athens) or he may have used "the familiar forms and formulae of religious emotion" (Deissmann), "the official liturgical language of Asia Minor." Peter is fond of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις</span></span> in this Epistle, and the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις</span></span> of Christ "is the sword which St. Peter holds over the head of the False Teachers" (Bigg).</p>
<p><b>All things that pertain unto life and godliness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα τα προς ζωην κα ευσεβειαν</span></span>). "All the things for life and godliness." The new life in Christ who is the mystery of godliness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ευσεβεια</span></span> with its cognates (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευσεβησ, ευσεβωσ, ευσεβεω</span></span>) occurs only in this Epistle, Acts, and the Pastoral Epistles (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ</span></span>, well, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεβομα</span></span>, to worship).</p>
<p><b>Of him that called us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του καλεσαντος</span></span>). Genitive of the articular first aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλεω</span></span>. Christ called Peter and all other Christians.</p>
<p><b>By his own glory and virtue </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια δοξης κα αρετης</span></span>). So B K L, but Aleph A C P read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδια δοξη κα αρετη</span></span> (either instrumental case "by" or dative "to"). Peter is fond of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιος</span></span> (own, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:1">1 Peter 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:5">1 Peter 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:16">2 Peter 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:22">2 Peter 2:22</span>, etc.). "Glory" here is the manifestation of the Divine Character in Christ. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρετη</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:8">Philippians 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5">2 Peter 1:5</span>. </p>
