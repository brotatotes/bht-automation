 For if these things are yours and abound  (ταυτα γαρ υμιν υπαρχοντα κα πλεοναζοντα). Present active circumstantial (conditional) participles neuter plural of υπαρχω and πλεοναζω (see 1 Thessalonians 3:12) with dative case υμιν, "these things existing for you (or in you) and abounding."They make you to be  (καθιστησιν). "Render" (present active indicative of καθιστημ, old verb, James 3:6), singular because ταυτα neuter plural.Not idle nor unfruitful  (ουκ αργους ουδε ακαρπους). Accusative predicative plural with υμας understood, both adjectives with alpha privative, for αργος see James 2:20 and for ακαρπος Matthew 13:22.Knowledge  (επιγνωσιν). "Full (additional) knowledge" as in 2 Peter 1:2.
