 He that lacketh these things  (ω μη παρεστιν ταυτα). "To whom (dative case of possession) these things are not (μη because a general or indefinite relative clause)."Seeing only what is near  (μυωπαζων). Present active participle of μυωπαζω, a rare verb from μυωπς (in Aristotle for a near-sighted man) and that from μυεω τους ωπας (to close the eyes in order to see, not to keep from seeing). The only other instance of μυωπαζω is given by Suicer from Ps. Dion. Eccl. Hier. ii. 3 (μυωπασουση κα αποστρεφομενη) used of a soul on which the light shines (blinking and turning away). Thus understood the word here limits τυφλος as a short-sighted man screwing up his eyes because of the light.Having forgotten  (ληθην λαβων). "Having received forgetfulness." Second aorist active participle of λαμβανω and accusative ληθην, old word, from ληθομα, to forget, here only in N.T. See 2 Timothy 1:5 for a like phrase υπομνησιν λαβων (having received remembrance).The cleansing  (του καθαρισμου). See Hebrews 1:3 for this word for the expiatory sacrifice of Christ for our sins as in 1 Peter 1:18; 1 Peter 2:24; 1 Peter 3:18. In 1 Peter 3:21 Peter denied actual cleansing of sin by baptism (only symbolic). If there is a reference to baptism here, which is doubtful, it can only be in a symbolic sense.Old  (παλα). Of the language as in Hebrews 1:1.
