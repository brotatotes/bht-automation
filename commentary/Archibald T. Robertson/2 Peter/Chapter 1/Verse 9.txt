<p><b>Seeing only what is near </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυωπαζων</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυωπαζω</span></span>, a rare verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυωπς</span></span> (in Aristotle for a near-sighted man) and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυεω τους ωπας</span></span> (to close the eyes in order to see, not to keep from seeing). The only other instance of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυωπαζω</span></span> is given by Suicer from Ps. Dion. Eccl. Hier. ii. 3 (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυωπασουση κα αποστρεφομενη</span></span>) used of a soul on which the light shines (blinking and turning away).
