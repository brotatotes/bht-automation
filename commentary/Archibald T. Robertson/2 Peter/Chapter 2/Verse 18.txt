 Great swelling words  (υπερογκα). Old compound adjective (υπερ and ογκος, a swelling, swelling above and beyond), in N.T. only here and Jude 1:16.Of vanity  (ματαιοτητος). Late and rare word (from ματαιος, empty, vain), often in LXX, in N.T. here, Romans 8:20; Ephesians 4:17.By lasciviousness  (ασελγειαις). Instrumental plural, "by lascivious acts." Note asyndeton as in 2 Peter 1:9; 2 Peter 1:17.Those who are just escaping  (τους ολιγως αποφευγοντας). So A B read ολιγως (slightly, a little), while Aleph C K L P read οντως (actually). Ολιγως late and rare, only here in N.T. So again the Textus Receptus has αποφυγοντας (second aorist active participle, clean escaped) while the correct text is the present active αποφευγοντας.From them that live in error  (τους εν πλανη αναστρεφομενους). Accusative case after αποφευγοντας (escaping from) according to regular idiom. Peter often uses αναστρεφω and αναστροφη.
