 Lascivious doings  (ασελγειαις). Associative instrumental ease after εξακολουθησουσιν (future active, for which verb see 2 Peter 1:16). See 1 Peter 4:3 for this word.By reason of whom  (δι' ους). "Because of whom" (accusative case of relative, referring to πολλο, many). Αυτων (their) refers to ψευδοδιδασκαλο (false teachers) while πολλο to their deluded followers. See Romans 2:23 for a picture of such conduct by Jews (quotation from Isaiah 52:5, with βλασφημεω used as here with δι' υμας, because of you).The way of truth  (η οδος της αληθειας). Hοδος (way) occurs often in N.T. for Christianity (Acts 9:2; Acts 16:17; Acts 18:25; Acts 22:4; Acts 24:14). This phrase is in Genesis 24:48 as "the right road," and that is what Peter means here. So Psalms 119:30. See again 2 Peter 2:15; 2 Peter 2:21.
