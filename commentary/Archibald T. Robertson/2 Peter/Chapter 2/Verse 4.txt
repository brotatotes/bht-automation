 For if God spared not  (ε γαρ ο θεος ουκ εφεισατο). First instance (γαρ) of certain doom, that of the fallen angels. Condition of the first class precisely like that in Romans 11:21 save that here the normal apodosis (υμων ου φεισετα) is not expressed as there, but is simply implied in verse 2 Peter 2:9 by οιδεν κυριος ρυεσθα (the Lord knows how to deliver) after the parenthesis in verse 2 Peter 2:8.Angels when they sinned  (αγγελων αμαρτησαντων). Genitive case after εφεισατο (first aorist middle indicative of φειδομα) and anarthrous (so more emphatic, even angels), first aorist active participle of αμαρτανω, "having sinned."Cast them down to hell  (ταρταρωσας). First aorist active participle of ταρταροω, late word (from ταρταρος, old word in Homer, Pindar, LXX Job 40:15; Job 41:23, Philo, inscriptions, the dark and doleful abode of the wicked dead like the Gehenna of the Jews), found here alone save in a scholion on Homer. Ταρταρος occurs in Enoch 20:2 as the place of punishment of the fallen angels, while Gehenna is for apostate Jews.Committed  (παρεδωκεν). First aorist active indicative of παραδιδωμ, the very form solemnly used by Paul in Romans 1:21; Romans 1:26; Romans 1:28.To pits of darkness  (σειροις ζοφου). Ζοφος (kin to γνοφοσ, νεφος) is an old word, blackness, gloom of the nether world in Homer, in N.T. only here, verse 2 Peter 2:17; Judges 1:13; Hebrews 12:18. The MSS. vary between σειραις (σειρα, chain or rope) and σειροις (σειρος, old word for pit, underground granary). Σειροις is right (Aleph A B C), dative case of destination.To be reserved unto judgment  (εις κρισιν τηρουμενους). Present (linear action) passive participle of τηρεω. "Kept for judgment." Cf. 1 Peter 1:4. Aleph A have κολαζομενους τηρειν as in verse 2 Peter 2:9. Note κρισις (act of judgment).
