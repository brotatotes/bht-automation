 The ancient world  (αρχαιου κοσμου). Genitive case after εφεισατο (with ε understood) repeated (the second example, the deluge). This example not in Jude. Absence of the article is common in the prophetic style like II Peter. For αρχαιος see Luke 9:8.Preserved  (εφυλαξεν). Still part of the long protasis with ε, first aorist active indicative of φυλασσω.With seven others  (ογδοον). "Eighth," predicate accusative adjective (ordinal), classic idiom usually with αυτον. See 1 Peter 3:20 for this same item. Some take ογδοον with κηρυκα (eighth preacher), hardly correct.A preacher of righteousness  (δικαιοσυνης κηρυκα). "Herald" as in 1 Timothy 2:7; 2 Timothy 1:11 alone in N.T., but κηρυσσω is common. It is implied in 1 Peter 3:20 that Noah preached to the men of his time during the long years.When he brought  (επαξας). First aorist active participle (instead of the common second aorist active επαγαγων) of εισαγω, old compound verb to bring upon, in N.T. only here and Acts 5:28 (by Peter here also).A flood  (κατακλυσμον). Old word (from κατακλυζω, to inundate), only of Noah's flood in N.T. (Matthew 24:38; Luke 17:27; 2 Peter 2:5).Upon the world of the ungodly  (κοσμο ασεβων). Anarthrous and dative case κοσμω. The whole world were "ungodly" (ασεβεις as in 1 Peter 4:18) save Noah's family of eight.
