 Beloved  (αγαπητο). With this vocative verbal (four times in this chapter), Peter "turns away from the Libertines and their victims" (Mayor).This is now the second epistle that I write unto you  (ταυτην ηδη δευτεραν υμιν γραφω επιστολην). Literally, "This already a second epistle I am writing to you." For ηδη see John 21:24. It is the predicate use of δευτεραν επιστολην in apposition with ταυτην, not "this second epistle." Reference apparently to I Peter.And in both of them  (εν αις). "In which epistles."I stir up  (διεγειρω). Present active indicative, perhaps conative, "I try to stir up." See 2 Peter 1:13.Mind  (διανοιαν). Understanding (Plato) as in 1 Peter 1:13.Sincere  (ειλικρινη). Old adjective of doubtful etymology (supposed to be ειλη, sunlight, and κρινω, to judge by it). Plato used it of ethical purity (ψυχη ειλικρινης) as here and Philippians 1:10, the only N.T. examples.By putting you in remembrance  (εν υπομνησε). As in 2 Peter 1:13.
