<p><b> Beloved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπητο</span></span>). With this vocative verbal (four times in this chapter), Peter "turns away from the Libertines and their victims" (Mayor).</p>
<p><b>This is now the second epistle that I write unto you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτην ηδη δευτεραν υμιν γραφω επιστολην</span></span>). Literally, "This already a second epistle I am writing to you." For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:24">John 21:24</span>. It is the predicate use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευτεραν επιστολην</span></span> in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτην</span></span>, not "this second epistle." Reference apparently to I Peter.</p>
<p><b>And in both of them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αις</span></span>). "In which epistles."</p>
<p><b>I stir up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεγειρω</span></span>). Present active indicative, perhaps conative, "I try to stir up." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:13">2 Peter 1:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>Mind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διανοιαν</span></span>). Understanding (Plato) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:13">1 Peter 1:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>Sincere </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειλικρινη</span></span>). Old adjective of doubtful etymology (supposed to be <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειλη</span></span>, sunlight, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>, to judge by it). Plato used it of ethical purity (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη ειλικρινης</span></span>) as here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:10">Philippians 1:10</span>, the only N.T. examples.</p>
<p><b>By putting you in remembrance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υπομνησε</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:13">2 Peter 1:13</span>. </p>
