 The day of the Lord  (ημερα κυριου). So Peter in Acts 2:20 (from Joel 3:4) and Paul in 1 Thessalonians 5:2; 1 Thessalonians 5:4; 2 Thessalonians 2:2; 1 Corinthians 5:5; and day of Christ in Philippians 2:16 and day of God in 2 Peter 2:12 and day of judgment already in 2 Peter 2:9; 2 Peter 3:7. This great day will certainly come (ηξε). Future active of ηκω, old verb, to arrive, but in God's own time.As a thief  (ως κλεπτης). That is suddenly, without notice. This very metaphor Jesus had used (Luke 12:39; Matthew 24:43) and Paul after him (1 Thessalonians 5:2) and John will quote it also (Revelation 3:3; Revelation 16:15).In the which  (εν η). The day when the Lord comes.Shall pass away  (παρελευσοντα). Future middle of παρερχομα, old verb, to pass by.With a great noise  (ροιζηδον). Late and rare adverb (from ροιζεω, ροιζος)-- Lycophron, Nicander, here only in N.T., onomatopoetic, whizzing sound of rapid motion through the air like the flight of a bird, thunder, fierce flame.The elements  (τα στοιχεια). Old word (from στοιχος a row), in Plato in this sense, in other senses also in N.T. as the alphabet, ceremonial regulations (Hebrews 5:12; Galatians 4:3; Galatians 5:1; Colossians 2:8).Shall be dissolved  (λυθησετα). Future passive of λυω, to loosen, singular because στοιχεια is neuter plural.With fervent heat  (καυσουμενα). Present passive participle of καυσοω, late verb (from καυσος, usually medical term for fever) and nearly always employed for fever temperature. Mayor suggests a conflagration from internal heat. Bigg thinks it merely a vernacular (Doric) future for καυσομενα (from καιω, to burn).Shall be burned up  (κατακαησετα). Repeated in verse 2 Peter 3:12. Second future passive of the compound verb κατακαιω, to burn down (up), according to A L. But Aleph B K P read ευρεθησετα (future passive of ευρισκω, to find) "shall be found." There are various other readings here. The text seems corrupt.
