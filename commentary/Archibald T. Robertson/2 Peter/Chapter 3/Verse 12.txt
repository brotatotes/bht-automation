 Looking for  (προσδοκωντας). Present active participle of προσδοκαω (Matthew 11:3) agreeing in case (accusative plural) with υμας.Earnestly desiring  (σπευδοντας). Present active participle, accusative also, of σπευδω, old verb, to hasten (like our speed) as in Luke 2:16, but it is sometimes transitive as here either (preferably so) to "hasten on the parousia" by holy living (cf. 1 Peter 2:12), with which idea compare Matthew 6:10; Acts 3:19, or to desire earnestly (Isaiah 16:5).Being on fire  (πυρουμενο). Present passive participle of πυροω, old verb (from pur), same idea as in verse 2 Peter 3:10.Shall melt  (τηκετα). Futuristic present passive indicative of τηκω, old verb, to make liquid, here only in N.T. Hort suggests τηξετα (future middle), though Isaiah 34:4 has τακησοντα (second future passive). The repetitions here make "an effective refrain" (Mayor).
