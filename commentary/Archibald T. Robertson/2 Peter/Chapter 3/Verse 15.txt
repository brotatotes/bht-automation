<p><b> In his sight </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span>). Ethical dative. Referring to Christ.</p>
<p><b>Is salvation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωτηριαν</span></span>). Predicate accusative after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγεισθε</span></span> in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακροθυμιαν</span></span> (long-suffering), an opportunity for repentance (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:20">1 Peter 3:20</span>). The Lord here is Christ.</p>
<p><b>Our beloved brother Paul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αγαπητος αδελφος Παυλος</span></span>). Paul applies the verbal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπητος</span></span> (beloved) to Epaphras (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:7">Colossians 1:7</span>), Onesimus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:9">Colossians 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:16">Philemon 1:16</span>), to Tychicus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:7">Colossians 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:21">Ephesians 6:21</span>), and to four brethren in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:16">2 Peter 3:16</span> (Epainetus <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span>, Ampliatus <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:8">Romans 16:8</span>, Stachys <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:9">Romans 16:9</span>, Persis <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:12">Romans 16:12</span>). It is not surprising for Peter to use it of Paul in view of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>, in spite of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11-14">Galatians 2:11-14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Given to him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοθεισαν αυτω</span></span>). First aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span> with dative case. Peter claimed wisdom for himself, but recognises that Paul had the gift also. His language here may have caution in it as well as commendation. "St. Peter speaks of him with affection and respect, yet maintains the right to criticise" (Bigg). </p>
