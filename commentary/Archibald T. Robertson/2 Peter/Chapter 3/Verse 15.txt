 In his sight  (αυτω). Ethical dative. Referring to Christ.Is salvation  (σωτηριαν). Predicate accusative after ηγεισθε in apposition with μακροθυμιαν (long-suffering), an opportunity for repentance (cf. 1 Peter 3:20). The Lord here is Christ.Our beloved brother Paul  (ο αγαπητος αδελφος Παυλος). Paul applies the verbal αγαπητος (beloved) to Epaphras (Colossians 1:7), Onesimus (Colossians 4:9; Philemon 1:16), to Tychicus (Colossians 4:7; Ephesians 6:21), and to four brethren in 2 Peter 3:16 (Epainetus Romans 16:5, Ampliatus Romans 16:8, Stachys Romans 16:9, Persis Romans 16:12). It is not surprising for Peter to use it of Paul in view of Galatians 2:9, in spite of Galatians 2:11-14.Given to him  (δοθεισαν αυτω). First aorist passive participle of διδωμ with dative case. Peter claimed wisdom for himself, but recognises that Paul had the gift also. His language here may have caution in it as well as commendation. "St. Peter speaks of him with affection and respect, yet maintains the right to criticise" (Bigg).
