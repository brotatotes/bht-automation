<p><b> As also in all his epistles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως κα εν πασαις επιστολαις</span></span>). We do not know to how many Peter here refers. There is no difficulty in supposing that Peter "received every one of St. Paul's Epistles within a month or two of its publication" (Bigg). And yet Peter does not here assert the formation of a canon of Paul's Epistles.</p>
<p><b>Speaking in them of these things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλων εν αυταις περ τουτων</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span>. That is to say, Paul also wrote about the second coming of Christ, as is obviously true.</p>
<p><b>Hard to be understood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυσνοητα</span></span>). Late verbal from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυς</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νοεω</span></span> (in Aristotle, Lucian, Diog. Laert.), here only in N.T. We know that the Thessalonians persisted in misrepresenting Paul on this very subject of the second coming as Hymenaeus and Philetus did about the resurrection (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:17">2 Timothy 2:17</span>) and Spitta holds that Paul's teaching about grace was twisted to mean moral laxity like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:10">Galatians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:28">Romans 3:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:20">Romans 5:20</span> (with which cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+6:1">2 Peter 6:1</span> as a case in point), etc. Peter does not say that he himself did not understand Paul on the subject of faith and freedom.</p>
<p><b>Unlearned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαθεις</span></span>). Old word (alpha privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μανθανω</span></span> to learn), ignorant, here only in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Unsteadfast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αστηρικτο</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:14">2 Peter 2:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Wrest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρεβλουσιν</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρεβλοω</span></span>, old verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρεβλος</span></span> twisted, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρεφω</span></span>, to turn), here only in N.T.</p>
<p><b>The other scriptures </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας λοιπας γραφας</span></span>). There is no doubt that the apostles claimed to speak by the help of the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:27">1 Thessalonians 5:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:16">Colossians 4:16</span>) just as the prophets of old did (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:20">2 Peter 1:20</span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λοιπας</span></span> (rest) here rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλας</span></span> (other). Peter thus puts Paul's Epistles on the same plane with the O.T., which was also misused (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:21-44">Matthew 5:21-44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:3-6">Matthew 15:3-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:3-10">Matthew 19:3-10</span>). </p>
