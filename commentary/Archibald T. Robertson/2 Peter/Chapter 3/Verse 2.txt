<p><b> That ye should remember </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνησθηνα</span></span>). First aorist passive (deponent) infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμνησκω</span></span>, to remind. Purpose (indirect command) is here expressed by this infinitive. Imperative in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:17">Jude 1:17</span>.</p>
<p><b>Spoken before </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προειρημενων</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προειπον</span></span> (defective verb). Genitive case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρηματων</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνησθηνα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>And the commandment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα της εντολης</span></span>). Ablative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο</span></span> (agency).</p>
<p><b>Of the Lord and Saviour through your apostles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των αποστολων υμων του κυριου κα σωτηρος</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυμων</span></span> (your) is correct, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημων</span></span> (our). But the several genitives complicate the sense. If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> (through) occurred before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των αποστολων</span></span>, it would be clear. It is held by some that Peter would not thus speak of the twelve apostles, including himself, and that the forger here allows the mask to slip, but Bigg rightly regards this a needless inference. The meaning is that they should remember the teaching of their apostles and not follow the Gnostic libertines. </p>
