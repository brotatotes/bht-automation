<p><b> Where is the promise of his coming? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">που εστιν η επαγγελια της παρουσιας αυτου;</span></span>). This is the only sample of the questions raised by these mockers. Peter had mentioned this subject of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρουσια</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16">2 Peter 1:16</span>. Now he faces it squarely. Peter, like Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:1">1 Thessalonians 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1">2 Thessalonians 2:1</span>), preached about the second coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16">2 Peter 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:20">Acts 3:20</span>), as Jesus himself did repeatedly (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:34">Matthew 24:34</span>) and as the angels promised at the Ascension (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:11">Acts 1:11</span>). Both Jesus and Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1">2 Thessalonians 2:1</span>) were misunderstood on the subject of the time and the parables of Jesus urged readiness and forbade setting dates for his coming, though his language in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:34">Matthew 24:34</span> probably led some to believe that he would certainly come while they were alive.</p>
<p><b>From the day that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφ' ης</span></span>). "From which day." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:45">Luke 7:45</span>.</p>
<p><b>Fell asleep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκοιμηθησαν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοιμαω</span></span>, old verb, to put sleep, classic euphemism for death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:11">John 11:11</span>) like our cemetery (sleeping-place).</p>
<p><b>Continue </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαμενε</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαμενω</span></span>, to remain through (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:22">Luke 1:22</span>). <i>In statu quo</i>.</p>
<p><b>As they were </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως</span></span>). "Thus."</p>
<p><b>From the beginning of creation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' αρχης κτισεως</span></span>). Precisely so in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:6">Mark 10:6</span>, which see. </p>
