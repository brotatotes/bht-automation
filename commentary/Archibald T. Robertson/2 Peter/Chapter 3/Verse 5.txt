 For this they wilfully forget  (λανθανε γαρ αυτους τουτο θελοντας). Literally, "for this escapes them being willing." See this use of λανθανω (old verb, to escape notice of, to be hidden from) in Acts 26:26. The present active participle θελοντας (from θελω, to wish) has almost an adverbial sense here.Compacted  (συνεστωσα). See Paul's συνεστηκεν (Colossians 1:17) "consist." Second perfect active (intransitive) participle of συνιστημ, feminine singular agreeing with γη (nearest to it) rather than with ουρανο (subject of ησαν imperfect plural). There is no need to make Peter mean the Jewish mystical "seven heavens" because of the plural which was used interchangeably with the singular (Matthew 5:9).Out of water and amidst water  (εξ υδατος κα δι' υδατος). Out of the primeval watery chaos (Genesis 1:2), but it is not plain what is meant by δι' υδατος, which naturally means "by means of water," though δια with the genitive is used for a condition or state (Hebrews 12:1). The reference may be to Genesis 1:9, the gathering together of the waters.By the word of God  (τω του θεου λογω). Instrumental case λογω, "by the fiat of God" (Genesis 1:3; Hebrews 11:3 ρηματ θεου).
