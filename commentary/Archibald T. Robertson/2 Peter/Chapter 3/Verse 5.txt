<p><b> For this they wilfully forget </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λανθανε γαρ αυτους τουτο θελοντας</span></span>). Literally, "for this escapes them being willing." See this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λανθανω</span></span> (old verb, to escape notice of, to be hidden from) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:26">Acts 26:26</span>. The present active participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελοντας</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω</span></span>, to wish) has almost an adverbial sense here.</p>
<p><b>Compacted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεστωσα</span></span>). See Paul's <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεστηκεν</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:17">Colossians 1:17</span>) "consist." Second perfect active (intransitive) participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιστημ</span></span>, feminine singular agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γη</span></span> (nearest to it) rather than with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουρανο</span></span> (subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν</span></span> imperfect plural). There is no need to make Peter mean the Jewish mystical "seven heavens" because of the plural which was used interchangeably with the singular (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:9">Matthew 5:9</span>).</p>
<p><b>Out of water and amidst water </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ υδατος κα δι' υδατος</span></span>). Out of the primeval watery chaos (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:2">Genesis 1:2</span>), but it is not plain what is meant by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' υδατος</span></span>, which naturally means "by means of water," though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> with the genitive is used for a condition or state (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</span>). The reference may be to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:9">Genesis 1:9</span>, the gathering together of the waters.</p>
<p><b>By the word of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω του θεου λογω</span></span>). Instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογω</span></span>, "by the fiat of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:3">Genesis 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:3">Hebrews 11:3</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρηματ θεου</span></span>). </p>
