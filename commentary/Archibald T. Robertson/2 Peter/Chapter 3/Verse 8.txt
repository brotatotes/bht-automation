<p><b> Forget not this one thing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τουτο μη λανθανετω υμας</span></span>). Rather, "let not this one thing escape you." For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λανθανετω</span></span> (present active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λανθανω</span></span>) see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:5">2 Peter 3:5</span>. The "one thing" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>) is explained by the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> (that) clause following. Peter applies the language of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+90:4">Psalms 90:4</span> about the eternity of God and shortness of human life to "the impatience of human expectations" (Bigg) about the second coming of Christ. "The day of judgment is at hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:7">1 Peter 4:7</span>). It may come tomorrow; but what is tomorrow? What does God mean by a day? It may be a thousand years" (Bigg). Precisely the same argument applies to those who argue for a literal interpretation of the thousand years in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4-6">Revelation 20:4-6</span>. It may be a day or a day may be a thousand years. God's clock (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα κυριω</span></span>, beside the Lord) does not run by our timepieces. The scoffers scoff ignorantly. </p>
