 Forget not this one thing  (εν τουτο μη λανθανετω υμας). Rather, "let not this one thing escape you." For λανθανετω (present active imperative of λανθανω) see verse 2 Peter 3:5. The "one thing" (εν) is explained by the οτ (that) clause following. Peter applies the language of Psalms 90:4 about the eternity of God and shortness of human life to "the impatience of human expectations" (Bigg) about the second coming of Christ. "The day of judgment is at hand (1 Peter 4:7). It may come tomorrow; but what is tomorrow? What does God mean by a day? It may be a thousand years" (Bigg). Precisely the same argument applies to those who argue for a literal interpretation of the thousand years in Revelation 20:4-6. It may be a day or a day may be a thousand years. God's clock (παρα κυριω, beside the Lord) does not run by our timepieces. The scoffers scoff ignorantly.
