<p><b> To which end </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ο</span></span>). So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:29">Colossians 1:29</span>. Probably purpose with reference to the contents of verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:5-10">2 Thessalonians 1:5-10</span>. We have had the Thanksgiving (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:3-10">2 Thessalonians 1:3-10</span>) in a long, complicated, but rich period or sentence. Now he makes a brief Prayer (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:11-12">2 Thessalonians 1:11-12</span>) that God will fulfil all their hopes and endeavours. Paul and his colleagues can still pray for them though no longer with them (Moffatt).</p>
<p><b>That </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>). Common after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευχομα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:3">Colossians 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:9">Philippians 1:9</span>) when the content of the prayer blends with the purpose (purport and purpose).</p>
<p><b>Count you worthy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμας αξιωση</span></span>). Causative verb (aorist active subjunctive) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταξιοω</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:5">2 Thessalonians 1:5</span> with genitive.</p>
<p><b>Of your calling </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της κλησεως</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κλησις</span></span> can apply to the beginning as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:26">1 Corinthians 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:29">Romans 11:29</span>, but it can also apply to the final issue as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:14">Philippians 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>. Both ideas may be here. It is God's calling of the Thessalonians.</p>
<p><b>And fulfil every desire of goodness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα πληρωση πασαν ευδοκιαν αγαθωσυνης</span></span>). "Whom he counts worthy he first makes worthy" (Lillie). Yes, in purpose, but the wonder and the glory of it all is that God begins to count us worthy in Christ before the process is completed in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>). But God will see it through and so Paul prays to God. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ευδοκια</span></span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:14">Luke 2:14</span>) is more than mere desire, rather good pleasure, God's purpose of goodness, not in ancient Greek, only in LXX and N.T. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αγαθωσυνη</span></span> like a dozen other words in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-συνη</span></span> occurs only in late Greek. This word occurs only in LXX, N.T., writings based on them. It is made from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθος</span></span>, good, akin to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαμα</span></span>, to admire. May the Thessalonians find delight in goodness, a worthy and pertinent prayer.</p>
<p><b>Work of faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργον πιστεως</span></span>). The same phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:3">1 Thessalonians 1:3</span>. Paul prays for rich fruition of what he had seen in the beginning. Work marked by faith, springs from faith, sustained by faith.</p>
<p><b>With power </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν δυναμε</span></span>). In power. Connect with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρωση</span></span> (fulfil), God's power (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:29">Romans 1:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:4">Colossians 1:4</span>) in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:24">1 Corinthians 1:24</span>) through the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:5">1 Thessalonians 1:5</span>). </p>
