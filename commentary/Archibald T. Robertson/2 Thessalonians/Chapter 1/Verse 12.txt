<p><b> That </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως</span></span>). Rare with Paul compared with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:29">1 Corinthians 1:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:14">2 Corinthians 8:14</span>). Perhaps here for variety (dependent on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> clause in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:11">2 Thessalonians 1:11</span>).</p>
<p><b>The name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ονομα</span></span>). The Old Testament (LXX) uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span> embodying the revealed character of Jehovah. So here the</p>
<p><b>Name </b> of our Lord Jesus means the Messiahship and Lordship of Jesus. The common Greek idiom of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span> for title or dignity as in the papyri (Milligan) is not quite this idiom. The papyri also give examples of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span> for person as in O.T. and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15">Acts 1:15</span> (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, pp. 196ff.).</p>
<p><b>In you, and ye in him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υμιν, κα υμεις εν αυτω</span></span>). This reciprocal glorying is Pauline, but it is also like Christ's figure of the vine and the branches in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:1-11">John 15:1-11</span>.</p>
<p><b>According to the grace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα την χαριν</span></span>). Not merely standard, but also aim (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 609).</p>
<p><b>Of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θεου ημων κα κυριου Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). Here strict syntax requires, since there is only one article with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεου</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριου</span></span> that one person be meant, Jesus Christ, as is certainly true in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1">2 Peter 1:1</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p.786). This otherwise conclusive syntactical argument, admitted by Schmiedel, is weakened a bit by the fact that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span> is often employed as a proper name without the article, a thing not true of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωτηρ</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1">2 Peter 1:1</span>. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη βασιλεια του Χριστου κα θεου</span></span> the natural meaning is</p>
<p><b>in the Kingdom of Christ and God </b> regarded as one, but here again <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span>, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span>, often occurs as a proper name without the article. So it has to be admitted that here Paul may mean "according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ," though he may also mean "according to the grace of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ." </p>
