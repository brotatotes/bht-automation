 That  (οπως). Rare with Paul compared with ινα (1 Corinthians 1:29; 2 Corinthians 8:14). Perhaps here for variety (dependent on ινα clause in verse 2 Thessalonians 1:11).The name  (το ονομα). The Old Testament (LXX) uses ονομα embodying the revealed character of Jehovah. So here theName  of our Lord Jesus means the Messiahship and Lordship of Jesus. The common Greek idiom of ονομα for title or dignity as in the papyri (Milligan) is not quite this idiom. The papyri also give examples of ονομα for person as in O.T. and Acts 1:15 (Deissmann, Bible Studies, pp. 196ff.).In you, and ye in him  (εν υμιν, κα υμεις εν αυτω). This reciprocal glorying is Pauline, but it is also like Christ's figure of the vine and the branches in John 15:1-11.According to the grace  (κατα την χαριν). Not merely standard, but also aim (Robertson, Grammar, p. 609).Of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ  (του θεου ημων κα κυριου Ιησου Χριστου). Here strict syntax requires, since there is only one article with θεου and κυριου that one person be meant, Jesus Christ, as is certainly true in Titus 2:13; 2 Peter 1:1 (Robertson, Grammar, p.786). This otherwise conclusive syntactical argument, admitted by Schmiedel, is weakened a bit by the fact that Κυριος is often employed as a proper name without the article, a thing not true of σωτηρ in Titus 2:13; 2 Peter 1:1. So in Ephesians 5:5 εν τη βασιλεια του Χριστου κα θεου the natural meaning isin the Kingdom of Christ and God  regarded as one, but here again θεος, like Κυριος, often occurs as a proper name without the article. So it has to be admitted that here Paul may mean "according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ," though he may also mean "according to the grace of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ."
