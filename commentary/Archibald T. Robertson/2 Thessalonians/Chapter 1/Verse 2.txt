<p><b> From God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο θεου πατρος κα Κυριου Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). These words are not genuine in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span>, but are here and they appear in all the other Pauline Epistles. Note absence of article both after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>, though both God and Lord Jesus Christ are definite. In both cases Jesus Christ is put on a par with God, though not identical. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span> for discussion of words, but note difference between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>, in the sphere of, by the power of, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>, from, as the fountain head and source of grace and peace. </p>
