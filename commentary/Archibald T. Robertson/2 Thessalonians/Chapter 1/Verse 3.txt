<p><b> We are bound </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειλομεν</span></span>). Paul feels a sense of obligation to keep on giving thanks to God (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστειν τω θεω</span></span>, present infinitive with dative case) because of God's continued blessings on the Thessalonians. He uses the same idiom again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span> and nowhere else in his thanksgivings. It is not necessity (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>) that Paul here notes, but a sense of personal obligation as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:6">1 John 2:6</span> (Milligan).</p>
<p><b>Even as it is meet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως αξιον εστιν</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Οφειλομεν</span></span> points to the divine, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιον</span></span> to the human side of the obligation (Lightfoot), perhaps to cheer the fainthearted in a possible letter to him in reply to Paul's First Thessalonian epistle (Milligan). This adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιος</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγω</span></span>, to drag down the scales, and so weighty, worthy, worthwhile, old word and appropriate here.</p>
<p><b>For that your faith groweth exceedingly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ υπεραυξανε η πιστις υμων</span></span>). Causal use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> referring to the obligation stated in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειλομεν</span></span>. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεραυξανω</span></span> is one of Paul's frequent compounds in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ-βαινω</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:6">1 Thessalonians 4:6</span>; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ-εκ-τεινω</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:14">2 Corinthians 10:14</span>; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ-εν-τυγχανω</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span>; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ-νικαω</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:37">Romans 8:37</span>; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ-πλεοναζω</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:14">1 Timothy 1:14</span>) and occurs only here in N.T. and rare elsewhere (Galen, Dio Cass.). Figure of the tree of faith growing above (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span>) measure. Cf. parable of Jesus about faith-like a grain of mustard seed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:31">Matthew 13:31</span>).</p>
<p><b>Aboundeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεοναζε</span></span>). Same verb in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:12">1 Thessalonians 3:12</span>, here a fulfilment of the prayer made there. Milligan finds <i>diffusive</i> growth of love in this word because of "each one" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενος εκαστου</span></span>). Frame finds in this fulfilment of the prayer of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:12">1 Thessalonians 3:12</span> one proof that II Thessalonians is later than I Thessalonians. </p>
