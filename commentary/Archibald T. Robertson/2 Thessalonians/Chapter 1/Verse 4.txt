<p><b> So that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span>). Another example of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span> and the infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενκαυχασθα</span></span>) for result as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:7">1 Thessalonians 1:7</span> which see.</p>
<p><b>We ourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτους ημας</span></span>). Accusative of general reference with the infinitive, but not merely <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημας</span></span> (or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτους</span></span>), perhaps in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υμιν</span></span> (in you), as much as to say, "so that we ourselves, contrary to your expectations, are boasting" (Frame). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ενκαυχαομα</span></span> occurs here alone in N.T., but is found in the LXX and in <i>Aesop's Fables</i>, proof enough of its vernacular use. Paul was not above praising one church to other churches, to provoke them to good works. Here he is boasting of Thessalonica in Macedonia to the Corinthians as he did later to the Corinthians about the collection (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:1-15">2 Corinthians 8:1-15</span>) after having first boasted to the Macedonians about the Corinthians (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:1-5">2 Corinthians 9:1-5</span>). There were other churches in Achaia besides Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:1">2 Corinthians 1:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>For </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span>). Over, about, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:2">1 Thessalonians 1:2</span>).</p>
<p><b>In all your persecutions </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πασιν τοις διωγμοις υμων</span></span>). Their patience and faith had already attracted Paul's attention (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:3">1 Thessalonians 1:3</span>) and their tribulations <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιψεσιν</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:6">1 Thessalonians 1:6</span>). Here Paul adds the more specific term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωγμος</span></span>, old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωκω</span></span>, to chase, to pursue, a word used by Paul of his treatment in Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:10">2 Corinthians 12:10</span>).</p>
<p><b>Which ye endure </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αις ανεχεσθε</span></span>). B here reads <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεχεσθε</span></span>, to be entangled in, to be held in as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεχεσθε</span></span> is probably correct and the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αις</span></span> is probably attracted to locative case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιψεσιν</span></span> from the ablative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεχεσθε</span></span>,</p>
<p><b>from which ye hold yourselves back </b> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:13">Colossians 3:13</span>). </p>
