<p><b> If so be that it is a righteous thing with God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπερ δικαιον παρα θεω</span></span>). Condition of first class, determined as fulfilled, assumed as true, but with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπερ</span></span> (if on the whole, provided that) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>, and with no copula expressed. A righteous thing "with God" means by the side of God (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα θεω</span></span>) and so from God's standpoint. This is as near to the idea of absolute right as it is possible to attain. Note the phrase in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:5">2 Thessalonians 1:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>To recompense affliction to them that afflict you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανταποδουνα τοις θλιβουσιν ημας θλιψιν</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive of double compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ-αποδιδωμ</span></span>, old verb, either in good sense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:9">1 Thessalonians 3:9</span> or in bad sense as here. Paul is certain of this principle, though he puts it conditionally. </p>
