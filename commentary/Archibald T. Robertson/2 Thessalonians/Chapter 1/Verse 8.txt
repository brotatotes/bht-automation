 Rendering  (διδοντος). Genitive of present active participle of διδωμ, to give, agreeing with Ιησου.Vengeance  (εκδικησιν). Late word from εκδικεω, to vindicate, in Polybius and LXX.To them that know not God  (τοις μη ειδοσιν θεον). Dative plural of perfect active participle ειδως. Apparently chiefly Gentiles in mind (1 Thessalonians 4:3; Galatians 4:8; Romans 1:28; Ephesians 2:12), though Jews are also guilty of wilful ignorance of God (Romans 2:14).And to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus  (κα τοις μη υπακουουσιν τω ευαγγελιω του κυριου ημων Ιησου). Repetition of the article looks like another class and so Jews (Romans 10:16). Both Jews as instigators and Gentiles as officials (πολιταρχς) were involved in the persecution in Thessalonica (Acts 17:5-9; 2 Thessalonians 1:6). Note the use of "gospel" here as in Mark 1:15 "believe in the gospel."
