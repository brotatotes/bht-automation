 Touching the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ  (υπερ της παρουσιας του Κυριου (ημων) Ιησου Χριστου). For ερωτωμεν, to beseech, see on 1 Thessalonians 4:1; 1 Thessalonians 4:12. Hυπερ originally meant over, in behalf of, instead of, but here it is used like περ, around, concerning as in 2 Thessalonians 1:4; 1 Thessalonians 3:2; 1 Thessalonians 5:10, common in the papyri (Robertson, Grammar, p. 632). For the distinction between Παρουσια, Επιφανεια (Epiphany), and Αποκαλυψις (Revelation) as applied to the Second Coming of Christ see Milligan on Thessalonian Epistles, pp. 145-151, in the light of the papyri. Παρουσια lays emphasis on thepresence  of the Lord with his people, επιφανεια on hismanifestation  of the power and love of God, αποκαλυψις on therevelation  of God's purpose and plan in the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus.And our gathering together unto him  (κα ημων επισυναγωγης επ' αυτον). A late word found only in II Macc. 2:7; 2 Thessalonians 2:1; Hebrews 10:25 till Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, p. 103) found it on a stele in the island of Syme, off Caria, meaning "collection." Paul is referring to the rapture, mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17, and the being forever with the Lord thereafter. Cf. also Matthew 24:31; Mark 13:27.
