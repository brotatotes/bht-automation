Here is the definite judicial act of God (Milligan) who gives the wicked over to the evil which they have deliberately chosen (Romans 1:24; Romans 1:26; Romans 1:28).A working of error  (ενεργειαν πλανης). Terrible result of wilful rejection of the truth of God.That they should believe a lie  (εις το πιστευσα αυτους τω ψευδε). Note εις το again and τω ψευδε (the lie, the falsehood already described), a contemplated result. Note Romans 1:25 "who changed the truth of God into the lie."
