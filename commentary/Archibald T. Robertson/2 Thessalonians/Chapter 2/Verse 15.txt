<p><b> So then </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα ουν</span></span>). Accordingly then. The illative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα</span></span> is supported (Ellicott) by the collective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:6">1 Thessalonians 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:10">Galatians 6:10</span>, etc. Here is the practical conclusion from God's elective purpose in such a world crisis.</p>
<p><b>Stand fast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηκετε</span></span>). Present imperative active of the late present <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηκο</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστηκα</span></span> (perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:8">1 Thessalonians 3:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>Hold the traditions </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατειτε τας παραδοσεις</span></span>). Present imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατεω</span></span>, old verb, to have masterful grip on a thing, either with genitive (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:31">Mark 1:31</span>) or usually the accusative as here. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παραδοσις</span></span> (tradition) is an old word for what is handed over to one. Dibelius thinks that Paul reveals his Jewish training in the use of this word (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:14">Galatians 1:14</span>), but the word is a perfectly legitimate one for teaching whether oral,</p>
<p><b>by word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια λογου</span></span>), or written,</p>
<p><b>by epistle of ours </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' επιστολης ημων</span></span>). Paul draws here no distinction between oral tradition and written tradition as was done later. The worth of the tradition lies not in the form but in the source and the quality of the content. Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23">1 Corinthians 11:23</span> says: "I received from the Lord what I also handed over (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδωκα</span></span>) unto you." He praises them because ye "hold fast the traditions even as I delivered them unto you." The</p>
<p><b>tradition </b> may be merely that of men and so worthless and harmful in place of the word of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:8">Mark 7:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:6-8">Colossians 2:6-8</span>). It all depends. It is easy to scoff at truth as mere tradition. But human progress in all fields is made by use of the old, found to be true, in connection with the new if found to be true. In Thessalonica the saints were already the victims of theological charlatans with their half-baked theories about the second coming of Christ and about social duties and relations.</p>
<p><b>Which ye were taught </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ας εδιδαχθητε</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκω</span></span>, to teach, retaining the accusative of the thing in the passive as is common with this verb like <i>doceo</i> in Latin and teach in English. </p>
