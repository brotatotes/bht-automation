 And God our Father  (κα [ο] θεος ο πατηρ ημων). It is uncertain whether the first article ο is genuine as it is absent in B D. Usually Paul has the Father before Christ except here, 2 Corinthians 13:13; Galatians 1:1.Which loved us  (ο αγαπησας ημας). This singular articular participle refers to ο πατηρ, "though it is difficult to see how St. Paul could otherwise have expressed his thought, if he had intended to refer to the Son, as well as to the Father. There is probably no instance in St. Paul of a plural adjective or verb, when the two Persons of the Godhead are mentioned" (Lightfoot).Eternal comfort  (παρακλησιν αιωνιαν). Distinct feminine form of αιωνιος here instead of masculine as in Matthew 25:46.
