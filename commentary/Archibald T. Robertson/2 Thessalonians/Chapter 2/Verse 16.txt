<p><b> And God our Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα [ο] θεος ο πατηρ ημων</span></span>). It is uncertain whether the first article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> is genuine as it is absent in B D. Usually Paul has the Father before Christ except here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:13">2 Corinthians 13:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Which loved us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αγαπησας ημας</span></span>). This singular articular participle refers to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πατηρ</span></span>, "though it is difficult to see how St. Paul could otherwise have expressed his thought, if he had intended to refer to the Son, as well as to the Father. There is probably no instance in St. Paul of a plural adjective or verb, when the two Persons of the Godhead are mentioned" (Lightfoot).</p>
<p><b>Eternal comfort </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακλησιν αιωνιαν</span></span>). Distinct feminine form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιωνιος</span></span> here instead of masculine as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46">Matthew 25:46</span>. </p>
