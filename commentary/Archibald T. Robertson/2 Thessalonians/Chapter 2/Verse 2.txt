<p><b> To the end that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το</span></span>). One of Paul's favourite idioms for purpose, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το</span></span> and the infinitive.</p>
<p><b>Ye be not quickly shaken </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ταχεως σαλευθηνα υμας</span></span>). First aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαλευω</span></span>, old verb to agitate, to cause to totter like a reed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:7">Matthew 11:7</span>), the earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:26">Hebrews 12:26</span>). Usual negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and accusative of general reference <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμας</span></span> with the infinitive.</p>
<p><b>From your mind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο του νοος</span></span>). Ablative case of nous, mind, reason, sober sense, "from your witte" (Wyclif), to "keep their heads."</p>
<p><b>Nor yet be troubled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδε θροεισθα</span></span>). Old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θροεω</span></span>, to cry aloud (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θροος</span></span>, clamour, tumult), to be in a state of nervous excitement (present passive infinitive, as if it were going on), "a continued state of agitation following the definite shock received (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαλευθηνα</span></span>)" (Milligan).</p>
<p><b>Either by spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητε δια πνευματος</span></span>). By ecstatic utterance (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:10">1 Thessalonians 5:10</span>). The nervous fear that the coming was to be at once prohibited by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδε</span></span> Paul divides into three sources by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητε, μητε, μητε</span></span>. No individual claim to divine revelation (the gift of prophecy) can justify the statement.</p>
<p><b>Or by word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητε δια λογου</span></span>). Oral statement of a conversation with Paul (Lightfoot) to this effect</p>
<p><b>as from us </b>. An easy way to set aside Paul's first Epistle by report of a private remark from Paul.</p>
<p><b>Or by epistle as from us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητε δι' επιστολης ως δι' ημων</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13-5">1 Thessalonians 4:13-5</span> Paul had plainly said that Jesus would come as a thief in the night and had shown that the dead would not be left out in the rapture. But evidently some one claimed to have a private epistle from Paul which supported the view that Jesus was coming at once,</p>
<p><b>as that the day of the Lord is now present </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως οτ ενεστηκεν η ημερα του κυριου</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενιστημ</span></span>, old verb, to place in, but intransitive in this tense to stand in or at or near. So "is imminent" (Lightfoot). The verb is common in the papyri. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:22">1 Corinthians 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:38">Romans 8:38</span> we have a contrast between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα ενεστωτα</span></span>, the things present, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα μελλοντα</span></span>, the things future (to come). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως οτ</span></span> may be disparaging here, though that is not true in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19">2 Corinthians 5:19</span>. In the <i>Koine</i> it comes in the vernacular to mean simply "that" (Moulton, <i>Proleg</i>., p. 212), but that hardly seems the case in the N.T. (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1033). Here it means "to wit that," though "as that" or "as if" does not miss it much. Certainly it flatly denies that by conversation or by letter he had stated that the second coming was immediately at hand. "It is this misleading assertion that accounts both for the increased discouragement of the faint-hearted to encourage whom Paul writes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:3-2">2 Thessalonians 1:3-2</span>, and for the increased meddlesomeness of the idle brethren to warn whom Paul writes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:1-18">2 Thessalonians 3:1-18</span>" (Frame). It is enough to give one pause to note Paul's indignation over this use of his name by one of the over-zealous advocates of the view that Christ was coming at once. It is true that Paul was still alive, but, if such a "pious fraud" was so common and easily condoned as some today argue, it is difficult to explain Paul's evident anger. Moreover, Paul's words should make us hesitate to affirm that Paul definitely proclaimed the early return of Jesus. He hoped for it undoubtedly, but he did not specifically proclaim it as so many today assert and accuse him of misleading the early Christians with a false presentation. </p>
