<p><b> Let no man beguile you in any wise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη τις υμας εξαπατηση κατα μηδενα τροπον</span></span>). First aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαπαταω</span></span> (old verb to deceive, strengthened form of simple verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαταω</span></span>) with double negative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη τισ, μηδενα</span></span>) in accord with regular Greek idiom as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:11">1 Corinthians 16:11</span> rather than the aorist imperative which does occur sometimes in the third person as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:15">Mark 13:15</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη καταβατω</span></span>). Paul broadens the warning to go beyond conversation and letter. He includes "tricks" of any kind. It is amazing how gullible some of the saints are when a new deceiver pulls off some stunts in religion.</p>
<p><b>For it will not be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). There is an ellipse here of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστα</span></span> (or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενησετα</span></span>) to be supplied after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>. Westcott and Hort make an anacoluthon at the end of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:4">2 Thessalonians 2:4</span>. The meaning is clear. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hοτ</span></span> is causal, because, but the verb is understood. The second coming not only is not "imminent," but will not take place before certain important things take place, a definite rebuff to the false enthusiasts of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>Except the falling away come first </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη ελθη η αποστασια πρωτον</span></span>). Negative condition of the third class, undetermined with prospect of determination and the aorist subjunctive. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αποστασια</span></span> is the late form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστασις</span></span> and is our word apostasy. Plutarch uses it of political revolt and it occurs in I Macc. 2:15 about Antiochus Epiphanes who was enforcing the apostasy from Judaism to Hellenism. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jos+22:22">Joshua 22:22</span> it occurs for rebellion against the Lord. It seems clear that the word here means a religious revolt and the use of the definite article (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span>) seems to mean that Paul had spoken to the Thessalonians about it. The only other New Testament use of the word is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:21">Acts 21:21</span> where it means apostasy from Moses. It is not clear whether Paul means revolt of the Jews from God, of Gentiles from God, of Christians from God, or of the apostasy that includes all classes within and without the body of Christians. But it is to be</p>
<p><b>first </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτον</span></span>) before Christ comes again. Note this adverb when only two events are compared (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:1">Acts 1:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>And the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αποκαλυφθη ο ανθρωπος της ανομιασ, ο υιος της απωλειας</span></span>). First aorist passive subjunctive after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη</span></span> and same condition as with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελθη</span></span>. The use of this verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαλυπτω</span></span>, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαλυψιν</span></span> of the second coming in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:7">2 Thessalonians 1:7</span>, seems to note the superhuman character (Milligan) of the event and the same verb is repeated in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:6">2 Thessalonians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>. The implication is that</p>
<p><b>the man of sin </b> is hidden somewhere who will be suddenly manifested just as false apostles pose as angels of light (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:13">2 Corinthians 11:13</span>), whether the crowning event of the apostasy or another name for the same event. Lightfoot notes the parallel between the man of sin, of whom sin is the special characteristic (genitive case, a Hebraism for the lawless one in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>) and Christ. Both Christ and the adversary of Christ are revealed, there is mystery about each, both make divine claims (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:4">2 Thessalonians 2:4</span>). He seems to be the Antichrist of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span>. The terrible phrase, the son of perdition, is applied to Judas in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:12">John 17:12</span> (like Judas doomed to perdition), but here to the lawless one (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ανομος</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>), who is not Satan, but some one definite person who is doing the work of Satan. Note the definite article each time. </p>
