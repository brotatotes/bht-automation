<p><b> He that opposeth and exalteth himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αντικειμενος κα υπεραιρομενος</span></span>). Like John's Antichrist this one opposes (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντι-</span></span>) Christ and exalts himself (direct middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεραιρω</span></span>, old verb to lift oneself up</p>
<p><b>above </b> others, only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span> in N.T.), but not Satan, but an agent of Satan. This participial clause is in apposition with the two preceding phrases, the man of sin, the son of perdition. Note <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:5">1 Corinthians 8:5</span> about one called God and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:23">Acts 17:23</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεβασμα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεβαζομα</span></span>), object of worship, late word, in N.T. only in these two passages.</p>
<p><b>So that he sitteth in the temple of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε αυτον εις τον ναον του θεου καθισα</span></span>). Another example of the infinitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span> for result. Caius Caligula had made a desperate attempt to have his statue set up for worship in the Temple in Jerusalem. This incident may lie behind Paul's language here.</p>
<p><b>Setting himself forth as God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδεικνυντα εαυτον οτ εστιν θεος</span></span>). Present active participle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μ</span></span> form) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδεικνυμ</span></span>, agreeing in case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον</span></span>,</p>
<p><b>showing himself that he is God </b>. Caligula claimed to be God. Moffatt doubts if Paul is identifying this deception with the imperial cultus at this stage. Lightfoot thinks that the deification of the Roman emperor supplied Paul's language here. Wetstein notes a coin of Julius with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span> on one side and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θεσσαλονικεων</span></span> on the other. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span> we are told of "many antichrists" some of whom had already come. Hence it is not clear that Paul has in mind only one individual or even individuals at all rather than evil principles, for in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:6">2 Thessalonians 2:6</span> he speaks of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το κατεχον</span></span> (that which restraineth) while in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</span> it is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κατεχων</span></span> (the one that restraineth). Frame argues for a combination of Belial and Antichrist as the explanation of Paul's language. But the whole subject is left by Paul in such a vague form that we can hardly hope to clear it up. It is possible that his own preaching while with them gave his readers a clue that we do not possess. </p>
