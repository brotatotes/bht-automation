<p><b> When I was yet with you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετ ων προς υμας</span></span>). The present participle takes the time of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγον</span></span> (imperfect active),</p>
<p><b>I used to tell you these things </b>. So Paul recalls their memory of his words and leaves us without the clue to his idea. We know that one of the charges against him was that Jesus was another king, a rival to Caesar (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:7">Acts 17:7</span>). That leads one to wonder how far Paul went when there in contrasting the kingdom of the world of which Rome was ruler and the kingdom of God of which Christ is king. Frame notes Paul's abrupt question here "with an unfinished sentence behind him" (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</span>), even "with a trace of impatience." </p>
