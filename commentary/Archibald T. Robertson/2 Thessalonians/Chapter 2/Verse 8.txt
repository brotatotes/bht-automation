<p><b> And then </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τοτε</span></span>). Emphatic note of time,</p>
<p><b>then </b> when the restraining one (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κατεχων</span></span>) is taken out of the way, then <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θε λαwλεσς ονε</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ανομος</span></span>), the man of sin, the man of perdition, will be revealed.</p>
<p><b>Whom the Lord [Jesus] shall slay </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον ο κυριος [Ιησουσ] ανελε</span></span>). Whether Jesus is genuine or not, he is meant by Lord. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ανελε</span></span> is a late future from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναιρεω</span></span>, in place of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναιρησε</span></span>. Paul uses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:4">Isaiah 11:4</span> (combining</p>
<p><b>by the word of his mouth </b> with</p>
<p><b>in breath through lips </b>) to picture the triumph of Christ over this adversary. It is a powerful picture how the mere breath of the Lord will destroy this arch-enemy (Milligan).</p>
<p><b>And bring to naught by the manifestation of his coming </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα καταργησε τη επιφανεια της παρουσιας αυτου</span></span>). This verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταργεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα, αργος</span></span>) to render useless, rare in ancient Greek, appears 25 times in Paul and has a variety of renderings. In the papyri it has a weakened sense of hinder. It will be a grand fiasco, this advent of the man of sin. Paul here uses both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιφανεια</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιφανψ</span></span>, elsewhere in N.T. in the Pastorals, familiar to the Greek mind for a visit of a god) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρουσια</span></span> (more familiar to the Jewish mind, but common in the papyri) of the second coming of Christ. "The apparition of Jesus heralds his doom" (Moffatt). The mere appearance of Christ destroys the adversary (Vincent). </p>
