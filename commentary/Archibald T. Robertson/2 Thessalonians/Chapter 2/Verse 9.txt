<p><b> Whose coming is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου εστιν η παρουσια</span></span>). Refers to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>. The Antichrist has his <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρουσια</span></span> also. Deissmann (<i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, pp. 374, 378) notes an inscription at Epidaurus in which "Asclepius manifested his <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παρουσια</span></span>." Antiochus Epiphanes is called <i>the manifest god</i> (III Macc. 5:35). So the two Epiphanies coincide.</p>
<p><b>Lying wonders </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τερασιν ψευδους</span></span>). "In wonders of a lie." Note here the three words for the miracles of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span>), power (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις</span></span>), signs (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημεια</span></span>), wonders (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τερατα</span></span>), but all according to the working of Satan (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα ενεργειαν του Σατανα</span></span>, the energy of Satan) just as Jesus had foretold (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>), wonders that would almost lead astray the very elect. </p>
