<p><b> Finally </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το λοιπον</span></span>). Accusative of general reference. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λοιπον</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:1">1 Thessalonians 4:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Pray </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευχεσθε</span></span>). Present middle, keep on praying. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:25">1 Thessalonians 5:25</span>.</p>
<p><b>That the word of the Lord may run and be glorified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ο λογος του κυριου τρεχη κα δοξαζητα</span></span>). Usual construction of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευχομα</span></span>, sub-final use, content and purpose combined. Note present subjunctive with both verbs rather than aorist, may keep on running and being glorified, two verbs joined together nowhere else in the N.T. Paul probably derived this metaphor from the stadium as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24">1 Corinthians 9:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:2">Galatians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:16">Romans 9:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:16">Philippians 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:7">2 Timothy 4:7</span>. Lightfoot translates "may have a triumphant career." On the word of the Lord see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:8">1 Thessalonians 1:8</span>. Paul recognizes the close relation between himself and the readers. He needs their prayers and sympathy and he rejoices in their reception of the word of the Lord already,</p>
<p><b>even as also it is with you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως κα προς υμας</span></span>). "As it does in your case" (Frame). </p>
