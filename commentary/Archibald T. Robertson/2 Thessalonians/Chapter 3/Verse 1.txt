 Finally  (το λοιπον). Accusative of general reference. Cf. λοιπον 1 Thessalonians 4:1.Pray  (προσευχεσθε). Present middle, keep on praying. Note περ as in 1 Thessalonians 5:25.That the word of the Lord may run and be glorified  (ινα ο λογος του κυριου τρεχη κα δοξαζητα). Usual construction of ινα after προσευχομα, sub-final use, content and purpose combined. Note present subjunctive with both verbs rather than aorist, may keep on running and being glorified, two verbs joined together nowhere else in the N.T. Paul probably derived this metaphor from the stadium as in 1 Corinthians 9:24; Galatians 2:2; Romans 9:16; Philippians 2:16; 2 Timothy 4:7. Lightfoot translates "may have a triumphant career." On the word of the Lord see on 1 Thessalonians 1:8. Paul recognizes the close relation between himself and the readers. He needs their prayers and sympathy and he rejoices in their reception of the word of the Lord already,even as also it is with you  (καθως κα προς υμας). "As it does in your case" (Frame).
