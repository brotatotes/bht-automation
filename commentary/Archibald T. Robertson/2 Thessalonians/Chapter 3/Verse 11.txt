<p><b> For we hear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουομεν γαρ</span></span>). Fresh news from Thessalonica evidently. For the present tense compare <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:18">1 Corinthians 11:18</span>. The accusative and the participle is a regular idiom for indirect discourse with this verb (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1040-2). Three picturesque present participles, the first a general description, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιπατουντας ατακτως</span></span>, the other two specifying with a vivid word-play,</p>
<p><b>that work not at all, but are busy-bodies </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν εργαζομενους αλλα περιεργαζομενους</span></span>). Literally,</p>
<p><b>doing nothing but doing around </b>. Ellicott suggests,</p>
<p><b>doing no business but being busy bodies </b>. "The first persecution at Thessalonica had been fostered by a number of fanatical loungers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span>)" (Moffatt). These theological dead-beats were too pious to work, but perfectly willing to eat at the hands of their neighbours while they piddled and frittered away the time in idleness. </p>
