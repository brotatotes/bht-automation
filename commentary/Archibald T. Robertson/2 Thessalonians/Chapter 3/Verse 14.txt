<p><b> And if any one obeyeth not our word by this epistle </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δε τις ουχ υπακουε τω λογω ημων δια της επιστολης</span></span>). Paul sums up the issue bluntly with this ultimatum. Condition of the first class, with negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span>, assuming it to be true.</p>
<p><b>Note that man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτον σημειουσθε</span></span>). Late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειοω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον</span></span>, sign, mark, token. Put a tag on that man. Here only in N.T. "The verb is regularly used for the signature to a receipt or formal notice in the papyri and the ostraca of the Imperial period" (Moulton Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>). How this is to be done (by letter or in public meeting) Paul does not say.</p>
<p><b>That ye have no company with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη συναναμιγνυσθα αυτω</span></span>). The MSS. are divided between the present middle infinitive as above in a command like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:15">Romans 12:15</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:16">Philippians 3:16</span> or the present middle imperative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναναμιγνυσθε</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-α</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ε</span></span> often being pronounced alike in the <i>Koine</i>). The infinitive can also be explained as an indirect command. This double compound verb is late, in LXX and Plutarch, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:9">1 Corinthians 5:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:11">1 Corinthians 5:11</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αυτω</span></span> is in associative instrumental case.</p>
<p><b>To the end that he may be ashamed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα εντραπη</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>. Second aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντρεπω</span></span>, to turn on, middle to turn on oneself or to put to shame, passive to be made ashamed. The idea is to have one's thoughts turned in on oneself. </p>
