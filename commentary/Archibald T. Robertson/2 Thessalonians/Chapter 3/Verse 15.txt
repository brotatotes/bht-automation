<p><b> Not as an enemy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ως εχθρον</span></span>). This is always the problem in such ostracism as discipline, however necessary it is at times. Few things in our churches are more difficult of wise execution than the discipline of erring members. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχθρος</span></span> is an adjective, hateful, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχθος</span></span>, hate. It can be passive,</p>
<p><b>hated </b>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:28">Romans 11:28</span>, but is usually active</p>
<p><b>hostile </b>, enemy, foe. </p>
