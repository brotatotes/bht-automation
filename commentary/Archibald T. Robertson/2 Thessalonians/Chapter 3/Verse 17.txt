<p><b> Of me Paul with mine own hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εμη χειρ Παυλου</span></span>). Instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρ</span></span>. Note genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παυλου</span></span> in apposition with possessive idea in the possessive pronoun <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμη</span></span>. Paul had dictated the letter, but now wrote the salutation in his hand.</p>
<p><b>The token in every epistle </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον εν παση επιστολη</span></span>). Mark (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:14">2 Thessalonians 3:14</span>) and proof of the genuineness of each epistle, Paul's signature. Already there were spurious forgeries (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span>). Thus each church was enabled to know that Paul wrote the letter. If only the autograph copy could be found! </p>
