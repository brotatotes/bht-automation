 And that we may be delivered  (κα ινα ρυσθωμεν). A second and more personal petition (Milligan). First aorist passive subjunctive of ρυομα, old verb to rescue. Note change in tense from present to aorist (effective aorist).From unreasonable and evil men  (απο των ατοπων κα πονηρων ανθρωπων). Ablative case with απο. Originally in the old Greek ατοπος (α privative and τοπος) is out of place, odd, unbecoming, perverse, outrageous, both of things and persons. Πονηρος is from πονεω, to work (πονος), looking on labour as an annoyance, bad, evil. Paul had a plague of such men in Corinth as he had in Thessalonica.For all have not faith  (ου γαρ παντων η πιστις). Copula εστιν not expressed. Παντων is predicate possessive genitive, faith (article with abstract substantive) does not belong to all. Hence their evil conduct.
