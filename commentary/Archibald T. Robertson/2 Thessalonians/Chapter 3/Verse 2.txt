<p><b> And that we may be delivered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ινα ρυσθωμεν</span></span>). A second and more personal petition (Milligan). First aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυομα</span></span>, old verb to rescue. Note change in tense from present to aorist (effective aorist).</p>
<p><b>From unreasonable and evil men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο των ατοπων κα πονηρων ανθρωπων</span></span>). Ablative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>. Originally in the old Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατοπος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοπος</span></span>) is out of place, odd, unbecoming, perverse, outrageous, both of things and persons. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πονηρος</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονεω</span></span>, to work (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονος</span></span>), looking on labour as an annoyance, bad, evil. Paul had a plague of such men in Corinth as he had in Thessalonica.</p>
<p><b>For all have not faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γαρ παντων η πιστις</span></span>). Copula <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> not expressed. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παντων</span></span> is predicate possessive genitive, faith (article with abstract substantive) does not belong to all. Hence their evil conduct. </p>
