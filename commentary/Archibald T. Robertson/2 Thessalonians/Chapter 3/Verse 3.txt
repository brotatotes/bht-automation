<p><b> But the Lord is faithful </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστος δε εστιν ο κυριος</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>But faithful is the Lord </b> (correct rendition), with a play (paronomasia) on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span> by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστος</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:3">Romans 3:3</span> we have a word-play on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιστεω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιστια</span></span>. The Lord can be counted on, however perverse men may be.</p>
<p><b>From the evil one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο του πονηρου</span></span>). Apparently a reminiscence of the Lord's Prayer in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:13">Matthew 6:13</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυσα ημας απο του πονηρου</span></span>. But here as there it is not certain whether <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του πονηρου</span></span> is neuter (evil) like to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονηρον</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:9">Romans 12:9</span> or masculine (the evil one). But we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πονηρος</span></span> (the evil one) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:18">1 John 5:18</span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του πονηρου</span></span> is clearly masculine in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:16">Ephesians 6:16</span>. If masculine here, as is probable, is it "the Evil One" (Ellicott) or merely the evil man like those mentioned in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:2">2 Thessalonians 3:2</span>? Perhaps Paul has in mind the representative of Satan, the man of sin, pictured in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1-12">2 Thessalonians 2:1-12</span>, by the phrase here without trying to be too definite. </p>
