<p><b>Into the love of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την αγαπην του θεου</span></span>). Either subjective or objective genitive makes sense and Lightfoot pleads for both, "not only as an objective attribute of deity, but as a ruling principle in our hearts," holding that it is "seldom possible to separate the one from the other." Most scholars take it here as subjective, the characteristic of God.</p>
<p><b>Into the patience of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την υπομνην του Χριστου</span></span>). There is the same ambiguity here, though the subjective idea, the patience shown by Christ, is the one usually accepted rather than "the patient waiting for Christ" (objective genitive). </p>
