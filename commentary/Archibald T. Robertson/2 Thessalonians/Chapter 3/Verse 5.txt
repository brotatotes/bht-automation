 Direct  (κατευθυνα). First aorist active optative of wish for the future as in 2 Thessalonians 2:17; 1 Thessalonians 5:23 from κατευθυνω, old verb, as in 1 Thessalonians 3:11 (thereway , herehearts ) and Luke 1:79 offeet  (ποδας). Perfective use of κατα. Bold figure for making smooth and direct road. The Lord here is the Lord Jesus.Into the love of God  (εις την αγαπην του θεου). Either subjective or objective genitive makes sense and Lightfoot pleads for both, "not only as an objective attribute of deity, but as a ruling principle in our hearts," holding that it is "seldom possible to separate the one from the other." Most scholars take it here as subjective, the characteristic of God.Into the patience of Christ  (εις την υπομνην του Χριστου). There is the same ambiguity here, though the subjective idea, the patience shown by Christ, is the one usually accepted rather than "the patient waiting for Christ" (objective genitive).
