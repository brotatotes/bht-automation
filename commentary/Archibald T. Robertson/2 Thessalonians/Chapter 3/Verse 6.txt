<p><b> Now we command you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραγγελλομεν δε υμιν</span></span>). Paul puts into practice the confidence expressed on their obedience to his commands in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:4">2 Thessalonians 3:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ονοματ του κυριου Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span>) here for authority of Jesus Christ with which compare</p>
<p><b>through the Lord Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του κυριου Ιησου</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:2">1 Thessalonians 4:2</span>. For a full discussion of the phrase see the monograph of W. Heitmuller, <i>Im Namen Jesu</i>. Paul wishes his readers to realize the responsibility on them for their obedience to his command.</p>
<p><b>That ye withdraw yourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στελλεσθα υμας</span></span>). Present middle (direct) infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στελλω</span></span>, old verb to place, arrange, make compact or shorten as sails, to move oneself from or to withdraw oneself from (with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> and the ablative). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:20">2 Corinthians 8:20</span> the middle voice (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στελλομενο</span></span>) means taking care.</p>
<p><b>From every brother that walketh disorderly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο παντος αδελφου ατακτως περιπατουντος</span></span>). He calls him "brother" still. The adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατακτως</span></span> is common in Plato and is here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:11">2 Thessalonians 3:11</span> alone in the N.T., though the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατακτος</span></span>, equally common in Plato we had in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:14">1 Thessalonians 5:14</span> which see. Military term, out of ranks.</p>
<p><b>And not after the tradition </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μη κατα την παραδοσιν</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:15">2 Thessalonians 2:15</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδοσιν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Which they received of us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην παρελαβοσαν παρ ημων</span></span>). Westcott and Hort put this form of the verb (second aorist indicative third person plural of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαμβανω</span></span>, the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-οσαν</span></span> form instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ον</span></span>, with slight support from the papyri, but in the LXX and the Boeotian dialect, Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 335f.) in the margin with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρελαβετε</span></span> (ye received) in the text. There are five different readings of the verb here, the others being <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρελαβον, παρελαβε, ελαβοσαν</span></span>. </p>
