<p><b> How ye ought to imitate us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πως δε μιμεισθα ημας</span></span>). Literally, how it is necessary to imitate us. The infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμεισθα</span></span> is the old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμεομα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμος</span></span> (actor, mimic), but in N.T. only here (and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:9">2 Thessalonians 3:9</span>), <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7">Hebrews 13:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:11">3 John 1:11</span>. It is a daring thing to say, but Paul knew that he had to set the new Christians in the midst of Jews and Gentiles a model for their imitation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:17">Philippians 3:17</span>).</p>
<p><b>For we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ουκ ητακτησαμεν εν υμιν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατακτεω</span></span>, to be out of ranks of soldiers. Specific denial on Paul's part in contrast to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:6">2 Thessalonians 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>. </p>
