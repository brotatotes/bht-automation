<p><b> For nought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωρεαν</span></span>). Adverbial accusative, as a gift, gift-wise (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωρεα</span></span>, gift, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>). Same claim made to the Corinthians (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:7">2 Corinthians 11:7</span>), old word, in LXX, and papyri. He lodged with Jason, but did not receive his meals <i>gratis</i>, for he paid for them. Apparently he received no invitations to meals. Paul had to make his financial independence clear to avoid false charges which were made in spite of all his efforts. To eat bread is merely a Hebraism for eat (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:10">2 Thessalonians 3:10</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span> for labour and travail, and night and day (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυκτος κα ημερας</span></span>, genitive of time, by night and by day). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span> for rest of the verse in precisely the same words. </p>
