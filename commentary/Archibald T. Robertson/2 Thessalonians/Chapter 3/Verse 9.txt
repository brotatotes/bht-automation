 Not because we have not the right  (ουχ οτ ουκ εχομεν εξουσιαν). Paul is sensitive on hisright  to receive adequate support (1 Thessalonians 2:6; 1 Thessalonians 2:1 where he uses the same word εξουσιαν in the long defence of thisright , 1 Corinthians 9:1-27). So he here puts in this limitation to avoid misapprehension. He did allow churches to help him where he would not be misunderstood (2 Corinthians 11:7-11; Philippians 4:45). Paul uses ουχ οτ elsewhere to avoid misunderstanding (2 Corinthians 1:24; 2 Corinthians 3:5; Philippians 4:17).But to make ourselves an ensample unto you  (αλλ' ινα εαυτους τυπον δωμεν υμιν). Literally,but that we might give ourselves a type to you . Purpose with ινα and second aorist active subjunctive of διδωμ. On τυπον see on 1 Thessalonians 1:7.
