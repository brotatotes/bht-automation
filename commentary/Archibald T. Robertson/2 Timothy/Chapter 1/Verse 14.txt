<p><b> That good thing which was committed unto thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την καλην παραθηκην</span></span>). Simply, "the good deposit."</p>
<p><b>Guard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλαξον</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:20">1 Timothy 6:20</span>. God has also made an investment in Timothy (cf. verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>). Timothy must not let that fail.</p>
<p><b>Which dwelleth in us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ενοικουντος εν ημιν</span></span>). It is only through the Holy Spirit that Timothy or any of us can guard God's deposit with us. </p>
