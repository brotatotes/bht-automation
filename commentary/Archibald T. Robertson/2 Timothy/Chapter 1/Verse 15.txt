<p><b> Are turned away from me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστραφησαν με</span></span>). Second aorist passive (still transitive here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστρεφω</span></span>, for which verb see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:14">Titus 1:14</span>. For the accusative with these passive deponents see Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 484. It is not known to what incident Paul refers, whether the refusal of the Christians in the Roman province of Asia to help Paul on his arrest (or in response to an appeal from Rome) or whether the Asian Christians in Rome deserted Paul in the first stage of the trial (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:16">2 Timothy 4:16</span>). Two of these Asian deserters are mentioned by name, perhaps for reasons known to Timothy. Nothing else is known of Phygelus and Hermogenes except this shameful item. </p>
