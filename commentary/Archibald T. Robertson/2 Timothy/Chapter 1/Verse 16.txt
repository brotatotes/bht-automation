 Grant mercy  (δωιη ελεος). The phrase nowhere else in the N.T. Second aorist active optative of διδωμ, the usual form being δοιη. This is the usual construction in a wish about the future.Unto the house of Onesiphorus  (τω Ονησιφορου οικω). The same phrase in 2 Timothy 4:19. Apparently Onesiphorus is now dead as is implied by the wish in 2 Timothy 1:18.For he oft refreshed me  (οτ πολλακις με ανεψυξεν). First aorist active indicative of αναψυχω, old verb, to cool again, in LXX and Koine often, here only in N.T., but αναψυξις in Acts 3:20. In the first imprisonment or the second. If he lost his life for coming to see Paul, it was probably recently during this imprisonment.Was not ashamed of my chain  (αλυσιν μου ουκ επαισχυνθη). Passive deponent again (first aorist indicative) with accusative as in 2 Timothy 1:8. For αλυσιν (chain) see Ephesians 6:20. Note absence of augment in επαισχυνθη.
