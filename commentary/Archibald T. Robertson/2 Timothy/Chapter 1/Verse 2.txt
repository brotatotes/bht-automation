<p><b> Beloved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπητο</span></span>). Instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνησιω</span></span> (genuine) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2">1 Timothy 1:2</span>. He had already called Timothy <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπητον</span></span> (verbal adjective of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαω</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:17">1 Corinthians 4:17</span>, an incidental and strong proof that it is Paul who is writing here. This argument applies to each of the Pastorals for Paul is known by other sources (Acts and previous Pauline Epistles) to sustain precisely the affectionate relation toward Timothy and Titus shown in the Pastorals. </p>
