 Called us with a holy calling  (καλεσαντος κλησε αγια). Probably dative, "to a holy calling." Κλησις here apparently not the invitation, but the consecrated service, "the upward calling" (Philippians 3:14). See 1 Corinthians 7:20; Ephesians 4:1; Ephesians 4:4 for the use of καλεω with κλησις. Paul often uses καλεω of God's calling men (1 Thessalonians 2:12; 1 Corinthians 1:9; Galatians 1:6; Romans 8:20; Romans 9:11).Purpose  (προθεσιν). See Romans 9:11; Ephesians 1:11 for προθεσιν.Which was given  (την δοθεισαν). First aorist passive articular participle agreeing with χαρις (grace), a thoroughly Pauline expression (1 Corinthians 3:10; Romans 12:3; Romans 12:6, etc.), only here in Pastoral Epistles.Before times eternal  (προ χρονων αιωνιων). See Titus 1:2.
