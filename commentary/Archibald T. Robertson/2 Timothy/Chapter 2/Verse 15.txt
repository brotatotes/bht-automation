 Give diligence  (σπουδασον). First aorist active imperative of σπουδαζω, old word, as in 1 Thessalonians 2:17; Galatians 2:10.To present  (παραστησα). First aorist active infinitive of παριστημ as in Colossians 1:22; Colossians 1:28.Approved unto God  (δοκιμον τω θεω). Dative case θεω with δοκιμον, predicate accusative, old adjective (from δεχομα), for which see 1 Corinthians 11:19; 2 Corinthians 10:18.A workman  (εργατην). See 2 Corinthians 11:3; Philippians 3:2.That needeth not to be ashamed  (ανεπαισχυντον). Late double compound verbal adjective (α privative, επαισχυνω), in Josephus and here alone.Handling aright  (ορθοτομουντα). Present active participle of ορθοτομεω, late and rare compound (ορθοτομος), cutting straight, ορθος and τεμνω), here only in N.T. It occurs in Proverbs 3:6; Proverbs 11:5 for making straight paths (οδους) with which compare Hebrews 12:13 and "the Way" in Acts 9:2. Theodoret explains it to mean ploughing a straight furrow. Parry argues that the metaphor is the stone mason cutting the stones straight since τεμνω and ορθος are so used. Since Paul was a tent-maker and knew how to cut straight the rough camel-hair cloth, why not let that be the metaphor? Certainly plenty of exegesis is crooked enough (crazy-quilt patterns) to call for careful cutting to set it straight.
