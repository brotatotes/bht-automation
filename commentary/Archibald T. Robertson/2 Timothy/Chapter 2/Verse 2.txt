<p><b> From me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ' εμου</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:13">2 Timothy 1:13</span>. Paul was Timothy's chief teacher of Christ.</p>
<p><b>Among many witnesses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια πολλων μαρτυρων</span></span>). Plutarch has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> in this sense and Field (<i>Ot. Norv.</i>) suggests that it is a legal phrase "supported by many witnesses." Not mere spectators, but testifiers. See Paul's use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:2">1 Thessalonians 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:4">2 Corinthians 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:27">Romans 2:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:20">Romans 14:20</span>. Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:1-8">1 Corinthians 15:1-8</span> gives many witnesses of the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p><b>Commit thou </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραθου</span></span>). Second aorist middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρατιθημ</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>) to deposit, same metaphor as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραθηκη</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:14">2 Timothy 1:14</span>. "Deposit thou."</p>
<p><b>Faithful </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστοις</span></span>). "Trustworthy," "reliable," as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:12">1 Timothy 1:12</span> of Paul himself.</p>
<p><b>Able </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικανο</span></span>). Capable, qualified, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:9">1 Corinthians 15:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:16">2 Corinthians 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:5">2 Corinthians 3:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>Others also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ετερους</span></span>). Not necessarily "different," but "others in addition." This is the way to pass on the torch of the light of the knowledge of God in Christ. Paul taught Timothy who will teach others who will teach still others, an endless chain of teacher-training and gospel propaganda. </p>
