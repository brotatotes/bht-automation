<p><b> They may recover themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανανηψωσιν</span></span>). First aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανανηφω</span></span>, late and rare word, to be sober again, only here in N.T., though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηφω</span></span> is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:6">1 Thessalonians 5:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>Out of the snare of the devil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ της του διαβολου παγιδος</span></span>). They have been caught while mentally intoxicated in the devil's snare (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:7">1 Timothy 3:7</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:9">Romans 11:9</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παγις</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Taken captive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζωγρημενο</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωγρεω</span></span>, old verb, to take alive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωοσ, αγρεω</span></span>), in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:10">Luke 5:10</span> (of Peter). "Taken captive alive."</p>
<p><b>By him unto his will </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπ' αυτου εις το εκεινου θελημα</span></span>). This difficult phrase is understood variously. One way is to take both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινου</span></span>, to refer to the devil. Another way is to take both of them to refer to God. Another way is to take <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> of the devil and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινου</span></span>, of God. This is probably best, "taken captive by the devil" "that they may come back to soberness to do the will of God." There are difficulties in either view. </p>
