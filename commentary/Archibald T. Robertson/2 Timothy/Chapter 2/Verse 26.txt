 They may recover themselves  (ανανηψωσιν). First aorist active subjunctive of ανανηφω, late and rare word, to be sober again, only here in N.T., though νηφω is in 1 Thessalonians 5:6.Out of the snare of the devil  (εκ της του διαβολου παγιδος). They have been caught while mentally intoxicated in the devil's snare (1 Timothy 3:7). See Romans 11:9 for παγις.Taken captive  (εζωγρημενο). Perfect passive participle of ζωγρεω, old verb, to take alive (ζωοσ, αγρεω), in N.T. only here and Luke 5:10 (of Peter). "Taken captive alive."By him unto his will  (υπ' αυτου εις το εκεινου θελημα). This difficult phrase is understood variously. One way is to take both αυτου and εκεινου, to refer to the devil. Another way is to take both of them to refer to God. Another way is to take αυτου of the devil and εκεινου, of God. This is probably best, "taken captive by the devil" "that they may come back to soberness to do the will of God." There are difficulties in either view.
