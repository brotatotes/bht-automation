<p><b> Suffer hardship with me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνκακοπαθησον</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:8">2 Timothy 1:8</span> for this verb. The old preacher challenges the young one to share hardship with him for Christ.</p>
<p><b>As a good soldier </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος καλος στρατιωτης</span></span>). Paul does not hesitate to use this military metaphor (this word only here for a servant of Christ) with which he is so familiar. He had already used the metaphor in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:7">1 Corinthians 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:3">2 Corinthians 10:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</span> he called Epaphroditus "my fellow-soldier" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνστρατιωτην μου</span></span>) as he did Archippus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:2">Philemon 1:2</span>. </p>
