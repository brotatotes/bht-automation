<p><b> That would live godly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θελοντες ζηιν ευσεβως</span></span>). "Those who desire (will, determine) to live godly." Paul does not regard his experience as peculiar, but only part of the price of loyal service to Christ.</p>
<p><b>Shall suffer persecution </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωχθησοντα</span></span>). Future passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωκω</span></span>, "shall be persecuted" (shall be hunted as wild beasts). </p>
