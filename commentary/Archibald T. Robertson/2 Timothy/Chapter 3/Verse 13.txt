<p><b> Impostors </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γοητες</span></span>). Old word from wailers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γοαω</span></span>, to bewail), professional mourners, deceivers, jugglers. Here only in the N.T. Modern impostors know all the tricks of the trade.</p>
<p><b>Shall wax worse and worse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκοψουσιν επ το χειρον</span></span>). "Shall cut forward to the worse stage." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:16">2 Timothy 2:16</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκοπτω</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χειρον</span></span> is comparative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακος</span></span>, "to the worse than now."</p>
<p><b>Deceiving and being deceived </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλανωντες κα πλανωμενο</span></span>). Present active and present passive participles of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλαναω</span></span>. The tragedy of it all is that these seducers are able to deceive others as well as themselves. </p>
