 Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable  (πασα γραφη θεοπνευστος κα ωφελιμος). There are two matters of doubt in this clause. One is the absence of the article η before γραφη, whether that makes it mean "every scripture" or "all scripture" as of necessity if present. Unfortunately, there are examples both ways with both πας and γραφη. Twice we find γραφη in the singular without the article and yet definite (1 Peter 2:6; 2 Peter 1:20). We have πας Ισραηλ (Romans 11:26) for all Israel (Robertson, Grammar, p. 772). So far as the grammatical usage goes, one can render here either "all scripture" or "every scripture." There is no copula (εστιν) in the Greek and so one has to insert it either before the κα or after it. If before, as is more natural, then the meaning is: "All scripture (or every scripture) is inspired of God and profitable." In this form there is a definite assertion of inspiration. That can be true also of the second way, making "inspired of God" descriptive of "every scripture," and putting εστιν (is) after κα: "All scripture (or every scripture), inspired of God, is also profitable."Inspired of God  (θεοπνευστος). "God-breathed." Late word (Plutarch) here only in N.T. Perhaps in contrast to the commandments of men in Titus 1:14.Profitable  (ωφελιμος). See 1 Timothy 4:8. See Romans 15:4. Four examples of προς (facing, with a view to, for): διδασκαλιαν, teaching; ελεγμον, reproof, in LXX and here only in N.T.; επανορθωσιν, correction, old word, from επανορθοω, to set up straight in addition, here only in N.T., with which compare επιδιορθοω in Titus 1:5; παιδειαν, instruction, with which compare Ephesians 6:4.
