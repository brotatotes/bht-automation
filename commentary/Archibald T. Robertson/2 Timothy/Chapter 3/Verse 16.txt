<p><b> Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασα γραφη θεοπνευστος κα ωφελιμος</span></span>). There are two matters of doubt in this clause. One is the absence of the article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span> before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφη</span></span>, whether that makes it mean "every scripture" or "all scripture" as of necessity if present. Unfortunately, there are examples both ways with both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πας</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφη</span></span>. Twice we find <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφη</span></span> in the singular without the article and yet definite (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:6">1 Peter 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:20">2 Peter 1:20</span>). We have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πας Ισραηλ</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:26">Romans 11:26</span>) for all Israel (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 772). So far as the grammatical usage goes, one can render here either "all scripture" or "every scripture." There is no copula (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span>) in the Greek and so one has to insert it either before the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> or after it. If before, as is more natural, then the meaning is: "All scripture (or every scripture) is inspired of God and profitable." In this form there is a definite assertion of inspiration. That can be true also of the second way, making "inspired of God" descriptive of "every scripture," and putting <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> (is) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>: "All scripture (or every scripture), inspired of God, is also profitable."</p>
<p><b>Inspired of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεοπνευστος</span></span>). "God-breathed." Late word (Plutarch) here only in N.T. Perhaps in contrast to the commandments of men in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:14">Titus 1:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Profitable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφελιμος</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:8">1 Timothy 4:8</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:4">Romans 15:4</span>. Four examples of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> (facing, with a view to, for): <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκαλιαν</span></span>, teaching; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγμον</span></span>, reproof, in LXX and here only in N.T.; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επανορθωσιν</span></span>, correction, old word, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επανορθοω</span></span>, to set up straight in addition, here only in N.T., with which compare <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιδιορθοω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span>; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδειαν</span></span>, instruction, with which compare <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:4">Ephesians 6:4</span>. </p>
