<p><b> That creep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ενδυνοντες</span></span>). Old and common verb (also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδυω</span></span>) either to put on (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:8">1 Thessalonians 5:8</span>) or to enter (to slip in by insinuation, as here). See same idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεισεδυησαν</span></span>), <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεισαξουσιν</span></span>), <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:4">Galatians 2:4</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεισηλθον</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεισακτους</span></span>). These stealthy "creepers" are pictured also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:11">Titus 1:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>Take captive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιχμαλωτιζοντες</span></span>). "Taking captive." Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιχμαλωτιζω</span></span>, for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:5">2 Corinthians 10:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span>.</p>
<p><b>Silly women </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυναικαρια</span></span>). Literally, "little women" (diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυνη</span></span>), found in Diocles (comedian of 5 century B.C.) and in Epictetus. The word here is neuter (grammatical gender) plural. Used contemptuously here (only N.T. example). Ramsay suggests "society ladies." It is amazing how gullible some women are with religious charlatans who pose as exponents of "new thought."</p>
<p><b>Laden with sins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεσωρευμενα αμαρτιαις</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωρευω</span></span>, old word from Aristotle down (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωρος</span></span>, a heap) to heap up. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:20">Romans 12:20</span>. Associative instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιαις</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Divers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποικιλαις</span></span>). Many coloured. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:3">Titus 3:3</span>. One has only to recall Schweinfurth, the false Messiah of forty odd years ago with his "heavenly harem" in Illinois and the recent infamous "House of David" in Michigan to understand how these Gnostic cults led women into licentiousness under the guise of religion or of liberty. The priestesses of Aphrodite and of Isis were illustrations ready to hand. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αγομενα</span></span> (present passive participle) means "continually led astray or from time to time." </p>
