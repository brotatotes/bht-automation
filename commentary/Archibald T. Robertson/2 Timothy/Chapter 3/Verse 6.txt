 That creep  (ο ενδυνοντες). Old and common verb (also ενδυω) either to put on (1 Thessalonians 5:8) or to enter (to slip in by insinuation, as here). See same idea in Jude 1:4 (παρεισεδυησαν), 2 Peter 2:1 (παρεισαξουσιν), Galatians 2:4 (παρεισηλθον and παρεισακτους). These stealthy "creepers" are pictured also in Titus 1:11.Take captive  (αιχμαλωτιζοντες). "Taking captive." Present active participle of αιχμαλωτιζω, for which see 2 Corinthians 10:5; Romans 7:23.Silly women  (γυναικαρια). Literally, "little women" (diminutive of γυνη), found in Diocles (comedian of 5 century B.C.) and in Epictetus. The word here is neuter (grammatical gender) plural. Used contemptuously here (only N.T. example). Ramsay suggests "society ladies." It is amazing how gullible some women are with religious charlatans who pose as exponents of "new thought."Laden with sins  (σεσωρευμενα αμαρτιαις). Perfect passive participle of σωρευω, old word from Aristotle down (from σωρος, a heap) to heap up. In N.T. only here and Romans 12:20. Associative instrumental case αμαρτιαις.Divers  (ποικιλαις). Many coloured. See Titus 3:3. One has only to recall Schweinfurth, the false Messiah of forty odd years ago with his "heavenly harem" in Illinois and the recent infamous "House of David" in Michigan to understand how these Gnostic cults led women into licentiousness under the guise of religion or of liberty. The priestesses of Aphrodite and of Isis were illustrations ready to hand. Αγομενα (present passive participle) means "continually led astray or from time to time."
