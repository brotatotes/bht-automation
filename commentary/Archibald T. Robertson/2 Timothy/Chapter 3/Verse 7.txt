<p><b> Never able to come to the knowledge of the truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεποτε εις επιγνωσιν αληθειας ελθειν δυναμενα</span></span>). Pathetic picture of these hypnotized women without intellectual power to cut through the fog of words and, though always learning scraps of things, they never come into the full knowledge (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγνωσιν</span></span>) of the truth in Christ. And yet they even pride themselves on belonging to the intelligentsia! </p>
