<p><b> Forsook me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με εγκατελειπεν</span></span>). Imperfect (MSS. also have aorist, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγκατελιπεν</span></span>) active of the old double compound verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγκαταλειπω</span></span>, for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:29">Romans 9:29</span>. Clearly in contrast to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:9">2 Timothy 4:9</span> and in the sense of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:17">1 Timothy 6:17</span>, wilful desertion. Only mentioned elsewhere in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:14">Colossians 4:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Crescens </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κρησκης</span></span>). No other mention of him.</p>
<p><b>Titus to Dalmatia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τιτος εις Δαλματιαν</span></span>). Titus had been asked to rejoin Paul in Nicopolis where he was to winter, probably the winter previous to this one (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:12">Titus 3:12</span>). He came and has been with Paul. </p>
