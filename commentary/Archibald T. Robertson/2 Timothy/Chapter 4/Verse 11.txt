 Only Luke is with me  (Λουκας εστιν μονος μετ' εμου). Luke is with Paul now in Rome as during the first Roman imprisonment (Philemon 1:24; Colossians 4:14).Take Mark  (Μαρκον αναλαβων). Second aorist active participle of αναλαμβανω, old verb, to pick up, as in Ephesians 6:13; Ephesians 6:16. "Pick up Mark."He is useful to me  (εστιν μο ευχρηστος). See 2 Timothy 2:21 for ευχρηστος. Paul had long ago changed his opinion of Mark (Colossians 4:10) because Mark had changed his conduct and had made good in his ministry. Now Paul longs to have the man that he once scornfully rejected (Acts 15:37).
