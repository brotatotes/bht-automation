<p><b> Only Luke is with me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λουκας εστιν μονος μετ' εμου</span></span>). Luke is with Paul now in Rome as during the first Roman imprisonment (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:24">Philemon 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:14">Colossians 4:14</span>).</p>
<p><b>Take Mark </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μαρκον αναλαβων</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναλαμβανω</span></span>, old verb, to pick up, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:16">Ephesians 6:16</span>. "Pick up Mark."</p>
<p><b>He is useful to me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν μο ευχρηστος</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:21">2 Timothy 2:21</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχρηστος</span></span>. Paul had long ago changed his opinion of Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>) because Mark had changed his conduct and had made good in his ministry. Now Paul longs to have the man that he once scornfully rejected (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:37">Acts 15:37</span>). </p>
