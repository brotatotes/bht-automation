 The cloke  (την φελονην). More common form φειλονη. By metathesis for φαινολη, Latin paenula, though which language transliterated the word into the other is not known. The meaning is also uncertain, though probably "cloke" as there are so many papyri examples in that sense (Moulton and Milligan, Vocabulary). Milligan (N.T. Documents, p. 20) had previously urged "book wrap" as probable but he changed his mind and rightly so.With Carpus  (παρα Καρπω). "Beside Carpus," at his house. Not mentioned elsewhere. Probably a visit to Troas after Paul's return from Crete.The books  (τα βιβλια). Probably papyrus rolls. One can only guess what rolls the old preacher longs to have with him, probably copies of Old Testament books, possibly copies of his own letters, and other books used and loved. The old preacher can be happy with his books.Especially the parchments  (μαλιστα τας μεμβρανας). Latin membrana. The dressed skins were first made at Pergamum and so termed "parchments." These in particular would likely be copies of Old Testament books, parchment being more expensive than papyrus, possibly even copies of Christ's sayings (Luke 1:1-4). We recall that in Acts 26:24 Festus referred to Paul's learning (τα γραμματα). He would not waste his time in prison.
