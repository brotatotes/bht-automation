 Alexander the coppersmith  (Αλεξανδρος ο χαλκευς). Old word, only here in N.T., for metal-worker (copper, iron, gold, etc.). Possibly the one in 2 Timothy 1:20, but not the one in Acts 19:33 unless he afterwards became a Christian.Did me much evil  (μο κακα ενεδειξατο). Evidently he had some personal dislike towards Paul and possibly also he was a Gnostic.Will render  (αποδωσε). Future active of the same verb used in verse 2 Timothy 4:8, but with a very different atmosphere.
