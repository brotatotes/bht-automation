<p><b> Alexander the coppersmith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αλεξανδρος ο χαλκευς</span></span>). Old word, only here in N.T., for metal-worker (copper, iron, gold, etc.). Possibly the one in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:20">2 Timothy 1:20</span>, but not the one in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:33">Acts 19:33</span> unless he afterwards became a Christian.</p>
<p><b>Did me much evil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μο κακα ενεδειξατο</span></span>). Evidently he had some personal dislike towards Paul and possibly also he was a Gnostic.</p>
<p><b>Will render </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδωσε</span></span>). Future active of the same verb used in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>, but with a very different atmosphere. </p>
