<p><b> I have fought the good fight </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον καλον αγωνα ηγωνισμα</span></span>). Perfect middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγωνιζομα</span></span>, a favourite figure with Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:25">1 Corinthians 9:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:29">Colossians 1:29</span>), with the cognate accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγωνα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:27">Philippians 1:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:30">Philippians 1:30</span>, etc.). The "fight" is the athletic contest of his struggle for Christ.</p>
<p><b>I have finished the course </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον δρομον τετελεκα</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελεω</span></span>. He had used this metaphor also of himself to the elders at Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span>). Then the "course" was ahead of him. Now it is behind him.</p>
<p><b>I have kept the faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την πιστιν τετηρηκα</span></span>). Perfect active indicative again of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρεω</span></span>. Paul has not deserted. He has kept faith with Christ. For this phrase, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:12">Revelation 14:12</span>. Deissmann (<i>Light, etc.</i>, p. 309) gives inscriptions in Ephesus of a man who says: "I have kept faith" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την πιστιν ετηρησα</span></span>) and another of a man of whom it is said: "He fought three fights, and twice was crowned." </p>
