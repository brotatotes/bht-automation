 I have fought the good fight  (τον καλον αγωνα ηγωνισμα). Perfect middle indicative of αγωνιζομα, a favourite figure with Paul (1 Corinthians 9:25; Colossians 1:29), with the cognate accusative αγωνα (Philippians 1:27; Philippians 1:30, etc.). The "fight" is the athletic contest of his struggle for Christ.I have finished the course  (τον δρομον τετελεκα). Perfect active indicative of τελεω. He had used this metaphor also of himself to the elders at Ephesus (Acts 20:24). Then the "course" was ahead of him. Now it is behind him.I have kept the faith  (την πιστιν τετηρηκα). Perfect active indicative again of τηρεω. Paul has not deserted. He has kept faith with Christ. For this phrase, see Revelation 14:12. Deissmann (Light, etc., p. 309) gives inscriptions in Ephesus of a man who says: "I have kept faith" (την πιστιν ετηρησα) and another of a man of whom it is said: "He fought three fights, and twice was crowned."
