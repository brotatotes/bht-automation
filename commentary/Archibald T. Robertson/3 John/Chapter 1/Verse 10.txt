<p><b> If I come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ελθω</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>. He hopes to come (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:14">3 John 1:14</span>), as he had said in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:12">2 John 1:12</span> (one argument for identifying II John with the letter in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:9">3 John 1:9</span>).</p>
<p><b>I will bring to remembrance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπομνησω</span></span>). Future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπομιμνησκω</span></span>, old compound (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:12">2 Peter 1:12</span>). The aged apostle is not afraid of Diotrephes and here defies him.</p>
<p><b>Which he doeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α ποιε</span></span>). Present active indicative, "which he keeps on doing."</p>
<p><b>Prating against us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φλυαρων ημας</span></span>). Present active participle of old verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φλυαρος</span></span>, babbling <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:13">1 Timothy 5:13</span>), to accuse idly and so falsely, here only in N.T. with accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημας</span></span> (us).</p>
<p><b>With wicked words </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογοις πονηροις</span></span>). Instrumental case. Not simply foolish chatter, but malevolent words.</p>
<p><b>Not content </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη αρκουμενος</span></span>). Present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρκεω</span></span> with usual negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>. For this verb in this sense see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:8">1 Timothy 6:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:5">Hebrews 13:5</span>, only there <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> is absent. John knows that the conduct of Diotrephes will not stand the light. See Paul's threats of exposure (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:21">1 Corinthians 4:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:11">2 Corinthians 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1-3">2 Corinthians 13:1-3</span>). And John is the apostle of love all the same.</p>
<p><b>He himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος</span></span>). That was bad enough.</p>
<p><b>Them that would </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους βουλομενους</span></span>). "Those willing or wishing or receive the brethren" from John.</p>
<p><b>He forbiddeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωλυε</span></span>). "He hinders." Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωλυω</span></span> and means either actual success in one case (punctiliar use of the present indicative) or repetition in several instances (linear action) or conative action attempted, but not successful as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:14">Matthew 3:14</span> (this same verb) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:32">John 10:32</span>.</p>
<p><b>Casteth them out of the church </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ της εκκλησιας εκβαλλε</span></span>). Here again <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλλε</span></span> can be understood in various ways, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωλυε</span></span>. This verb occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:15">John 2:15</span> for casting out of the temple the profaners of it and for casting the blind man out of the synagogue (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:34">John 9:34</span>). If this ancient "church-boss" did not succeed in expelling John's adherents from the church, he certainly tried to do it. </p>
