<p><b> For the sake of the Name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ του ονοματος</span></span>). The name of Jesus. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:4">Acts 5:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5">Romans 1:5</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ του ονοματος</span></span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:7">James 2:7</span> for the absolute use of "the name" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:16">1 Peter 4:16</span>. "This name is in essence the sum of the Christian creed" (Westcott) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:9">Romans 10:9</span>. It is like the absolute use of "the Way" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:2">Acts 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:9">Acts 19:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:23">Acts 19:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:22">Acts 24:22</span>).</p>
<p><b>Taking nothing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν λαμβανοντες</span></span>). Present active participle with the usual negative with participles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:4">1 John 2:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>Of the Gentiles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο των εθνικων</span></span>). Instead of the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνων</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:32">Luke 2:32</span>), late adjective for what is peculiar to a people (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνος</span></span>) and then for the people themselves (Polybius, Diodorus, not in LXX), in N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:47">Matthew 5:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:7">Matthew 6:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:17">Matthew 18:17</span>. Like our heathen, pagan. John is anxious that Christian missionaries receive nothing from the heathen, as our missionaries have to watch against the charge of being after money. There were many travelling lecturers out for money. Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:1">3 John 1:1</span> defends the right of preachers to pay, but refuses himself to accept it from Corinth because it would be misunderstood (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:6">1 Thessalonians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:16">2 Corinthians 12:16</span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> here as in collecting taxes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:25">Matthew 17:25</span>) rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>, which may be suggestive. </p>
