<p><b> I wrote somewhat unto the church </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγραψα τ τη εκκλησια</span></span>). A few MSS. add <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> to indicate that he had not written (conclusion of second-class condition), clearly spurious. Not epistolary aorist nor a reference to II John as Findlay holds, but an allusion to a brief letter of commendation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:27">Acts 18:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:1">2 Corinthians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>) sent along with the brethren in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:5-7">3 John 1:5-7</span> or to some other itinerant brethren. Westcott wrongly thinks that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span> is never used of anything important in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:9">Acts 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:3">Galatians 6:3</span>), and hence that this lost letter was unimportant. It may have been brief and a mere introduction. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διοτρεφες</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρεφω</span></span>, nourished by Zeus). This ambitious leader and sympathiser with the Gnostics would probably prevent the letter referred to being read to the church, whether it was II John condemning the Gnostics or another letter commending Demetrius and John's missionaries. Hence he sends Gaius this personal letter warning against Diotrephes.</p>
<p><b>Who loveth to have the preeminence among them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο φιλοπρωτευων αυτων</span></span>). Present active articular participle of a late verb, so far found only here and in ecclesiastical writers (the example cited by Blass being an error, Deissmann, <i>Light</i> etc., p. 76), from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλοπρωτος</span></span>, fond of being first (Plutarch), and made like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλοπονεω</span></span> (papyri), to be fond of toil. This ambition of Diotrephes does not prove that he was a bishop over elders, as was true in the second century (as Ignatius shows). He may have been an elder (bishop) or deacon, but clearly desired to rule the whole church. Some forty years ago I wrote an article on Diotrephes for a denominational paper. The editor told me that twenty-five deacons stopped the paper to show their resentment against being personally attacked in the paper.</p>
<p><b>Receiveth us not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ επιδεχετα ημας</span></span>). Present active indicative of this old compound, in N.T. only here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:10">3 John 1:10</span>. Diotrephes refused to accept John's authority or those who sided with him, John's missionaries or delegates (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:40">Matthew 10:40</span>). </p>
