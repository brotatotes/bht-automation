<p><i>The Title</i> is simply <i>Acts</i> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πραξεις</span></span>) in Aleph, Origen, Tertullian, Didymus, Hilary, Eusebius, Epiphanius. <i>The Acts of the Apostles</i> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πραξεις αποστολων</span></span>) is the reading of B D (Aleph in subscription) Athanasius, Origen, Tertullian, Cyprian, Eusebius, Cyril of Jerusalem, Theodoret, Hilary. <i>The Acts of the Holy Apostles</i> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πραξεις των αγιων αποστολων</span></span>) is read by A2 E G H A K Chrysostom. It is possible that the book was given no title at all by Luke, for it is plain that usage varied greatly even in the same writers. The long title as found in the Textus Receptus (Authorized Version) is undoubtedly wrong with the adjective "Holy." The reading of B D, "<i>The Acts of the Apostles</i>," may be accepted as probably correct. </p>
<p><b> The former treatise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον μεν πρωτον</span></span>). Literally, the first treatise. The use of the superlative is common enough and by no means implies, though it allows, a third volume. This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτος</span></span> where only two are compared is seen between the Baptist and Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span>), John and Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:4">John 20:4</span>). The idiom is common in the papyri (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 662, 669). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν σολιταριυμ</span></span> here, as Hackett notes, is common in Acts. It is by no means true that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν</span></span> requires a following <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> by contrast. The word is merely a weakened form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μην</span></span>=surely, indeed. The reference is to the "first treatise" and merely emphasizes that. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span> (word) for treatise or historical narrative is common in ancient Greek as in Herodotus 6 and 9. Plato (<i>Phaedo</i>, p. 61 B) makes a contrast between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυθος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>I made </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποιησαμην</span></span>). Aorist middle indicative, the middle being the usual construction for mental acts with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>O Theophilus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ο Θεοφιλε</span></span>). The interjection <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ο</span></span> here as is common, though not in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:3">Luke 1:3</span>. But the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατιστε</span></span> (most excellent) is wanting here. See remarks on Theophilus on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:3">Luke 1:3</span>. Hackett thinks that he lived at Rome because of the way Acts ends. He was a man of rank. He may have defrayed the expense of publishing both Luke and Acts. Perhaps by this time Luke may have reached a less ceremonious acquaintance with Theophilus.</p>
<p><b>Which Jesus began </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων ηρξατο Ιησους</span></span>). The relative is attracted from the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> to the genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span> because of the antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντων</span></span> (all). The language of Luke here is not merely pleonastic as Winer held. Jesus "began" "both to do and to teach" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιειν τε κα διδασκειν</span></span>). Note present infinitives, linear action, still going on, and the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε--κα</span></span> binds together the life and teachings of Jesus, as if to say that Jesus is still carrying on from heaven the work and teaching of the disciples which he started while on earth before his ascension. The record which Luke now records is really the Acts of Jesus as much as the Acts of the Apostles. Dr. A. T. Pierson called it "The Acts of the Holy Spirit," and that is true also. The Acts, according to Luke, is a continuation of the doings and teachings of Jesus. "The following writings appear intended to give us, and do, in fact, profess to give us, that which Jesus <i>continued</i> to do and teach after the day in which he was taken up" (Bernard, <i>Progress of Doctrine in the N.T.</i>). </p>
