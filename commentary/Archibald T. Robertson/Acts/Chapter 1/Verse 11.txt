<p><b> Who also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κα</span></span>). Common use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> pleonastic to show that the two events were parallel. This is the simplest way from Homer on to narrate two parallel events.</p>
<p><b>Why? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span>). Jesus had told them of his coming Ascension (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:62">John 6:62</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:17">John 20:17</span>) so that they should have been prepared.</p>
<p><b>This Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος ο Ιησους</span></span>). <i>Qui vobis fuit eritque semper Jesus, id est, Salvator</i> (Corn. a Lapide). The personal name assures them that Jesus will always be in heaven a personal friend and divine Saviour (Knowling).</p>
<p><b>So in like manner </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως ον τροπον</span></span>). Same idea twice. "So in which manner" (incorporation of antecedent and accusative of general reference). The fact of his second coming and the manner of it also described by this emphatic repetition. </p>
