<p><b> Olivet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ελαιωνος</span></span>). Genitive singular. Vulgate <i>Olivetum</i>. Made like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμπελων</span></span>. Here only in the N.T., usually <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ορος των Ελαιων</span></span> (the Mount of Olives), though some MSS. have Olivet in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:29">Luke 19:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:37">Luke 21:37</span>. Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. VII. 9, 2) has it also and the papyri (Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 170).</p>
<p><b>A sabbath day's journey off </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σαββατου εχων οδον</span></span>). Luke only says here that Olivet is a Sabbath day's journey from Jerusalem, not that Jesus was precisely that distance when he ascended. In the Gospel Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:50">Acts 24:50</span>) states that Jesus led them "over against" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως προς</span></span>) Bethany (about two miles or fifteen furlongs). The top of Olivet is six furlongs or three-fourths of a mile. The Greek idiom here is "having a journey of a Sabbath" after "which is nigh unto Jerusalem" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εστιν εγγυς Ιερουσαλημ</span></span>), note the periphrastic construction. Why Luke mentions this item for Gentile readers in this form is not known, unless it was in his Jewish source. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:29">Exodus 16:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+35:5">Numbers 35:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jos+3:4">Joshua 3:4</span>. But it does not contradict what he says in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:50">Luke 24:50</span>, where he does not say that Jesus led them all the way to Bethany. </p>
