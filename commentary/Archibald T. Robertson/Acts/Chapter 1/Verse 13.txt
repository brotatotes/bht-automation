<p><b> Into the upper chamber </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το υπερωιον</span></span>). The upstairs or upper room (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> is upper or over, the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερωιος</span></span>), the room upstairs where the women staid in Homer, then a room up under the flat roof for retirement or prayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:37">Acts 9:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:39">Acts 9:39</span>), sometimes a large third story room suitable for gatherings (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:9">Acts 20:9</span>). It is possible, even probable, that this is the "large upper room" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανωγεον μεγα</span></span>) of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:15">Mark 14:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:12">Luke 22:12</span>. The Vulgate has <i>coenaculum</i> for both words. The word is used in the N.T. only in Acts. It was in a private house as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:11">Luke 22:11</span> and not in the temple as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:53">Luke 24:53</span> might imply, "continually" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια παντος</span></span>) these words probably meaning on proper occasions.</p>
<p><b>They were abiding </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν καταμενοντες</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect active. Perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>, to abide permanently. It is possible that this is the house of Mary the mother of John Mark where the disciples later met for prayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:12">Acts 12:12</span>). Here alone in the N.T., though old compound. Some MSS. here read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραμενοντες</span></span>. This could mean constant residence, but most likely frequent resort for prayer during these days, some being on hand all the time as they came and went.</p>
<p><b>Simon the Zealot </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σιμον ο Ζηλωτης</span></span>). Called Simon the Cananaean (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Χαναναιος</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:4">Matthew 10:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:18">Mark 3:18</span>, but Zealot in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:16">Luke 6:16</span> as here giving the Greek equivalent of the Aramaic word because Luke has Gentiles in mind. The epithet (member of the party of Zealots) clung to him after he became an apostle and distinguishes him from Simon Peter. See Vol. I on the Gospel of Matthew for discussion of the four lists of the apostles.</p>
<p><b>Judas the son of James </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Jουδας Ιακωβου</span></span>). Literally, Judas of James, whether son or brother (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:1">Jude 1:1</span>) we do not really know. "Of James" is added to distinguish him from Judas Iscariot (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:22">John 14:22</span>). However we take it, he must be identified with the Thaddaeus (=Lebbaeus) of Mark and Matthew to make the list in the third group identical. No name appears in Acts for that of Judas Iscariot. </p>
