<p><b> Brethren </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανδρες αδελφο</span></span>). Literally, men, brethren or brother men. More dignified and respectful than just "brethren." Demosthenes sometimes said <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ανδρες Αθηναιο</span></span>. Cf. our "gentlemen and fellow-citizens." Women are included in this address though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανδρες</span></span> refers only to men.</p>
<p><b>It was needful </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδε</span></span>). Imperfect tense of the impersonal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> with the infinitive clause (first aorist passive) and the accusative of general reference as a loose subject. Peter here assumes that Jesus is the Messiah and finds scripture illustrative of the treachery of Judas. He applies it to Judas and quotes the two passages in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:20">Acts 1:20</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:25">Psalms 69:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+109:8">Psalms 109:8</span>). The Holy Spirit has not yet come upon them, but Peter feels moved to interpret the situation. He feels that his mind is opened by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:45">Luke 24:45</span>). It is a logical, not a moral, necessity that Peter points out. Peter here claims the Holy Spirit as speaking in the scriptures as he does in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:21">2 Peter 1:21</span>. His description of Judas as "guide" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδηγου</span></span>) to those who seized (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συλλαβουσιν</span></span>) Jesus is that of the base traitor that he was. This very verb occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:54">Luke 22:54</span> of the arrest of Jesus. </p>
