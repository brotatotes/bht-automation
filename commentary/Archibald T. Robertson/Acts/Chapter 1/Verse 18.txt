<p><b> Now this man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hουτος μεν ουν</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν ουν</span></span> again without a corresponding <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:6">Acts 1:6</span>. Verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:18">Acts 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:19">Acts 1:19</span> are a long parenthesis of Luke by way of explanation of the fate of Judas. In verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:20">Acts 1:20</span> Peter resumes and quotes the scripture to which he referred in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:16">Acts 1:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>Obtained </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτησατο</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κταομα</span></span>, to acquire, only in the middle, to get for oneself. With the covenant money for the betrayal, acquired it indirectly apparently according to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:14-16">Matthew 26:14-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:3-8">Matthew 27:3-8</span> which see.</p>
<p><b>Falling headlong </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρηνης γενομενος</span></span>). Attic form usually <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρανης</span></span>. The word means, not "headlong," but "flat on the face" as opposed to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπτιος</span></span> on the back (Hackett). Hackett observes that the place suits admirably the idea that Judas hung himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:5">Matthew 27:5</span>) and, the rope breaking, fell flat on his face and</p>
<p><b>burst asunder in the midst </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελακησεν μεσος</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λασκω</span></span> old verb (here only in the N.T.), to clang, to crack, to crash, like a falling tree. Aristophanes uses it of crashing bones. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μεσος</span></span> is predicate nominative referring to Judas.</p>
<p><b>Gushed out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεχυθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκχεω</span></span>, to pour out. </p>
