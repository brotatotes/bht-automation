<p><b> Until the day in which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ ης ημερας</span></span>). Incorporation of the antecedent into the relative clause and the change of case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span> (locative) to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ης</span></span> (genitive).</p>
<p><b>Was received up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανελημπθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναλαμβανω</span></span>. Common verb to lift anything up (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:16">Acts 10:16</span>) or person as Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:13">Acts 20:13</span>). Several times of the Ascension of Jesus to heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:19">Mark 16:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:2">Acts 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:11">Acts 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>) with or without "into heaven" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον ουρανον</span></span>). This same verb is used of Elijah's translation to heaven in the LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+2:11">2 Kings 2:11</span>). The same idea, though not this word, is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:51">Luke 24:51</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναλημψις</span></span> of the Ascension.</p>
<p><b>Had given commandment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντειλαμενος</span></span>). First aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντελλω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελλω</span></span>, to accomplish), usually in the middle, old verb, to enjoin. This special commandment refers directly to what we call the commission given the apostles before Christ ascended on high (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:21-23">John 20:21-23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:16-20">Matthew 28:16-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15-18">Mark 16:15-18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:6">1 Corinthians 15:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:44-49">Luke 24:44-49</span>). He had given commands to them when they were first chosen and when they were sent out on the tour of Galilee, but the immediate reference is as above.</p>
<p><b>Through the Holy Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια πνευματος αγιου</span></span>). In his human life Jesus was under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This applies to the choice of the apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13">Luke 6:13</span>) and to these special commands before the Ascension.</p>
<p><b>Whom he had chosen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ους εξελεξατο</span></span>). Aorist middle indicative, not past perfect. The same verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεξαμενος</span></span>) was used by Luke in describing the choice of the twelve by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13">Luke 6:13</span>). But the aorist does not stand "for" our English pluperfect as Hackett says. That is explaining Greek by English. The Western text here adds: "And ordered to proclaim the gospel." </p>
