<p><b> For it is written </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγραπτα γαρ</span></span>). Luke here returns to the address of Peter interrupted by verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:18">Acts 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:19">Acts 1:19</span>. Perfect passive indicative, the usual idiom in quoting scripture, stands written. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:69">Acts 1:69</span> is often quoted as Messianic in Matthew and John.</p>
<p><b>His habitation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η επαυλις αυτου</span></span>). Only here in the N.T., a country house, cottage, cabin.</p>
<p><b>His office </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την επισκοπην αυτου</span></span>). Our word bishopric (Authorized Version) is from this word, office of bishop (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισχοπος</span></span>). Only that is not the idea here, but over-seership (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι, σκοπεω</span></span>) or office as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:12">1 Peter 2:12</span>. It means to visit and to inspect, to look over. The ecclesiastical sense comes later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:1">1 Timothy 3:1</span>). </p>
