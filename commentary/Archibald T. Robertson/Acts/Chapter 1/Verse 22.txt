<p><b> Beginning </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρξαμενος</span></span>). Aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχω</span></span>, agreeing (nominative) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κυριος Ιησους</span></span> (the Lord Jesus). The ministry of Jesus began with the ministry of John. Strictly speaking <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρξαμενος</span></span> should be the accusative and agree with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρα</span></span> (witness) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span>, but the construction is a bit free. The ministry of Jesus began with the baptism of John and lasted until the Ascension.</p>
<p><b>A witness with us of his resurrection </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρα της αναστασεως αυτου συν ημιν</span></span>). This Peter considers the essential thing in a successor to Judas. The one chosen should be a personal witness who can speak from his own experience of the ministry, resurrection, and ascension of the Lord Jesus. One can easily see that this qualification will soon put an end to those who bear such personal testimony. </p>
