<p><b> Apostleship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολης</span></span>). Jesus had called the twelve apostles. An old word for sending away, then for a release, then the office and dignity of an apostle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:25">Acts 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5">Romans 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:2">1 Corinthians 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:8">Galatians 2:8</span>).</p>
<p><b>To his own place </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον τοπον τον ιδιον</span></span>). A bold and picturesque description of the destiny of Judas worthy of Dante's <i>Inferno</i>. There is no doubt in Peter's mind of the destiny of Judas nor of his own guilt. He made ready his own berth and went to it. </p>
