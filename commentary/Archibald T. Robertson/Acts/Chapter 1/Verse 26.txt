<p><b> He was numbered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνκατεψηφισθη</span></span>). To the Jews the lot did not suggest gambling, but "the O.T. method of learning the will of Jehovah" (Furneaux). The two nominations made a decision necessary and they appealed to God in this way. This double compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνκαταψηφιζω</span></span> occurs here alone in the N.T. and elsewhere only in Plutarch (<i>Them</i>. 21) in the middle voice for condemning with others. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συνψηφιζω</span></span> occurs in the middle voice in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:19">Acts 19:19</span> for counting up money and also in Aristophanes. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ψηφιζω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαπανην</span></span> occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:28">Luke 14:28</span> for counting the cost and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:18">Revelation 13:18</span> for "counting" the number of the beast. The ancients used pebbles (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψηφο</span></span>) in voting, black for condemning, white (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>) in acquitting. Here it is used in much the same sense as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταριθμεω</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:17">Acts 1:17</span>. </p>
