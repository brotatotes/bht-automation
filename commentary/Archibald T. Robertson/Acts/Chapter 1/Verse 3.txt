<p><b> To whom also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οις κα</span></span>). He chose them and then also manifested himself to these very same men that they might have personal witness to give.</p>
<p><b>Shewed himself alive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεστησεν εαυτον ζωντα</span></span>). To the disciples the first Sunday evening (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:14">Mark 16:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:36-43">Luke 24:36-43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:19-25">John 20:19-25</span>), the second Sunday evening (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:26-29">John 20:26-29</span>), at the Sea of Tiberias (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:1-23">John 21:1-23</span>), on the mountain in Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:16-20">Matthew 28:16-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15-18">Mark 16:15-18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:6">1 Corinthians 15:6</span>), to the disciples in Jerusalem and Olivet (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:44-53">Luke 24:44-53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:16-19">Luke 24:16-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:1-11">Acts 1:1-11</span>). Luke uses this verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παριστημ</span></span> 13 times in the Acts both transitively and intransitively. It is rendered by various English words (present, furnish, provide, assist, commend). The early disciples including Paul never doubted the fact of the Resurrection, once they were convinced by personal experience. At first some doubted like Thomas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:14">Mark 16:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:41">Luke 24:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:24">John 20:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:17">Matthew 28:17</span>). But after that they never wavered in their testimony to their own experience with the Risen Christ, "whereof we are witnesses" Peter said (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:15">Acts 3:15</span>). They doubted at first, that we may believe, but at last they risked life itself in defence of this firm faith.</p>
<p><b>After his passion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα το παθειν αυτον</span></span>). Neat Greek idiom, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα</span></span> with the articular infinitive (second aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασχω</span></span>) and the accusative of general reference, "after the suffering as to him." For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παθειν</span></span> used absolutely of Christ's suffering see also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:3">Acts 17:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:23">Acts 26:23</span>.</p>
<p><b>By many proofs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πολλοις τεκμηριοις</span></span>). Literally, "in many proofs." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τεκμηριον</span></span> is only here in the N.T., though an old and common word in ancient Greek and occurring in the <i>Koine</i> (papyri, etc.). The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκμαιρω</span></span>, to prove by sure signs, is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκμαρ</span></span>, a sign. Luke does not hesitate to apply the definite word "proofs" to the evidence for the Resurrection of Christ after full investigation on the part of this scientific historian. Aristotle makes a distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκμηριον</span></span> (proof) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον</span></span> (sign) as does Galen the medical writer.</p>
<p><b>Appearing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπτανομενος</span></span>). Present middle participle from late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπτανω</span></span>, late <i>Koine</i> verb from root <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπτω</span></span> seen in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψομαι, ωφθην</span></span>. In LXX, papyri of second century B.C. (Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 83). Only here in the N.T. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπτασια</span></span> for vision see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:19">Acts 26:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:22">Luke 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:23">Luke 24:23</span>.</p>
<p><b>By the space of forty days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ημερων τεσσερακοντα</span></span>). At intervals (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>, between) during the forty days, ten appearances being known to us. Jesus was not with them continually now in bodily presence. The period of forty days is given here alone. The Ascension was thus ten days before Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came. Moses was in the mount forty days (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:18">Exodus 24:18</span>) and Jesus fasted forty days (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:2">Matthew 4:2</span>). In the Gospel of Luke 24 this separation of forty days between the Resurrection and the Ascension is not drawn.</p>
<p><b>The things concerning the Kingdom of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα περ της βασιλειας του θεου</span></span>). This phrase appears 33 times in Luke's Gospel, 15 times in Mark, 4 times in Matthew who elsewhere has "the kingdom of heaven," once in John, and 6 times in Acts. No essential distinction is to be drawn between the two for the Jews often used "heaven" rather than "God" to avoid using the Tetragrammaton. But it is noticeable how the word kingdom drops out of Acts. Other words like gospel (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιον</span></span>) take the place of "kingdom." Jesus was fond of the word "kingdom" and Luke is fond of the idiom "the things concerning" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα περ</span></span>). Certainly with Jesus the term "kingdom" applies to the present and the future and covers so much that it is not strange that the disciples with their notions of a political Messianic kingdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:6">Acts 1:6</span>) were slow to comprehend the spiritual nature of the reign of God. </p>
