<p><b> Being assembled together with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναλιζομενος</span></span>). Present passive participle from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναλιζω</span></span>, an old verb in Herodotus, Xenophon, etc., from sun, with, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλιζω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλης</span></span>, crowded. The margin of both the Authorized and the Revised Versions has "eating with them" as if from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλς</span></span> (salt). Salt was the mark of hospitality. There is the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλισθητε εν αυτω</span></span> used by Ignatius <i>Ad Magnes</i>. X, "Be ye salted in him." But it is more than doubtful if that is the idea here though the Vulgate does have <i>convescens illis</i> "eating with them," as if that was the common habit of Jesus during the forty days (Wendt, Feine, etc.). Jesus did on occasion eat with the disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:41-43">Luke 24:41-43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:14">Mark 16:14</span>).</p>
<p><b>To wait for the promise of the Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιμενειν την επαγγελιαν του πατρος</span></span>). Note present active infinitive, to keep on waiting for (around, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span>). In the Great Commission on the mountain in Galilee this item was not given (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:16-20">Matthew 28:16-20</span>). It is the subjective genitive, the promise given by the Father (note this Johannine use of the word), that is the Holy Spirit ("the promise of the Holy Spirit," objective genitive).</p>
<p><b>Which ye heard from me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην ηκουσατε μου</span></span>). Change from indirect discourse (command), infinitives <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωριζεσθα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιμενειν</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρηγγειλεν</span></span> to direct discourse without any <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφη</span></span> (said he) as the English (Italics). Luke often does this (<i>oratior ariata</i>). Note also the ablative case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μου</span></span> (from me). Luke continues in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:5">Acts 1:5</span> with the direct discourse giving the words of Jesus. </p>
