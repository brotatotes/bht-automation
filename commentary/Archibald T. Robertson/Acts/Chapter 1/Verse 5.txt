<p><b> Baptized with water </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβαπτισεν υδατ</span></span>)</p>
<p><b>and with the Holy Ghost </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πνευματ βαπτισθησεσθε αγιω</span></span>). The margin has "in the Holy Ghost" (Spirit, it should be). The American Standard Version renders "in" both with "water" and "Holy Spirit" as do Goodspeed (American Translation) and Mrs. Montgomery (Centenary Translation). John's own words (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>) to which Jesus apparently refers use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> (in) both with water and Spirit. There is a so-called instrumental use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> where we in English have to say "with" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:10">Revelation 13:10</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν μαχαιρη</span></span>, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαχαιρη</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:2">Acts 12:2</span>). That is to say <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> with the locative presents the act as located in a certain instrument like a sword (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 589f.). But the instrumental case is more common without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> (the locative and instrumental cases having the same form). So it is often a matter of indifference which idiom is used as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:8">John 21:8</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω πλοιαριω</span></span> (locative without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>). They came</p>
<p><b>in </b> (locative case without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>) the boat. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:31">John 1:31</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υδατ βαπτιζων</span></span> baptizing in water. No distinction therefore can be insisted on here between the construction <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υδατ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πνευματ</span></span> (both being in the locative case, one without, one with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>). Note unusual position of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισθησεσθε</span></span> (future passive indicative) between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιω</span></span>. This baptism of the Holy Spirit was predicted by John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>) as the characteristic of the Messiah's work. Now the Messiah himself in his last message before his Ascension proclaims that in a few days the fulfilment of that prophecy will come to pass. The Codex Bezae adds here "which ye are about to receive" and "until the Pentecost" to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:5">Acts 1:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>Not many days hence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μετα πολλας ταυτας ημερας</span></span>). A neat Greek idiom difficult to render smoothly into English: "Not after many days these." The litotes (not many=few) is common in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:6">Luke 7:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:13">Luke 15:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:27">Acts 17:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:11">Acts 19:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:12">Acts 20:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:39">Acts 21:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:14">Acts 28:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:2">Acts 28:2</span>). The predicate use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτας</span></span> (without article) is to be noted. "These" really means as a starting point, "from these" (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 702). It was ten days hence. This idiom occurs several times in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:21">Luke 24:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:21">Acts 24:21</span>), as elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:18">John 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:1">2 Peter 3:1</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:12">Luke 2:12</span> the copula is easily supplied as it exists in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:36">Luke 1:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:2">Luke 2:2</span>. </p>
