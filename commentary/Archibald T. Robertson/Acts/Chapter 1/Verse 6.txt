<p><b> They therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μεν ουν</span></span>). Demonstrative use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν ουν</span></span> without any corresponding <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> just as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:1">Acts 1:1</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν</span></span> occurs alone. The combination <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν ουν</span></span> is common in Acts (27 times). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:18">Luke 3:18</span>. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν</span></span> is resumptive and refers to the introductory verses (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:1-5">Acts 1:1-5</span>), which served to connect the Acts with the preceding Gospel. The narrative now begins.</p>
<p><b>Asked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρωτων</span></span>). Imperfect active, repeatedly asked before Jesus answered.</p>
<p><b>Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριε</span></span>). Here not in the sense of "sir" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:30">Matthew 21:30</span>), but to Jesus as Lord and Master as often in Acts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:5">Acts 19:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:10">Acts 19:10</span>, etc.) and in prayer to Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:59">Acts 7:59</span>).</p>
<p><b>Dost thou restore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε αποκαθιστανεις</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> in an indirect question is common. We have already seen its use in direct questions (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:10">Matthew 12:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:23">Luke 13:23</span> which see for discussion), possibly in imitation of the Hebrew (frequent in the LXX) or as a partial condition without conclusion. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:1">Acts 7:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:2">Acts 19:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:37">Acts 21:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:25">Acts 22:25</span>. The form of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαθιστανω</span></span> is late (also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαθισταω</span></span>) omega form for the old and common <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαθιστημ</span></span>, double compound, to restore to its former state. As a matter of fact the Messianic kingdom for which they are asking is a political kingdom that would throw off the hated Roman yoke. It is a futuristic present and they are uneasy that Jesus may yet fail to fulfil their hopes. Surely here is proof that the eleven apostles needed the promise of the Father before they began to spread the message of the Risen Christ. They still yearn for a political kingdom for Israel even after faith and hope have come back. They need the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:14-16">Acts 1:14-16</span>) and the power of the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:4">Acts 1:4</span>). </p>
