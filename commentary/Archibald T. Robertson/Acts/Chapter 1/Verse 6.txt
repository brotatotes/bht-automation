 They therefore  (ο μεν ουν). Demonstrative use of ο with μεν ουν without any corresponding δε just as in Acts 1:1 μεν occurs alone. The combination μεν ουν is common in Acts (27 times). Cf. Luke 3:18. The ουν is resumptive and refers to the introductory verses (Acts 1:1-5), which served to connect the Acts with the preceding Gospel. The narrative now begins.Asked  (ηρωτων). Imperfect active, repeatedly asked before Jesus answered.Lord  (κυριε). Here not in the sense of "sir" (Matthew 21:30), but to Jesus as Lord and Master as often in Acts (Acts 19:5; Acts 19:10, etc.) and in prayer to Jesus (Acts 7:59).Dost thou restore  (ε αποκαθιστανεις). The use of ε in an indirect question is common. We have already seen its use in direct questions (Matthew 12:10; Luke 13:23 which see for discussion), possibly in imitation of the Hebrew (frequent in the LXX) or as a partial condition without conclusion. See also Acts 7:1; Acts 19:2; Acts 21:37; Acts 22:25. The form of the verb αποκαθιστανω is late (also αποκαθισταω) omega form for the old and common αποκαθιστημ, double compound, to restore to its former state. As a matter of fact the Messianic kingdom for which they are asking is a political kingdom that would throw off the hated Roman yoke. It is a futuristic present and they are uneasy that Jesus may yet fail to fulfil their hopes. Surely here is proof that the eleven apostles needed the promise of the Father before they began to spread the message of the Risen Christ. They still yearn for a political kingdom for Israel even after faith and hope have come back. They need the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:14-16) and the power of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:4).
