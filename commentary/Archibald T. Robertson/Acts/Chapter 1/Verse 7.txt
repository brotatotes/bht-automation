<p><b> Times or seasons </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρονους η καιρους</span></span>). "Periods" and "points" of time sometimes and probably so here, but such a distinction is not always maintained. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:26">Acts 17:26</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιρους</span></span> in the same sense as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρονους</span></span> for long periods of time. But here some distinction seems to be called for. It is curious how eager people have always been to fix definite dates about the second coming of Christ as the apostles were about the political Messianic kingdom which they were expecting.</p>
<p><b>Hath set </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθετο</span></span>). Second aorist middle indicative, emphasizing the sovereignty of the Father in keeping all such matters to himself, a gentle hint to people today about the limits of curiosity. Note also "his own" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδια</span></span>) "authority" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσια</span></span>). </p>
