 Times or seasons  (χρονους η καιρους). "Periods" and "points" of time sometimes and probably so here, but such a distinction is not always maintained. See Acts 17:26 for καιρους in the same sense as χρονους for long periods of time. But here some distinction seems to be called for. It is curious how eager people have always been to fix definite dates about the second coming of Christ as the apostles were about the political Messianic kingdom which they were expecting.Hath set  (εθετο). Second aorist middle indicative, emphasizing the sovereignty of the Father in keeping all such matters to himself, a gentle hint to people today about the limits of curiosity. Note also "his own" (ιδια) "authority" (εξουσια).
