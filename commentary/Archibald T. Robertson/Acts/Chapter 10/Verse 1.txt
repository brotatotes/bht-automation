<p><b> Cornelius </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κορνηλιος</span></span>). The great Cornelian family of Rome may have had a freedman or descendant who is</p>
<p><b>centurion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκατον-ταρχης</span></span>, leader of a hundred, Latin <i>centurio</i>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:5">Matthew 8:5</span>. These Roman centurions always appear in a favourable light in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:5">Matthew 8:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:2">Luke 7:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:47">Luke 23:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1">Acts 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:25">Acts 22:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:3">Acts 27:3</span>). Furneaux notes the contrasts between Joppa, the oldest town in Palestine, and Caesarea, built by Herod; the Galilean fisherman lodging with a tanner and the Roman officer in the seat of governmental authority.</p>
<p><b>Of the band called the Italian </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ σπειρης της καλουμενης Ιταλικης</span></span>). A legion had ten cohorts or "bands" and sixty centuries. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπειρης</span></span> (note genitive in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ες</span></span> like the Ionic instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ας</span></span>) is here equal to the Latin <i>cohors</i>. In the provinces were stationed cohorts of Italic citizens (volunteers) as an inscription at Carnuntum on the Danube (Ramsay) has shown (epitaph of an officer in the second Italic cohort). Once more Luke has been vindicated. The soldiers could, of course, be Roman citizens who lived in Caesarea. But the Italian cohorts were sent to any part of the empire as needed. The procurator at Caesarea would need a cohort whose loyalty he could trust, for the Jews were restless. </p>
