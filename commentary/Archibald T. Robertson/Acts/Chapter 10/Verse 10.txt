<p><b> Hungry </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσπεινος</span></span>) Only instance of the word known, a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαξ λεγομενον</span></span>. Probably "very hungry" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span>=besides, in addition).</p>
<p><b>Desired </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηθελεν</span></span>). Imperfect active. Was longing to eat. It was about twelve o'clock noon and Peter may even have smelt the savory dishes, "while they made ready" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρασκευαζοντων</span></span>). "The natural and the supernatural border closely on one another, with no definable limits" (Furneaux).</p>
<p><b>He fell into a trance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο επ' αυτον εκστασις</span></span>). More exactly, "An ecstasy came upon him," in which trance he passed out of himself (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκστασις</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξιστημ</span></span>) and from which one came to himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:11">Acts 12:11</span>). Cf. also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:5">Acts 11:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17">Acts 22:17</span>. It is thus different from a vision (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραμα</span></span>) as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:3">Acts 10:3</span>. </p>
