<p><b> Not so, Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μηδαμωσ, κυριε</span></span>). The negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδαμως</span></span> calls for the optative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειη</span></span> (may it not be) or the imperative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστω</span></span> (let it be). It is not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδαμως</span></span>, a blunt refusal (I shall not do it). And yet it is more than a mild protest as Page and Furneaux argue. It is a polite refusal with a reason given. Peter recognizes the invitation to slay (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυσον</span></span>) the unclean animals as from the Lord (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριε</span></span>) but declines it three times.</p>
<p><b>For I have never eaten anything </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ουδεποτε εφαγον παν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative, I never did anything like this and I shall not do it now. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν</span></span> (everything) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεποτε</span></span> (never) is like the Hebrew (<i>lo--kol</i>) though a like idiom appears in the vernacular <i>Koine</i> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 752).</p>
<p><b>Common and unclean </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινον κα ακαθαρτον</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κοινος</span></span> from epic <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυνος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυν, συν</span></span>, together with) originally meant common to several (Latin <i>communis</i>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:44">Acts 2:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:32">Acts 4:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4">Titus 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:3">Judges 1:3</span>. The use seen here (also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:2">Mark 7:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:5">Mark 7:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:14">Romans 14:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:27">Revelation 21:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:28">Acts 10:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:8">Acts 11:8</span>), like Latin <i>vulgaris</i> is unknown in ancient Greek. Here the idea is made plain by the addition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακαθαρτον</span></span> (unclean), ceremonially unclean, of course. We have the same double use in our word "common." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:18">Mark 7:18</span> where Mark adds the remarkable participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαριζων</span></span> (making all meats clean), evidently from Peter who recalls this vision. Peter had been reared from childhood to make the distinction between clean and unclean food and this new proposal even from the Lord runs against all his previous training. He did not see that some of God's plans for the Jews could be temporary. This symbol of the sheet was to show Peter ultimately that Gentiles could be saved without becoming Jews. At this moment he is in spiritual and intellectual turmoil. </p>
