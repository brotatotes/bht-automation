<p><b> Make not thou common </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ μη κοινου</span></span>). Note emphatic position of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ</span></span> (thou). Do thou stop making common what God cleansed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθαρισεν</span></span>). The idiom of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> with the present active imperative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινου</span></span> means precisely this. Peter had just called "common" what God had invited him to slay and eat. </p>
