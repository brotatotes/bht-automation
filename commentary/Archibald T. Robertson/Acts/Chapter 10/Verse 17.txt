<p><b> Was much perplexed in himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εαυτω διηπορε</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαπορεω</span></span>, intensive compound (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>, thoroughly, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορος</span></span>, way), to be completely at a loss to know what road to take. Old verb, but in N.T. only in Luke and Acts. Page notes that Luke is singularly fond of verbs compounded with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:7">Luke 9:7</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:12">Acts 2:12</span>.

Optative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> in indirect question simply retained from the direct (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1021, 1044). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span>, for the direct and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:62">Luke 1:62</span> for the indirect (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν θελο</span></span> both times). It is the conclusion of a fourth class condition.</p>
<p><b>Having made inquiry </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διερωτησαντες</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διερωταω</span></span>, another compound of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>, to ask one after another, to ask through, old verb, but only here in the N.T. It took diligent inquiry to find the obscure house of Simon the tanner.</p>
<p><b>Stood before the gate </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεστησαν επ τον πυλωνα</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφιστημ</span></span>, intransitive. Note repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>.
