<p><b> Called </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνησαντες</span></span>). In a loud voice that those inside the house might hear.</p>
<p><b>Asked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επυνθανοντο</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυνθανομα</span></span>, old verb to make inquiry especially with an indirect question as here. Kept on inquiring. Westcott and Hort follow B C here and read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επυθοντο</span></span> (second aorist middle, effective aorist). Either makes sense, though the imperfect is more picturesque.</p>
<p><b>Were lodging </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξενιζετα</span></span>). Present middle indicative retained in indirect question. See on verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:6">Acts 10:6</span> for the verb. </p>
