<p><b> Devout </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευσεβης</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ</span></span> (well) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεβομα</span></span> (to worship, to reverence), but rare in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:2">Acts 10:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:7">Acts 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>). It might refer to a worshipful pagan (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:23">Acts 17:23</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεβασματα</span></span>, objects of worship), but connected with "one that feared God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβουμενος τον θεον</span></span>) Luke describes "a God-fearing proselyte" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:22">Acts 10:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:35">Acts 10:35</span>. This is his usual term for the Gentile seekers after God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:16">Acts 13:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:26">Acts 13:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:4">Acts 17:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:17">Acts 17:17</span>, etc.), who had come into the worship of the synagogue without circumcision, and were not strictly proselytes, though some call such men "proselytes of the gate" (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:43">Acts 13:43</span>); but clearly Cornelius and his family were still regarded as outside the pale of Judaism (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:28">Acts 10:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:34">Acts 10:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1">Acts 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:8">Acts 11:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:7">Acts 15:7</span>). They had seats in the synagogue, but were not Jews.</p>
<p><b>Gave much alms </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιων ελεεμοσυνας πολλας</span></span>). Doing many alms (the very phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:2">Matthew 6:2</span>), a characteristic mark of Jewish piety and from a Gentile to the Jewish people.</p>
<p><b>Prayed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεομενος</span></span>). Begging of God. Almsgiving and prayer were two of the cardinal points with the Jews (Jesus adds fasting in his picture of the Pharisee in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1-18">Matthew 6:1-18</span>). </p>
