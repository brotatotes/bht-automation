<p><b> But </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span>). So usually, though it is open to question whether <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span> is adversative here and not rather, "Now then."</p>
<p><b>Get thee down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβηθ</span></span>). Second aorist active imperative, at once.</p>
<p><b>Go </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορευου</span></span>). Present middle imperative, go on.</p>
<p><b>Nothing doubting </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν διακρινομενος</span></span>). Another compound of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>, old and common verb for a divided mind (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυο</span></span>, two). Note usual negative of the present middle participle, the subjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν</span></span>. The notion of wavering (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:6">James 1:6</span>) is common with this verb in the middle voice. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:12">Acts 11:12</span> the aorist active (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν διακριναντα</span></span>) is used perhaps with the idea of conduct towards others rather than his own internal doubt as here (Page).</p>
<p><b>For I </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ εγω</span></span>). The Holy Spirit assumes responsibility for the messengers from Cornelius and thus connects their mission with the vision which was still troubling Peter. Peter had heard his name called by the man (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:19">Acts 10:19</span>). </p>
