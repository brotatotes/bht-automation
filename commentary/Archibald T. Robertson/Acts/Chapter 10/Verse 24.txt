Only instance in the N.T. of this sense of αναγκαιος from αναγκη, necessity, what one cannot do without, necessary (1 Corinthians 12:22), duty (Acts 13:46), or blood relations as here. The ancient Greek writers combined these two words (συγγενεις, kinsmen, αναγκαιους, necessary friends) as here. It was a homogeneous group of Gentiles close to Cornelius and predisposed to hear Peter favourably.
