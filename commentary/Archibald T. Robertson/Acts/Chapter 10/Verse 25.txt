 That Peter entered  (του εισελθειν τον Πετρον). This is a difficult construction, for the subject of εγενετο (it happened) has to be the articular genitive infinitive του εισελθειν with the accusative of general reference τον Πετρον. Most commentators consider it inexplicable. It is probably an extension of the ordinary articular infinitive under the influence of the Hebrew infinitive construct without regard to the case, regarding it as a fixed case form and so using it as nominative. Precisely this construction of του and the infinitive as the subject of a verb occurs in the LXX (2 Chronicles 6:7, etc.). See Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1067f. for full discussion of this obvious Hebraism. Somewhat similar examples appear in Acts 20:3; Acts 27:1. But the Codex Bezae avoids this awkward idiom by the genitive absolute (προσεγγιζοντος του Πετρου) and some additional details (one of the servants ran forward and announced that he was come).Worshipped him  (προσεκυνησεν). "Cornelius was not an idolator and would not have honoured Peter as a god" (Furneaux). The word probably means here reverence like old English usage (Wycliff) and not actual worship, though Peter took it that way (verse Acts 10:26). Jesus accepted such worship (Matthew 8:2; Luke 5:8 by Peter).
