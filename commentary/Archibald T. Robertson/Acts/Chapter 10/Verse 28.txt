<p><b> How that it is an unlawful thing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως αθεμιτον εστιν</span></span>). The conjunction <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> is sometimes equivalent to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> (that). The old form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αθεμιτος</span></span> was <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αθεμιστος</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμιστο</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμιζω, θεμις</span></span>, law custom) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:3">1 Peter 4:3</span> (Peter both times). But there is no O.T. regulation forbidding such social contact with Gentiles, though the rabbis had added it and had made it binding by custom. There is nothing more binding on the average person than social custom. On coming from the market an orthodox Jew was expected to immerse to avoid defilement (Edersheim, <i>Jewish Social Life</i>, pp. 26-28; Taylor's <i>Sayings of the Jewish Fathers</i>, pp. 15, 26, 137, second edition). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:3">Acts 11:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:12">Galatians 2:12</span>. It is that middle wall of partition between Jew and Gentile (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:14">Ephesians 2:14</span>) which Jesus broke down.</p>
<p><b>One of another nation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλοφυλω</span></span>). Dative case of an old adjective, but only here in the N.T. (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλος</span></span>, another, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλον</span></span>, race). Both Juvenal (<i>Sat</i>. XIV. 104, 105) and Tacitus (<i>History</i>, V. 5) speak of the Jewish exclusiveness and separation from Gentiles.</p>
<p><b>And yet unto </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καμο</span></span>). Dative of the emphatic pronoun (note position of prominence) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρασις</span></span>) meaning here "and yet" or adversative "but" as often with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> which is by no means always merely the connective "and" (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1182f.). Now Peter takes back both the adjectives used in his protest to the Lord (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:14">Acts 10:14</span>) "common and unclean." It is a long journey that Peter has made. He here refers to "no one" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδενα</span></span>), not to "things," but that is great progress. </p>
