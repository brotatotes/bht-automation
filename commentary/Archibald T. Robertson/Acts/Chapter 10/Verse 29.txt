 Without gainsaying  (αναντιρρητως). Α privative with compound adverb from αντ (back, in return, against) and verbal ρητος (from ερρηθην, to speak). Late and rare and here only in the N.T., but the adjective in Acts 19:36. Without answering back. That is true after the Holy Spirit expressly told Peter to go with the messengers of Cornelius (Acts 10:19-23). Peter's objections were made to the Lord in the vision which he did not understand. But that vision prepared him for this great step which he had now taken. He had stepped over the line of Jewish custom.With what intent  (τιν λογω). More exactly, "for what reason" as in Plato, Gorgias 512 C.
