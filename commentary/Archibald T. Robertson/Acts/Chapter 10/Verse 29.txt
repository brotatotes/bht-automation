<p><b> Without gainsaying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναντιρρητως</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Α</span></span> privative with compound adverb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span> (back, in return, against) and verbal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρητος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερρηθην</span></span>, to speak). Late and rare and here only in the N.T., but the adjective in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:36">Acts 19:36</span>. Without answering back. That is true after the Holy Spirit expressly told Peter to go with the messengers of Cornelius (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:19-23">Acts 10:19-23</span>). Peter's objections were made to the Lord in the vision which he did not understand. But that vision prepared him for this great step which he had now taken. He had stepped over the line of Jewish custom.</p>
<p><b>With what intent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιν λογω</span></span>). More exactly, "for what reason" as in Plato, <i>Gorgias</i> 512 C. </p>
