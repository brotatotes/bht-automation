 Coming in  (εισελθοντα). Ingressive second aorist active participle, not present. So punctiliar, "saw come," not "saw coming." So also "say" or "speak," not "saying." Luke repeats the account of this vision to Cornelius twice (Acts 10:30; Acts 11:13) and also the story of the vision to Peter (Acts 10:1-16; Acts 10:28; Acts 11:5).
