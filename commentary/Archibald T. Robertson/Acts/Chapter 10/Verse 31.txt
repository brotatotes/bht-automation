<p><b> Is heard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισηκουσθη</span></span>). Sort of timeless first aorist passive indicative as is "are had in remembrance" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμνησθησαν</span></span>. See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:4">Acts 10:4</span> "are gone up for a memorial"). </p>
