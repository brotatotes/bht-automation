<p><b> Opened his mouth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιξας το στομα</span></span>). Solemn formula for beginning his address (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:35">Acts 8:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:14">Acts 18:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:2">Matthew 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:35">Matthew 13:35</span>). But also good elocution for the speaker.</p>
<p><b>I perceive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλαμβανομα</span></span>). Aoristic present middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλαμβανω</span></span>, to take hold of, the middle noting mental action, to lay hold with the mind (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:13">Acts 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:34">Acts 10:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:25">Acts 25:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:18">Ephesians 3:18</span>). It had been a difficult thing for Peter to grasp, but now "of a truth" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ' αληθειας</span></span>) the light has cleared away the fogs. It was not until Peter had crossed the threshold of the house of Cornelius in the new environment and standpoint that he sees this new and great truth.</p>
<p><b>Respecter of persons </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσωπολημπτης</span></span>). This compound occurs only here and in Chrysostom. It is composed of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσωπον</span></span> face or person (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπς</span></span>, before the eye or face) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>. The abstract form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσωπολημψια</span></span> occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1">James 2:1</span> (also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:11">Romans 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:9">Ephesians 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:25">Colossians 3:25</span>) and the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσωπολεμπτεω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:9">James 2:9</span>. The separate phrase (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανειν προσωπον</span></span>) occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:21">Luke 20:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:6">Galatians 2:6</span>. The phrase was already in the LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+10:17">Deuteronomy 10:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+19:7">2 Chronicles 19:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+82:6">Psalms 82:6</span>). Luke has simply combined the two words into one compound one. The idea is to pay regard to one's looks or circumstances rather than to his intrinsic character. The Jews had come to feel that they were the favourites of God and actually sons of the kingdom of heaven because they were descendants of Abraham. John the Baptist rebuked them for this fallacy. </p>
