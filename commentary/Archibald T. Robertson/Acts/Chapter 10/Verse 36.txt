<p><b> The word which he sent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον λογον ον απεστειλεν</span></span>). Many ancient MSS. (so Westcott and Hort) read merely <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον λογον απεστειλεν</span></span> (he sent the word). This reading avoids the anacoluthon and inverse attraction of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογον</span></span> to the case of the relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον</span></span> (which).</p>
<p><b>Preaching good tidings of peace through Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιζομενος ειρηνην δια Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). Gospelizing peace through Jesus Christ. There is no other way to have real peace between individuals and God, between races and nations, than by Jesus Christ. Almost this very language occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:17">Ephesians 2:17</span> where Paul states that Jesus on the cross "preached (gospelized) peace to you who are afar off and peace to you who are near." Peter here sees what Paul will see later with great clearness.</p>
<p><b>He is Lord of all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος εστιν παντων κυριος</span></span>). A triumphant parenthesis that Peter throws in as the reason for his new truth. Jesus Christ is Lord of all, both Jews and Gentiles. </p>
