<p><b> Jesus of Nazareth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησουν τον απο Ναζαρεθ</span></span>). Jesus the one from Nazareth, the article before the city identifying him clearly. The accusative case is here by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προλεψις</span></span>, Jesus being expressed for emphasis before the verb "anointed" and the pronoun repeated pleonastically after it. "Jesus transfers the mind from the gospel-history to the personal subject of it" (Hackett).</p>
<p><b>God anointed him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχρισεν, αυτον, ο θεος</span></span>). First aorist active of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χριω</span></span>, to anoint, from which the verbal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος</span></span> is formed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36">Acts 2:36</span>). The precise event referred to by Peter could be the Incarnation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:35">Luke 1:35</span>), the Baptism (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:22">Luke 3:22</span>), the Ministry at Nazareth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:14">Luke 4:14</span>). Why not to the life and work of Jesus as a whole?</p>
<p><b>Went about doing good </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διηλθεν ευεργετων</span></span>). Beautiful description of Jesus. Summary (constative) aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διερεομα</span></span>, to go through (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) or from place to place. The present active participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευεργετων</span></span> is from the old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευεργετεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ</span></span>, well, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργον</span></span>, work) and occurs only here in the N.T. The substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευεργετης</span></span> (benefactor) was often applied to kings like Ptolemy Euergetes and that is the sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:25">Luke 22:25</span> the only N.T. example. But the term applies to Jesus far more than to Ptolemy or any earthly king (Cornelius a Lapide).</p>
<p><b>And healing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ιωμενος</span></span>). And in particular healing. Luke does not exclude other diseases (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:11">Luke 13:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:16">Luke 13:16</span>), but he lays special emphasis on demoniacal possession (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:23">Mark 1:23</span>).</p>
<p><b>That were oppressed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους καταδυναστευομενους</span></span>). Present passive articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταδυναστευω</span></span>. A late verb in LXX and papyri. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:6">James 2:6</span> (best MSS.). One of the compounds of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> made transitive. The reality of the devil (the slanderer, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαβολος</span></span>) is recognized by Peter.</p>
<p><b>For God was with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ο θεος ην μετ' αυτου</span></span>). Surely this reason does not reveal "a low Christology" as some charge. Peter had used the same language in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:9">Acts 7:9</span> and earlier in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:28">Luke 1:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:66">Luke 1:66</span> as Nicodemus does in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:2">John 3:2</span>. </p>
