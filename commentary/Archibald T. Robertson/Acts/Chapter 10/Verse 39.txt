<p><b> And we are witnesses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ημεις μαρτυρες</span></span>). Compare "ye yourselves know" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:37">Acts 10:37</span>). Peter thus appeals to what the audience know and to what the disciples know. He made the same claim about personal witnesses of the Resurrection of Jesus at Pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:32">Acts 2:32</span>). Here Peter affirms full knowledge of the work of Jesus in Judea (for whole country including Galilee and Perea) and Jerusalem (given mainly in John's Gospel). In the Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span> (which) is attracted into the genitive case to agree with the antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντων</span></span> (all), a common enough idiom.</p>
<p><b>Whom also they slew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον κα ανειλαν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναιρεω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> as often in Acts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:30">Acts 5:30</span>). But note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> (also) in the old MSS., not in the Textus Receptus. They "also" slew him, went that far, "this crowning atrocity" (Vincent), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> could here be "even."</p>
<p><b>Hanging him on a tree </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρεμασαντες επ ξυλου</span></span>). This same expression used by Peter in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:30">Acts 5:30</span> which see for discussion. </p>
