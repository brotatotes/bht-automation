<p><b> Chosen before </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκεχειροτονημενοις</span></span>). Perfect passive participle dative plural from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προχειροτονεω</span></span>, to choose or designate by hand (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειροτονεω, χειρ</span></span>, hand, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεινω</span></span>, to stretch, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:19">2 Corinthians 8:19</span>), beforehand (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ</span></span>), a double compound as old as Plato, but here alone in the N.T. Peter is evidently stating the thing as it happened and not trying to make a convincing story by saying that both friends and foes saw him after his resurrection. It is the "historian's candour" (Paley) in Luke here that adds to the credibility of the narrative. The sceptical Jews would not have believed and Jesus was kept from open contact with the world of sin after his Passion.</p>
<p><b>To us who did eat and drink with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημιν οιτινες συνεφαγομεν κα συνεπιομεν αυτω</span></span>). The "who" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιτινες</span></span>) is first person agreeing with "us" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημιν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of the common verbs <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεσθιω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμπινω</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αυτω</span></span> is associative instrumental case. There are difficulties to us in understanding how Jesus could eat and drink after the resurrection as told here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:41-3">Luke 24:41-3</span>, but at any rate Peter makes it clear that it was no hallucination or ghost, but Jesus himself whom they saw after he rose from the dead, "after the rising as to him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα το αναστηνα αυτον</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα</span></span> with the accusative articular infinitive second aorist active and the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον</span></span> of general reference). Furneaux dares to think that the disciples misunderstood Jesus about eating after the resurrection. But that is to deny the testimony merely because we cannot explain the transition state of the body of Jesus. </p>
