 He charged  (παρηγγειλεν). First aorist active indicative as in Acts 1:4. There Jesus is the subject and so probably here, though Page insists that ο θεος (God) is here because of verse Acts 10:40.To testify  (διαμαρτυρασθα). First aorist middle infinitive. See on Acts 2:40.Ordained  (ωρισμενος). Perfect passive participle of οριζω, old verb, to mark out, to limit, to make a horizon.Judge  (κριτης). The same point made by Peter in 1 Peter 4:5. He does not use the word "Messiah" to these Gentiles though he did say "anointed" (εχρισεν) in verse Acts 10:38. Peter's claim for Jesus is that he is the Judge of Jew and Gentile (living and dead).
