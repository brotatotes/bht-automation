 Every one that believeth  (παντα τον πιστευοντα). This accusative active participle of general reference with the infinitive in indirect discourse is the usual idiom. Only λαβειν (second aorist active infinitive of λαμβανω) is not indirect statement so much as indirect command or arrangement. The prophets bear witness to Jesus Christ to this effect. It is God's plan and no race distinctions are drawn. Peter had already said the same thing at Pentecost (Acts 2:38), but now he sees himself that Gentiles do not have to become Jews, but have only to believe in Jesus as Messiah and Judge as foretold by the prophets. It was glorious news to Cornelius and his group.Through his name  (δια του ονοματος αυτου), not as a title or magic formula (Acts 18:13), but the power of Christ himself represented by his name.
