<p><b> While Peter yet spake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετ λαλουντος του Πετρου</span></span>). Genitive absolute of present participle, still going on.</p>
<p><b>The Holy Ghost fell </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεπεσεν το πνευμα το αγιον</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιπιπτω</span></span>, old verb to fall upon, to recline, to come upon. Used of the Holy Spirit in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:16">Acts 8:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:44">Acts 10:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:15">Acts 11:15</span>. It appears that Peter was interrupted in his sermon by this remarkable event. The Jews had received the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span>), the Samaritans (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:17">Acts 8:17</span>), and now Gentiles. But on this occasion it was before baptism, as was apparently true in Paul's case (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:16">Acts 8:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:5">Acts 19:5</span> the hands of the apostles were also placed after baptism on those who received the Holy Spirit. Here it was unexpected by Peter and by Cornelius and was indubitable proof of the conversion of these Gentiles who had accepted Peter's message and had believed on Jesus Christ as Saviour. </p>
