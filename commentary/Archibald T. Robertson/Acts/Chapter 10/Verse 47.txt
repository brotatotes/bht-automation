<p><b> Can any man forbid the water? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μητ το υδωρ δυνατα κωλυσα τισ?</span></span>). The negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητ</span></span> expects the answer <i>No</i>. The evidence was indisputable that these Gentiles were converted and so were entitled to be baptized. See the similar idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:39">Luke 6:39</span>. Note the article with "water." Here the baptism of the Holy Spirit had preceded the baptism of water (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:5">Acts 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:16">Acts 11:16</span>). "The greater had been bestowed; could the lesser be withheld?" (Knowling).</p>
<p><b>That these should not be baptized </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του μη βαπτισθηνα τουτους</span></span>). Ablative case of the articular first aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτιζω</span></span> with the redundant negative after the verb of hindering (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωλυσα</span></span>) and the accusative of general reference (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτους</span></span>). The redundant negative after the verb of hindering is not necessary though often used in ancient Greek and in the <i>Koine</i> (papyri). Without it see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:14">Matthew 19:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:36">Acts 8:36</span> and with it see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:42">Luke 4:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:16">Luke 24:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:18">Acts 14:18</span>. Cf. Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1061, 1094, 1171. The triple negatives here are a bit confusing to the modern mind (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητ</span></span> in the question, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωλυσα</span></span>, to hinder or to cut off, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισθηνα</span></span>). Literally, Can any one cut off the water from the being baptized as to these? Meyer: "The water is in this animated language conceived as the element offering itself for the baptism."</p>
<p><b>As well as we </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως κα ημεις</span></span>). The argument was conclusive. God had spoken. Note the query of the eunuch to Philip (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:36">Acts 8:36</span>). </p>
