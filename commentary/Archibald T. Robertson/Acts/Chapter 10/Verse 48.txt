<p><b> Commanded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεταξεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative. Peter himself abstained from baptizing on this occasion (cf. Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span>). Evidently it was done by the six Jewish brethren.</p>
<p><b>Them to be baptized </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτους βαπτισθηνα</span></span>). Accusative of general reference with the first aorist passive infinitive.</p>
<p><b>In the name of Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ονοματ Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). The essential name in Christian baptism as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:5">Acts 19:5</span>. But these passages give the authority for the act, not the formula that was employed (Alvah Hovey in Hackett's <i>Commentary</i>. See also chapter on the Baptismal Formula in my <i>The Christ of the Logia</i>). "Golden days" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυρε διες</span></span>, Bengel) were these for the whole group. </p>
