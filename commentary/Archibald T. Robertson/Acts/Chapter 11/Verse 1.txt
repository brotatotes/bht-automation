Throughout Judea (probably all Palestine), distributive use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>. The news from Casearea spread like wildfire among the Jewish Christians. The case of the Samaritans was different, for they were half Jews, though disliked. But here were real Romans even if with Jewish affinities.</p>
<p><b>Had received </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδεξαντο</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative. The English idiom requires "had" received, the Greek has simply "received." </p>
