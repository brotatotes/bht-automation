 Standing and saying  (σταθεντα κα ειποντα). More precisely, "stand and say" (punctiliar act, first aorist passive and second aorist active participles).Fetch Simon  (μεταπεμψα Σιμωνα). First aorist middle imperative. Third time mentioned (Acts 10:5; Acts 10:22; Acts 11:13). Perhaps Peter is anxious to make it plain that he did not go of his own initiative into the house of Cornelius. He went under God's direct orders.
