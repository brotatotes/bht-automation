<p><b> Standing and saying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταθεντα κα ειποντα</span></span>). More precisely, "stand and say" (punctiliar act, first aorist passive and second aorist active participles).</p>
<p><b>Fetch Simon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταπεμψα Σιμωνα</span></span>). First aorist middle imperative. Third time mentioned (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:5">Acts 10:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:22">Acts 10:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:13">Acts 11:13</span>). Perhaps Peter is anxious to make it plain that he did not go of his own initiative into the house of Cornelius. He went under God's direct orders. </p>
