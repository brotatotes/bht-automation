<p><b> Whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν οις σωθηση συ κα πας ο οικος σου</span></span>). Future passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωζω</span></span>, to save. Clearly Cornelius was unsaved in spite of his interest in Jewish worship. Clearly also the household of Cornelius would likewise be won to Christ by the words of Simon Peter. This is household conversion before the household baptism (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:48">Acts 10:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:17">Acts 11:17</span>). </p>
