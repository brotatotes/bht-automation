 As I began to speak  (εν τω αρξασθα με λαλειν). Εν with the locative of the articular aorist infinitive αρξασθα (punctiliar action simply) and the accusative of general reference. The second infinitive λαλειν (to speak) is dependent on αρξασθα, "In the beginning to speak as to me."Even as on us at the beginning  (ωσπερ κα εφ' ημας εν αρχη). Peter recalls vividly the events at Pentecost, the speaking with tongues and all. It is noteworthy that Peter does not here repeat his sermon. "He rests his defence, not on what he said, but on what God did" (Furneaux).
