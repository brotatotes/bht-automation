<p><b> As I began to speak </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω αρξασθα με λαλειν</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εν</span></span> with the locative of the articular aorist infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρξασθα</span></span> (punctiliar action simply) and the accusative of general reference. The second infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλειν</span></span> (to speak) is dependent on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρξασθα</span></span>, "In the beginning to speak as to me."</p>
<p><b>Even as on us at the beginning </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωσπερ κα εφ' ημας εν αρχη</span></span>). Peter recalls vividly the events at Pentecost, the speaking with tongues and all. It is noteworthy that Peter does not here repeat his sermon. "He rests his defence, not on what he said, but on what God did" (Furneaux). </p>
