 I remembered  (εμνησθην). First aorist passive indicative of the common verb μιμνησκω, to remind. Peter recalls the very words of Jesus as reported in Acts 1:5. Peter now understands this saying of Jesus as he had not done before. That is a common experience with us all as new experiences of grace open richer veins in God's truth (John 12:16). Peter clearly sees that the water baptism is merely the symbol or picture of the spiritual baptism in the heart.
