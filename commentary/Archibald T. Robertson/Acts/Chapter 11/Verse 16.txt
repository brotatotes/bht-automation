<p><b> I remembered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμνησθην</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμνησκω</span></span>, to remind. Peter recalls the very words of Jesus as reported in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:5">Acts 1:5</span>. Peter now understands this saying of Jesus as he had not done before. That is a common experience with us all as new experiences of grace open richer veins in God's truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:16">John 12:16</span>). Peter clearly sees that the water baptism is merely the symbol or picture of the spiritual baptism in the heart. </p>
