 The like gift  (την ισην δωρεαν). The equal gift, equal in quality, rank, or measure. Common word.When we believed  (πιστευσασιν). First aorist active participle of πιστευω in the dative case. It agrees both with ημιν (unto us) and with αυτοις (unto them), "having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ." Both classes (Gentiles and Jews) trusted in Christ, and both received the Holy Spirit.Who was I  (εγω τις ημην). Note order, "I, who was I." "That I could withstand God " (δυνατος κωλυσα τον θεον). Literally, "able to withstand or hinder God." It is a rhetorical question, really two questions. Who was I ? Was I able to hinder God? Peter's statement of the facts made an unanswerable defence. And yet Peter (Galatians 2:11) will later in Antioch play the coward before emissaries from Jerusalem on this very point of eating with Gentile Christians.
