<p><b> The like gift </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ισην δωρεαν</span></span>). The equal gift, equal in quality, rank, or measure. Common word.</p>
<p><b>When we believed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευσασιν</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span> in the dative case. It agrees both with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημιν</span></span> (unto us) and with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοις</span></span> (unto them), "having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ." Both classes (Gentiles and Jews) trusted in Christ, and both received the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><b>Who was I </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω τις ημην</span></span>). Note order, "<i>I</i>, who was I." "<b>That I could withstand God </b>" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνατος κωλυσα τον θεον</span></span>). Literally, "able to withstand or hinder God." It is a rhetorical question, really two questions. Who was I ? Was I able to hinder God? Peter's statement of the facts made an unanswerable defence. And yet Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11">Galatians 2:11</span>) will later in Antioch play the coward before emissaries from Jerusalem on this very point of eating with Gentile Christians. </p>
