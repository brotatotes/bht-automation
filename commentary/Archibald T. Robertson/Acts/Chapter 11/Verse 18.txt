<p><b> Held their peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησυχασαν</span></span>). Ingressive aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησυχαζω</span></span>, old verb to be quiet, to keep quiet. The wrangling (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:2">Acts 11:2</span>) ceased. The critics even "glorified God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοξασαν</span></span>, ingressive aorist again).</p>
<p><b>Then to the Gentiles also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αρα κα τοις εθνεσιν</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εργο</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:20">Luke 11:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:48">Luke 11:48</span> and like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα ουν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>. In ancient Greek inferential <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα</span></span> cannot come at the beginning of a clause as here. It was reluctant acquiescence in the undoubted fact that God had "granted repentance unto life" to these Gentiles in Caesarea, but the circumcision party undoubtedly looked on it as an exceptional case and not to be regarded as a precedent to follow with other Gentiles. Peter will see in this incident (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:8">Acts 15:8</span>) the same principle for which Paul contends at the Jerusalem Conference. Furneaux suggests that this conduct of Peter in Caesarea, though grudgingly acquiesced in after his skilful defence, decreased his influence in Jerusalem where he had been leader and helped open the way for the leadership of James the Lord's brother. </p>
