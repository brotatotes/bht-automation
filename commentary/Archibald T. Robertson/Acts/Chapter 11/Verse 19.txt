<p><b> They therefore that were scattered abroad </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μεν ουν διασπαρεντες</span></span>). Precisely the same words used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:4">Acts 8:4</span> about those scattered by Saul (which see) and a direct reference to it is made by the next words, "upon the tribulation that arose about Stephen" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο της θλιψεως της γενομενης επ Στεφανω</span></span>). As a result of (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>), in the case of (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>) Stephen. From that event Luke followed Saul through his conversion and back to Jerusalem and to Tarsus. Then he showed the activity of Peter outside of Jerusalem as a result of the cessation of the persecution from the conversion of Saul with the Gentile Pentecost in Caesarea and the outcome in Jerusalem. Now Luke starts over again from the same persecution by Saul and runs a new line of events up to Antioch parallel to the other, probably partly following.</p>
<p><b>Except to Jews only </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη μονον Ιουδαιοις</span></span>). Clearly these disciples did not know anything about the events in Caesarea and at first their flight preceded that time. But it was a wonderful episode, the eager and loyal preaching of the fleeing disciples. The culmination in Antioch was probably after the report of Peter about Caesarea. This Antioch by the Orontes was founded 300 B.C. by Seleucus Nicator and was one of five cities so named by the Seleucides. It became the metropolis of Syria though the Arabs held Damascus first. Antioch ranked next to Rome and Alexandria in size, wealth, power, and vice. There were many Jews in the cosmopolitan population of half a million. It was destined to supplant Jerusalem as the centre of Christian activity. </p>
