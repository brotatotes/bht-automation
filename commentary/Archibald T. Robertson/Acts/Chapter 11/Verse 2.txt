<p><b> They that were of the circumcision </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εκ περιτομης</span></span>). Literally, those of circumcision (on the side of circumcision, of the circumcision party). The phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:46">Acts 10:46</span> is confined to the six brethren with Peter in Caesarea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:12">Acts 11:12</span>). That can hardly be the meaning here for it would mean that they were the ones who brought the charge against Peter though Hort takes this view. All the disciples in Jerusalem were Jews so that it can hardly mean the whole body. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:12">Galatians 2:12</span> the phrase has the narrower sense of the Judaizing or Pharisaic wing of the disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:5">Acts 15:5</span>) who made circumcision necessary for all Gentile converts. Probably here by anticipation Luke so describes the beginning of that great controversy. The objectors probably did not know of Peter's vision at Joppa, but only of the revolutionary conduct of Peter in Caesarea. These extremists who spoke probably had abundant sympathy in their protest. The apostles are mentioned in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1">Acts 11:1</span>, but are not referred to in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:2">Acts 11:2</span>. Apparently they are in contrast with the circumcision party in the church.</p>
<p><b>Contended </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεκρινοντο</span></span>). Imperfect middle of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακρινω</span></span>, to</p>
<p><b>separate </b>. Here to separate oneself apart (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>), to take sides against, to make a cleavage (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>, two, in two) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:9">Jude 1:9</span>. So Peter is at once put on the defensive as the contention went on. It is plain that Peter was not regarded as any kind of pope or overlord. </p>
