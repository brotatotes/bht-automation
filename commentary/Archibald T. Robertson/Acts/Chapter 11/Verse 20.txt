<p><b> Spake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλουν</span></span>). Inchoative imperfect active, began to speak. For them it was an experiment.</p>
<p><b>Unto the Greeks also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα προς τους Hελληνας</span></span>). This is undoubtedly the correct reading in spite of Hellenists (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hελληνιστας</span></span>) or Grecian Jews in B E H L P. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hελληνας</span></span> is read by A and D and a corrector of Aleph. The presence of "also" or "even" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>) in Aleph A B makes no sense unless "Greeks" is correct. Hellenists or Grecian Jews as Christians were common enough as is seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:2">Acts 11:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:6">Acts 11:6</span>. Saul also had preached to the Hellenists in Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:29">Acts 9:29</span>). Hellenists were merely one kind of Jews in contrast with those who spoke Aramaic (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:6">Acts 11:6</span>). It is true that the case of Cornelius was first in importance, but it is not clear that it was before the work in Antioch. Probably the report of the work among the Greeks in Antioch reached Jerusalem after Peter's defence in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1-18">Acts 11:1-18</span>. That explains the calm tone about it and also why Barnabas and not Peter was sent to investigate. Peter and John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:8">Acts 11:8</span>) had condoned Philip's work in Samaria and Peter was the agent in the work among the Romans in Caesarea. His position was now well-known and his services discounted for this new crisis. These Greeks in Antioch were apparently in part pure heathen and not "God-fearers" like Cornelius. A man of wisdom was called for. These preachers were themselves Hellenists (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span>) and open to the lessons from their environment without a vision such as Peter had at Joppa. "It was a departure of startling boldness" (Furneaux) by laymen outside of the circle of official leaders. </p>
