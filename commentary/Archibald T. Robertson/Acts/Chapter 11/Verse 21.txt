<p><b> The hand of the Lord was with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην χειρ κυριου μετ' αυτων</span></span>). This O.T. phrase (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+9:3">Exodus 9:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:1">Isaiah 59:1</span>) is used by Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:66">Luke 1:66</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:28">Acts 4:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:30">Acts 4:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:11">Acts 13:11</span>). It was proof of God's approval of their course in preaching the Lord Jesus to Greeks.</p>
<p><b>Turned unto the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεστρεψεν επ τον κυριον</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστρεφω</span></span>, common verb to turn. The usual expression for Gentiles turning to the true God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:15">Acts 14:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:3">Acts 15:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:19">Acts 15:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:20">Acts 26:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:9">1 Thessalonians 1:9</span>). Here "Lord" refers to "the Lord Jesus" as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:20">Acts 11:20</span>, though "the hand of the Lord" is the hand of Jehovah, clearly showing that the early disciples put Jesus on a par with Jehovah. His deity was not a late development read back into the early history. </p>
