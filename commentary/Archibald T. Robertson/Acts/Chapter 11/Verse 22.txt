<p><b> Came to the ears </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσθη εις τα ωτα</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span>, was heard in the ears.</p>
<p><b>Of the church which was in Jerusalem </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της εκκλησιας της εν Ιερουσαλημ</span></span>). Not yet was the term "church" applied to the group of disciples in Antioch as it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>They sent forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαπεστειλαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of the double compound verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ-απο-στελλω</span></span>, to send out and away. The choice of Barnabas was eminently wise. He already had a position of leadership in Jerusalem because of his generosity (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36">Acts 4:36</span>) and his championship of Saul after his conversion (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:27">Acts 9:27</span>). He was originally from Cyprus and probably had personal friends among some of the leaders in this new movement. He was to investigate the work of the travelling preachers (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span>) all the way to Antioch (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως Αντιοχειας</span></span>). </p>
