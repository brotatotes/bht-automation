<p><b> The grace of God, was glad </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την χαριν την του θεου εχαρη</span></span>). Note repetition of the article, "the grace that of God." The verb (second aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρω</span></span>) has the same root as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις</span></span>. See the same <i>suavis paronomasia</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:28">Luke 1:28</span>. "Grace brings gladness" (Page). "A smaller man would have raised difficulties as to circumcision or baptism" (Furneaux).</p>
<p><b>He exhorted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεκαλε</span></span>). Imperfect active, picturing the continuous encouragement from Barnabas.</p>
<p><b>With purpose of heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη προθεσε της καρδιας</span></span>). Placing before (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ-τιθημ</span></span>), old word for set plan as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:13">Acts 27:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>. The glow of the first enthusiasm might pass as often happens after a revival. Barnabas had a special gift (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36">Acts 4:36</span>) for work like this.</p>
<p><b>Cleave unto the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσμενειν [εν] τω κυριω</span></span>). Dative case (locative if <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> is genuine) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριος</span></span> (here Jesus again) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεμενειν</span></span> to keep on remaining loyal to (present active infinitive). Persistence was needed in such a pagan city. </p>
