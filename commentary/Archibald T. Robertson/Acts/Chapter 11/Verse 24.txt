 For  (οτ). Because. This is the explanation of the conduct of Barnabas. The facts were opposed to the natural prejudices of a Jew like Barnabas, but he rose above such racial narrowness. He was a really good man (αγαθος). See Romans 5:7 for distinction between αγαθος and δικαιος, righteous, where αγαθος ranks higher than δικαιος. Besides, Barnabas was full of the Holy Spirit (like Peter) and of faith and so willing to follow the leading of God's Spirit and take some risks. This is a noble tribute paid by Luke. One wonders if Barnabas was still living when he wrote this. Certainly he was not prejudiced against Barnabas though he will follow the fortunes of Paul after the separation (Acts 15:36; Acts 15:41).Was added unto the Lord  (προσετεθη τω κυριω). First aorist passive indicative of προστιθημ, common verb to add to. These people were added to the Lord Jesus before they were added to the church. If that were always true, what a difference it would make in our churches.
