<p><b> Prophets </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητα</span></span>). Christian prophets these were (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>) who came from Jerusalem (the headquarters, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:15">Acts 8:15</span>). Judas and Silas are called prophets (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:4">Acts 14:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:32">Acts 15:32</span>). They were not just fore-tellers, but forth-tellers. The prophet had inspiration and was superior to the speaker with tongues (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>). John was a prophet (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:26">Luke 7:26</span>). We need prophets in the ministry today. </p>
