<p><b> Signified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσημαινεν</span></span>). Imperfect active in Westcott and Hort, but aorist active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσημανεν</span></span> in the margin. The verb is an old one from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημα</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον</span></span>) a sign (cf. the symbolic sign in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:11">Acts 21:11</span>). Here Agabus (also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:10">Acts 21:10</span>) does predict a famine through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><b>Should be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλειν εσεσθα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μελλω</span></span> occurs either with the present infinitive (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:27">Acts 16:27</span>), the aorist infinitive (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:6">Acts 12:6</span>), or the future as here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:15">Acts 24:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:10">Acts 27:10</span>.</p>
<p><b>Over all the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφ' ολην την οικουμενην</span></span>). Over all the inhabited earth (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γην</span></span>, understood). Probably a common hyperbole for the Roman empire as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:1">Luke 2:1</span>. Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. VIII. 13, 4) appears to restrict it to Palestine.</p>
<p><b>In the days of Claudius </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ Κλαυδιου</span></span>). He was Roman Emperor A.D. 41-44. The Roman writers (Suetonius, Dio Cassius, Tacitus) all tell of dearths (<i>assiduae sterilitates</i>) during the brief reign of Claudius who was preceded by Caligula and followed by Nero. </p>
