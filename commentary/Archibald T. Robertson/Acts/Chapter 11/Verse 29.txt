 Every man according to his ability  (καθως ευπορειτο τις). Imperfect middle of ευπορεω, to be well off (from ευπορος), old verb, but here alone in the N.T., "as any one was well off." The sentence is a bit tangled in the Greek from Luke's rush of ideas. Literally, "Of the disciples, as any one was able (or well off), they determined (ωρισαν, marked off the horizon) each of them to send relief (εις διακονιαν, for ministry) to the brethren who dwelt in Judaea." The worst of the famine came A.D. 45. The warning by Agabus stirred the brethren in Antioch to send the collection on ahead.
