<p><b> Every man according to his ability </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως ευπορειτο τις</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευπορεω</span></span>, to be well off (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευπορος</span></span>), old verb, but here alone in the N.T., "as any one was well off." The sentence is a bit tangled in the Greek from Luke's rush of ideas. Literally, "Of the disciples, as any one was able (or well off), they determined (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωρισαν</span></span>, marked off the horizon) each of them to send relief (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις διακονιαν</span></span>, for ministry) to the brethren who dwelt in Judaea." The worst of the famine came A.D. 45. The warning by Agabus stirred the brethren in Antioch to send the collection on ahead. </p>
