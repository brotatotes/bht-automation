<p><b> Began </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρξαμενος</span></span>). Not pleonastic here, but graphically showing how Peter began at the beginning and gave the full story of God's dealings with him in Joppa and Caesarea.</p>
<p><b>Expounded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξετιθετο</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτιθημ</span></span>, to set forth, old verb, but in the N.T. only in Acts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:21">Acts 7:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:4">Acts 11:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:26">Acts 18:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:23">Acts 28:23</span>), a deliberate and detailed narrative "in order" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθεξης</span></span>). Old word for in succession. In the N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:2">Luke 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:1">Luke 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:24">Acts 3:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:14">Acts 11:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:23">Acts 18:23</span>. Luke evidently considered this defence of Peter important and he preserves the marks of authenticity. It came originally from Peter himself (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:5">Acts 11:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:6">Acts 11:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:15">Acts 11:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:16">Acts 11:16</span>). "The case of Cornelius was a test case of primary importance" (Page), "the first great difficulty of the early Church." Part of the story Luke gives three times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:3-6">Acts 10:3-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:30-32">Acts 10:30-32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:13">Acts 11:13</span>). See the discussion chapter 10 for details given here. </p>
