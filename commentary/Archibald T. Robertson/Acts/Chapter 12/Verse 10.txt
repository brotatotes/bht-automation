<p><b> When they were past </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διελθοντες</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διερχομα</span></span>, transitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> in composition.</p>
<p><b>The first and the second ward </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτην φυλακην κα δευτεραν</span></span>). It is not clear to what this language refers. Some take it to mean single soldiers, using <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλακην</span></span> in the sense of a guard (one before the door, one at the iron gate). But it seems hardly likely that the two soldiers with whom Peter had been stationed are meant. Probably the "first ward" means the two soldiers of the quaternion stationed by the door and the second ward some other soldiers, not part of the sixteen, further on in the prison by the iron gate. However understood, the difficulties of escape are made plain.</p>
<p><b>Unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ την πυλην την σιδηραν την φερουσαν εις την πολιν</span></span>). Note the triple use of the article (the gate the iron one the one leading into the city). For this resumptive use of the article see Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 762, 764. This iron gate may have opened from a court out into the street and effectually barred escape.</p>
<p><b>Opened to them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηνοιγη αυτοις</span></span>). Second aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιγω</span></span>, the usual later form though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηνοιχθη</span></span> (first aorist passive) occurs also, was opened.</p>
<p><b>Of its own accord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοματη</span></span>). Old compound adjective (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος</span></span>, self, obsolete <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαω</span></span>, to desire eagerly, feminine form though masculine <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοματος</span></span> also used as feminine). In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:28">Mark 4:28</span>. It was a strange experience for Peter. The Codex Bezae adds here "went down the seven steps" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεβησαν τους επτα βαθμους</span></span>), an interesting detail that adds to the picture.</p>
<p><b>One street </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυμην μιαν</span></span>). The angel saw Peter through one of the narrow streets and then left him. We have no means of knowing precisely the location of the prison in the city. On "departed" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστη</span></span>) see on verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:7">Acts 12:7</span>. </p>
