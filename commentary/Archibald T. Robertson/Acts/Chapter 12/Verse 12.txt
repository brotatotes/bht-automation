<p><b> When he had considered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιδων</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνειδον</span></span> (for the defective verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνοραω</span></span>), to see together, to grasp as a whole, old verb, but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:6">Acts 14:6</span>, save the perfect indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνοιδα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:4">1 Corinthians 4:4</span>) and participle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:2">Acts 5:2</span>). It is the word from which <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνειδησις</span></span> (conscience) comes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:15">Romans 2:15</span>). Peter's mind worked rapidly and he decided what to do. He took in his situation clearly.</p>
<p><b>To the house of Mary </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ την οικιαν της Μαριας</span></span>). Another Mary (the others were Mary the mother of Jesus, Mary of Bethany, Mary Magdalene, Mary wife of Cleopas, Mary the mother of James and Joses). She may have been a widow and was possessed of some means since her house was large enough to hold the large group of disciples there. Barnabas, cousin of John Mark her son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>), was also a man of property or had been (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36">Acts 4:36</span>). It is probable that the disciples had been in the habit of meeting in her house, a fact known to Peter and he was evidently fond of John Mark whom he afterwards calls "my son" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:13">1 Peter 5:13</span>) and whom he had met here. The upper room of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:13">Acts 1:13</span> may have been in Mary's house and Mark may have been the man bearing a pitcher of water (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:10">Luke 22:10</span>) and the young man who fled in the Garden of Gethsemane (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:51">Mark 14:51</span>). There was a gate and portress here as in the house of the highpriest (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:16">John 18:16</span>). Peter knew where to go and even at this early hour hoped to find some of the disciples. Mary is one of the many mothers who have become famous by reason of their sons, though she was undoubtedly a woman of high character herself.</p>
<p><b>Were gathered together and were praying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν συνηθροισμενο κα προσευχομενο</span></span>). Note difference in the tenses, one periphrastic past perfect passive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναθροιζω</span></span> old verb, in the N.T. here only and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:25">Acts 19:25</span> and the uncompounded <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θροιζω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:33">Luke 24:33</span>) and the periphrastic imperfect. The praying apparently had been going on all night and a large number (many, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικανο</span></span>) of the disciples were there. One recalls the time when they had gathered to pray (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:31">Acts 4:31</span>) after Peter had told the disciples of the threats of the Sanhedrin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:23">Acts 4:23</span>). God had rescued Peter then. Would he let him be put to death now as James had been? </p>
