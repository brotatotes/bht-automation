<p><b> As soon as it was day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γενομενης ημερας</span></span>). Genitive absolute, day having come.</p>
<p><b>No small stir </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταραχος ουκ ολιγος</span></span>). Litotes (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ολιγος</span></span>), occurs eight times in the Acts as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:2">Acts 15:2</span>, and nowhere else in the N.T. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ταραχος</span></span> (stir) is an old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταρασσω</span></span>, to agitate. In the N.T only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:23">Acts 19:23</span>. Probably all sixteen soldiers were agitated over this remarkable escape. They were responsible for the prisoner with their lives (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:27">Acts 16:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:42">Acts 27:42</span>). Furneaux suggests that Manaen, the king's foster-brother and a Christian (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>), was the "angel" who rescued Peter from the prison. That is not the way that Peter looked at it.</p>
<p><b>What was become of Peter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ αρα ο Πετρος εγενετο</span></span>). An indirect question with the aorist indicative retained. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αρα</span></span> adds a syllogism (therefore) to the problem as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:66">Luke 1:66</span>. The use of the neuter <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span> (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:25">Acts 13:25</span>) is different from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις</span></span>, though nominative like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πετρος</span></span>, literally, "what then Peter had become," "what had happened to Peter" (in one idiom). See the same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:21">John 21:21</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος δε τ</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>But this one what </b> (verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενησετα</span></span> not used). </p>
