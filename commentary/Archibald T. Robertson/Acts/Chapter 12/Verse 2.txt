<p><b> James the brother of John </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιακωβον τον αδελφον Ιωανου</span></span>). He had been called by Jesus a son of thunder along with his brother John. Jesus had predicted a bloody death for both of them (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:38">Mark 10:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:23">Matthew 20:23</span>). James is the first of the apostles to die and John probably the last. He is not James the Lord's brother (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:19">Galatians 1:19</span>). We do not know why Luke tells so little about the death of James and so much about the death of Stephen nor do we know why Herod selected him as a victim. Eusebius (<i>H.E</i>. ii. 9) quotes Clement of Alexandria as saying that a Jew made accusations against James and was converted and beheaded at the same time with him.</p>
<p><b>Killed with the sword </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανειλεν μαχαιρη</span></span>). The verb is a favourite one with Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:33">Acts 2:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:33">Acts 5:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:36">Acts 5:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:28">Acts 7:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:23-29">Acts 9:23-29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:39">Acts 10:39</span>, etc.). Instrumental case and Ionic form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαχαιρα</span></span>. The Jews considered beheading a shameful death as in the case of the Baptist (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:10">Matthew 14:10</span>). </p>
