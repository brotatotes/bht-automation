Locative case and the verbal adjective of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τασσω</span></span>, to arrange, appoint, old word, here only in the N.T. Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. XVII. 6, 8; XIX. 8, 2) gives a full account of the occasion and the death of Herod Agrippa. It was the second day of the festival in honour of the Emperor Claudius, possibly his birthday rather than the <i>Quinquennalia</i>. The two accounts of Luke and Josephus supplement each other with no contradiction. Josephus does not mention the name of Blastus.</p>
