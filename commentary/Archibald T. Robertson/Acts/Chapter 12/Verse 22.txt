<p><b> Shouted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεφωνε</span></span>). Imperfect active, kept on shouting, calling out to him. Old verb, but only four times in the N.T. and all by Luke. The heathen crowd (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δημος</span></span>) repeated their flattering adulation to gain Herod's favour.</p>
<p><b>The voice of a god </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεου φωνη</span></span>). In the pagan sense of emperor worship, not as the Supreme Being. But it was pleasing to Herod Agrippa's vanity. </p>
