Αντ with the genitive of the relative pronoun, "in return for which things." He accepted the impious flattery (Hackett) instead of giving God the glory.

The compound verbal adjective (σκωληξ, worm, βρωτος, eaten, from βιβρωσκω) is a late word (II Macc. 9:9) of the death of Antiochus Epiphanes, used also of a tree (Theophrastus), here only in the N.T. The word σκωληξ was used of intestinal worms and Herodotus (IV. 205) describes Pheretima, Queen of Cyrene, as having swarms of worms which ate her flesh while still alive. Josephus (Ant. XIX. 8, 2) says that Herod Agrippa lingered for five days and says that the rotting of his flesh produced worms, an item in harmony with the narrative in Luke. Josephus gives further details, one a superstitious sight of an owl sitting on one of the ropes of the awning of the theatre while the people flattered him, an omen of his death to him. Luke puts it simply that God smote him.Gave up the ghost  (εξεψυξεν). Effective aorist active of εκψυχω, to breathe out, late verb, medical term in Hippocrates, in the N.T. only in Acts 5:5; Acts 5:10; Acts 12:23. Herod was carried out of the theatre a dying man and lingered only five days.
