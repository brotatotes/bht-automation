<p><b> From Jerusalem </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ Ιερουσαλημ</span></span>). Probably correct text, though D has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>. Westcott and Hort follow Aleph B in reading <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> (to) Jerusalem, an impossible reading contradicted by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:29">Acts 11:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>. The ministration (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονιαν</span></span>) referred to is that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:29">Acts 11:29</span> which may have taken place, in point of time, after the death of Herod.</p>
<p><b>Taking with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνπαραλαβοντες</span></span>). Taking along (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>) with (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span>) them, John Mark from Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:12">Acts 12:12</span>) to Antioch (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>). The aorist participle does not express subsequent action as Rackham here argues (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 861-863). </p>
