 From Jerusalem  (εξ Ιερουσαλημ). Probably correct text, though D has απο. Westcott and Hort follow Aleph B in reading εις (to) Jerusalem, an impossible reading contradicted by Acts 11:29; Acts 13:1. The ministration (διακονιαν) referred to is that in Acts 11:29 which may have taken place, in point of time, after the death of Herod.Taking with them  (συνπαραλαβοντες). Taking along (παρα) with (συν) them, John Mark from Jerusalem (Acts 12:12) to Antioch (Acts 13:1). The aorist participle does not express subsequent action as Rackham here argues (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 861-863).
