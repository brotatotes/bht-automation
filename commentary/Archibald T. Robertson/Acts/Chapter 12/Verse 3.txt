<p><b> That it pleased the Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ αρεστον εστιν τοις Ιουδαιοις</span></span>). Indirect assertion with the present tense <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> retained. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αρεστον</span></span> is the verbal adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρεσκω</span></span> followed by the dative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:29">John 8:29</span>.</p>
<p><b>Proceeded to seize </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεθετο συλλαβειν</span></span>). A patent Hebraism in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:11">Luke 20:11</span> already, and nowhere else in the N.T. It occurs in the LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:2">Genesis 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+8:12">Genesis 8:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:29">Genesis 18:29</span>, etc.). Second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προστιθημ</span></span> and the second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συλλαμβανω</span></span>. Literally, he added to seize, he seized Peter in addition to James.</p>
<p><b>The days of unleavened bread </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερα των αζυμων</span></span>). By this parenthesis Luke locates the time of the year when Peter was arrested, the passover. It was a fine occasion for Agrippa to increase his favour among the crowds of Jews there by extra zeal against the Christians. It is possible that Luke obtained his information about this incident from John Mark for at his Mother's house the disciples gathered (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:12">Acts 12:12</span>). </p>
