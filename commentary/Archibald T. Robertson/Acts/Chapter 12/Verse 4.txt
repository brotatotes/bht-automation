<p><b> When he had taken him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιασας</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:7">Acts 3:7</span> for same form.</p>
<p><b>He put him in prison </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθετο εις φυλακην</span></span>). Second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>, common verb. This is the third imprisonment of Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:3">Acts 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:18">Acts 5:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>To four quaternions of soldiers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεσσαρσιν τετραδιοις στρατιωτων</span></span>). Four soldiers in each quaternion (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετραδιον</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετρας</span></span>, four), two on the inside with the prisoner (chained to him) and two on the outside, in shifts of six hours each, sixteen soldiers in all, the usual Roman custom. Probably Agrippa had heard of Peter's previous escape (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:19">Acts 5:19</span>) and so took no chances for connivance of the jailors.</p>
<p><b>After the passover </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα το πασχα</span></span>). The passover feast of eight days. "The stricter Jews regarded it as a profanation to put a person to death during a religious festival" (Hackett). So Agrippa is more scrupulous than the Sanhedrin was about Jesus.</p>
<p><b>To bring him forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγαγειν αυτον</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγω</span></span>, to lead up, old verb, used literally here. Peter was in the inner prison or lower ward and so would be led up to the judgment seat where Herod Agrippa would sit (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:13">John 19:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>To the people </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω λαω</span></span>). Ethical dative, in the presence of and for the pleasure of the Jewish people. </p>
