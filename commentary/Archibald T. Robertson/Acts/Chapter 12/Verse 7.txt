<p><b> Stood by him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεστη</span></span>). Ingressive second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφιστημ</span></span>, intransitive. This very form occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:9">Luke 2:9</span> of the sudden appearance of the angel of the Lord to the shepherds. Page notes that this second aorist of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφιστημ</span></span> occurs seven times in the Gospel of Luke, eight times in the Acts, and nowhere else in the N.T. Note also the same form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστη</span></span> (departed from, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιστημ</span></span>, stood off from) of the disappearance of the angel in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:10">Acts 12:10</span>.</p>
<p><b>In the cell </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω οικηματ</span></span>).

Old word, but only here in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>He smote Peter on the side </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παταξας την πλευραν του Πετρου</span></span>). More exactly, "smote the side of Peter." Strongly enough to wake Peter up who was sound asleep and yet not rouse the two guards. It was probably between 3 A.M. and 6 A.M., hours when changes in the guards were made.</p>
<p><b>Rise up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστα</span></span>). Short form (<i>Koine</i>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστηθ</span></span>, second aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανιστημ</span></span>, intransitive. So also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:11">Acts 9:11</span> (Westcott and Hort text); <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:14">Ephesians 5:14</span>.</p>

This miracle was necessary if Peter was to escape without rousing the two guards. </p>
