 Stood by him  (επεστη). Ingressive second aorist active indicative of εφιστημ, intransitive. This very form occurs in Luke 2:9 of the sudden appearance of the angel of the Lord to the shepherds. Page notes that this second aorist of εφιστημ occurs seven times in the Gospel of Luke, eight times in the Acts, and nowhere else in the N.T. Note also the same form απεστη (departed from, from αφιστημ, stood off from) of the disappearance of the angel in verse Acts 12:10.In the cell  (εν τω οικηματ). Literally, a dwelling place or habitation (from οικεω, to dwell, οικος, house), but here not the prison as a whole as in Thucydides, but the room in the prison (cell) where Peter was chained to the two guards. Old word, but only here in the N.T.He smote Peter on the side  (παταξας την πλευραν του Πετρου). More exactly, "smote the side of Peter." Strongly enough to wake Peter up who was sound asleep and yet not rouse the two guards. It was probably between 3 A.M. and 6 A.M., hours when changes in the guards were made.Rise up  (αναστα). Short form (Koine) of αναστηθ, second aorist active imperative of ανιστημ, intransitive. So also Acts 9:11 (Westcott and Hort text); Ephesians 5:14.Fell off  (εξεπεσαν). Second aorist active with α ending like first aorist of εξπιπτω, old verb. This miracle was necessary if Peter was to escape without rousing the two guards.
