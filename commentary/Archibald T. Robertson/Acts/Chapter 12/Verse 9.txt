<p><b> Wist not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ηιδε</span></span>). Past perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span> used as imperfect, did not know.</p>
<p><b>Followed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκολουθε</span></span>). Imperfect active, kept on following as the angel had directed (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:8">Acts 12:8</span>). That it was true (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ αληθες εστιν</span></span>). Indirect assertion and so present tense retained. Note "true" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθες</span></span>) in the sense of reality or actuality.</p>
<p><b>Which was done </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το γινομενον</span></span>). Present middle participle, that which was happening.</p>
<p><b>Thought he saw a vision </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοκε οραμα βλεπειν</span></span>). Imperfect active, kept on thinking, puzzled as he was. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βλεπειν</span></span> is the infinitive in indirect assertion without the pronoun (he) expressed which could be either nominative in apposition with the subject as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:22">Romans 1:22</span> or accusative of general reference as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:36">Acts 5:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:9">Acts 8:9</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1036-40). Peter had had a vision in Joppa (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:10">Acts 10:10</span>) which Luke describes as an "ecstasy," but here is objective fact, at least Luke thought so and makes that distinction. Peter will soon know whether he is still in the cell or not as we find out that a dream is only a dream when we wake up. </p>
