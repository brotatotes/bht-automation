 Wist not  (ουκ ηιδε). Past perfect of οιδα used as imperfect, did not know.Followed  (ηκολουθε). Imperfect active, kept on following as the angel had directed (verse Acts 12:8). That it was true (οτ αληθες εστιν). Indirect assertion and so present tense retained. Note "true" (αληθες) in the sense of reality or actuality.Which was done  (το γινομενον). Present middle participle, that which was happening.Thought he saw a vision  (εδοκε οραμα βλεπειν). Imperfect active, kept on thinking, puzzled as he was. Βλεπειν is the infinitive in indirect assertion without the pronoun (he) expressed which could be either nominative in apposition with the subject as in Romans 1:22 or accusative of general reference as in Acts 5:36; Acts 8:9 (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1036-40). Peter had had a vision in Joppa (Acts 10:10) which Luke describes as an "ecstasy," but here is objective fact, at least Luke thought so and makes that distinction. Peter will soon know whether he is still in the cell or not as we find out that a dream is only a dream when we wake up.
