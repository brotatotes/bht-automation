<p><b> In the church that was there </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα την ουσαν εκκλησιαν</span></span>). Possibly distributed throughout the church (note "in the church" <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>). Now a strong organization there. Luke here begins the second part of Acts with Antioch as the centre of operations, no longer Jerusalem. Paul is now the central figure instead of Peter. Jerusalem had hesitated too long to carry out the command of Jesus to take the gospel to the whole world. That glory will now belong to Antioch.</p>
<p><b>Prophets and teachers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητα κα διδασκαλο</span></span>). All prophets were teachers, but not all teachers were prophets who were for-speakers of God, sometimes fore-speakers like Agabus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>. The double use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε</span></span> here makes three prophets (Barnabas, Symeon, Lucius) and two teachers (Manaen and Saul). Barnabas heads the list (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:22">Acts 11:22</span>) and Saul comes last. Symeon Niger may be the Simon of Cyrene who carried the Saviour's cross. Lucius of Cyrene was probably one of the original evangelists (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:20">Acts 11:20</span>). The name is one of the forms of Luke, but it is certainly not Luke the Physician. Manaen shows how the gospel was reaching some of the higher classes (home of Herod Antipas).</p>
<p><b>Foster-brother </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συντροφος</span></span>). Old word for nourished with or brought up with one <i>collactaneus</i> (Vulgate). These are clearly the outstanding men in the great Greek church in Antioch. </p>
