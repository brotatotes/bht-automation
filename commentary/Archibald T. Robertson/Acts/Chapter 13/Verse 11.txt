 Upon thee  (επ σε). The use of επ with the accusative is rich and varied, the precise shade of meaning depending on the content. The "hand of the Lord" might be kindly (Acts 11:21) or hostile (Hebrews 10:31), but when God's hand touches one's life (Job 19:21) it may be in judgment as here with Elymas. He has not humbled himself under the mighty hand of God (1 Peter 5:6).Not seeing  (μη βλεπων). Repeating with negative participle the negative idea in "blind" (τυφλος). "It was a judicial infliction; blindness for blindness, darkness without for wilful darkness within" (Furneaux). He was an example of the blind leading the blind that was to cease and Sergius Paulus was to be led into the light. The blindness was to be "for a season" (αχρ καιρου, Luke 4:13), if it should please God to restore his sight. Paul apparently recalls his own blindness as he entered Damascus.A mist  (αχλυς). Especially a dimness of the eyes, old poetic word and late prose, in LXX, only here in N.T. Galen uses it of the opacity of the eye caused by a wound.He went about seeking some one to lead him by the hand  (περιαγων εζητε χειραγωγους). A rather free rendering. Literally, "going about (περιαγων, present active participle of περιαγω) he was seeking (εζητε, imperfect active of ζητεω) guides (χειραγωγους, from χειρ, hand, and αγωγος, guide, from αγω, one who leads by the hand)." The very verb χειραγωγεω, to lead by the hand, Luke uses of Paul in Acts 9:8, as he entered Damascus.
