<p><b> Upon thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ σε</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> with the accusative is rich and varied, the precise shade of meaning depending on the content. The "hand of the Lord" might be kindly (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:21">Acts 11:21</span>) or hostile (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:31">Hebrews 10:31</span>), but when God's hand touches one's life (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+19:21">Job 19:21</span>) it may be in judgment as here with Elymas. He has not humbled himself under the mighty hand of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:6">1 Peter 5:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>Not seeing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη βλεπων</span></span>). Repeating with negative participle the negative idea in "blind" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυφλος</span></span>). "It was a judicial infliction; blindness for blindness, darkness without for wilful darkness within" (Furneaux). He was an example of the blind leading the blind that was to cease and Sergius Paulus was to be led into the light. The blindness was to be "for a season" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ καιρου</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:13">Luke 4:13</span>), if it should please God to restore his sight. Paul apparently recalls his own blindness as he entered Damascus.</p>
<p><b>A mist </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχλυς</span></span>). Especially a dimness of the eyes, old poetic word and late prose, in LXX, only here in N.T. Galen uses it of the opacity of the eye caused by a wound.</p>
<p><b>He went about seeking some one to lead him by the hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιαγων εζητε χειραγωγους</span></span>). A rather free rendering. Literally, "going about (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιαγων</span></span>, present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιαγω</span></span>) he was seeking (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζητε</span></span>, imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητεω</span></span>) guides (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειραγωγους</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρ</span></span>, hand, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγωγος</span></span>, guide, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγω</span></span>, one who leads by the hand)." The very verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειραγωγεω</span></span>, to lead by the hand, Luke uses of Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:8">Acts 9:8</span>, as he entered Damascus. </p>
