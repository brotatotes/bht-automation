<p><b> Paul and his company </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο περ Παυλον</span></span>). Neat Greek idiom as in Plato, Cratylus 440 C <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο περ Hερακλειτον</span></span>. On this idiom see Gildersleeve, <i>Syntax</i>, p. 264. It means a man and his followers, "those around Paul." Now Paul ranks first always in Acts save in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:2">Acts 14:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:12">Acts 15:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:25">Acts 15:25</span> for special reasons. Heretofore Saul (Paul) held a secondary position (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:27">Acts 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>). "In nothing is the greatness of Barnabas more manifest than in his recognition of the superiority of Paul and acceptance of a secondary position for himself" (Furneaux).</p>
<p><b>Set sail </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναχθεντες</span></span>). First aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγω</span></span>. Thirteen times in the Acts and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:22">Luke 8:22</span> which see. They sailed up to sea and came down (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταγω, καταβαινω</span></span>) to land. So it looks.</p>
<p><b>Departed from them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποχωρησας απ' αυτων</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποχωρεω</span></span>, old verb to withdraw, go away from. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:39">Luke 9:39</span>. He is called John there as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:5">Acts 13:5</span> and Mark in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:39">Acts 15:39</span>, though John Mark in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:12">Acts 12:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:25">Acts 12:25</span>. This may be accidental or on purpose (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 317). Luke is silent on John's reasons for leaving Paul and Barnabas. He was the cousin of Barnabas and may not have relished the change in leadership. There may have been change in plans also now that Paul is in command. Barnabas had chosen Cyprus and Paul has led them to Perga in Pamphylia and means to go on into the highlands to Antioch in Pisidia. There were perils of many sorts around them and ahead (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:26">2 Corinthians 11:26</span>), perils to which John Mark was unwilling to be exposed. Paul will specifically charge him at Antioch with desertion of his post (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:39">Acts 15:39</span>). It is possible, as Ramsay suggests, that the mosquitoes at Perga gave John malaria. If so, they bit Paul and Barnabas also. He may not have liked Paul's aggressive attitude towards the heathen. At any rate he went home to Jerusalem instead of to Antioch, <i>zu seiner Mutter</i> (Holtzmann). It was a serious breach in the work, but Paul and Barnabas stuck to the work. </p>
