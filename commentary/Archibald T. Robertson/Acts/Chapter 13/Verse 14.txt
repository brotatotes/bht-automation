<p><b> Passing through </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διελθοντες</span></span>). It is not clear why Paul and Barnabas left Perga so soon nor why they went to Antioch in Pisidia. Ramsay suggests malaria that spurred them on to the hills after the desertion of John Mark. They preached at Perga on the return (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:25">Acts 14:25</span>) and apparently hurried away now. Farrar thinks that the hot weather had driven the population to the hills. At any rate it is not difficult to imagine the perils of this climb over the rough mountain way from Perga to Pisidian Antioch to which Paul apparently refers in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:26">2 Corinthians 11:26</span>.</p>
<p><b>Sat down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθισαν</span></span>). Ingressive aorist active indicative, took their seats as visiting Jews, possibly in the seats of the rabbis (J. Lightfoot). Whether they expected to be called on or not, they were given the opportunity as prominent visitors. The Pisidian Antioch was really in Phrygia, but towards Pisidia to distinguish it from Antioch on the Maeander (Ramsay, <i>Church in the Roman Empire</i>, p. 25). It was a colony like Philippi and so a free city. If Paul is referring to South Galatia and not North Galatia in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:13">Galatians 4:13</span> when he says that his preaching in Galatia at first was due to illness, then it was probably here at Pisidian Antioch. What it was we have no means of knowing, though it was a temptation in his flesh to them so severe that they were willing to pluck out their eyes for him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:14">Galatians 4:14</span>). Opthalmia, malaria, epilepsy have all been suggested as this stake in the flesh (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span>). But Paul was able to preach with power whatever his actual physical condition was. </p>
