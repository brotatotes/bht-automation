<p><b> After the reading of the law and the prophets </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα την αναγνωσιν του νομου κα των προφητων</span></span>). The law was first read in the synagogues till B.C. 163 when Antiochus Epiphones prohibited it. Then the reading of the prophets was substituted for it. The Maccabees restored both. There was a reading from the law and one from the prophets in Hebrew which was interpreted into the Aramaic or the Greek <i>Koine</i> for the people. The reading was followed by the sermon as when Jesus was invited to read and to preach in Nazareth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:16">Luke 4:16</span>). For the service in the synagogue see Schuerer, <i>History of the Jewish People</i>, Div. II, Vol. II, pp. 79ff. It was the duty of the rulers of the synagogue (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχισυναγωγο</span></span>) to select the readers and the speakers for the service (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:22">Mark 5:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:35-38">Mark 5:35-38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:49">Luke 8:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:14">Luke 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:15">Acts 13:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:8">Acts 18:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:17">Acts 18:17</span>). Any rabbi or distinguished stranger could be called on to speak.</p>
<p><b>If ye have any word of exhortation for the people </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τις εστιν εν υμιν λογος παρακλησεως προς τον λαον</span></span>). Literally, if there is among you any word of exhortation for the people. It is a condition of the first class and assumed to be true, a polite invitation. On "exhortation" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακλησις</span></span>) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:31">Acts 9:31</span>. It may be a technical phrase used in the synagogue (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:22">Hebrews 13:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:13">1 Timothy 4:13</span>). </p>
