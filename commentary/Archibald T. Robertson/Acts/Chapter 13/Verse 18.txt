 Suffered he their manners  (ετροποφορησεν). First aorist active indicative of τροποφορεω, late word from τροπος, manner, and φερω, reading of Aleph B D and accepted by Westcott and Hort. But A C Sahidic Bohairic read ετροφοφορησεν from τροφοφορεω (τροφος, a nurse, and φερω,) late word (II Macc. 7:27), probably correct word here and Deuteronomy 1:31.
