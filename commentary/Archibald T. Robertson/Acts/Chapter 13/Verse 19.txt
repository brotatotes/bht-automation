<p><b> When he had destroyed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθελων</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαιρεω</span></span>, to tear down, old verb.</p>
<p><b>He gave them for an inheritance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεκληρονομησεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of the double compound verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα-κληρο-νομεω</span></span>, late verb in LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+34:18">Numbers 34:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+3:28">Deuteronomy 3:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jos+14:1">Joshua 14:1</span>) and only here in the N.T., to distribute by lot, to distribute as an inheritance. This is the correct reading and not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεκληροδοτησεν</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακληροδοτεω</span></span> of the Textus Receptus. These two verbs were confused in the MSS. of the LXX as well as here.</p>
<p><b>For about four hundred and fifty years </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ετεσιν τετρακοσιοις κα πεντηκοντα</span></span>). Associative instrumental case with an expression of time as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:11">Acts 8:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:29">Luke 8:29</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 527). The oldest MSS. (Aleph A B C Vg Sah Boh) place these figures before "after these things" and so in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:19">Acts 13:19</span>. This is the true reading and is in agreement with the notation in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+6:1">1 Kings 6:1</span>. The difficulty found in the Textus Receptus (King James Version) thus disappears with the true text. The four hundred and fifty years runs therefore from the birth of Isaac to the actual conquest of Canaan and does not cover the period of the Judges. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:6">Acts 7:6</span>. </p>
