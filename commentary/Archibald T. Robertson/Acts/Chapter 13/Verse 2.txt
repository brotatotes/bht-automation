<p><b> As they ministered to the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λειτουργουντων αυτων το κυριω</span></span>). Genitive absolute of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λειτουργεω</span></span>, old verb, used of the Attic orators who served the state at their own cost <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεως</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαος</span></span>, people, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργον</span></span>, work or service). Common in the LXX of the priests who served in the tabernacle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:31">Exodus 28:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:39">Exodus 28:39</span>) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λειτουργια</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:23">Luke 1:23</span>) which see.

The word liturgy grows out of this use.</p>
<p><b>And fasted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα νηστευοντων</span></span>). Genitive absolute also. Christian Jews were keeping up the Jewish fast (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:12">Luke 18:12</span>). Note fasting also in the choice of elders for the Mission Churches (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span>). Fasting was not obligatory on the Christians, but they were facing a great emergency in giving the gospel to the Gentile world.</p>
<p><b>Separate me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφορισατε δη μο</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφοριζω</span></span>, old verb to mark off boundaries or horizon, used by Paul of his call (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:15">Galatians 1:15</span>). The Greek has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δη</span></span>, a shortened form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη</span></span> and like Latin <i>jam</i> and German <i>doch</i>, now therefore. It ought to be preserved in the translation. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:15">Luke 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:36">Acts 15:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:20">1 Corinthians 6:20</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μο</span></span> is the ethical dative. As in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span> Barnabas is named before Saul. Both had been called to ministry long ago, but now this call is to the special campaign among the Gentiles. Both had been active and useful in such work.</p>
<p><b>Whereunto </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span>). Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> has to be repeated from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το εργον</span></span> just before, "for which" as Jesus sent the twelve and the seventy in pairs, so here. Paul nearly always had one or more companions. </p>
