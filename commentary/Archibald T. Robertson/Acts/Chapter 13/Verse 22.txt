<p><b> When he had removed him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταστησας αυτον</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθιστημ</span></span>, old verb to transfer, to transpose (note force of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα</span></span>). This verb occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:4">Luke 16:4</span> by the unjust steward about his removal from office. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:16">1 Samuel 15:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>To be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>). As or for, Greek idiom like the Hebrew <i>le</i>, common in the LXX.</p>
<p><b>A man after my heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανδρα κατα την καρδιαν μου</span></span>). The words quoted by Paul as a direct saying of God are a combination of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:20">Psalms 89:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:21">Psalms 89:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+13:14">1 Samuel 13:14</span> (the word of the Lord to Samuel about David). Knowling thinks that this free and rather loose quotation of the substance argues for the genuineness of the report of Paul's sermon. Hackett observes that the commendation of David is not absolute, but, as compared with the disobedient Saul, he was a man who did God's will in spite of the gross sin of which he repented (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:51">Acts 13:51</span>). Note "wills" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεληματα</span></span>), plural, of God. </p>
