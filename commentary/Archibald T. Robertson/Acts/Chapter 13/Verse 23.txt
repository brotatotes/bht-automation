<p><b>According to promise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ' επαγγελιαν</span></span>). This phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:29">Galatians 3:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:1">2 Timothy 1:1</span>.

In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:8">Zechariah 3:8</span> the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγω</span></span> is used of the sending of the Messiah as here.</p>
<p><b>A Saviour Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σωτηρα Ιησουν</span></span>). Jesus is in apposition with Saviour (accusative case) and comes at the end of the sentence in contrast with "this man" (David) at the beginning. Paul goes no further than David because he suggests to him Jesus, descendant in the flesh from David. By "Israel" here Paul means the Jewish people, though he will later enlarge this promise to include the spiritual Israel both Gentile and Jew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:6">Romans 9:6</span>). </p>
