<p><b> When John had first preached </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκηρυξαντος Ιωανου</span></span>). Literally, John heralding beforehand, as a herald before the king (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:3">Luke 3:3</span>). Genitive absolute of first aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκηρυσσω</span></span>, old verb to herald beforehand, here alone in the N.T., though Textus Receptus has it also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:20">Acts 3:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>Before his coming </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ προσωπου της εισοδου αυτου</span></span>). Literally, before the face of his entering in (here act of entrance as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:9">1 Thessalonians 1:9</span>, not the gate as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19">Hebrews 10:19</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:1">Malachi 3:1</span> quoted in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:10">Matthew 11:10</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:27">Luke 7:27</span>) for this Hebrew phrase and also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:76">Luke 1:76</span>.</p>

The very phrase used of John's preaching in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:4">Mark 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:3">Luke 3:3</span>. It is clear therefore that Paul understood John's ministry and message as did Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:37">Acts 10:37</span>). </p>
