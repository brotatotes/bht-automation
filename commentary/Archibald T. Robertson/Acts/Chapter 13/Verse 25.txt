<p><b> As John was fulfilling his course </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως επληρου Ιωανης τον δρομον</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span>, describing his vivid ministry without defining the precise period when John asked the question. Paul uses this word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δρομος</span></span> (course) of his own race (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:7">2 Timothy 4:7</span>).</p>
<p><b>What suppose ye that I am? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ εμε υπονοειτε ειναι?</span></span>) Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span> (neuter), not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινα</span></span> (masculine),</p>
<p><b>what </b> not</p>
<p><b>who </b>, character, not identity. It is indirect discourse (the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα</span></span> and the accusative of general reference).</p>
<p><b>Huponoeo </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο, νοεω</span></span>) is to think secretly, to suspect, to conjecture.</p>
<p><b>I am not he </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ειμ εγω</span></span>). These precise words are not given in the Gospels, but the idea is the same as the disclaimers by the Baptist in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19-27">John 1:19-27</span> (cf. also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:7">Mark 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:16">Luke 3:16</span>). Paul had a true grasp of the message of the Baptist. He uses the very form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυσα</span></span> (first aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυω</span></span>) found in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:7">Mark 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:16">Luke 3:16</span> and the word for shoes (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποδημα</span></span>, singular) in all three. His quotation is remarkably true to the words in the Synoptic Gospels. How did Paul get hold of the words of the Baptist so clearly? </p>
