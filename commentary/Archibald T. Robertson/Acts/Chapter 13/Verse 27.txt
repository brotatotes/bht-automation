<p><b> Because they knew him not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτον αγνοησαντες</span></span>). First aorist active participle (causal) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνοεω</span></span>, old verb, not to know. Peter gives "ignorance" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνοια</span></span>) as the excuse of the Jews in the death of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:17">Acts 3:17</span>) and Paul does the same about his conduct before his conversion (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:13">1 Timothy 1:13</span>). This ignorance mitigated the degree of their guilt, but it did not remove it, for it was willing ignorance and prejudice.</p>
<p><b>The voices of the prophets which are read </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας φωνας των προφητων τας αναγινωσκομενας</span></span>). Object also of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνοησαντες</span></span>, though it could be the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επληρωσαν</span></span> (fulfilled) if <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> is taken as "also". The "voices" were heard as they were read aloud each Sabbath in the synagogue. In their ignorant condemnation they fulfilled the prophecies about the suffering Messiah. </p>
