 Because they knew him not  (τουτον αγνοησαντες). First aorist active participle (causal) of αγνοεω, old verb, not to know. Peter gives "ignorance" (αγνοια) as the excuse of the Jews in the death of Christ (Acts 3:17) and Paul does the same about his conduct before his conversion (1 Timothy 1:13). This ignorance mitigated the degree of their guilt, but it did not remove it, for it was willing ignorance and prejudice.The voices of the prophets which are read  (τας φωνας των προφητων τας αναγινωσκομενας). Object also of αγνοησαντες, though it could be the object of επληρωσαν (fulfilled) if κα is taken as "also". The "voices" were heard as they were read aloud each Sabbath in the synagogue. In their ignorant condemnation they fulfilled the prophecies about the suffering Messiah.
