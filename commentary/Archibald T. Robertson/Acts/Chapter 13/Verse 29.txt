<p><b> From the tree </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο του ξυλου</span></span>). Not here strictly a tree, but wood as already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:30">Acts 5:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:29">Acts 10:29</span> and later in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span>. Strictly speaking, it was Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus who took the body of Jesus down from the cross, though the Jews had asked Pilate to have the bones of Jesus broken that his body should not remain on the cross during the Sabbath (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:31">John 19:31</span>). Paul does not distinguish the details here.</p>
