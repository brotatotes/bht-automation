<p><b> Was seen for many days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφθη επ ημερας πλειους</span></span>). The common verb (first aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>, to see) for the appearance of the Risen Christ, the one used by Paul of his own vision of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:8">1 Corinthians 15:8</span>), which is not reported by Luke here. For more days (than a few), the language means, forty in all (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:3">Acts 1:3</span>).</p>
<p><b>Of them that came up with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις συναναβασιν αυτω</span></span>). Dative (after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφθη</span></span>) articular participle (second aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναναβαινω</span></span>) with associative instrumental case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span>), the very men who knew him best and who could not be easily deceived about the reality of his resurrection. But this fact rules Paul out on this point, for he had not fellowshipped with Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><b>Who are now his witnesses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιτινες νυν εισιν μαρτυρες αυτου</span></span>). The very point that Peter used to clinch his argument with such powerful effect (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:32">Acts 2:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:15">Acts 3:15</span>). </p>
