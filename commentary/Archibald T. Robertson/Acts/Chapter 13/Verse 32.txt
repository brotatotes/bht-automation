<p><b> We bring you good tidings of the promise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις υμας ευαγγελιζομεθα την επαγγελιαν</span></span>). Two accusatives here (person and thing), old Greek did not use accusative of the person with this verb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:10">Acts 16:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:18">Luke 3:18</span>. Note "we you" together. Here the heart of Paul's message on this occasion. </p>
