<p><b> Hath fulfilled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπεπληρωκεν</span></span>). Hath filled out (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Unto our children </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις τεκνοις ημων</span></span>). The MSS. vary greatly here about <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημων</span></span> (our), some have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτων</span></span>, some <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτων ημιν</span></span>. Westcott and Hort consider these readings "a primitive error" for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημιν</span></span> (to us) taken with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστησας Ιησουν</span></span> (having for us raised up Jesus). This raising up (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανιστημ</span></span>, set up) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:22">Acts 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:37">Acts 7:37</span> refers not to resurrection (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:34">Acts 13:34</span>), but to the sending of Jesus (two raisings up).</p>
<p><b>In the second psalm </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ψαλμω τω δευτερω</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span>. D has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτω</span></span> because the first psalm was often counted as merely introductory. </p>
