<p><b> Because </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διοτ</span></span>). Compound conjunction (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια, οτ</span></span>) like our "because that." The reason for the previous statement about "the holy things."</p>
<p><b>Thou wilt not give thy holy one to see corruption </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου δωσεις τον οσιον σου ιδειν διαφθοραν</span></span>). Quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:10">Psalms 16:10</span> to show that Jesus did not see corruption in his body, a flat contradiction for those who deny the bodily resurrection of Jesus. </p>
