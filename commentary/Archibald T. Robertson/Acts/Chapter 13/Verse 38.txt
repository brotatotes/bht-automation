<p><b> Through this man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τουτου</span></span>). This very man whom the Jews had crucified and whom God had raised from the dead. Remission of sins (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεσις αμαρτιων</span></span>) is proclaimed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταγγελλετα</span></span>) to you. This is the keynote of Paul's message as it had been that of Peter at Pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:31">Acts 5:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:43">Acts 10:43</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span>. This glorious message Paul now presses home in his exhortation. </p>
