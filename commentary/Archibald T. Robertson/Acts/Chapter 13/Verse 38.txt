 Through this man  (δια τουτου). This very man whom the Jews had crucified and whom God had raised from the dead. Remission of sins (αφεσις αμαρτιων) is proclaimed (καταγγελλετα) to you. This is the keynote of Paul's message as it had been that of Peter at Pentecost (Acts 2:38; Acts 5:31; Acts 10:43). Cf. Acts 26:18. This glorious message Paul now presses home in his exhortation.
