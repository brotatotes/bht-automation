<p><b> And by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα απο παντων ων ουκ ηδυνηθητε εν νομω Μωυσεως δικαιοθηνα εν τουτω πας ο πιστευων δικαιουτα</span></span>). This is a characteristic Greek sentence with the principal clause at the end and Pauline to the core. A literal rendering as to the order would be: "And from all the things from (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> not repeated in the Greek, but understood, the ablative case being repeated) which ye were not able to be justified in this one every one who believes is justified." The climax is at the close and gives us the heart of Paul's teaching about Christ. "We have here the germ of all that is most characteristic in Paul's later teaching. It is the argument of the Epistle to Galatians and Romans in a sentence" (Furneaux). The failure of the Mosaic law to bring the kind of righteousness that God demands is stated. This is made possible in and by (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>) Christ alone. Paul's favourite words occur here, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>, believe, with which <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span>, faith, is allied, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοω</span></span>, to set right with God on the basis of faith. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:7">Romans 6:7</span> Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> also after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοω</span></span>. These are key words (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοω</span></span>) in Paul's theology and call for prolonged and careful study if one is to grasp the Pauline teaching. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δικαιοω</span></span> primarily means to make righteous, to declare righteous like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιοω</span></span>, to deem worthy (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιος</span></span>). But in the end Paul holds that real righteousness will come (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:6-8">Acts 13:6-8</span>) to those whom God treats as righteous (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:3-5">Acts 13:3-5</span>) though both Gentile and Jew fall short without Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1-3">Acts 13:1-3</span>). This is the doctrine of grace that will prove a stumbling block to the Jews with their ceremonial works and foolishness to the Greeks with their abstract philosophical ethics (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:23-25">1 Corinthians 1:23-25</span>). It is a new and strange doctrine to the people of Antioch. </p>
