<p><b> Beware therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπετε ουν</span></span>). The warning is pertinent. Perhaps Paul noticed anger on the faces of some of the rabbis.</p>
<p><b>Lest there come upon you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη επελθη</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive with the negative final conjunction <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>In the prophets </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις προφηταις</span></span>). The quotation is from the LXX text of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="hab+1:5">Habakkuk 1:5</span>. The plural here refers to the prophetic collection (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:44">Luke 24:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:14">Acts 24:14</span>). "The Jews of Habakkuk's day had refused to believe in the impending invasion by the Chaldeans, and yet it had come" (Furneaux). </p>
