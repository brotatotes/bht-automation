<p><b> And as they went out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εξιοντων δε αυτων</span></span>). Genitive absolute with present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξειμ</span></span>, to go out, old verb, in the N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:42">Acts 12:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:15">Acts 17:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7">Acts 20:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:43">Acts 27:43</span>. As they (Paul and Barnabas) were going out with all the excitement and hubbub created by the sermon.</p>
<p><b>They besought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεκαλουν</span></span>). Imperfect active, inchoative, began to beseech. The Textus Receptus inserts wrongly <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα εθνη</span></span> (the Gentiles) as if the Jews were opposed to Paul from the first as some doubtless were. But both Jews and Gentiles asked for the repetition of the sermon (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαληθηνα</span></span>, first aorist passive infinitive object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεκαλουν</span></span> with accusative of general reference).</p>
<p><b>The next Sabbath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το μεταξυ σαββατον</span></span>). Late use (Josephus, Plutarch, etc.) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταξυ</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυν</span></span>=<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span>) in sense of after or next instead of between (sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα</span></span> prevailing). Note use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> for "on" or "by." </p>
