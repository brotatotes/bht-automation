<p><b> When the synagogue broke up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυθεισης της συναγωγης</span></span>). Genitive absolute of first aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυω</span></span>. Apparently Paul and Barnabas had gone out before the synagogue was formally dismissed.</p>
<p><b>Of the devout proselytes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των σεβομενων προσηλυτων</span></span>). Of the worshipping proselytes described in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:16">Acts 13:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:25">Acts 13:25</span> as "those who fear God" (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:14">Acts 16:14</span>) employed usually of the uncircumcised Gentiles who yet attended the synagogue worship, but the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσηλυτο</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσ, ηλυτος</span></span> verbal from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, a new-comer) means usually those who had become circumcised (proselytes of righteousness). Yet the rabbis used it also of proselytes of the gate who had not yet become circumcised, probably the idea here. In the N.T. the word occurs only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:15">Matthew 23:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:10">Acts 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:5">Acts 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:43">Acts 13:43</span>. Many (both Jews and proselytes) followed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκολουθησαν</span></span>, ingressive aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακολουθεω</span></span>) Paul and Barnabas to hear more without waiting till the next Sabbath. So we are to picture Paul and Barnabas speaking (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσλαλουντες</span></span>, late compound, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:20">Acts 28:20</span>) to eager groups.</p>
<p><b>Urged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επειθον</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθω</span></span>, either descriptive (were persuading) or conative (were trying to persuade). Paul had great powers of persuasion (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:4">Acts 18:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:8">Acts 19:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:26">Acts 19:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:28">Acts 26:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:23">Acts 28:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:11">2 Corinthians 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:10">Galatians 1:10</span>). These Jews "were beginning to understand for the first time the true meaning of their national history" (Furneaux), "the grace of God" to them. </p>
