<p><b> The next Sabbath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω ερχομενω σαββατω</span></span>). Locative case, on the coming (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομενω</span></span>, present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>) Sabbath. So the best MSS., though some have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχομενω</span></span> (present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span> in sense of near, bordering, following as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:33">Luke 13:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+29:15">Acts 29:15</span>).</p>
<p><b>Almost </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχεδον</span></span>). Old word, but in N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:26">Acts 19:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:22">Hebrews 9:22</span>.</p>
<p><b>Was gathered together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνηχθη</span></span>). First aorist (effective) passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγω</span></span>, old and common verb. The "whole city" could hardly all gather in the synagogue. Perhaps Paul spoke in the synagogue and Barnabas to the overflow outside (see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span>). It was an eager and earnest gathering "to hear (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουσα</span></span>, first aorist active infinitive of purpose) the word of God" and a great opportunity for Paul and Barnabas. The Codex Bezae has it "to hear Paul." It was the new preacher (Paul) that drew the big crowd. It was a crowd such as will later hang on the words of John Wesley and George Whitfield when they preach Jesus Christ. </p>
