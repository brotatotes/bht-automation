<p><b> The Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Ιουδαιο</span></span>). Certainly not the proselytes of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:43">Acts 13:43</span>. Probably many of the Jews that were then favourably disposed to Paul's message had reacted against him under the influence of the rabbis during the week and evidently on this Sabbath very many Gentiles ("almost the whole city," "the multitudes" <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους οχλους</span></span>) had gathered, to the disgust of the stricter Jews. Nothing is specifically stated here about the rabbis, but they were beyond doubt the instigators of, and the ringleaders in, the opposition as in Thessalonica (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span>). No such crowds (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλους</span></span>) came to the synagogue when they were the speakers.</p>
<p><b>With jealousy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλου</span></span>). Genitive case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζεω</span></span>, to boil) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επλησθησαν</span></span> (effective first aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιμπλημ</span></span>). Envy and jealousy arise between people of the same calling (doctors towards doctors, lawyers towards lawyers, preachers towards preachers). So these rabbis boiled with jealousy when they saw the crowds gathered to hear Paul and Barnabas.</p>
<p><b>Contradicted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντελεγον</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιλεγω</span></span>, old verb to speak against, to say a word in opposition to (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span>, face to face). It was interruption of the service and open opposition in the public meeting. Paul and Barnabas were guests by courtesy and, of course, could not proceed further, when denied that privilege.</p>
<p><b>Blasphemed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλασφημουντες</span></span>). Blaspheming. So the correct text without the addition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιλεγοντες</span></span> (repeated from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντελεγον</span></span> above). Common verb in the Gospels for saying injurious and harmful things. Doubtless these rabbis indulged in unkind personalities and made it plain that Paul and Barnabas were going beyond the limitations of pure Judaism in their contacts with Gentiles. </p>
