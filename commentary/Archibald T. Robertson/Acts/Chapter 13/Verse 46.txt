 Spake out boldly  (παρρησιασαμενο). First aorist middle participle of παρρησιαζομα, to use freedom in speaking, to assume boldness. Both Paul and Barnabas accepted the challenge of the rabbis. They would leave their synagogue, but not without a word of explanation.It was necessary to you first  (Hυμιν ην αναγκαιον πρωτον). They had done their duty and had followed the command of Jesus (Acts 1:8). They use the very language of Peter in Acts 3:26 (υμιν πρωτον) "to you first." This position Paul as the apostle to the Gentiles will always hold, the Jew first in privilege and penalty (Romans 1:16; Romans 2:9; Romans 2:10).Ye thrust it from you  (απωθεισθε αυτον). Present middle (indirect, from yourselves) indicative of απωθεω, to push from. Vigorous verb seen already in Acts 7:27; Acts 7:39 which see.Judge yourselves unworthy  (ουκ αξιους κρινετε εαυτους). Present active indicative of the common verb κρινω, to judge or decide with the reflexive pronoun expressed. Literally, Do not judge yourselves worthy. By their action and their words they had taken a violent and definite stand.Lo, we turn to the Gentiles  (ιδου στρεφομεθα εις τα εθνη). It is a crisis (ιδου, lo): "Lo, we turn ourselves to the Gentiles." Probably also aoristic present, we now turn (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 864-70). Στρεφομεθα is probably the direct middle (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 806-08) though the aorist passive εστραφην is so used also (Acts 7:39). It is a dramatic moment as Paul and Barnabas turn from the Jews to the Gentiles, a prophecy of the future history of Christianity. In Acts 13:9-11 Paul will discuss at length the rejection of Christ by the Jews and the calling of the Gentiles to be the real (the spiritual) Israel.
