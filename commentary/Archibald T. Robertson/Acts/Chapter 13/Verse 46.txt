<p><b> Spake out boldly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησιασαμενο</span></span>). First aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησιαζομα</span></span>, to use freedom in speaking, to assume boldness. Both Paul and Barnabas accepted the challenge of the rabbis. They would leave their synagogue, but not without a word of explanation.</p>
<p><b>It was necessary to you first </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυμιν ην αναγκαιον πρωτον</span></span>). They had done their duty and had followed the command of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8">Acts 1:8</span>). They use the very language of Peter in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:26">Acts 3:26</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν πρωτον</span></span>) "to you first." This position Paul as the apostle to the Gentiles will always hold, the Jew first in privilege and penalty (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:9">Romans 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:10">Romans 2:10</span>).</p>
<p><b>Ye thrust it from you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απωθεισθε αυτον</span></span>). Present middle (indirect, from yourselves) indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απωθεω</span></span>, to push from. Vigorous verb seen already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:27">Acts 7:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:39">Acts 7:39</span> which see.</p>
<p><b>Judge yourselves unworthy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ αξιους κρινετε εαυτους</span></span>). Present active indicative of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>, to judge or decide with the reflexive pronoun expressed.

<p><b>Lo, we turn to the Gentiles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδου στρεφομεθα εις τα εθνη</span></span>). It is a crisis (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδου</span></span>, lo): "Lo, we turn ourselves to the Gentiles." Probably also aoristic present, we now turn (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 864-70). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Στρεφομεθα</span></span> is probably the direct middle (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 806-08) though the aorist passive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστραφην</span></span> is so used also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:39">Acts 7:39</span>). It is a dramatic moment as Paul and Barnabas turn from the Jews to the Gentiles, a prophecy of the future history of Christianity. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:9-11">Acts 13:9-11</span> Paul will discuss at length the rejection of Christ by the Jews and the calling of the Gentiles to be the real (the spiritual) Israel. </p>
