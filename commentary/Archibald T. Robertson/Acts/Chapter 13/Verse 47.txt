<p><b> For so hath the Lord commanded us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως γαρ εντεταλτα ημιν ο κυριος</span></span>). Perfect middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντελλω</span></span>, poetic (Pindar) and late verb to enjoin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:2">Acts 1:2</span>). The command of the Lord Paul finds in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:6">Isaiah 49:6</span> quoted by Simeon also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:32">Luke 2:32</span>). The conviction of Paul's mind was now made clear by the fact of the rejection by the Jews. He could now see more clearly the words of the prophet about the Gentiles: The Messiah is declared by God in Isaiah to be "a light to the Gentiles" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνων</span></span>, objective genitive), "a light for revelation to the Gentiles" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φως εις αποκαλυψιν εθνων</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:32">Luke 2:32</span>). So Paul is carrying out the will of God in turning to the Gentiles. He will still appeal to the Jews elsewhere as they allow him to do so, but not here.</p>
<p><b>That thou shouldest be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του εινα σε</span></span>). Genitive articular infinitive of purpose with the accusative of general reference. This is all according to God's fixed purpose (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεθεικα</span></span>, perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Unto the uttermost part of the earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως εσχατου της γης</span></span>). Unto the last portion (genitive neuter, not feminine) of the earth. It is a long time from Paul to now, not to say from Isaiah to now, and not yet has the gospel been carried to half of the people of earth. God's people are slow in carrying out God's plans for salvation. </p>
