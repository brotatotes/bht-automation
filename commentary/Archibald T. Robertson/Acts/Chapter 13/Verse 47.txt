 For so hath the Lord commanded us  (ουτως γαρ εντεταλτα ημιν ο κυριος). Perfect middle indicative of εντελλω, poetic (Pindar) and late verb to enjoin (Acts 1:2). The command of the Lord Paul finds in Isaiah 49:6 quoted by Simeon also (Luke 2:32). The conviction of Paul's mind was now made clear by the fact of the rejection by the Jews. He could now see more clearly the words of the prophet about the Gentiles: The Messiah is declared by God in Isaiah to be "a light to the Gentiles" (εθνων, objective genitive), "a light for revelation to the Gentiles" (φως εις αποκαλυψιν εθνων, Luke 2:32). So Paul is carrying out the will of God in turning to the Gentiles. He will still appeal to the Jews elsewhere as they allow him to do so, but not here.That thou shouldest be  (του εινα σε). Genitive articular infinitive of purpose with the accusative of general reference. This is all according to God's fixed purpose (τεθεικα, perfect active indicative of τιθημ).Unto the uttermost part of the earth  (εως εσχατου της γης). Unto the last portion (genitive neuter, not feminine) of the earth. It is a long time from Paul to now, not to say from Isaiah to now, and not yet has the gospel been carried to half of the people of earth. God's people are slow in carrying out God's plans for salvation.
