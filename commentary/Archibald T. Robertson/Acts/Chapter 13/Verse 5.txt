 Proclaimed  (κατηγγελλον). Imperfect active of καταγγελλω, inchoative, began to proclaim. This was Paul's rule of procedure, "to the Jew first" (Romans 1:16; Acts 13:46; Acts 17:2; Acts 18:4; Acts 18:19; Acts 19:8).They had also  (ειχον δε κα). Imperfect active, descriptive.As their attendant  (υπηρετην). Literally, "under-rower" (υπο, ηρετης) in the trireme. Probably here minister (χαζζαν) or assistant in the synagogue as in Luke 4:20. Cf. Matthew 5:25. It is not clear what John Mark did, though he was evidently selected by Barnabas as his cousin. He may have helped in the baptizing. There were probably others also in the company (verse Acts 13:13). The "also" may mean that Mark did some preaching. Barnabas was probably the leader in the work in these Jewish synagogues.
