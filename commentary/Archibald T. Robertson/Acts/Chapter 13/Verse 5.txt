Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταγγελλω</span></span>, inchoative, began to proclaim. This was Paul's rule of procedure, "to the Jew first" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:2">Acts 17:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:4">Acts 18:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:19">Acts 18:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:8">Acts 19:8</span>).</p>

<p><b>As their attendant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπηρετην</span></span>). Literally, "under-rower" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο, ηρετης</span></span>) in the trireme. Probably here minister (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαζζαν</span></span>) or assistant in the synagogue as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:20">Luke 4:20</span>. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:25">Matthew 5:25</span>. It is not clear what John Mark did, though he was evidently selected by Barnabas as his cousin. He may have helped in the baptizing. There were probably others also in the company (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:13">Acts 13:13</span>). The "also" may mean that Mark did some preaching. Barnabas was probably the leader in the work in these Jewish synagogues. </p>
