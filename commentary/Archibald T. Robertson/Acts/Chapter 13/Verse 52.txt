<p><b> And the disciples </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο τε</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε μαθητα</span></span>). The Gentile Christians in Antioch in Pisidia. Persecution had precisely the opposite effect to the intention of the Jews for they "were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επληρουντο χαρας κα πνευματος αγιου</span></span>). Imperfect passive, they kept on being filled. It had been so before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:31">Acts 4:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:4">Acts 8:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:31">Acts 9:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:24">Acts 12:24</span>). The blood of the martyrs is still the seed of the church. </p>
