 They called  (εκαλουν). Inchoative imperfect began to call.Barnabas, Jupiter  (τον Βαρναβαν Δια). Because Barnabas was the older and the more imposing in appearance. Paul admits that he was not impressive in looks (2 Corinthians 10:10).And Paul, Mercury  (τον δε Παυλον Hερμην). Mercury (Hερμης) was the messenger of the gods, and the spokesman of Zeus. Hερμης was of beautiful appearance and eloquent in speech, the inventor of speech in legend. Our word hermeneutics or science of interpretation comes from this word (Hebrews 7:2; John 1:38).Because he was the chief speaker  (επειδη αυτος ην ο ηγουμενος του λογου). Paul was clearly "the leader of the talk." So it seemed a clear case to the natives. If preachers always knew what people really think of them! Whether Paul was alluding to his experience in Lystra or not in Galatians 4:14, certainly they did receive him as an angel of God, as if "Mercury" in reality.
