<p><b> They called </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαλουν</span></span>). Inchoative imperfect began to call.</p>
<p><b>Barnabas, Jupiter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον Βαρναβαν Δια</span></span>). Because Barnabas was the older and the more imposing in appearance. Paul admits that he was not impressive in looks (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>).</p>
<p><b>And Paul, Mercury </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον δε Παυλον Hερμην</span></span>). Mercury (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hερμης</span></span>) was the messenger of the gods, and the spokesman of Zeus. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hερμης</span></span> was of beautiful appearance and eloquent in speech, the inventor of speech in legend. Our word hermeneutics or science of interpretation comes from this word (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:2">Hebrews 7:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:38">John 1:38</span>).</p>
<p><b>Because he was the chief speaker </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επειδη αυτος ην ο ηγουμενος του λογου</span></span>). Paul was clearly "the leader of the talk." So it seemed a clear case to the natives. If preachers always knew what people really think of them! Whether Paul was alluding to his experience in Lystra or not in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:14">Galatians 4:14</span>, certainly they did receive him as an angel of God, as if "Mercury" in reality. </p>
