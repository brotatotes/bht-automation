<p><b> Having heard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουσαντες</span></span>). Such elaborate preparation "with the multitudes" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν τοις οχλοις</span></span>) spread rumours and some who spoke Greek told Paul and Barnabas. It is possible that the priest of Jupiter may have sent a formal request that the visiting "gods" might come out to the statue by the temple gates to make it a grand occasion. They rent their garments (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαρρηξαντες</span></span>). First aorist active participle from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαρρηγνυμ</span></span>, old verb to rend in two. Like the high priest in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:65">Matthew 26:65</span> as if an act of sacrilege was about to be committed. It was strange conduct for the supposed gods!</p>
<p><b>Sprang forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεπηδησαν</span></span>). First aorist (ingressive) active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπηδαω</span></span> (note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>), old verb, here only in the N.T. It was all a sign of grief and horror with loud outcries (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραζοντες</span></span>). </p>
