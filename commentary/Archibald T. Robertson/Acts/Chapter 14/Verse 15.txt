<p><b> Sirs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανδρες</span></span>). Literally, Men. Abrupt, but courteous.</p>
<p><b>We also are men of like passions with you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ημεις ομοιοπαθεις εσμεν υμιν ανθρωπο</span></span>). Old adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιος</span></span> (like) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασχω</span></span>, to experience. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:17">James 5:17</span>. It means "of like nature" more exactly and affected by like sensations, not "gods" at all. Their conduct was more serious than the obeisance of Cornelius to Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:25">Acts 10:25</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυμιν</span></span> is associative instrumental case.</p>
<p><b>And bring you good tidings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιζομενο</span></span>). No "and" in the Greek, just the present middle participle, "gospelizing you." They are not gods, but evangelists. Here we have Paul's message to a pagan audience without the Jewish environment and he makes the same line of argument seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:21-32">Acts 17:21-32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18-23">Romans 1:18-23</span>. At Antioch in Pisidia we saw Paul's line of approach to Jews and proselytes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:16-41">Acts 13:16-41</span>).</p>
<p><b>That ye should turn from these vain things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο τουτων των ματαιων επιστρεφειν</span></span>). He boldly calls the worship of Jupiter and Mercury and all idols "vain" or empty things, pointing to the statues and the temple.</p>
<p><b>Unto the living God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ θεον ζωντα</span></span>). They must go the whole way. Our God is a live God, not a dead statue. Paul is fond of this phrase (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:16">2 Corinthians 6:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:26">Romans 9:26</span>).</p>
<p><b>Who made </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος εποιησεν</span></span>). The one God is alive and is the Creator of the Universe just as Paul will argue in Athens (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:24">Acts 17:24</span>). Paul here quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+146:6">Psalms 146:6</span> and has <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:1">Genesis 1:1</span> in mind. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:9">1 Thessalonians 1:9</span> where a new allegiance is also claimed as here. </p>
