<p><b> And yet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιτο</span></span>). Old Greek compound particle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα το</span></span>). In the N.T. twice only, once with finite verb as here, once with the participle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:3">Hebrews 4:3</span>).</p>
<p><b>Without witness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτυρον</span></span>). Old adjective (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυς</span></span>, witness), only here in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Left </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφηκεν</span></span>). First aorist active (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κ</span></span> aorist indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιημ</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>In that he did good </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθουργων</span></span>). Present active causal participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθουργεω</span></span>, late and rare verb (also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθοεργεω</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:18">1 Timothy 6:18</span>), reading of the oldest MSS. here for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθοποιεω</span></span>, to do good. Note two other causal participles here parallel with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθουργων</span></span>, viz., <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδους</span></span> ("giving you") present active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμι, εμπιπλων</span></span> ("filling") present active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπιμπλαω</span></span> (late form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπιμπλημ</span></span>). This witness to God (his doing good, giving rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness) they could receive without the help of the Old Testament revelation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>). Zeus was regarded as the god of rain (Jupiter Pluvius) and Paul claims the rain and the fruitful (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρποφορουσ, καρπος</span></span>, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερω</span></span>, fruit bearing, old word, here alone in N.T.) seasons as coming from God. Lycaonia was often dry and it would be an appropriate item. "Mercury, as the God of merchandise, was also the dispenser of food" (Vincent). Paul does not talk about laws of nature as if they governed themselves, but he sees the living God "behind the drama of the physical world" (Furneaux). These simple country people could grasp his ideas as he claims everything for the one true God.</p>
<p><b>Gladness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευφροσυνης</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευφρων</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρην</span></span>), good cheer. In the N.T. only <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:28">Acts 2:28</span> and here. Cheerfulness should be our normal attitude when we consider God's goodness. Paul does not here mention Christ because he had the single definite purpose to dissuade them from worshipping Barnabas and himself. </p>
