<p><b> But there came thither Jews from Antioch and Iconium </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Επηλθαν δε απο Αντιοχειας κα Ικονιου Ιουδαιο</span></span>). Came to or upon them, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επηλθαν</span></span>, second aorist (ingressive) indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επερχομα</span></span>. Whether news of the miracle had reached those cities we do not know. These may have been travelling grain merchants. At any rate there was an interval in which Paul and Barnabas won some disciples (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:22">Acts 14:22</span>). There would be a natural reaction, even revulsion, in the minds of many who had come so near to worshipping Paul and Barnabas. The pendulum swings easily from one extreme to the other. The hostile Jews from Antioch and Iconium may even have followed Paul and Barnabas along the fine Roman road on purpose to keep them on the run. They had driven them out of Antioch and out of Iconium and now appear at Lystra at an opportune moment for their work.</p>
<p><b>Having persuaded the multitudes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεισαντες τους οχλους</span></span>). First aorist (effective) active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθω</span></span>. They had complete success with many and struck at the psychological moment.</p>
<p><b>They stoned Paul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθασαντες τον Παυλον</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθαζω</span></span>, late verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθος</span></span> for throwing stones (used by Paul referring to this one incident when alone he was stoned, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:25">2 Corinthians 11:25</span>). The wounds inflicted may have left some of the scars (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στιγματα</span></span>) mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:17">Galatians 6:17</span>. They stoned Paul as the chief speaker (Mercury) and passed by Barnabas (Jupiter). It was a Jewish mode of punishment as against Stephen and these Jews knew that Paul was the man that they had to deal with. Hackett notes that the Jews with two exceptions incited the persecutions which Paul endured. The exceptions were in Philippi (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:16-40">Acts 16:16-40</span>) and Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:23-41">Acts 19:23-41</span>).</p>
<p><b>Dragged him out of the city </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσυρον εξω της πολεως</span></span>). They hurled Stephen outside of the city before stoning him (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">7:58</span></span>). It was a hurried and irregular proceeding, but they were dragging (imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συρω</span></span>, old verb) Paul out now.</p>
<p><b>Supposing that he were dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομιζοντες αυτον τεθνηκενα</span></span>). Present active participle with infinitive (second perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θνησκω</span></span>) in indirect discourse with accusative of general reference. The Jews are jubilant this time with memories of Paul's escape at Antioch and Iconium. The pagan mob feel that they have settled accounts for their narrow escape from worshipping two Jewish renegade preachers. It was a good day's work for them all. Luke does not say that Paul was actually dead. </p>
