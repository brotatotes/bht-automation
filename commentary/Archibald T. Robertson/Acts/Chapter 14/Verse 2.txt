<p><b> That were disobedient </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο απειθησαντες</span></span>). First aorist active articular participle, not the present <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απειθουντες</span></span> as the Textus Receptus has it. But the meaning is probably the Jews that disbelieved, rather than that disobeyed. Strictly <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απειθεω</span></span> does mean to disobey and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιστεω</span></span> to disbelieve, but that distinction is not observed in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span> nor in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:9">Acts 19:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:24">Acts 28:24</span>. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απειθεω</span></span> means to be <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απειθης</span></span>, to be unwilling to be persuaded or to withhold belief and then also to withhold obedience. The two meanings run into one another. To disbelieve the word of God is to disobey God.</p>
<p><b>Made them evil affected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκακωσαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακοω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακος</span></span>, to do evil to, to ill-treat, then in later Greek as here to embitter, to exasperate as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+105:32">Psalms 105:32</span> and in Josephus. In this sense only here in the N.T. Evidently Paul preached the same message as in Antioch for it won both Jews and Gentiles, and displeased the rabbis. Codex Bezae adds here that "the chiefs of the synagogue and the rulers" brought persecution upon Paul and Barnabas just as was argued about Antioch. Outside the synagogue the Jews would poison the minds of the Gentiles against Paul and Barnabas. "The story of Thecla suggests a means, and perhaps the apostles were brought before the magistrates on some charge of interference with family life. The magistrates however must have seen at once that there was no legal case against them; and by a sentence of acquittal or in some other way the Lord gave peace" (Rackham). As we have it, the story of Paul and Thecla undoubtedly has apocryphal features, though Thecla may very well be an historical character here at Iconium where the story is located. Certainly the picture of Paul herein drawn cannot be considered authentic though a true tradition may underlie it: "bald, bowlegged, strongly built, small in stature, with large eyes and meeting eyebrows and longish nose; full of grace; sometimes looking like a man, sometimes having the face of an angel." </p>
