<p><b> When they had preached the gospel to that city </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελισαμενο την πολιν εκεινην</span></span>). Having evangelized (first aorist middle participle) that city, a smaller city and apparently with no trouble from the Jews.</p>
<p><b>Had made many disciples </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαθητευσαντες ικανους</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαθητευω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαθητης</span></span>, a learner or disciple. Late verb in Plutarch, to be a disciple (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:57">Matthew 27:57</span> like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:38">John 19:38</span>) and then to disciple (old English, Spenser), to make a disciple as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> and here. Paul and Barnabas were literally here obeying the command of Jesus in discipling people in this heathen city.</p>
<p><b>They returned to Lystra and to Iconium, and to Antioch </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεστρεψαν εις την Λυστραν κα εις Ικονιον κα εις Αντιοχειαν</span></span>). Derbe was the frontier city of the Roman empire. The quickest way to return to Antioch in Syria would have been by the Cilician Gates or by the pass over Mt. Taurus by which Paul and Silas will come to Derbe in the second tour (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:41-16">Acts 15:41-16</span>), but difficult to travel in winter. But it was necessary to revisit the churches in Lystra, Iconium, Antioch in Pisidia and to see that they were able to withstand persecution. Paul was a Roman citizen though he had not made use of this privilege as yet for his own protection. Against mob violence it would count for little, but he did not hesitate. Paul had been stoned in Lystra, threatened in Iconium, expelled in Antioch. He shows his wisdom in conserving his work. </p>
