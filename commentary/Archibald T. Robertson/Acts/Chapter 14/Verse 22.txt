<p><b> Confirming </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστηριζοντες</span></span>). Late verb (in LXX), in N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:22">Acts 14:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:32">Acts 15:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:41">Acts 15:41</span>, to make more firm, to give additional (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>) strength. Each time in Acts the word is used concerning these churches.</p>
<p><b>To continue in the faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμμενειν τη πιστε</span></span>). To remain in with locative, old verb. It is possible that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span> here has the notion of creed as Paul uses it later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιμενω</span></span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:8">1 Timothy 5:8</span>). It seems to be here more than trust or belief. These recent converts from heathenism were ill-informed, were persecuted, had broken family and social ties, greatly needed encouragement if they were to hold out.</p>
<p><b>We must </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε ημας</span></span>). It does not follow from this use of "we" that Luke was present, since it is a general proposition applying to all Christians at all times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:12">2 Timothy 3:12</span>). Luke, of course, approved this principle. Knowling asks why Timothy may not have told Luke about Paul's work. It all sounds like quotation of Paul's very language. Note the change of construction here after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλουντες</span></span> (infinitive of indirect command, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμμενειν</span></span>, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ δε</span></span>, indirect assertion). They needed the right understanding of persecution as we all do. Paul frankly warned these new converts in this heathen environment of the many tribulations through which they must enter the Kingdom of God (the culmination at last) as he did at Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:20">Acts 20:20</span>) and as Jesus had done (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33">John 16:33</span>). These saints were already converted. </p>
