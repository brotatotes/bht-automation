<p><b> And when they had appointed for them elders in every church </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειροτονησαντες δε αυτοις κατ' εκκλησιαν πρεσβυτερους</span></span>). They needed also some form of organization, though already churches. Note distributive use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησιαν</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:46">Acts 2:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:42">Acts 5:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χειροτονεω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειροτονος</span></span>, extending the hand, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρ</span></span>, hand, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεινω</span></span>, to stretch) is an old verb that originally meant to vote by show of the hands, finally to appoint with the approval of an assembly that chooses as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:19">2 Corinthians 8:19</span>, and then to appoint without regard to choice as in Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. XIII. 2, 2) of the appointment of Jonathan as high priest by Alexander. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:41">Acts 10:41</span> the compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προχειρατονεω</span></span> is used of witnesses appointed by God. But the seven (deacons) were first selected by the Jerusalem church and then appointed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταστησομεν</span></span>) by the apostles. That is probably the plan contemplated by Paul in his directions to Titus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span>) about the choice of elders. It is most likely that this plan was the one pursued by Paul and Barnabas with these churches. They selected the elders in each instance and Paul and Barnabas "ordained" them as we say, though the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειροτονεω</span></span> does not mean that. "Elders" were mentioned first in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>. Later Paul will give the requirements expected in these "elders" or "bishops" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:1-7">1 Timothy 3:1-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5-9">Titus 1:5-9</span>. It is fairly certain that these elders were chosen to correspond in a general way with the elders in the Jewish synagogue after which the local church was largely copied as to organization and worship. Paul, like Jesus, constantly worshipped and spoke in the synagogues. Already it is plain, as at Antioch in Syria (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>), that the Christians can no longer count on the use of the Jewish synagogue. They must have an organization of their own. The use of the plural here implies what was true at Philippi (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>) and Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17">Acts 20:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>) that each church (one in each city) "had its college of elders" (Hackett) as in Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:18">Acts 21:18</span>). Elder (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτερος</span></span>) was the Jewish name and bishop (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισκοπος</span></span>) the Greek name for the same office. "Those who are called elders in speaking of Jewish communities are called bishops in speaking of Gentile communities" (Hackett). Hovey rightly holds against Hackett that teaching was a normal function of these elders, pastors or bishops as they were variously called (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:9">Titus 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:30">1 Corinthians 12:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>).</p>
<p><b>Had prayed with fasting </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευξαμενο μετα νηστειων</span></span>). It was a serious matter, this formal setting apart of these "elders" in the churches. So it was done in a public meeting with prayer and fasting as when Paul and Barnabas were sent forth from Antioch in Syria (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:3">Acts 13:3</span>) on this mission tour.</p>
<p><b>They commended them to the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεθεντο αυτους τω κυριω</span></span>). Second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρατιθημ</span></span>. Old and solemn word, to entrust, to deposit as in a bank (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:2">2 Timothy 2:2</span>). Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραθηκη</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:20">1 Timothy 6:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:14">2 Timothy 1:14</span>. It was all that they could now do, to commit them to the Lord Jesus. Jesus used this word on the cross (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:32">Luke 22:32</span>).</p>
<p><b>On whom they had believed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ον πεπιστευκεισαν</span></span>). Past perfect indicative (without augment) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>. They had "trusted" in Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>) and Paul now "entrusts" them to him with confidence. It was a solemn and serious occasion in each instance as it always is to set apart men for the ministry. These men may not have been ideal men for this service, but they were the only ones available and they were chosen from the actual membership in each instance, men who knew local conditions and problems. </p>
