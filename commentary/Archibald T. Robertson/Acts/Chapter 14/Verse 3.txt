<p><b> Long time therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικανον μεν ουν χρονον</span></span>). Accusative of duration of time (possibly six months) and note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν ουν</span></span>. There is an antithesis in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσχισθη δε</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:4">Acts 14:4</span>) and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:5">Acts 14:5</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο δε</span></span>). After the persecution and vindication there was a season of great opportunity which Paul and Barnabas used to the full, "speaking boldly" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησιαζομενο</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span> at Antioch in Pisidia, "in the Lord" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τω κυριω</span></span>), upon the basis of the Lord Jesus as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:17">Acts 4:17</span>. And the Lord Jesus "bore witness to the word of his grace" as he always does, "granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδοντ σημεια κα τερατα γινεσθα δια των χειρων αυτων</span></span>). Present participle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδοντ</span></span>) and present infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινεσθα</span></span>) repetition of both signs and wonders (note both words) just as had happened with Peter and John and the other apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:43">Acts 2:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:29">Acts 4:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:12">Acts 5:12</span>; cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span>). The time of peace could not last forever with such a work of grace as this. A second explosion of persecution was bound to come and some of the MSS. actually have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ δευτερου</span></span> (a second time). </p>
