<p><b> But the multitude of the city was divided </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσχισθη δε το πληθος της πολεως</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχιζω</span></span>, old verb to split, to make a schism or factions as Sadducees and Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:7">Acts 23:7</span>). This division was within the Gentile populace. Part held (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μεν ησαν</span></span>), literally "some were with the Jews" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν τοις Ιουδαιοις</span></span>), part with the apostles (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε συν τοις αποστολοις</span></span>). Common demonstrative of contrast (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μεν, ο δε</span></span>, Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 694). The Jewish leaders made some impression on the Gentiles as at Antioch in Pisidia and later at Thessalonica (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:4">Acts 17:4</span>). This is the first time in the Acts that Paul and Barnabas are termed "apostles" (see also verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:14">Acts 14:14</span>). Elsewhere in the Acts the word is restricted to the twelve. Certainly Luke does not here employ it in that technical sense. To have followed Jesus in his ministry and to have seen the Risen Christ was essential to the technical use (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span>). Whether Barnabas had seen the Risen Christ we do not know, but certainly Paul had (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:8">1 Corinthians 15:8</span>). Paul claimed to be an apostle on a par with the twelve (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:16-18">Galatians 1:16-18</span>). The word originally means simply one sent (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:16">John 13:16</span>) like messengers of the churches with the collection (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23">2 Corinthians 8:23</span>). The Jews used it of those sent from Jerusalem to collect the temple tribute. Paul applies the word to James the Lord's brother (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:19">Galatians 1:19</span>), to Epaphroditus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</span>) as the messenger of the church in Philippi, to Silvanus and Timothy (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:6">1 Thessalonians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:5">Acts 18:5</span>), apparently to Apollos (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:9">1 Corinthians 4:9</span>), and to Andronicus and Junias (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:6">Romans 16:6</span>). He even calls the Judaizers "false apostles" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:13">2 Corinthians 11:13</span>). </p>
