<p><b> An onset </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορμη</span></span>). A rush or impulse as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:4">James 3:4</span>. Old word, but only twice in the N.T. (here and James). It probably denotes not an actual attack so much as the open start, the co-operation of both Jews and Gentiles (the disaffected portion), "with their rulers" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν τοις αρχουσιν αυτων</span></span>), that is the rulers of the Jewish synagogue (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:27">Acts 13:27</span>). The city officials would hardly join in a mob like this, though Hackett and Rackham think that the city magistrates were also involved as in Antioch in Pisidia (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:50">Acts 13:50</span>).</p>
<p><b>To entreat them shamefully </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υβρισα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υβριζω</span></span>, old verb to insult insolently. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:6">Matthew 22:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:32">Luke 18:32</span>.</p>
<p><b>To stone </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθοβολησα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθοβολεω</span></span>, late verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθοβολος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθος</span></span>, stone, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλω</span></span>, to throw) to pelt with stones, the verb used of the stoning of Stephen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:58">Acts 7:58</span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:35">Matthew 21:35</span>. The plan to stone them shows that the Jews were in the lead and followed by the Gentile rabble. "Legal proceedings having failed the only resource left for the Jews was illegal violence" (Rackham). </p>
