<p><b> At Lystra </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Λυστροις</span></span>). Neuter plural as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:2">Acts 16:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:11">2 Timothy 3:11</span> while feminine singular in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:6">Acts 14:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:21">Acts 14:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span>. There was apparently no synagogue in Lystra and so not many Jews. Paul and Barnabas had to do open-air preaching and probably had difficulty in being understood by the natives though both Greek and Latin inscriptions were discovered here by Professor Sterrett in 1885. The incident narrated here (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:8-18">Acts 14:8-18</span>) shows how they got a real hearing among these rude heathen.</p>
<p><b>There sat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθητο</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθημα</span></span>. Was sitting. This case is very much like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:1-11">Acts 3:1-11</span>, healed by Peter. Possibly outside the gate (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:13">Acts 14:13</span>) or some public place.</p>
<p><b>Impotent in his feet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδυνατος τοις ποσιν</span></span>). Old verbal, but only here in the N.T. in this sense except figuratively in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:1">Romans 15:1</span>. Elsewhere it means "impossible" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:26">Matthew 19:26</span>). Locative case. Common in medical writers in the sense of "impotent." So Tobit 2:10; 5:9.</p>
<p><b>Had walked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεπατησεν</span></span>). So best MSS., first aorist active indicative "walked," not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεπεπατηκε</span></span>, "had walked" (past perfect active). </p>
