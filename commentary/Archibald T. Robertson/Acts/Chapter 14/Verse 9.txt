<p><b> The same </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>). Just "this one."</p>
<p><b>Heard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουεν</span></span>). Imperfect active, was listening to Paul speaking (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλουντος</span></span>). Either at the gate or in the market place (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:17">Acts 17:17</span>) Paul was preaching to such as would listen or could understand his Greek (<i>Koine</i>). Ramsay (<i>St. Paul the Traveller</i>, pp. 114, 116) thinks that the cripple was a proselyte. At any rate he may have heard of the miracles wrought at Iconium (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:3">Acts 14:3</span>) and Paul may have spoken of the work of healing wrought by Jesus. This man was "no mendicant pretender," for his history was known from his birth.</p>
<p><b>Fastening his eyes upon him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατενισας αυτω</span></span>). Just as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:9">Acts 13:9</span> of Paul and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:10">Acts 1:10</span> which see. Paul saw a new hope in the man's eyes and face.</p>
<p><b>He had faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχε πιστιν</span></span>). Present active indicative retained in indirect discourse.</p>
<p><b>To be made whole </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του σωθηνα</span></span>). Genitive of articular first aorist passive infinitive (purpose and result combined) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωζω</span></span>, to make sound and also to save. Here clearly to make whole or well as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:50">Luke 7:50</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:16">Acts 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:10">Acts 4:10</span>). </p>
