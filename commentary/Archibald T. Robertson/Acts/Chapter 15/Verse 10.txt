<p><b> Why tempt ye God? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ πειραζετε τον θεον;</span></span>). By implying that God had made a mistake this time, though right about Cornelius. It is a home-thrust. They were refusing to follow the guidance of God like the Israelites at Massah and Meribah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+17:7">Exodus 17:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+6:16">Deuteronomy 6:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:9">1 Corinthians 10:9</span>).</p>
<p><b>That ye should put </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιθεινα</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτιθημ</span></span>, epexegetic, explaining the tempting.</p>
<p><b>A yoke upon the neck </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζυγον επ τον τραχηλον</span></span>). Familiar image of oxen with yokes upon the necks. Paul's very image for the yoke of bondage of the Mosaic law in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>. It had probably been used in the private interview. Cf. the words of Jesus about the Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:4">Matthew 23:4</span>) and how easy and light his own yoke is (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:30">Matthew 11:30</span>).</p>
<p><b>Were able to bear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυσαμεν βαστασα</span></span>). Neither our fathers nor we had strength (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυω</span></span>) to carry this yoke which the Judaizers wish to put on the necks of the Gentiles. Peter speaks as the spiritual emancipator. He had been slow to see the meaning of God's dealings with him at Joppa and Caesarea, but he has seen clearly by now. He takes his stand boldly with Paul and Barnabas for Gentile freedom. </p>
