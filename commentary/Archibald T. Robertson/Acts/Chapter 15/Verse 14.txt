<p><b> Hearken unto me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουσατε μου</span></span>). Usual appeal for attention. James was termed James the Just and was considered a representative of the Hebraic as opposed to the Hellenistic wing of the Jewish Christians (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>). The Judaizers had doubtless counted on him as a champion of their view and did later wrongfully make use of his name against Peter at Antioch (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:12">Galatians 2:12</span>). There was instant attention when James began to speak.</p>
<p><b>Symeon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συμεων</span></span>). The Aramaic form of Simon as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>. This little touch would show his affinities with the Jewish Christians (not the Judaizers). This Aramaic form is used also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:25">Luke 2:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34">Luke 2:34</span> of the old prophet in the temple. Possibly both forms (Symeon, Aramaic, and Simon, Greek) were current in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><b>How </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως</span></span>). Strictly, "according as," here like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span> in indirect discourse somewhat like the epexegetic or explanatory use in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:3">3 John 1:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>First </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτον</span></span>). Told by Peter in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:7">Acts 15:7</span>. James notes, as Peter did, that this experience of Barnabas and Paul is not the beginning of work among the Gentiles.</p>
<p><b>Did visit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεσκεψατο</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισκεπτομα</span></span>, old verb to look upon, to look after, provide for. This same verb occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:27">James 1:27</span> and is one of various points of similarity between this speech of James in Acts and the Epistle of James as shown by Mayor in his <i>Commentary on James</i>. Somehow Luke may have obtained notes of these various addresses.</p>
<p><b>To take from the Gentiles a people for his name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαβειν εξ εθνων λαον τω ονοματ αυτου</span></span>). Bengel calls this <i>egregium paradoxon</i>, a chosen people (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαον</span></span>) out of the Gentiles (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνων</span></span>). This is what is really involved in what took place at Caesarea at the hands of Peter and the campaign of Barnabas and Paul from Antioch. But such a claim of God's purpose called for proof from Scripture to convince Jews and this is precisely what James undertakes to give. This new Israel from among the Gentiles is one of Paul's great doctrines as set forth in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:3">Acts 15:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:9-11">Acts 15:9-11</span>. Note the use of God's "name" here for "the Israel of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:16">Galatians 6:16</span>). </p>
