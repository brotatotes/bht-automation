<p><b> That the residue of men may seek after the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως αν εκζητησωσιν ο καταλοιπο των ανθρωπων τον κυριον</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως</span></span> with the subjunctive (effective aorist active) to express purpose is common enough and note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> for an additional tone of uncertainty. On the rarity of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως</span></span> in the <i>Koine</i> see Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 986. Here the Gentiles are referred to. The Hebrew text is quite different, "that they may possess the remnant of Edom." Certainly the LXX suits best the point that James is making. But the closing words of this verse point definitely to the Gentiles both in the Hebrew and the LXX, "all the Gentiles" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα τα εθνη</span></span>). Another item of similarity between this speech and the Epistle of James is in the phrase "my name is called" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επικεκλητα το ονομα μου</span></span>) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:7">James 2:7</span>. The purpose of God, though future, is expressed by this perfect passive indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επικεκλητα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι-καλεω</span></span>, to call on. It is a Jewish way of speaking of those who worship God. </p>
