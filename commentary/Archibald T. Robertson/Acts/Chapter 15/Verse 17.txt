 That the residue of men may seek after the Lord  (οπως αν εκζητησωσιν ο καταλοιπο των ανθρωπων τον κυριον). The use of οπως with the subjunctive (effective aorist active) to express purpose is common enough and note αν for an additional tone of uncertainty. On the rarity of αν with οπως in the Koine see Robertson, Grammar, p. 986. Here the Gentiles are referred to. The Hebrew text is quite different, "that they may possess the remnant of Edom." Certainly the LXX suits best the point that James is making. But the closing words of this verse point definitely to the Gentiles both in the Hebrew and the LXX, "all the Gentiles" (παντα τα εθνη). Another item of similarity between this speech and the Epistle of James is in the phrase "my name is called" (επικεκλητα το ονομα μου) and James 2:7. The purpose of God, though future, is expressed by this perfect passive indicative επικεκλητα from επι-καλεω, to call on. It is a Jewish way of speaking of those who worship God.
