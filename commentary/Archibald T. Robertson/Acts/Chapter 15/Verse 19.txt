 Wherefore  (διο). "Because of which," this plain purpose of God as shown by Amos and Isaiah.My judgment is  (εγω κρινω). Note expression of εγω.I give my judgment . (Εγο χενσεο). James sums up the case as President of the Conference in a masterly fashion and with that consummate wisdom for which he is noted. It amounts to a resolution for the adoption by the assembly as happened (verse Acts 15:33).That we trouble not  (μη παρενοχλειν). Present active infinitive with μη in an indirect command (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1046) of παρενοχλεω, a common late verb, occurring here alone in the N.T. This double compound (παρα, εν) is from the old compound ενοχλεω (εν and οχλος, crowd, annoyance) seen in Luke 6:18; Hebrews 12:15, and means to cause trouble beside (παρα) one or in a matter. This is the general point of James which he explains further concerning "those who are turning from the Gentiles unto God," the very kind of people referred to in Amos.
