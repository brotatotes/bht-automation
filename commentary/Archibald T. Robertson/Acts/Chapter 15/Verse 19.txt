<p><b> Wherefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διο</span></span>). "Because of which," this plain purpose of God as shown by Amos and Isaiah.</p>
<p><b>My judgment is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω κρινω</span></span>). Note expression of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>I give my judgment </b>. (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγο χενσεο</span></span>). James sums up the case as President of the Conference in a masterly fashion and with that consummate wisdom for which he is noted. It amounts to a resolution for the adoption by the assembly as happened (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:33">Acts 15:33</span>).</p>
<p><b>That we trouble not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη παρενοχλειν</span></span>). Present active infinitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> in an indirect command (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1046) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρενοχλεω</span></span>, a common late verb, occurring here alone in the N.T. This double compound (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα, εν</span></span>) is from the old compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενοχλεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλος</span></span>, crowd, annoyance) seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:18">Luke 6:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:15">Hebrews 12:15</span>, and means to cause trouble beside (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>) one or in a matter. This is the general point of James which he explains further concerning "those who are turning from the Gentiles unto God," the very kind of people referred to in Amos. </p>
