<p><b> But that we write unto them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα επιστειλα αυτοις</span></span>). By way of contrast (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστελλω</span></span>, old verb to send to one (message, letter, etc.). Our word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστλε</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστολη</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:30">Acts 15:30</span>) comes from this verb. In the N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:22">Hebrews 13:22</span>, and possibly <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:25">Acts 21:25</span>.</p>
<p><b>That they abstain from </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του απεχεσθα</span></span>). The genitive of the articular infinitive of purpose, present middle (direct) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεχω</span></span>, old verb, to hold oneself back from. The best old MSS. do not have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>, but the ablative is clear enough in what follows. James agrees with Peter in his support of Paul and Barnabas in their contention for Gentile freedom from the Mosaic ceremonial law. The restrictions named by James affect the moral code that applies to all (idolatry, fornication, murder). Idolatry, fornication and murder were the outstanding sins of paganism then and now (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:15">Revelation 22:15</span>). Harnack argues ably against the genuineness of the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνικτου</span></span> (strangled) which is absent from D Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cyprian. It is a nice point, though the best MSS. have it in accord with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+17:10-16">Leviticus 17:10-16</span>. The problem is whether the words were added because "blood" was understood as not "murder," but a reference to the Mosaic regulation or whether it was omitted to remove the ceremonial aspect and make it all moral and ethical. The Western text omits the word also in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:29">Acts 15:29</span>. But with the word retained here and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:29">Acts 15:29</span> the solution of James is not a compromise, though there is a wise concession to Jewish feeling.</p>
<p><b>Pollutions of idols </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλισγηματων</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλισγεω</span></span> only in the LXX and this substantive nowhere else. The word refers to idolatrous practices (pollutions) and things sacrificed to idols (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδωλυθων</span></span>) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:29">Acts 15:29</span>, not to sacrificial meat sold in the market (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:27">1 Corinthians 10:27</span>), a matter not referred to here. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+17:1-9">Leviticus 17:1-9</span>. All the four items in the position of James (accepting <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνικτου</span></span>) are mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:17">Acts 15:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:18">Acts 15:18</span>. </p>
