<p><b> For Moses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μωυσης γαρ</span></span>). A reason why these four necessary things (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:28">Acts 15:28</span>) are named. In every city are synagogues where rabbis proclaim (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυσσοντας</span></span>) these matters. Hence the Gentile Christians would be giving constant offence to neglect them. The only point where modern Christian sentiment would object would be about "things strangled" and "blood" in the sense of any blood left in the animals, though most Christians probably agree with the feeling of James in objecting to blood in the food. If "blood" is taken to be "murder," that difficulty vanishes. Moses will suffer no loss for these Gentile Christians are not adherents of Judaism. </p>
