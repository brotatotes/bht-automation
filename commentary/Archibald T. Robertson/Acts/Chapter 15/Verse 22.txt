<p><b>With the whole church </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν ολε τη εκκλησια</span></span>). Probably by acclamation. It was a great victory. But James was a practical leader and he did not stop with speeches and a vote.</p>
<p><b>To choose men out of their company </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεζαμενους ανδρας εξ αυτων</span></span>). Accusative case, though dative just before (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις αποστολοις</span></span>, etc.), of first aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεγω</span></span>, to select. This loose case agreement appears also in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραψαντες</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:23">Acts 15:23</span> and in MSS. in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:25">Acts 15:25</span>. It is a common thing in all Greek writers (Paul, for instance), especially in the papyri and in the Apocalypse of John.</p>
<p><b>Judas called Barsabbas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιουδαν τον καλουμενον Βαρσαββαν</span></span>). Not otherwise known unless he is a brother of Joseph Barsabbas of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:23">Acts 1:23</span>, an early follower of Jesus.
