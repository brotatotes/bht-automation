 Then it seemed good  (Τοτε εδοξεν). First aorist active indicative of δοκεω. A regular idiom at the beginning of decrees. This Eirenicon of James commended itself to the whole assembly. Apparently a vote was taken which was unanimous, the Judaizers probably not voting. The apostles and the elders (τοις αποστολοις κα τοις πρεσβυτεροις, article with each, dative case) probably all vocally expressed their position.With the whole church  (συν ολε τη εκκλησια). Probably by acclamation. It was a great victory. But James was a practical leader and he did not stop with speeches and a vote.To choose men out of their company  (εκλεζαμενους ανδρας εξ αυτων). Accusative case, though dative just before (τοις αποστολοις, etc.), of first aorist middle participle of εκλεγω, to select. This loose case agreement appears also in γραψαντες in verse Acts 15:23 and in MSS. in verse Acts 15:25. It is a common thing in all Greek writers (Paul, for instance), especially in the papyri and in the Apocalypse of John.Judas called Barsabbas  (Ιουδαν τον καλουμενον Βαρσαββαν). Not otherwise known unless he is a brother of Joseph Barsabbas of Acts 1:23, an early follower of Jesus. The other, Silas, is probably a shortened form of Silvanus (Σιλουανος, 1 Peter 5:12), the companion of Paul in his second mission tour (Acts 15:32; Acts 15:41; Acts 16:25).Chief men  (ηγουμενους). Leaders, leading men (participle from ηγεομα, to lead).
