<p><b> And they wrote </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραψαντες</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span> and the nominative as if a principal verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεμψαν</span></span> had been used instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεμψα</span></span>, the first aorist active infinitive (anacoluthon). This committee of four (Judas, Silas, Barnabas, Paul) carried the letter which embodied the decision of the Conference. This letter is the writing out of the judgment of James and apparently written by him as the President.</p>
<p><b>The apostles and the elders, brethren </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αποστολο κα ο πρεσβυτεροι, αδελφο</span></span>). So the oldest and best MSS. without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> (and) before "brethren." This punctuation is probably correct and not "elder brethren." The inquiry had been sent to the apostles and elders (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:2">Acts 15:2</span>) though the whole church joined in the welcome (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:4">Acts 15:4</span>) and in the decision (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span>). The apostles and elders send the epistle, but call themselves "brothers to brothers," <i>Fratres Fratibus Salutem</i>. "The brothers" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις αδελφοις</span></span>) addressed (dative case) are of the Gentiles (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ εθνων</span></span>) and those in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia, because they were immediately involved. But the decision of this Conference was meant for Gentile Christians everywhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:4">Acts 16:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>Greeting </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χαιρειν</span></span>). The customary formula in the beginning of letters, the absolute infinitive (usually <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρειν</span></span>) with the nominative absolute also as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:26">Acts 23:26</span> and innumerable papyri (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1902f.). </p>
