<p><b> Certain which went from us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινες εξ ημων</span></span>, Aleph B omit <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξελθοντες</span></span>). A direct blow at the Judaizers, put in delicate language (we heard <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσαμεν</span></span>) as if only at Antioch (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:1">Acts 15:1</span>), and not also in Jerusalem in open meeting (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:5">Acts 15:5</span>).</p>
<p><b>Have troubled you with words </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εταραξαν υμας λογοις</span></span>). What a picture of turmoil in the church in Antioch, words, words, words. Aorist tense of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταρασσω</span></span>, to agitate, to make the heart palpitate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:1">John 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27">John 14:27</span>) and instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογοις</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Subverting your souls </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανασκευαζοντες τας ψυχας υμων</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανασκευαζω</span></span>, old verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκευος</span></span>, baggage) to pack up baggage, to plunder, to ravage. Powerful picture of the havoc wrought by the Judaizers among the simple-minded Greek Christians in Antioch.</p>
<p><b>To whom we gave no commandment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οις ου διεστειλαμεθα</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαστελλω</span></span>, old verb to draw asunder, to distinguish, to set forth distinctly, to command. This is a flat disclaimer of the whole conduct of the Judaizers in Antioch and in Jerusalem, a complete repudiation of their effort to impose the Mosaic ceremonial law upon the Gentile Christians. </p>
