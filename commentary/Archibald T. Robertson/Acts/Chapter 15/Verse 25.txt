 It seemed good unto us  (εδοξεν ημιν). See statement by Luke in verse Acts 15:22, and now this definite decision is in the epistle itself. It is repeated in verse Acts 15:28.Having come to one accord  (γενομενοις ομοθυμαδον). On this adverb, common in Acts, see on Acts 1:14. But γενομενοις clearly means that the final unity was the result of the Conference (private and public talks). The Judaizers are here brushed to one side as the defeated disturbers that they really were who had lacked the courage to vote against the majority.To choose out men and send them  (εκλεξαμενοις ανδρας πεμψα A B L, though Aleph C D read εκλεξαμενους as in verse Acts 15:22). Precisely the same idiom as in verse Acts 15:22, "having chosen out to send."With our beloved Barnabas and Paul  (συν τοις αγαπητοις ημων Βαρναβα κα Παυλω). The verbal adjective αγαπητοις (common in the N.T.) definitely sets the seal of warm approval on Barnabas and Paul. Paul (Galatians 2:9) confirms this by his statement concerning the right hand of fellowship given.
