<p><b> It seemed good unto us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοξεν ημιν</span></span>). See statement by Luke in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span>, and now this definite decision is in the epistle itself. It is repeated in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:28">Acts 15:28</span>.</p>
<p><b>Having come to one accord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενοις ομοθυμαδον</span></span>). On this adverb, common in Acts, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:14">Acts 1:14</span>. But <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενοις</span></span> clearly means that the final unity was the result of the Conference (private and public talks). The Judaizers are here brushed to one side as the defeated disturbers that they really were who had lacked the courage to vote against the majority.</p>
<p><b>To choose out men and send them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεξαμενοις ανδρας πεμψα</span></span> A B L, though Aleph C D read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεξαμενους</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span>). Precisely the same idiom as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span>, "having chosen out to send."</p>
<p><b>With our beloved Barnabas and Paul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν τοις αγαπητοις ημων Βαρναβα κα Παυλω</span></span>). The verbal adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπητοις</span></span> (common in the N.T.) definitely sets the seal of warm approval on Barnabas and Paul. Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>) confirms this by his statement concerning the right hand of fellowship given. </p>
