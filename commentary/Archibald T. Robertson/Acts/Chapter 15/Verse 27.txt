<p><b> Who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αυτους δια λογου απαγγελλοντας τα αυτα</span></span>). Literally, "they themselves also by speech announcing the same things." The present participle, as here, sometimes is used like the future to express purpose as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:26">Acts 3:26</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευλογουντα</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστειλεν</span></span> and so here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαγγελλοντας</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεσταλκαμεν</span></span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1128). Judas and Silas are specifically endorsed (perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστελλω</span></span>) as bearers of the epistle who will also verbally confirm the contents of the letter. </p>
