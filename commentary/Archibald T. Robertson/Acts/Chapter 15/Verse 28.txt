<p><b> To the Holy Spirit and to us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω πνευματ τω αγιω κα ημιν</span></span>). Dative case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοξεν</span></span> (third example, verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:25">Acts 15:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:28">Acts 15:28</span>). Definite claim that the church in this action had the guidance of the Holy Spirit. That fact was plain to the church from what had taken place in Caesarea and in this campaign of Paul and Barnabas (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:8">Acts 15:8</span>). Jesus had promised that the Holy Spirit would guide them into all truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:13">John 16:13</span>). Even so the church deliberated carefully before deciding. What a blessing it would be if this were always true! But even so the Judaizers are only silenced for the present, not convinced and only waiting for a better day to start over again.</p>
<p><b>No greater burden </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν πλεον βαρος</span></span>). The restrictions named did constitute some burden (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:12">Matthew 20:12</span>), for the old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρος</span></span> means weight or heaviness. Morality itself is a restraint upon one's impulses as is all law a prohibition against license. </p>
