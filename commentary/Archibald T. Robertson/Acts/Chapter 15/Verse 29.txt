<p><b> Than these necessary things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλην τουτων των επαναγκες</span></span>). This old adverb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγκη</span></span>) means on compulsion, of necessity. Here only in the N.T. For discussion of these items see on verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:20">Acts 15:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:21">Acts 15:21</span>. In comparison with the freedom won this "burden" is light and not to be regarded as a compromise in spite of the arguments of Lightfoot and Ramsay. It was such a concession as any converted Gentile would be glad to make even if "things strangled" be included. This "necessity" was not a matter of salvation but only for fellowship between Jews and Gentiles. The Judaizers made the law of Moses essential to salvation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:16">Acts 15:16</span>).</p>
<p><b>It shall be well with you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ πραξετε</span></span>). Ye shall fare well. A classical idiom used here effectively. The peace and concord in the fellowship of Jews and Gentiles will justify any slight concession on the part of the Gentiles. This letter is not laid down as a law, but it is the judgment of the Jerusalem Christians for the guidance of the Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:4">Acts 16:4</span>) and it had a fine effect at once (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:30-35">Acts 15:30-35</span>). Trouble did come later from the Judaizers who were really hostile to the agreement in Jerusalem, but that opposition in no way discredits the worth of the work of this Conference. No sane agreement will silence perpetual and professional disturbers like these Judaizers who will seek to unsettle Paul's work in Antioch, in Corinth, in Galatia, in Jerusalem, in Rome.</p>
<p><b>Fare ye well </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ερρωσθε</span></span>). <i>Valete</i>. Perfect passive imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρωννυμ</span></span>, to make strong. Common at the close of letters. Be made strong, keep well, fare well. Here alone in the N.T. though some MSS. have it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:30">Acts 23:30</span>. </p>
