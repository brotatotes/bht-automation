<p><b> But it seemed good unto Silas to abide there </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοξε δε Σιλα επιμεινα αυτου</span></span>). This verse is not in the Revised Version or in the text of Westcott and Hort, being absent from Aleph A B Vulgate, etc. It is clearly an addition to help explain the fact that Silas is back in Antioch in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:40">Acts 15:40</span>. But the "some days" of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:36">Acts 15:36</span> afforded abundant time for him to return from Jerusalem. He and Judas went first to Jerusalem to make a report of their mission. </p>
