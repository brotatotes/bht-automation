<p><b> Tarried </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διετριβον</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διατριβω</span></span>, old verb to pass time, seen already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:19">Acts 12:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:3">Acts 14:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:28">Acts 14:28</span>.</p>
<p><b>With many others also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα κα ετερων πολλων</span></span>). A time of general revival and naturally so after the victory at Jerusalem. It is at this point that it is probable that the sad incident took place told by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11-21">Galatians 2:11-21</span>. Peter came up to see how things were going in Antioch after Paul's victory in Jerusalem. At first Peter mingled freely with the Greek Christians without the compunctions shown at Caesarea and for which he had to answer in Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1-18">Acts 11:1-18</span>). Rumours of Peter's conduct reached Jerusalem and the Judaizers saw a chance to reopen the controversy on the line of social customs, a matter not passed on at the Jerusalem Conference. These Judaizers threaten Peter with a new trial and he surrenders and is followed by Barnabas and all the Jewish brethren in Antioch to the dismay of Paul who boldly rebuked Peter and Barnabas and won them back to his view. It was a crisis. Some would even date the Epistle to the Galatians at this time also, an unlikely hypothesis. </p>
