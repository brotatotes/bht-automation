<p><b> Let us return now and visit the brethren </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστρεψαντες δε επισκεψωμεθα τους αδελφους</span></span>). Paul takes the initiative as the leader, all the more so if the rebuke to Peter and Barnabas in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11-21">Galatians 2:11-21</span> had already taken place. Paul is anxious, like a true missionary, to go back to the fields where he has planted the gospel. He uses the hortatory subjunctive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισκεψωμεθα</span></span>) for the proposal (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:14">Acts 15:14</span> for this verb). Note the repeated <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι-στρεψαντες</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισκεψωμεθα</span></span>). There is special point in the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δη</span></span> (shortened form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη</span></span>), now at this juncture of affairs (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span>).</p>
<p><b>How they fare </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πως εχουσιν</span></span>). Indirect question, "how they have it." The precariousness of the life of new converts in pagan lands is shown in all of Paul's Epistles (Furneaux). So he wanted to go city by city (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα πολιν πασαν</span></span>). </p>
