 Was minded to take with them  (εβουλετο συνπαραλαβειν). Imperfect middle (εβουλετο), not aorist middle εβουλευσατο of the Textus Receptus. Barnabas willed, wished and stuck to it (imperfect tense). Συνπαραλαβειν is second aorist active infinitive of the double compound συνπαραλαμβανω, old verb to take along together with, used already about John Mark in Acts 12:25 and by Paul in Galatians 2:1 about Titus. Nowhere else in the N.T. Barnabas used the ingressive aorist in his suggestion.
