<p><b> Was minded to take with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβουλετο συνπαραλαβειν</span></span>). Imperfect middle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβουλετο</span></span>), not aorist middle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβουλευσατο</span></span> of the Textus Receptus. Barnabas willed, wished and stuck to it (imperfect tense). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συνπαραλαβειν</span></span> is second aorist active infinitive of the double compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνπαραλαμβανω</span></span>, old verb to take along together with, used already about John Mark in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:25">Acts 12:25</span> and by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1">Galatians 2:1</span> about Titus. Nowhere else in the N.T. Barnabas used the ingressive aorist in his suggestion. </p>
