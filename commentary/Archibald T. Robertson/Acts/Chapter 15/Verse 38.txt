<p><b> But Paul thought not good to take with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παυλος δε ηξιου--μη συνπαραλαμβανειν τουτον</span></span>). The Greek is far more effective than this English rendering. It is the imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιοω</span></span>, old verb to think meet or right and the present active infinitive of the same verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνπαραλαμβανω</span></span>) with negative used with this infinitive. Literally, "But Paul kept on deeming it wise not to be taking along with them this one." Barnabas looked on it as a simple punctiliar proposal (aorist infinitive), but Paul felt a lively realization of the problem of having a quitter on his hands (present infinitive). Each was insistent in his position (two imperfects). Paul had a definite reason for his view describing John Mark as "him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αποσταντα απ' αυτων απο Παμφυλιας</span></span>). Second aorist active articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιστημ</span></span>, intransitive use, "the one who stood off from, apostatized from" (our very word "apostasy"). And also as the one who "went not with them to the work" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μη συνελθοντα αυτοις εις το εργον</span></span>). At Perga Mark had faced the same task that Paul and Barnabas did, but he flinched and flickered and quit. Paul declined to repeat the experiment with Mark. </p>
