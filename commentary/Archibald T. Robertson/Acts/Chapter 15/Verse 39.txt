<p><b> A sharp contention </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροξυσμος</span></span>). Our very word paroxysm in English. Old word though only twice in the N.T. (here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:24">Hebrews 10:24</span>), from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροξυνω</span></span>, to sharpen (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα, οξυς</span></span>) as of a blade and of the spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:16">Acts 17:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:5">1 Corinthians 13:5</span>). This "son of consolation" loses his temper in a dispute over his cousin and Paul uses sharp words towards his benefactor and friend. It is often so that the little irritations of life give occasion to violent explosions. If the incident in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11-21">Galatians 2:11-21</span> had already taken place, there was a sore place already that could be easily rubbed. And if Mark also joined with Peter and Barnabas on that occasion, Paul had fresh ground for irritation about him. But there is no way to settle differences about men and we can only agree to disagree as Paul and Barnabas did.</p>
<p><b>So that they parted asunder from one another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε αποχωρισθηνα αυτους απ' αλληλων</span></span>). Actual result here stated by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span> and the first aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποχωριζω</span></span>, old verb to sever, to separate, here only and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:4">Revelation 6:4</span> in the N.T. The accusative of general reference (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτους</span></span>) is normal. For construction with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span> see Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 999f.</p>
<p><b>And Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον τε Βαρναβαν παραλαβοντα τον Μαρκον εκπλευσα εις Κυπρον</span></span>). Second infinitival clause <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπλευσα</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span> connected by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε</span></span>. The same participle is used here minus <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν, παραλαβοντα</span></span> (second aorist active). Barnabas and Mark sailed out (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπλευσα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπλεω</span></span>) from the harbour of Antioch. This is the last glimpse that Luke gives us of Barnabas, one of the noblest figures in the New Testament. Paul has a kindly reference to him in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:6">1 Corinthians 9:6</span>. No one can rightly blame Barnabas for giving his cousin John Mark a second chance nor Paul for fearing to risk him again. One's judgment may go with Paul, but one's heart goes with Barnabas. And Mark made good with Barnabas, with Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:13">1 Peter 5:13</span>) and finally with Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:11">2 Timothy 4:11</span>). See my little book on John Mark (<i>Making Good in the Ministry</i>). Paul and Barnabas parted in anger and both in sorrow. Paul owed more to Barnabas than to any other man. Barnabas was leaving the greatest spirit of the time and of all times. </p>
