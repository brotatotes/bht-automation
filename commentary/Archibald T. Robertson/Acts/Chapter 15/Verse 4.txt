 Were received  (παρεδεχθησαν). First aorist passive indicative of παραδεχομα, old verb, to receive, to welcome. Here it was a public reception for Paul and Barnabas provided by the whole church including the apostles and elders, at which an opportunity was given to hear the story of Paul and Barnabas about God's dealings with them among the Gentiles. This first public meeting is referred to by Paul in Galatians 2:2 "I set before them (αυτοις) the gospel, etc."
