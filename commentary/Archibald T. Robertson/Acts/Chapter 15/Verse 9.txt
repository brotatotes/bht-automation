<p><b> He made no distinction between us and them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουθεν διεκρινεν μεταξυ ημων τε κα αυτων</span></span>). He distinguished nothing (first aorist active ind.) between (both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταξυ</span></span>) both (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε κα</span></span>) us and them. In the matter of faith and conversion God treated us Jews as heathen and the heathen as Jews.</p>
<p><b>Cleansing their hearts by faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη πιστε καθαρισας τας καρδιας αυτων</span></span>). Not by works nor by ceremonies. Peter here has a thoroughly Pauline and Johannine idea of salvation for all both Jew and Greek. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:15">Acts 10:15</span>. </p>
