<p><b> And he came also to Derbe and Lystra </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηντησεν δε κα εις Δερβην κα εις Λυστραν</span></span>). First aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατανταω</span></span>, late verb to come down to, to arrive at. He struck Derbe first of the places in the first tour which was the last city reached then.</p>
<p><b>Timothy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τιμοθεος</span></span>). Apparently a native of Lystra ("there," <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκε</span></span>), his Hebrew mother named Eunice and grandmother Lois (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:5">2 Timothy 1:5</span>) and his Greek father's name not known. He may have been a proselyte, but not necessarily so as Timothy was taught the Scriptures by his mother and grandmother (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:15">2 Timothy 3:15</span>), and, if a proselyte, he would have had Timothy circumcised. It is idle to ask if Paul came on purpose to get Timothy to take Mark's place. Probably Timothy was about eighteen years of age, a convert of Paul's former visit a few years before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2">1 Timothy 1:2</span>) and still young twelve years later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span>). Paul loved him devotedly (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:23">1 Timothy 5:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:15">2 Timothy 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:19">Philippians 2:19</span>). It is a glorious discovery to find a real young preacher for Christ's work. </p>
