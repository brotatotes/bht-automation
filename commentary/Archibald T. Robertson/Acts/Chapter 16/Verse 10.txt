<p><b> We sought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζητησαμεν</span></span>). This sudden use of the plural, dropped in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:1">Acts 17:1</span> when Paul leaves Philippi, and resumed in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:5">Acts 20:5</span> when Paul rejoins Luke in Philippi, argues conclusively that Luke, the author, is in the party ("we" portions of Acts) and shows in a writer of such literary skill as Luke that he is not copying a document in a blundering sort of way. Paul told his vision to the party and they were all ready to respond to the call.</p>
<p><b>Concluding </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνβιβαζοντες</span></span>). A very striking word, present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνβιβαζω</span></span>, old verb to make go together, to coalesce or knit together, to make this and that agree and so to conclude. Already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:22">Acts 9:22</span> of Paul's preaching. This word here gives a good illustration of the proper use of the reason in connection with revelation, to decide whether it is a revelation from God, to find out what it means for us, and to see that we obey the revelation when understood. God had called them to preach to the Macedonians. They had to go. </p>
