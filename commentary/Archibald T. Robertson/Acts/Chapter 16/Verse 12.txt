<p><b> To Philippi </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Φιλιππους</span></span>). The plural like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αθηνα</span></span> (Athens) is probably due to separate sections of the city united (Winer-Moulton, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 220). The city (ancient name Krenides or Wells) was renamed after himself by Philip, the father of Alexander the Great. It was situated about a mile east of the small stream Gangites which flows into the river Strymon some thirty miles away. In this valley the Battle of Philippi was fought B.C. 42 between the Second Triumvirate (Octavius, Antonius, Lepidus) and Brutus and Cassius. In memory of the victory Octavius made it a colony (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολωνια</span></span>) with all the privileges of Roman citizenship, such as freedom from scourging, freedom from arrest save in extreme cases, and the right of appeal to the emperor. This Latin word occurs here alone in the N.T. Octavius planted here a colony of Roman veterans with farms attached, a military outpost and a miniature of Rome itself. The language was Latin. Here Paul is face to face with the Roman power and empire in a new sense. He was a new Alexander, come from Asia to conquer Europe for Christ, a new Caesar to build the Kingdom of Christ on the work of Alexander and Caesar. One need not think that Paul was conscious of all that was involved in destiny for the world. Philippi was on the Egnatian Way, one of the great Roman roads, that ran from here to Dyrrachium on the shores of the Adriatic, a road that linked the east with the west.</p>
<p><b>The first of the district </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτη της μεριδος</span></span>). Philippi was not the first city of Macedonia nor does Luke say so. That honour belonged to Thessalonica and even Amphipolis was larger than Philippi. It is not clear whether by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μερις</span></span> Luke means a formal division of the province, though the <i>Koine</i> has examples of this geographical sense (papyri). There is no article with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτη</span></span> and Luke may not mean to stress unduly the position of Philippi in comparison with Amphipolis. But it was certainly a leading city of this district of Macedonia.</p>
<p><b>We were tarrying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεν διατριβοντες</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect active. </p>
