<p><b> Lydia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λυδια</span></span>). Her birthplace was Thyatira in Lydia. She may have been named after the land, though Lydia is a common female name (see Horace). Lydia was itself a Macedonian colony (Strabo, XIII. 4). Thyatira (note plural form like Philippi and one of the seven churches of Asia here <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:18">Revelation 2:18</span>) was famous for its purple dyes as old as Homer (Iliad, IV. 141) and had a guild of dyers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο βαφεις</span></span>) as inscriptions show.</p>
<p><b>A seller of purple </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορφυροπωλις</span></span>). A female seller of purple fabrics (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορφυρα, πωλις</span></span>). Late word, masculine form in an inscription. There was a great demand for this fabric as it was used on the official toga at Rome and in Roman colonies. We still use the term "royal purple." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:19">Luke 16:19</span>. Evidently Lydia was a woman of some means to carry on such an important enterprise from her native city. She may have been a freed-woman, since racial names were often borne by slaves.</p>
<p><b>One that worshipped God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεβομενη τον θεον</span></span>). A God-fearer or proselyte of the gate. There was a Jewish settlement in Thyatira which was especially interested in the dyeing industry. She probably became a proselyte there. Whether this was true of the other women we do not know. They may have been Jewesses or proselytes like Lydia, probably all of them employees of hers in her business. When Paul writes to the Philippians he does not mention Lydia who may have died meanwhile and who certainly was not Paul's wife. She was wealthy and probably a widow.</p>
<p><b>Heard us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουεν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span>, was listening, really listening and she kept it up, listening to each of these new and strange preachers.</p>
<p><b>Opened </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διηνοιξεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διανοιγω</span></span>, old word, double compound (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια, ανα, οιγω</span></span>) to open up wide or completely like a folding door (both sides, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>, two). Only the Lord could do that. Jesus had opened (the same verb) the mind of the disciples to understand the Scriptures (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:45">Luke 24:45</span>).</p>
<p><b>To give heed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεχειν</span></span>). To hold the mind (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον νουν</span></span> understood), present active infinitive. She kept her mind centred on the things spoken by Paul whose words gripped her attention. She rightly perceived that Paul was the foremost one of the group. He had personal magnetism and power of intellect that the Spirit of God used to win the heart of this remarkable woman to Christ. It was worth coming to Philippi to win this fine personality to the Kingdom of God. She will be the chief spirit in this church that will give Paul more joy and co-operation than any of his churches. It is not stated that she was converted on the first Sabbath, though this may have been the case. "One solitary convert, a woman, and she already a seeker after God, and a native of that very Asia where they had been forbidden to preach" (Furneaux). But a new era had dawned for Europe and for women in the conversion of Lydia. </p>
