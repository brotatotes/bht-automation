<p><b> A spirit of divination </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα πυθωνα</span></span>). So the correct text with accusative (apparition, a spirit, a python), not the genitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυθωνος</span></span>). Hesychius defines it as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονιον μανικον</span></span> (a spirit of divination). The etymology of the word is unknown. Bengel suggests <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυθεσθα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυνθανομα</span></span>, to inquire. Python was the name given to the serpent that kept guard at Delphi, slain by Apollo, who was called <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πυθιος Απολλο</span></span> and the prophetess at Delphi was termed Pythia. Certainly Luke does not mean to credit Apollo with a real existence (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:4">1 Corinthians 8:4</span>). But Plutarch (A.D. 50-100) says that the term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυθωνες</span></span> was applied to ventriloquists (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγγαστριμυθο</span></span>). In the LXX those with familiar spirits are called by this word ventriloquists (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+19:31">Leviticus 19:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+20:6">Leviticus 20:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+20:27">Leviticus 20:27</span>, including the witch of Endor <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+28:7">1 Samuel 28:7</span>). It is possible that this slave girl had this gift of prophecy "by soothsaying" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαντευομενη</span></span>). Present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαντευομα</span></span>, old heathen word (in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητευω</span></span>) for acting the seer (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαντις</span></span>) and this kin to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαινομα</span></span>, to be mad, like the howling dervishes of later times. This is the so-called instrumental use of the circumstantial participles.</p>
<p><b>Brought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρειχεν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεχω</span></span>, a steady source of income.</p>
<p><b>Much gain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργασιαν πολλην</span></span>). Work, business, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργαζομα</span></span>, to work.</p>
<p><b>Her masters </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις κυριοις αυτης</span></span>). Dative case. Joint owners of this poor slave girl who were exploiting her calamity, whatever it was, for selfish gain, just as men and women today exploit girls and women in the "white slave" trade. As a fortune-teller she was a valuable asset for all the credulous dupes of the community. Simon Magus in Samaria and Elymas Barjesus in Cyprus had won power and wealth as soothsayers. </p>
