<p><b> The Most High God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θεου του υψιστου</span></span>). Pagan inscriptions use this language for the Supreme Being. It looks like supernatural testimony like that borne by the demoniacs to Jesus as "son of the Most High God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:28">Luke 8:28</span>. Cf; also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:24">Mark 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:11">Mark 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:41">Luke 4:41</span>, etc.). She may have heard Paul preach about Jesus as the way of salvation.</p>
<p><b>The way of salvation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδον σωτηριας</span></span>). A way of salvation, strictly speaking (no article). There were many "ways of salvation" offered to men then as now. </p>
