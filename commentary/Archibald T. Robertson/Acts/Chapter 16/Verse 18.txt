<p><b> She did </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποιε</span></span>). Imperfect active, kept it up for many days. The strange conduct gave Paul and the rest an unpleasant prominence in the community.</p>
<p><b>Being sore troubled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαπονηθεις</span></span>). First aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαπονεω</span></span>, old verb, to work laboriously, then in passive to be "worked up," displeased, worn out. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:2">Acts 4:2</span> which see (there of the Sadducees about Peter's preaching). Paul was grieved, annoyed, indignant. He wanted no testimony from a source like this any more than he did the homage of the people of Lystra (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:14">Acts 14:14</span>).</p>
<p><b>That very hour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτη τη ωρα</span></span>). Locative case of time and familiar Lukan idiom in his Gospel, "at the hour itself." The cure was instantaneous. Paul, like Jesus, distinguished between the demon and the individual. </p>
