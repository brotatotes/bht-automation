<p><b> Unto the magistrates </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις στρατηγοις</span></span>). Greek term (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατοσ, αγω</span></span>) for leader of an army or general. But in civic life a governor. The technical name for the magistrates in a Roman colony was <i>duumviri</i> or duumvirs, answering to consuls in Rome. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Στρατηγο</span></span> here is the Greek rendering of the Latin <i>praetores</i> (praetors), a term which they preferred out of pride to the term <i>duumviri</i>. Since they represented consuls, the praetors or duumvirs were accompanied by lictors bearing rods (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:35">Acts 16:35</span>).</p>
<p><b>These men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτο ο ανθρωπο</span></span>). Contemptuous use.</p>
<p><b>Being Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιουδαιο υπαρχοντες</span></span>). The people of Philippi, unlike those in Antioch (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>), did not recognize any distinction between Jews and Christians. These four men were Jews. This appeal to race prejudice would be especially pertinent then because of the recent decree of Claudius expelling Jews from Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span>). It was about A.D. 49 or 50 that Paul is in Philippi. The hatred of the Jews by the Romans is known otherwise (Cicero, <i>Pro Flacco</i>, XXVIII; Juvenal, XIV. 96-106).</p>
<p><b>Do exceedingly trouble </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκταρασσουσιν</span></span>). Late compound (effective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> in composition) and only here in the N.T. </p>
