<p><b>Many stripes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλας πληγας</span></span>). The Jewish law was forty stripes save one (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:24">2 Corinthians 11:24</span>). The Roman custom depended on the caprice of the judge and was a terrible ordeal. It was the custom to inflict the stripes on the naked body (back) as Livy 2.5 says: "<i>Missique lictores ad sumendum supplicium, nudatos virgis caedunt</i>."
