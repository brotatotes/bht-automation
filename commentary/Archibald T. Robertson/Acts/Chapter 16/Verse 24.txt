<p><b> Into the inner prison </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την εσωτεραν φυλακην</span></span>). The comparative form from the adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσω</span></span> (within), Ionic and old Attic for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισω</span></span>. In the LXX, but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:19">Hebrews 6:19</span>. The Roman public prisons had a vestibule and outer prison and behind this the inner prison, a veritable dungeon with no light or air save what came through the door when open. One has only to picture modern cells in our jails, the dungeons in feudal castles, London prisons before the time of Howard, to appreciate the horrors of an inner prison cell in a Roman provincial town of the first century A.D.</p>
<p><b>Made their feet fast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους ποδας ησφαλισατο αυτων</span></span>). First aorist (effective) middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασφαλιζω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασφαλης</span></span> (safe), common verb in late Greek, in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:64">Matthew 24:64</span>. The inner prison was safe enough without this refinement of cruelty.</p>
<p><b>In the stocks </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ξυλον</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ξυλον</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυω</span></span>, to scrape or plane, is used for a piece of wood whether a cross or gibbet (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:30">Acts 5:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:39">Acts 10:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:29">Acts 13:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:24">1 Peter 2:24</span>) or a log or timber with five holes (four for the wrists and ankles and one for the neck) or two for the feet as here, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυλοπεδη</span></span>, Latin <i>vervus</i>, to shackle the feet stretched apart (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+33:11">Job 33:11</span>). This torment was practiced in Sparta, Athens, Rome, and Adonirom Judson suffered it in Burmah. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ξυλον</span></span> is also used in the N.T. for stick or staff (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:47">Matthew 26:47</span>) and even a tree (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:31">Luke 23:31</span>). Tertullian said of Christians in the stocks: <i>Nihil crus sentit in vervo, quum animus in caelo est</i> (Nothing the limb feels in the stocks when the mind is in heaven). </p>
