<p><b> Earthquake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεισμος</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σειω</span></span>, to shake. Luke regarded it as an answer to prayer as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:31">Acts 4:31</span>. He and Timothy were not in prison.</p>
<p><b>So that the foundations of the prison house were shaken </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε σαλευθηνα τα θεμελια του δεσμωτηριου</span></span>). Regular construction of the first aorist passive infinitive and the accusative of general reference with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span> for actual result just like the indicative. This old word for prison house already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:2">Matthew 11:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:21">Acts 5:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:23">Acts 5:23</span> which see. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θεμελια</span></span> is neuter plural of the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμελιος</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμα</span></span> (thing laid down from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>). So already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:48">Luke 6:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:29">Luke 14:29</span>. If the prison was excavated from rocks in the hillside, as was often the case, the earthquake would easily have slipped the bars of the doors loose and the chains would have fallen out of the walls.</p>
<p><b>Were opened </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηνεωιχθησαν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιγω</span></span> (or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-νυμ</span></span>) with triple augment (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η, ε, ω</span></span>), while there is no augment in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεθη</span></span> (first aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανιημ</span></span>, were loosed), old verb, but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:40">Acts 27:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:9">Ephesians 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:5">Hebrews 13:5</span>. </p>
