<p><b> Do thyself no harm </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν πραξηις σεαυτω κακον</span></span>). The usual construction (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the aorist subjunctive) for a prohibition not to</p>
<p><b>begin </b> to do a thing. The older Greek would probably have used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησηις</span></span> here. The later Greek does not always preserve the old distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>, to do a thing, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρασσω</span></span>, to practice, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρασσετε</span></span> keeps it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:9">Philippians 4:9</span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span> is rightly used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:10-14">Luke 3:10-14</span>. As a matter of fact <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρασσω</span></span> does not occur in Matthew or in Mark, only twice in John, six times in Luke's Gospel, thirteen in Acts, and elsewhere by Paul.</p>
<p><b>Sprang in </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισεπηδησεν</span></span>). First aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισπηδαω</span></span>, old verb, but here only in the N.T. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπηδαω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:14">Acts 14:14</span>. The jailor was at the outer door and he wanted lights to see what was inside in the inner prison. </p>
