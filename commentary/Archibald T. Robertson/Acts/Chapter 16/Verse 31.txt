<p><b> To be saved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα σωθω</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and first aorist passive subjunctive. What did he mean by "saved"? Certainly more than escape from peril about the prisoners or because of the earthquake, though these had their influences on him. Cf. way of salvation in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:17">Acts 16:17</span>.</p>
<p><b>Believe on the Lord Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πιστευσον επ τον κυριον Ιησουν</span></span>). This is what Peter told Cornelius (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:43">Acts 10:43</span>). This is the heart of the matter for both the jailor and his house. </p>
