<p><b> Washed their stripes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελουσεν απο των πληγων</span></span>). Deissmann (<i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 227) cites an inscription of Pergamum with this very construction of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> and the ablative, to wash off, though it is an old verb. This first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λουω</span></span>, to bathe, succinctly shows what the jailor did to remove the stains left by the rods of the lictors (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:22">Acts 16:22</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Νιπτω</span></span> was used for washing parts of the body.</p>
<p><b>And was baptized, he and all his, immediately </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εβαπτισθη αυτος κα ο αυτου απαντες παραχρημα</span></span>). The verb is in the singular agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος</span></span>, but it is to be supplied with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αυτου</span></span>, and it was done at once. </p>
