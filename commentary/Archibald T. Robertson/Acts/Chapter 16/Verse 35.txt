<p><b> The serjeants </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους ραβδουχους</span></span>). Fasces-bearers, regular Greek word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραβδοσ, εχω</span></span>) for Latin <i>lictores</i> though Cicero says that they should carry <i>baculi</i>, not <i>fasces</i>. Was this message because of the earthquake, the influence of Lydia, or a belated sense of justice on the part of the magistrates (praetors)? Perhaps a bit of all three may be true. The Codex Bezae expressly says that the magistrates "assembled together in the market place and recollecting the earthquake that had happened they were afraid." </p>
