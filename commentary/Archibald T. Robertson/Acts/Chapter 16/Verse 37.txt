<p><b> Unto them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς αυτους</span></span>). The lictors by the jailor. The reply of Paul is a marvel of brevity and energy, almost every word has a separate indictment showing the utter illegality of the whole proceeding.</p>
<p><b>They have beaten us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειραντες ημας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δερω</span></span>, old verb to flay, to skin, to smite. The <i>Lex Valeria</i> B.C. 509 and the <i>Lex Poscia</i> B.C. 248 made it a crime to inflict blows on a Roman citizen. Cicero says, "To fetter a Roman citizen was a crime, to scourge him a scandal, to slay him--parricide." Claudius had "deprived the city of Rhodes of its freedom for having crucified some citizen of Rome" (Rackham).</p>
<p><b>Publicly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δημοσια</span></span>). This added insult to injury. Common adverb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδω</span></span>) supplied with adjective, associative instrumental case, opposed to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδια</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ' οικους</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:20">Acts 20:20</span>)</p>
<p><b>Uncondemned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακατακριτους</span></span>). This same verbal adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα-κρινω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative is used by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:25">Acts 22:25</span> and nowhere else in the N.T. Rare in late Greek like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακαταγνωστος</span></span>, but in late <i>Koine</i> (papyri, inscriptions). The meaning is clearly "without being tried." Paul and Silas were not given a chance to make a defence. They were sentenced unheard (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:16">Acts 25:16</span>). Even slaves in Roman law had a right to be heard.</p>
<p><b>Men that are Romans </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπους Ρομαιους υπαρχοντας</span></span>). The praetors did not know, of course, that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens any more than Lysias knew it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:27">Acts 22:27</span>. Paul's claim is not challenged in either instance. It was a capital offence to make a false claim to Roman citizenship.</p>
<p><b>Have cast us into prison </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβαλαν εις φυλακην</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλω</span></span>, old verb, with first aorist ending as often in the <i>Koine</i> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-αν</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ον</span></span>). This was the climax, treating them as criminals.</p>
<p><b>And now privily </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα νυν λαθρα</span></span>). Paul balances their recent conduct with the former.</p>
<p><b>Nay verily, but </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γαρ, αλλα</span></span>). No indeed! It is the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span> so common in answers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γε+αρα</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:23">Matthew 27:23</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αλλα</span></span> gives the sharp alternative.</p>
<p><b>Themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτο</span></span>). As a public acknowledgment that they had wronged and mistreated Paul and Silas. Let them come themselves and lead us out (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαγαγετωσαν</span></span>, third person plural second aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαγω</span></span>). It was a bitter pill to the proud praetors. </p>
