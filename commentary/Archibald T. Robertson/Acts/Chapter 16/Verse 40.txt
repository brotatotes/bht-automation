<p><b> Into the house of Lydia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς την Λυδιαν</span></span>). No word in the Greek for "house," but it means the house of Lydia. Note "the brethren" here, not merely Luke and Timothy, but other brethren now converted besides those in the house of the jailor. The four missionaries were guests of Lydia (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:15">Acts 16:15</span>) and probably the church now met in her home.</p>
<p><b>They departed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηλθαν</span></span>). Paul and Silas, but not Luke and Timothy. Note "they" here, not "we." Note also the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-αν</span></span> ending instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ον</span></span> as above. The movements of Timothy are not perfectly clear till he reappears at Beroea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:15">Acts 17:15</span>). It seems unlikely that he came to Thessalonica with Paul and Silas since only Paul and Silas obtained security there (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:9">Acts 17:9</span>) and were sent on to Beroea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:10">Acts 17:10</span>). Probably Timothy was sent to Thessalonica from Philippi with gifts of which Paul spoke later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:15">Philippians 4:15</span>). Then he followed Paul and Silas to Beroea. </p>
