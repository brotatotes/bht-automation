<p><b> The region of Phrygia and Galatia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την Φρυγιαν κα Γαλατικην χωραν</span></span>). This is probably the correct text with one article and apparently describes one "Region" or District in The Province of Galatia which was also Phrygian (the old-ethnographic name with which compare the use of Lycaonia in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:6">Acts 14:6</span>). Strictly speaking Derbe and Lystra, though in the Province of Galatia, were not Phrygian, and so Luke would here be not resumptive of the record in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1-5">Acts 16:1-5</span>; but a reference to the country around Iconium and Antioch in Pisidia in North Galatia is not included. This verse is hotly disputed at every point by the advocates of the North Galatian theory as represented by Chase and the South Galatian theory by Ramsay. Whatever is true in regard to the language of Luke here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:23">Acts 18:23</span>, it is still possible for Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:2">Galatians 1:2</span> to use the term Galatia of the whole province of that name which could, in fact, apply to either South or North Galatia or to both. He could, of course, use it also in the ethnographic sense of the real Gauls or Celts who dwelt in North Galatia. Certainly the first tour of Paul and Barnabas was in the Province of Galatia though touching only the Regions of Pisidia, Phrygia, and Lycaonia, which province included besides the Gauls to the north. In this second tour Lycaonia has been already touched (Derbe and Lystra) and now Phrygia. The question arises why Luke here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:23">Acts 18:23</span> adds the term "of Galatia" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γαλατικην</span></span>) though not in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:14">Acts 13:14</span> (Pisidian Antioch) nor in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:6">Acts 14:6</span> (cities of Lycaonia). Does Luke mean to use "of Galatia" in the same ethnographic sense as "of Phrygia" or does he here add the province (Galatia) to the name of the Region (Phrygia)? In itself either view is possible and it really matters very little except that the question is raised whether Paul went into the North Galatian Region on this occasion or later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:23">Acts 18:23</span>). He could have done so and the Epistle be addressed to the churches of South Galatia, North Galatia, or the province as a whole. But the Greek participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωλυθεντες</span></span> ("having been forbidden") plays a part in the argument that cannot be overlooked whether Luke means to say that Paul went north or not. This aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωλυω</span></span>, to hinder, can only express simultaneous or antecedent action, not subsequent action as Ramsay argues. No example of the so-called subsequent use of the aorist participle has ever been found in Greek as all Greek grammarians agree (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 860-63, 1112-14). The only natural meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωλυθεντες</span></span> is that Paul with Silas and Timothy "passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia" because they were hindered by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia (the Province of Asia of which Ephesus was the chief city and west of Derbe and Lystra). This construction implies that the country called "the region of Phrygia and Galatia" is not in the direct line west toward Ephesus. What follows in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:7">Acts 16:7</span> throws further light on the point. </p>
