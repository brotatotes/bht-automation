<p><b> Passing by Mysia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρελθοντες την Μυσιαν</span></span>). Literally, passing alongside or skirting Mysia, neglecting it without preaching there. Strictly they passed through part of it to reach Troas.</p>
<p><b>To Troas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Τροιαδα</span></span>). This city, named Alexandria Troas after Alexander the Great, was the seaport of Mysia, though a Roman colony and not counted as part of either Asia or Bithynia. New Ilium, on the site of the old Troy, was four miles farther north. It was the place to take ship for Philippi.
