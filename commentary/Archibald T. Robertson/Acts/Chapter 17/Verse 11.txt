<p><b> More noble than those </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευγενεστερο των</span></span>). Comparative form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευγενης</span></span>, old and common adjective, but in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:12">Luke 19:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:26">1 Corinthians 1:26</span>. Followed by ablative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των</span></span> as often after the comparative.</p>
<p><b>With all readiness of mind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα πασης προθυμιας</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προθυμος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ, θυμος</span></span>) and means eagerness, rushing forward. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:11-19">2 Corinthians 8:11-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:2">2 Corinthians 9:2</span>. In Thessalonica many of the Jews out of pride and prejudice refused to listen. Here the Jews joyfully welcomed the two Jewish visitors.</p>
<p><b>Examining the Scriptures daily </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθ' ημεραν ανακρινοντες τας γραφας</span></span>). Paul expounded the Scriptures daily as in Thessalonica, but the Beroeans, instead of resenting his new interpretation, examined (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακρινω</span></span> means to sift up and down, make careful and exact research as in legal processes as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:9">Acts 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:19">Acts 12:19</span>, etc.) the Scriptures for themselves. In Scotland people have the Bible open on the preacher as he expounds the passage, a fine habit worth imitating.</p>
<p><b>Whether these things were so </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε εχο ταυτα ουτως</span></span>). Literally, "if these things had it thus." The present optative in the indirect question represents an original present indicative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:29">Luke 1:29</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1043f.). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> with the optative may be looked at as the condition of the fourth class (undetermined with less likelihood of determination) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:27">Acts 17:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:16">Acts 20:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:19">Acts 24:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:12">Acts 27:12</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1021). The Beroeans were eagerly interested in the new message of Paul and Silas but they wanted to see it for themselves. What a noble attitude. Paul's preaching made Bible students of them. The duty of private interpretation is thus made plain (Hovey). </p>
