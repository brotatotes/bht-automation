<p><b> Was proclaimed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηγγελη</span></span>). Second aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταγγελλω</span></span>, common late verb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:21">Acts 16:21</span>.</p>
<p><b>Of Paul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο Παυλου</span></span>). By Paul, of course.</p>
<p><b>Stirring up and troubling the multitudes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαλευοντες κα ταρασσοντες τους οχλους</span></span>). Shaking the crowds like an earthquake (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:31">Acts 4:31</span>) and disturbing like a tornado (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:8">Acts 17:8</span>). Success at Thessalonica gave the rabbis confidence and courage. The attack was sharp and swift. The Jews from Antioch in Pisidia had likewise pursued Paul to Iconium and Lystra. How long Paul had been in Beroea Luke does not say. But a church was established here which gave a good account of itself later and sent a messenger (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>) with their part of the collection to Jerusalem. This quiet and noble town was in a whirl of excitement over the attacks of the Jewish emissaries from Thessalonica who probably made the same charge of treason against Paul and Silas. </p>
