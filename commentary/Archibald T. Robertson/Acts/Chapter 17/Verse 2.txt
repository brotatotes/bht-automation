<p><b> As his custom was </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα το ειωθος τω Παυλω</span></span>). The same construction in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:16">Luke 4:16</span> about Jesus in Nazareth (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα το ειωθος αυτω</span></span>) with the second perfect active participle neuter singular from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθω</span></span>. Paul's habit was to go to the Jewish synagogue to use the Jews and the God-fearers as a springboard for his work among the Gentiles.</p>
<p><b>For three Sabbaths </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ σαββατα τρια</span></span>). Probably the reference is to the first three Sabbaths when Paul had a free hand in the synagogue as at first in Antioch in Pisidia. Luke does not say that Paul was in Thessalonica only three weeks. He may have spoken there also during the week, though the Sabbath was the great day. Paul makes it plain, as Furneaux shows, that he was in Thessalonica a much longer period than three weeks. The rest of the time he spoke, of course, outside of the synagogue. Paul implies an extended stay by his language in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:8">1 Thessalonians 1:8</span>. The church consisted mainly of Gentile converts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:4">2 Thessalonians 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:7">2 Thessalonians 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:8">2 Thessalonians 3:8</span>) and seems to have been well organized (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:12">1 Thessalonians 5:12</span>). He received help while there several times from Philippi (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:16">Philippians 4:16</span>) and even so worked night and day to support himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span>). His preaching was misunderstood there in spite of careful instruction concerning the second coming of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13-5">1 Thessalonians 4:13-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1-12">2 Thessalonians 2:1-12</span>).</p>
<p><b>Reasoned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διελεξατο</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαλεγομα</span></span>, old verb in the active to select, distinguish, then to revolve in the mind, to converse (interchange of ideas), then to teach in the Socratic ("dialectic") method of question and answer (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διελεγετο</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:17">Acts 17:17</span>), then simply to discourse, but always with the idea of intellectual stimulus. With these Jews and God-fearers Paul appealed to the Scriptures as text and basis (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>) of his ideas. </p>
