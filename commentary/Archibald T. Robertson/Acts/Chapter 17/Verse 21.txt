<p><b> Spent their time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηυκαιρουν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευκαιρεω</span></span>. A late word to have opportunity (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ, καιρος</span></span>) from Polybius on. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:31">Mark 6:31</span>. They had time for,.etc. This verse is an explanatory parenthesis by Luke.</p>
<p><b>Some new thing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ καινοτερον</span></span>). Literally "something newer" or "fresher" than the new, the very latest, the comparative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινος</span></span>. Demosthenes (<i>Philipp</i>. 1. 43) pictures the Athenians "in the agora inquiring if anything newer is said" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυνθανομενο κατα την αγοραν ε τ λεγετα νεωτερον</span></span>). The new soon became stale with these itching and frivolous Athenians. </p>
