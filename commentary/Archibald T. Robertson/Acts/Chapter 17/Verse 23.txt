<p><b> For </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>). Paul gives an illustration of their religiousness from his own experiences in their city.</p>
<p><b>The objects of your worship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα σεβασματα υμων</span></span>). Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεβαζομα</span></span>, to worship. In N T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:4">2 Thessalonians 2:4</span>. The use of this word for temples, altars, statues, shows the conciliatory tone in the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεισιδαιμονεστερους</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:22">Acts 17:22</span>.</p>
<p><b>An altar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βωμον</span></span>). Old word, only here in the N.T. and the only mention of a heathen altar in the N.T</p>
<p><b>With this inscription </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ω επεγεγραπτο</span></span>). On which had been written (stood written), past perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγραφω</span></span>, old and common verb for writing on inscriptions (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγραφη</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:38">Luke 23:38</span>).</p>
<p><b>To an Unknown God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ΑΓΝΟΣΤΟ ΤHΕΟ</span></span>). Dative case, dedicated to. Pausanias (I. 1, 4) says that in Athens there are "altars to gods unknown" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βωμο θεων αγνωστων</span></span>). Epimenides in a pestilence advised the sacrifice of a sheep to the befitting god whoever he might be. If an altar was dedicated to the wrong deity, the Athenians feared the anger of the other gods. The only use in the N.T. of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνωστος</span></span>, old and common adjective (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωστος</span></span> verbal of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, to know). Our word agnostic comes from it. Here it has an ambiguous meaning, but Paul uses it though to a stern Christian philosopher it may be the "confession at once of a bastard philosophy and of a bastard religion" (Hort, <i>Hulsean Lectures</i>, p. 64). Paul was quick to use this confession on the part of the Athenians of a higher power than yet known to them. So he gets his theme from this evidence of a deeper religious sense in them and makes a most clever use of it with consummate skill.</p>
<p><b>In ignorance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνοουντες</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνοεω</span></span>, old verb from same root as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνωστος</span></span> to which Paul refers by using it.</p>
<p><b>This set I forth unto you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο εγο καταγγελλω υμιν</span></span>). He is a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταγγελευς</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span>) as they suspected of a God, both old and new, old in that they already worship him, new in that Paul knows who he is. By this master stroke he has brushed to one side any notion of violation of Roman law or suspicion of heresy and claims their endorsement of his new gospel, a shrewd and consummate turn. He has their attention now and proceeds to describe this God left out of their list as the one true and Supreme God. The later MSS. here read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον--τουτον</span></span> (whom--this one) rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο--τουτο</span></span> (what--this), but the late text is plainly an effort to introduce too soon the personal nature of God which comes out clearly in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:24">Acts 17:24</span>. </p>
