<p><b> The God that made the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hο θεος ο ποιησας τον κοσμον</span></span>). Not a god for this and a god for that like the 30,000 gods of the Athenians, but the one God who made the Universe (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοσμος</span></span> on the old Greek sense of orderly arrangement of the whole universe).</p>
<p><b>And all things therein </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα παντα τα εν αυτω</span></span>). All the details in the universe were created by this one God. Paul is using the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:5">Isaiah 42:5</span>. The Epicureans held that matter was eternal. Paul sets them aside. This one God was not to be confounded with any of their numerous gods save with this "Unknown God."</p>
<p><b>Being Lord of heaven and earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουρανου κα γης υπαρχων κυριος</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span> here owner, absolute possessor of both heaven and earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:7">Isaiah 45:7</span>), not of just parts.</p>
<p><b>Dwelleth not in temples made with hands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκεν χειροποιητοις ναοις κατοικε</span></span>). The old adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειροποιητος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρ, ποιεω</span></span>) already in Stephen's speech (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:48">Acts 7:48</span>). No doubt Paul pointed to the wonderful Parthenon, supposed to be the home of Athene as Stephen denied that God dwelt alone in the temple in Jerusalem. </p>
