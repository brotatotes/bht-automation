 The God that made the world  (Hο θεος ο ποιησας τον κοσμον). Not a god for this and a god for that like the 30,000 gods of the Athenians, but the one God who made the Universe (κοσμος on the old Greek sense of orderly arrangement of the whole universe).And all things therein  (κα παντα τα εν αυτω). All the details in the universe were created by this one God. Paul is using the words of Isaiah 42:5. The Epicureans held that matter was eternal. Paul sets them aside. This one God was not to be confounded with any of their numerous gods save with this "Unknown God."Being Lord of heaven and earth  (ουρανου κα γης υπαρχων κυριος). Κυριος here owner, absolute possessor of both heaven and earth (Isaiah 45:7), not of just parts.Dwelleth not in temples made with hands  (ουκεν χειροποιητοις ναοις κατοικε). The old adjective χειροποιητος (χειρ, ποιεω) already in Stephen's speech (Acts 7:48). No doubt Paul pointed to the wonderful Parthenon, supposed to be the home of Athene as Stephen denied that God dwelt alone in the temple in Jerusalem.
