<p><b> As though he needed anything </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσδεομενος τινος</span></span>). Present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσδεομα</span></span>, to want besides, old verb, but here only in the N.T. This was strange doctrine for the people thought that the gods needed their offerings for full happiness. This self-sufficiency of God was taught by Philo and Lucretius, but Paul shows that the Epicurean missed it by putting God, if existing at all, outside the universe.</p>
<p><b>Seeing he himself giveth to all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος διδους πασιν</span></span>). This Supreme Personal God is the source of life, breath, and everything. Paul here rises above all Greek philosophers. </p>
