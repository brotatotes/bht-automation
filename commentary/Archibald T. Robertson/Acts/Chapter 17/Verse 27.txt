<p><b> That they should seek God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ζητειν τον θεον</span></span>). Infinitive (present active) of purpose again. Seek him, not turn away from him as the nations had done (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18-32">Romans 1:18-32</span>).</p>
<p><b>If haply they might feel after him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε αρα γε ψηλαφησειαν αυτον</span></span>). First aorist active (Aeolic form) optative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψηλαφαω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψαω</span></span>, to touch. So used by the Risen Jesus in his challenge to the disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:39">Luke 24:39</span>), by the Apostle John of his personal contact with Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>), of the contact with Mount Sinai (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:18">Hebrews 12:18</span>). Here it pictures the blind groping of the darkened heathen mind after God to "find him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευροιεν</span></span>, second aorist active optative) whom they had lost. One knows what it is in a darkened room to feel along the walls for the door (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+28:29">Deuteronomy 28:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+5:14">Job 5:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+12:25">Job 12:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:10">Isaiah 59:10</span>). Helen Keller, when told of God, said that she knew of him already, groping in the dark after him. The optative here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> is due to the condition of the fourth class (undetermined, but with vague hope of being determined) with aim also present (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1021). Note also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα γε</span></span> the inferential particle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα</span></span> with the delicate intensive particle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γε</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Though he is not far from each one of us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα γε ου μακραν απο ενος εκαστου ημων υπαρχοντα</span></span>). More exactly with B L (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα γε</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιτο</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιτο γε</span></span>), "and yet being not far from each one of us," a direct statement rather than a concessive one. The participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαρχοντα</span></span> agrees with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον</span></span> and the negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> rather than the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span> with the participle makes an emphatic negative. Note also the intensive particle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γε</span></span>. </p>
