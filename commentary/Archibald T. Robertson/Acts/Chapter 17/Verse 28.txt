<p><b> For in him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτω γαρ</span></span>). Proof of God's nearness, not stoic pantheism, but real immanence in God as God dwells in us. The three verbs (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωμεν, κινουμεθα, εσμεν</span></span>) form an ascending scale and reach a climax in God (life, movement, existence). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κινουμεθα</span></span> is either direct middle present indicative (we move ourselves) or passive (we are moved).</p>
<p><b>As certain even of your own poets </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως κα τινες των καθ' υμας ποιητων</span></span>). "As also some of the poets among you." Aratus of Soli in Cilicia (ab. B.C. 270) has these very words in his <i>Ta Phainomena</i> and Cleanthes, Stoic philosopher (300-220 B.C.) in his <i>Hymn to Zeus</i> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εκ σου γαρ γενος εσμεν</span></span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:32">1 Corinthians 15:32</span> Paul quotes from Menander and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:12">Titus 1:12</span> from Epimenides. J. Rendel Harris claims that he finds allusions in Paul's Epistles to Pindar, Aristophanes, and other Greek writers. There is no reason in the world why Paul should not have acquaintance with Greek literature, though one need not strain a point to prove it. Paul, of course, knew that the words were written of Zeus (Jupiter), not of Jehovah, but he applies the idea in them to his point just made that all men are the offspring of God. </p>
