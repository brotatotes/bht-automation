<p><b> Opening and alleging </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διανοιγων κα παρατιθεμενος</span></span>). Opening the Scriptures, Luke means, as made plain by the mission and message of Jesus, the same word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διανοιγω</span></span>) used by him of the interpretation of the Scriptures by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:32">Luke 24:32</span>) and of the opening of the mind of the disciples also by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:45">Luke 24:45</span>) and of the opening of Lydia's heart by the Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:14">Acts 16:14</span>). One cannot refrain from saying that such exposition of the Scriptures as Jesus and Paul gave would lead to more opening of mind and heart. Paul was not only "expounding" the Scriptures, he was also "propounding" (the old meaning of "allege") his doctrine or setting forth alongside the Scriptures (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα-τιθεμενος</span></span>), quoting the Scripture to prove his contention which was made in much conflict (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span>), probably in the midst of heated discussion by the opposing rabbis who were anything but convinced by Paul's powerful arguments, for the Cross was a stumbling-block to the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:23">1 Corinthians 1:23</span>).</p>
<p><b>That it behoved the Christ to suffer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ τον Χριστον εδε παθειν</span></span>). The second aorist active infinitive is the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδε</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον Χριστον</span></span>, the accusative of general reference. This is Paul's major premise in his argument from the Scriptures about the Messiah, the necessity of his sufferings according to the Scriptures, the very argument made by the Risen Jesus to the two on the way to Emmaus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:25-27">Luke 24:25-27</span>). The fifty-third chapter of Isaiah was a passage in point that the rabbis had overlooked. Peter made the same point in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:18">Acts 3:18</span> and Paul again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:23">Acts 26:23</span>. The minor premise is the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.</p>
<p><b>To rise again from the dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστηνα εκ νεκρων</span></span>). This second aorist active infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστηνα</span></span> is also the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδε</span></span>. The actual resurrection of Jesus was also a necessity as Paul says he preached to them (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:14">1 Thessalonians 4:14</span>) and argued always from Scripture (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:3-4">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</span>) and from his own experience (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:22">Acts 9:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:7">Acts 22:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:8">Acts 26:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:8">1 Corinthians 15:8</span>).</p>
<p><b>This Jesus is the Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος εστιν ο Χριστοσ, ο Ιησους</span></span>). More precisely, "This is the Messiah, viz., Jesus whom I am proclaiming unto you." This is the conclusion of Paul's line of argument and it is logical and overwhelming. It is his method everywhere as in Damascus, in Antioch in Pisidia, here, in Corinth. He spoke as an eye-witness. </p>
