<p><b> The times of ignorance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους χρονους της αγνοιας</span></span>). The times before full knowledge of God came in Jesus Christ. Paul uses the very word for their ignorance (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνοουντες</span></span>) employed in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:23">Acts 17:23</span>.</p>
<p><b>Overlooked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεριδων</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεροραω</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερειδω</span></span>, old verb to see beyond, not to see, to overlook, not "to wink at" of the Authorized Version with the notion of condoning. Here only in the N.T. It occurs in the LXX in the sense of overlooking or neglecting (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:62">Psalms 18:62</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+55:1">Psalms 55:1</span>). But it has here only a negative force. God has all the time objected to the polytheism of the heathen, and now he has made it plain. In Wisdom 11:23 we have these words: "Thou overlookest the sins of men to the end they may repent."</p>
<p><b>But now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα νυν</span></span>). Accusative of general reference, "as to the now things or situation." All is changed now that Christ has come with the full knowledge of God. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:22">Acts 27:22</span>.</p>
<p><b>All everywhere </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντας πανταχου</span></span>). No exceptions anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Repent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοειν</span></span>). Present active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοεω</span></span> in indirect command, a permanent command of perpetual force. See on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοεω</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span> and the Synoptic Gospels. This word was the message of the Baptist, of Jesus, of Peter, of Paul, this radical change of attitude and life. </p>
