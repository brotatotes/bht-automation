<p><b> The resurrection of the dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστασιν νεκρων</span></span>). Rather, "a resurrection of dead men." No article with either word. The Greeks believed that the souls of men lived on, but they had no conception of resurrection of the body. They had listened with respect till Paul spoke of the actual resurrection of Jesus from the dead as a fact, when they did not care to hear more.</p>
<p><b>Some mocked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μεν εχλευαζον</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χλευαζω</span></span>, a common verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χλευη</span></span>, jesting, mockery). Only here in the N.T. though late MSS. have it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:13">Acts 2:13</span> (best MSS. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαχλευαζω</span></span>). Probably inchoative here, began to mock. In contempt at Paul's statement they declined to listen further to "this babbler" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span>) who had now lost what he had gained with this group of hearers (probably the light and flippant Epicureans).</p>
<p><b>But others </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε</span></span>). A more polite group like those who had invited him to speak (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:19">Acts 17:19</span>). They were unconvinced, but had better manners and so were in favour of an adjournment. This was done, though it is not clear whether it was a serious postponement or a courteous refusal to hear Paul further (probably this). It was a virtual dismissal of the matter. " It is a sad story--the noblest of ancient cities and the noblest man of history--and he never cared to look on it again" (Furneaux). </p>
