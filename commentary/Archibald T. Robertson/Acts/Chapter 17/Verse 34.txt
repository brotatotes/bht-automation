<p><b> Clave unto him and believed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολληθεντες αυτω επιστευσαν</span></span>). First aorist passive of this strong word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολλαω</span></span>, to glue to, common in Acts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:13">Acts 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:29">Acts 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:26">Acts 9:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:28">Acts 10:28</span>) No sermon is a failure which leads a group of men (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανδρες</span></span>) to believe (ingressive aorist of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>) in Jesus Christ. Many so-called great or grand sermons reap no such harvest.</p>
<p><b>Dionysius the Areopagite </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διονυσιος ο Αρεοπαγιτης</span></span>). One of the judges of the Court of the Areopagus. That of itself was no small victory. He was one of this college of twelve judges who had helped to make Athens famous. Eusebius says that he became afterwards bishop of the Church at Athens and died a martyr.</p>
<p><b>A woman named Damaris </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυνη ονοματ Δαμαρις</span></span>). A woman by name Damaris. Not the wife of Dionysius as some have thought, but an aristocratic woman, not necessarily an educated courtezan as Furneaux holds. And there were "others" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερο</span></span>) with them, a group strong enough to keep the fire burning in Athens. It is common to say that Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1-5">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</span> alludes to his failure with philosophy in Athens when he failed to preach Christ crucified and he determined never to make that mistake again. On the other hand Paul determined to stick to the Cross of Christ in spite of the fact that the intellectual pride and superficial culture of Athens had prevented the largest success. As he faced Corinth with its veneer of culture and imitation of philosophy and sudden wealth he would go on with the same gospel of the Cross, the only gospel that Paul knew or preached. And it was a great thing to give the world a sermon like that preached in Athens. </p>
