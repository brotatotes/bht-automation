<p><b> Moved with jealousy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλωσαντες</span></span>). Both our English words,</p>
<p><b>zeal </b> and</p>
<p><b>jealousy </b>, are from the Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλος</span></span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:45">Acts 13:45</span> the Jews (rabbis) "were filled with jealousy" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επλησθησαν ζηλου</span></span>). That is another way of saying the same thing as here. The success of Paul was entirely too great in both places to please the rabbis. So here is jealousy of Jewish preachers towards Christian preachers. It is always between men or women of the same profession or group. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:3-10">1 Thessalonians 2:3-10</span> Paul hints at some of the slanders spread against him by these rabbis (deceivers, using words of flattery as men-pleasers, after vain-glory, greed of gain, etc.).</p>
<p><b>Took unto them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσλαβομενο</span></span>). Second aorist middle (indirect, to themselves) participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσλαμβανω</span></span>, old and common verb.</p>
<p><b>Certain vile fellows of the rabble </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των αγοραιων ανδρας τινας πονηρους</span></span>). The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγορα</span></span> or market-place was the natural resort for those with nothing to do (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:4">Matthew 20:4</span>) like the court-house square today or various parks in our cities where bench-warmers flock. Plato (<i>Protagoras</i> 347 C) calls these <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγοραιο</span></span> (common word, but in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:38">Acts 19:38</span>) idlers or good-for-nothing fellows. They are in every city and such "bums" are ready for any job. The church in Thessalonica caught some of these peripatetic idlers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:10">2 Thessalonians 3:10</span>) "doing nothing but doing about." So the Jewish preachers gather to themselves a choice collection of these market-loungers or loafers or wharf-rats. The Romans called them <i>subrostrani</i> (hangers round the rostrum or <i>subbasilicari</i>).</p>
<p><b>Gathering a crowd </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλοποιησαντες</span></span>). Literally, making or getting (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>) a crowd (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλος</span></span>), a word not found elsewhere. Probably right in the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγορα</span></span> itself where the rabbis could tell men their duties and pay them in advance. Instance Hyde Park in London with all the curious gatherings every day, Sunday afternoons in particular.</p>
<p><b>Set the city on an uproar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθορυβουν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θορυβεω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θορυβος</span></span> (tumult), old verb, but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:10">Acts 20:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:23">Matthew 9:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:39">Mark 4:39</span>. They kept up the din, this combination of rabbis and rabble.</p>
<p><b>Assaulting the house of Jason </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισταντες τη οικια Ιασονος</span></span>). Second aorist (ingressive) active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφιστημ</span></span>, taking a stand against, rushing at, because he was Paul's host. He may have been a Gentile (Jason the name of an ancient king of Thessaly), but the Jews often used it for Joshua or Jesus (II Macc. 1:7).</p>
<p><b>They sought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζητουν</span></span>). Imperfect active. They burst into the house and searched up and down.</p>
<p><b>Them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτους</span></span>). Paul and Silas. They were getting ready to have a lynching party. </p>
