<p><b> When they found them not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ευροντες</span></span>). Usual negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> with the participle in the <i>Koine</i>, second aorist (effective) active participle, complete failure with all the noise and "bums."</p>
<p><b>They dragged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσυρον</span></span>). Imperfect active, vivid picture, they were dragging (literally). See already <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:19">Acts 16:19</span>. If they could not find Paul, they could drag Jason his host and some other Christians whom we do not know.</p>
<p><b>Before the rulers of the city </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τους πολιταρχας</span></span>). This word does not occur in Greek literature and used to be cited as an example of Luke's blunders. But now it is found in an inscription on an arch in the modern city preserved in the British Museum. It is also found in seventeen inscriptions (five from Thessalonica) where the word or the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολιταρχεω</span></span> occurs. It is a fine illustration of the historical accuracy of Luke in matters of detail. This title for city officers in Thessalonica, a free city, is correct. They were burgomasters or "rulers of the city."</p>
<p><b>Crying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βοωντες</span></span>). Yelling as if the house was on fire like the mob in Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:28">Acts 21:28</span>).</p>
<p><b>These that have turned the world upside down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο την οικουμενην αναστατωσαντες</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικουμενην</span></span> (supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεν</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωραν</span></span>, the inhabited earth, present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικεω</span></span>) means the Roman Empire, since it is a political charge, a natural hyperbole in their excitement, but the phrase occurs for the Roman Empire in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:1">Luke 2:1</span>. It is possible that news had come to Thessalonica of the expulsion of the Jews from Rome by Claudius. There is truth in the accusation, for Christianity is revolutionary, but on this particular occasion the uproar (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span>) was created by the rabbis and the hired loafers. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστατοω</span></span> (here first aorist active participle) does not occur in the ancient writers, but is in LXX and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:6">Acts 17:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:38">Acts 21:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:12">Galatians 5:12</span>. It occurs also in Harpocration (A.D. 4th cent.) and about 100 B.C. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαναστατοω</span></span> is found in a fragment of papyrus (Tebtunis no. 2) and in a Paris Magical Papyrus l. 2243f. But in an Egyptian letter of Aug. 4, 41 A.D. (Oxyrhynchus Pap. no. 119, 10) "the bad boy" uses it = "he upsets me" or " he drives me out of my senses" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστατο με</span></span>). See Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, pp. 84f. It is not a "Biblical word" at all, but belongs to the current <i>Koine</i>. It is a vigorous and graphic term. </p>
