<p><b> Whom Jason hath received </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ους υποδεδεκτα Ιασων</span></span>). Present perfect middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποδεχομα</span></span>, to entertain, old verb, but in N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:38">Luke 10:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:6">Luke 19:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:7">Acts 17:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:25">James 2:25</span>. This is Jason's crime and he is the prisoner before the politarchs.</p>
<p><b>These all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτο παντες</span></span>). Jason, the "brethren" of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:6">Acts 17:6</span>, Paul and Silas, and all Christians everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Contrary </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεναντ</span></span>). Late compound preposition (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο, εν, αντ</span></span>) found in Polybius, LXX, here only in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>The decrees of Caesar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των δογματων Καισαρος</span></span>). This was a charge of treason and was a sure way to get a conviction. Probably the Julian <i>Leges Majestatis</i> are in mind rather than the definite decree of Claudius about the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span>).</p>
<p><b>Saying that there is another king, one Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βασιλεα ετερον λεγοντες εινα Ιησουν</span></span>). Note the very order of the words in the Greek indirect discourse with the accusative and infinitive after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγοντες</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βασιλεα ετερον</span></span> comes first, a different king, another emperor than Caesar. This was the very charge that the smart student of the Pharisees and Herodians had tried to catch Jesus on (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:14">Mark 12:14</span>). The Sanhedrin made it anyhow against Jesus to Pilate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:2">Luke 23:2</span>) and Pilate had to notice it. "Although the emperors never ventured to assume the title <i>rex</i> at Rome, in the Eastern provinces they were regularly termed <i>basileus</i>" (Page). The Jews here, as before Pilate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:15">John 19:15</span>), renounce their dearest hope of a Messianic king. It is plain that Paul had preached about Jesus as the Messiah, King of the Kingdom of God over against the Roman Empire, a spiritual kingdom, to be sure, but the Jews here turn his language to his hurt as they did with Jesus. As a matter of fact Paul's preaching about the kingdom and the second coming of Christ was gravely misunderstood by the Christians at Thessalonica after his departure (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13-5">1 Thessalonians 4:13-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:2">1 Thessalonians 4:2</span>). The Jews were quick to seize upon his language about Jesus Christ to his own injury. Clearly here in Thessalonica Paul had faced the power of the Roman Empire in a new way and pictured over against it the grandeur of the reign of Christ. </p>
