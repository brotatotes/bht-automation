<p><b> They troubled the multitude and the rulers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εταραξαν τον οχλον κα τους πολιταρχας</span></span>). First aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταρασσω</span></span>, old verb to agitate. The excitement of the multitude "agitated" the politarchs still more. To the people it meant a revolution, to the politarchs a charge of complicity in treason if they let it pass. They had no way to disprove the charge of treason and Paul and Silas were not present. </p>
