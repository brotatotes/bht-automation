<p><b> When they had taken security </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαβοντες το ικανον</span></span>). A Greek idiom=Latin <i>satis accipere</i>, to receive the sufficient (bond), usually money for the fulfilment of the judgment. Probably the demand was made of Jason that he see to it that Paul and Silas leave the city not to return. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:17">1 Thessalonians 2:17</span>. Paul may refer to this in mentioning his inability to visit these Thessalonians again. The idiom <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανειν το ικανον</span></span> now is found in two inscriptions of the second century A.D. (O. G. I. S. 484, 50 and 629, 101). In Vol. III Oxyrhynchus Papyri no. 294 A.D. 22 the corresponding phrase <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουνα εικανον</span></span> ("to give security") appears.</p>
<p><b>They let them go </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απελυσαν αυτους</span></span>). The charge was serious but the proof slim so that the politarchs were glad to be rid of the case. </p>
