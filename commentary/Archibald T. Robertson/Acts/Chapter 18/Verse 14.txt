<p><b>Wrong </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικημα</span></span>). <i>Injuria</i>. Old word, a wrong done one. In N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:20">Acts 24:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:5">Revelation 18:5</span>. Here it may mean a legal wrong to the state.</p>
<p><b>Wicked villainy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραιδιουργημα</span></span>). A crime, act of a criminal, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραιδιουργος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραιδιος</span></span>, easy, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργον</span></span>, work), one who does a thing with ease, adroitly, a "slick citizen."</p>
<p><b>Reason would that I should bear with you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα λογον αν ανεσχομην υμων</span></span>). Literally, "according to reason I should have put up with you (or held myself back from you)." This condition is the second class (determined as unfulfilled) and means that the Jews had no case against Paul in a Roman court. The verb in the conclusion (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεσχομην</span></span>) is second aorist middle indicative and means with the ablative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμων</span></span> "I should have held myself back (direct middle) from you (ablative). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> makes the form of the condition plain. </p>
