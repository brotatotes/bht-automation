<p><b> Questions </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητηματα</span></span>). Plural, contemptuous, "a parcel of questions" (Knowling).</p>
<p><b>About words </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ λογου</span></span>). Word, singular, talk, not deed or fact (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργον, φαχτυμ</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>And names </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ονοματων</span></span>). As to whether "Jesus" should also be called "Christ" or "Messiah." The Jews, Gallio knew, split hairs over words and names.</p>
<p><b>And your own law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα νομου του καθ' υμας</span></span>) Literally, "And law that according to you." Gallio had not been caught in the trap set for him. What they had said concerned Jewish law, not Roman law at all.</p>
<p><b>Look to it yourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψεσθε αυτο</span></span>). The volitive future middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span> often used (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:4">Matthew 27:4</span>) where an imperative could be employed (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 874). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτο</span></span> (yourselves) turns it all over to them.</p>
<p><b>I am not minded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου βουλομα</span></span>). I am not willing, I do not wish. An absolute refusal to allow a religious question to be brought before a Roman civil court. This decision of Gallio does not establish Christianity in preference to Judaism. It simply means that the case was plainly that Christianity was a form of Judaism and as such was not opposed to Roman law. This decision opened the door for Paul's preaching all over the Roman Empire. Later Paul himself argues (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:9-11">Acts 18:9-11</span>) that in fact Christianity is the true, the spiritual Judaism. </p>
