<p><b> They all laid hold on Sosthenes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιλαβομενο παντες Σωσθενην</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:19">Acts 16:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:19">Acts 17:19</span> for the same form. Here is violent hostile reaction against their leader who had failed so miserably.</p>
<p><b>Beat him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετυπτον</span></span>). Inchoative imperfect active, began to beat him, even if they could not beat Paul. Sosthenes succeeded Crispus (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:8">Acts 18:8</span>) when he went over to Paul. The beating did Sosthenes good for he too finally is a Christian (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span>), a co-worker with Paul whom he had sought to persecute.</p>
<p><b>And Gallio cared for none of these things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουδεν τουτων τω Γαλλιων εμελεν</span></span>). Literally, "no one of these things was a care to Gallio." The usually impersonal verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελει, εμελεν</span></span>, imperfect active) here has the nominative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:40">Luke 10:40</span>. These words have been often misunderstood as a description of Gallio's lack of interest in Christianity, a religious indifferentist. But that is quite beside the mark. Gallio looked the other way with a blind eye while Sosthenes got the beating which he richly deserved. That was a small detail for the police court, not for the proconsul's concern. Gallio shows up well in Luke's narrative as a clear headed judge who would not be led astray by Jewish subterfuges and with the courage to dismiss a mob. </p>
