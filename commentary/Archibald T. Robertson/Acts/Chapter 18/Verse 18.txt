<p><b> Having tarried after this yet many days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετ προσμεινας ημερας ικανας</span></span>). First aorist (constative) active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσμενω</span></span>, old verb, to remain besides (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>) and that idea is expressed also in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετ</span></span> (yet). The accusative is extent of time. On Luke's frequent use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικανος</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:11">Acts 8:11</span>. It is not certain that this period of "considerable days" which followed the trial before Gallio is included in the year and six months of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:11">Acts 18:11</span> or is in addition to it which is most likely. Vindicated as Paul was, there was no reason for haste in leaving, though he usually left after such a crisis was passed.</p>
<p><b>Took his leave </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποταξαμενος</span></span>). First aorist middle (direct), old verb, to separate oneself, to bid farewell (Vulgate <i>valefacio</i>), as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:21">Acts 18:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:46">Mark 6:46</span>.</p>
<p><b>Sailed thence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεπλε</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπλεω</span></span>, old and common verb, inchoative imperfect, started to sail. Only Priscilla and Aquila are mentioned as his companions though others may have been in the party.</p>
<p><b>Having shorn his head </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κειραμενος την κεφαλην</span></span>). First aorist middle (causative) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κειρω</span></span>, old verb to shear (sheep) and the hair as also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:6">1 Corinthians 11:6</span>. The participle is masculine and so cannot refer to Priscilla. Aquila comes next to the participle, but since mention of Priscilla and Aquila is parenthetical and the two other participles (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσμεινασ, αποταξαμενος</span></span>) refer to Paul it seems clear that this one does also.</p>
<p><b>For he had a vow </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειχεν γαρ ευχην</span></span>). Imperfect active showing the continuance of the vow up till this time in Cenchreae, the port of Corinth when it expired. It was not a Nazarite vow which could be absolved only in Jerusalem. It is possible that the hair was only polled or trimmed, cut shorter, not "shaved" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυραω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:24">Acts 21:24</span>) for there is a distinction as both verbs are contrasted in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:6">1 Corinthians 11:6</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κειρασθα η ξυρασθα</span></span>). It is not clear what sort of a vow Paul had taken nor why he took it. It may have been a thank offering for the outcome at Corinth (Hackett). Paul as a Jew kept up his observance of the ceremonial law, but refused to impose it on the Gentiles. </p>
