<p><b> Came </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηντησαν</span></span>). Came down, as usual in speaking of coming to land (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>To Ephesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Εφεσον</span></span>). This great city on the Cayster, the capital of the Province of Asia, the home of the worship of Diana (Artemis) with a wonderful temple, Paul at last had reached, though forbidden to come on the way out on this tour (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:6">Acts 16:6</span>). Here Paul will spend three years after his return from Jerusalem.</p>
<p><b>He left them there </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακεινους κατελιπεν αυτου</span></span>). That is, Priscilla and Aquila he left (second aorist active indicative) here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span>). But Luke mentions the departure by way of anticipation before he actually went away (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:21">Acts 18:21</span>).</p>
<p><b>But he himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος δε</span></span>). Paul again the leading person in the narrative. On this occasion he may have gone alone into the synagogue.</p>
<p><b>He reasoned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διελεξατο</span></span>). Luke's favourite word for Paul's synagogue discourses (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:2">Acts 17:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:17">Acts 17:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:4">Acts 18:4</span> which see) as also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:8">Acts 19:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:9">Acts 19:9</span>. </p>
