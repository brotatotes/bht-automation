<p><b> Aquila </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ακυλαν</span></span>). Luke calls him a Jew from Pontus, apparently not yet a disciple, though there were Jews from Pontus at the great Pentecost who were converted (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9">Acts 2:9</span>). Aquila who made the famous A.D. translation of the O.T. was also from Pontus. Paul "found" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρων</span></span>, second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκω</span></span>) though we do not know how. Edersheim says that a Jewish guild always kept together whether in street or synagogue so that by this bond they probably met.</p>
<p><b>Lately come from Italy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσφατως εληλυθοτα απο της Ιταλιας</span></span>). Second perfect participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>. <i>Koine</i> adverb, here only in the N.T., from adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσφατος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ, σφαω</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφαζω</span></span>, to kill), lately slaughtered and so fresh or recent (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:20">Hebrews 10:20</span>).</p>
<p><b>With his wife Priscilla </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα Πρισκιλλαν γυναικα αυτου</span></span>). Diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πρισκα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:3">Romans 16:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:19">1 Corinthians 16:19</span>). Prisca is a name in the Acilian family and the Prisci was the name of another noble clan. Aquila may have been a freedman like many Jews in Rome. Her name comes before his in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:18">Acts 18:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:26">Acts 18:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:3">Romans 16:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:9">2 Timothy 4:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>Because Claudius had commanded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το διατεταχενα Κλαυδιον</span></span>). Perfect active articular infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διατασσω</span></span>, old verb to dispose, arrange, here with accusative of general reference. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δια</span></span> here is causal sense, "because of the having ordered as to Claudius." This was about A.D. 49, done, Suetonius says (<i>Claudius</i> C. 25), because "the Jews were in a state of constant tumult at the instigation of one Chrestus" (probably among the Jews about Christ so pronounced). At any rate Jews were unpopular in Rome for Tiberius had deported 4,000 to Sardinia. There were 20,000 Jews in Rome. Probably mainly those implicated in the riots actually left. </p>
