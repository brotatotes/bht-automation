<p><b> I shall return </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακαμψω</span></span>). Future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακαμπτω</span></span>, old verb to bend back, turn back (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:2">Matthew 2:2</span>).</p>
<p><b>If God will </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θεου θελοντος</span></span>). Genitive absolute of present active participle. This expression (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> with subjunctive) occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:19">1 Corinthians 4:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:7">1 Corinthians 16:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:15">James 4:15</span>. Such phrases were common among Jews, Greeks, and Romans, and are today. It is simply a recognition that we are in God's hands. The Textus Receptus has here a sentence not in the best MSS.: "I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem." This addition by D and other documents may have been due to a desire to give a reason for the language in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:22">Acts 18:22</span> about "going up" to Jerusalem. Whether Paul said it or not, it was in the spring when he made this journey with a company of pilgrims probably going to the feast of Pentecost in Jerusalem. We know that later Paul did try to reach Jerusalem for Pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:16">Acts 20:16</span>) and succeeded. As the ship was leaving, Paul had to go, but with the hope of returning soon to Ephesus as he did. </p>
