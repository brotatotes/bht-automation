<p><b> Having spent some time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησας χρονον τινα</span></span>). Literally, having done some time. How long we do not know, probably not long. There are those who place the visit of Peter here to which Paul alludes in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11">Galatians 2:11</span> and which we have located while Paul was here the last time (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:35">Acts 15:35</span>).</p>
<p><b>He departed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηλθεν</span></span>). Thus simply and alone Paul began the third mission tour without a Barnabas or a Silas.</p>
<p><b>Went through </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διερχομενος</span></span>). Present middle participle, going through.</p>
<p><b>The region of Galatia and Phrygia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεν Γαλατικην χωραν κα Φρψγιαν</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:6">Acts 16:6</span> for discussion of this phrase, here in reverse order, passing through the Galatic region and then Phrygia. Does Luke mean Lycaonia (Derbe and Lystra) and Phrygia (Iconium and Pisidian Antioch)? Or does he mean the route west through the old Galatia and the old Phrygia on west into Asia? The same conflict exists here over the South Galatian and the North Galatian theories. Phrygia is apparently distinguished from the Galatic region here. It is apparently A.D. 52 when Paul set out on this tour.</p>
<p><b>In order </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθεξης</span></span>). In succession as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:4">Acts 11:4</span>, though the names of the cities are not given.</p>
<p><b>Stablishing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηριζων</span></span>). As he did in the second tour (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:41">Acts 15:41</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστηριζων</span></span>, compound of this same verb) which see. </p>
