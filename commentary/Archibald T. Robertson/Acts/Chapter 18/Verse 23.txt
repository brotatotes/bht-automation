 Having spent some time  (ποιησας χρονον τινα). Literally, having done some time. How long we do not know, probably not long. There are those who place the visit of Peter here to which Paul alludes in Galatians 2:11 and which we have located while Paul was here the last time (Acts 15:35).He departed  (εξηλθεν). Thus simply and alone Paul began the third mission tour without a Barnabas or a Silas.Went through  (διερχομενος). Present middle participle, going through.The region of Galatia and Phrygia  (τεν Γαλατικην χωραν κα Φρψγιαν). See on Acts 16:6 for discussion of this phrase, here in reverse order, passing through the Galatic region and then Phrygia. Does Luke mean Lycaonia (Derbe and Lystra) and Phrygia (Iconium and Pisidian Antioch)? Or does he mean the route west through the old Galatia and the old Phrygia on west into Asia? The same conflict exists here over the South Galatian and the North Galatian theories. Phrygia is apparently distinguished from the Galatic region here. It is apparently A.D. 52 when Paul set out on this tour.In order  (καθεξης). In succession as in Acts 11:4, though the names of the cities are not given.Stablishing  (στηριζων). As he did in the second tour (Acts 15:41, επιστηριζων, compound of this same verb) which see.
