<p><b> Had been instructed in the way of the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην κατηχημενος την οδον του κυριου</span></span>). Periphrastic past perfect passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηχεω</span></span>, rare in the old Greek and not in the LXX from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηχεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηχω</span></span>, sound) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:4">Luke 1:4</span>, to re-sound, to re-echo, to teach by repeated dinning into the ears as the Arabs do now, to teach orally by word of mouth (and ear). Here the accusative of the thing (the word) is retained in the passive like with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκω</span></span>, to teach (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 485). Being fervent in spirit (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζεων τω πνευματ</span></span>). Boiling (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζεω</span></span>, to boil, old and common verb, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:11">Romans 12:11</span>) like boiling water or yeast. The Latin verb <i>ferveo</i> means to boil or ferment. Locative case after it.</p>
<p><b>Taught carefully </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιδασκεν ακριβως</span></span>). Imperfect active, was teaching or inchoative, began teaching, accurately. He taught accurately what he knew, a fine gift for any preacher.</p>
<p><b>Only the baptism of John </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονον το βαπτισμα Ιωανου</span></span>). It was a</p>
<p><b>baptism of repentance </b> (marked by repentance) as Paul said (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:24">Acts 13:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:4">Acts 19:4</span>), as Peter said (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span>) and as the Gospels tell (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:4">Mark 1:4</span>, etc.). That is to say, Apollos knew only what the Baptist knew when he died, but John had preached the coming of the Messiah, had baptized him, had identified him as the Son of God, had proclaimed the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but had not seen the Cross, the Resurrection of Jesus, nor the great Day of Pentecost. </p>
