<p><b> Encouraged him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προτρεψαμενο</span></span>). First aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προτρεπω</span></span>, old verb, to urge forward, to push on, only here in the N.T. Since Apollos wanted (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομενου αυτου</span></span>, genitive absolute) to go into Achaia, the brethren (including others besides Priscilla and Aquila) wrote (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγραψαν</span></span>) a letter of introduction to the disciples in Corinth to receive him (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδεξασθα αυτον</span></span>), a nice letter of recommendation and a sincere one also. But Paul will refer to this very letter later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:1">2 Corinthians 3:1</span>) and observe that he himself needed no such letter of commendation. The Codex Bezae adds here that certain Corinthians who had come to Ephesus heard Apollos and begged him to cross over with them to Corinth. This may very well be the way that Apollos was led to go. Preachers often receive calls because visitors from other places hear them. Priscilla and Aquila were well known in Corinth and their approval would carry weight. But they did not urge Apollos to stay longer in Ephesus.</p>
<p><b>Helped them much </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεβαλετο πολυ</span></span>). Second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνβαλλω</span></span> used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span> for "dispute," old verb to throw together, in the N.T. always in the active save here in the middle (common in Greek writers) to put together, to help.</p>
<p><b>Through grace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια της χαριτος</span></span>). This makes sense if taken with "believed," as Hackett does (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:48">Acts 13:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:14">Acts 16:14</span>) or with "helped" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:10">1 Corinthians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:10">1 Corinthians 15:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>). Both are true as the references show. </p>
