<p><b> Because he was of the same trade </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το ομοτεχνον εινα</span></span>). Same construction with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> as above. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hομοτεχνον</span></span> is an old word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοσ, τεχνη</span></span>), though here alone in N.T. Rabbi Judah says: "He that teacheth not his son a trade, doth the same as if he taught him to be a thief." So it was easy for Paul to find a home with these "tentmakers by trade" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνοιποιο τη τεχνη</span></span>). Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνη</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>, here only in the N.T. They made portable tents of leather or of cloth of goat's hair. So Paul lived in this home with this noble man and his wife, all the more congenial if already Christians which they soon became at any rate. They worked as partners in the common trade. Paul worked for his support elsewhere, already in Thessalonica (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:8">2 Thessalonians 3:8</span>) and later at Ephesus with Aquila and Priscilla (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:18">Acts 18:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:26">Acts 18:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:34">Acts 20:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:19">1 Corinthians 16:19</span>). They moved again to Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:3">Romans 16:3</span>) and were evidently a couple of considerable wealth and generosity. It was a blessing to Paul to find himself with these people. So he "abode" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμενεν</span></span>, imperfect active) with them and "they wrought" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηργαζοντο</span></span>, imperfect middle), happy and busy during week days. </p>
