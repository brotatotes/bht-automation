 Was constrained by the word  (συνειχετο τω λογω). This is undoubtedly the correct text and not τω πνευματ of the Textus Receptus, but συνειχετο is in my opinion the direct middle imperfect indicative, not the imperfect passive as the translations have it (Robertson, Grammar, p. 808). Paul held himself together or completely to the preaching instead of just on Sabbaths in the synagogue (verse Acts 18:4). The coming of Silas and Timothy with the gifts from Macedonia (1 Thessalonians 3:6; 2 Corinthians 11:9; Philippians 4:15) set Paul free from tent-making for a while so that he began to devote himself (inchoative imperfect) with fresh consecration to preaching. See the active in 2 Corinthians 5:14. He was now also assisted by Silas and Timothy (2 Corinthians 1:19).Testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ  (διαμαρτυρομενος τοις Ιουδαιοις εινα τον Χριστον Ιησουν). Paul's witness everywhere (Acts 9:22; Acts 17:3). This verb διαμαρτυρομενος occurs in Acts 2:40 (which see) for Peter's earnest witness. Perhaps daily now in the synagogue he spoke to the Jews who came. Εινα is the infinitive in indirect discourse (assertion) with the accusative of general reference. By τον Χριστον Paul means "the Messiah." His witness is to show to the Jews that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah.
