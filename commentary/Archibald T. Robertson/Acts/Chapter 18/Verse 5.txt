<p><b> Was constrained by the word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνειχετο τω λογω</span></span>). This is undoubtedly the correct text and not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω πνευματ</span></span> of the Textus Receptus, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνειχετο</span></span> is in my opinion the direct middle imperfect indicative, not the imperfect passive as the translations have it (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 808). Paul held himself together or completely to the preaching instead of just on Sabbaths in the synagogue (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:4">Acts 18:4</span>). The coming of Silas and Timothy with the gifts from Macedonia (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:6">1 Thessalonians 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:9">2 Corinthians 11:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:15">Philippians 4:15</span>) set Paul free from tent-making for a while so that he began to devote himself (inchoative imperfect) with fresh consecration to preaching. See the active in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:14">2 Corinthians 5:14</span>. He was now also assisted by Silas and Timothy (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:19">2 Corinthians 1:19</span>).</p>
<p><b>Testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαμαρτυρομενος τοις Ιουδαιοις εινα τον Χριστον Ιησουν</span></span>). Paul's witness everywhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:22">Acts 9:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:3">Acts 17:3</span>). This verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαμαρτυρομενος</span></span> occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:40">Acts 2:40</span> (which see) for Peter's earnest witness. Perhaps daily now in the synagogue he spoke to the Jews who came. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εινα</span></span> is the infinitive in indirect discourse (assertion) with the accusative of general reference. By <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον Χριστον</span></span> Paul means "the Messiah." His witness is to show to the Jews that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah. </p>
