<p><b> Titus Justus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τιτου Ιουστου</span></span>). So Aleph E Vulgate, while B has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τιτιαυ Ιουστου</span></span>, while most MSS. have only <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιουστου</span></span>. Evidently a Roman citizen and not Titus, brother of Luke, of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1">Galatians 2:1</span>. We had Barsabbas Justus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:23">Acts 1:23</span>) and Paul speaks of Jesus Justus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:11">Colossians 4:11</span>). The Titii were a famous family of potters in Corinth. This Roman was a God-fearer whose house "joined hard to the synagogue" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην συνομορουσα τη συναγωγη</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνομορεω</span></span>, a late (Byzantine) word, here only in the N.T., followed by the associative instrumental case, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνομορος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομορος</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομος</span></span>, joint, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορος</span></span>, boundary) having joint boundaries, right next to. Whether Paul chose this location for his work because it was next to the synagogue, we do not know, but it caught the attendants at the synagogue worship. In Ephesus when Paul had to leave the synagogue he went to the school house of Tyrannus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:9">Acts 19:9</span>). The lines are being drawn between the Christians and the Jews, drawn by the Jews themselves. </p>
