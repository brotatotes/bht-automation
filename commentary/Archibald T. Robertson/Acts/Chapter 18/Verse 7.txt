 Titus Justus  (Τιτου Ιουστου). So Aleph E Vulgate, while B has Τιτιαυ Ιουστου, while most MSS. have only Ιουστου. Evidently a Roman citizen and not Titus, brother of Luke, of Galatians 2:1. We had Barsabbas Justus (Acts 1:23) and Paul speaks of Jesus Justus (Colossians 4:11). The Titii were a famous family of potters in Corinth. This Roman was a God-fearer whose house "joined hard to the synagogue" (ην συνομορουσα τη συναγωγη). Periphrastic imperfect active of συνομορεω, a late (Byzantine) word, here only in the N.T., followed by the associative instrumental case, from συνομορος (συν, ομορος from ομος, joint, and ορος, boundary) having joint boundaries, right next to. Whether Paul chose this location for his work because it was next to the synagogue, we do not know, but it caught the attendants at the synagogue worship. In Ephesus when Paul had to leave the synagogue he went to the school house of Tyrannus (Acts 19:9). The lines are being drawn between the Christians and the Jews, drawn by the Jews themselves.
