<p><b> Crispus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κρισπος</span></span>). Though a Jew and ruler of the synagogue (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:15">Acts 13:15</span>), he had a Latin name. Paul baptized him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span>) himself, perhaps because of his prominence, apparently letting Silas and Timothy baptize most of the converts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14-17">1 Corinthians 1:14-17</span>). Probably he followed Paul to the house of Titus Justus. It looked like ruin for the synagogue.</p>
<p><b>With all his house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν ολω τω οικω αυτου</span></span>). Another household conversion, for Crispus "believed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευσεν</span></span>) in the Lord with all his house."</p>
<p><b>Hearing believed and were baptized </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουοντες επιστευον κα εβαπτιζοντο</span></span>). Present active participle and imperfect indicatives active and passive, expressing repetition for the "many" others who kept coming to the Lord in Corinth. It was a continual revival after Silas and Timothy came and a great church was gathered here during the nearly two years that Paul laboured in Corinth (possibly A.D. 51 and 52). </p>
