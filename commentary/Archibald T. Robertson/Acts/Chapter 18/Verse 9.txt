<p><b> Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη φοβου, αλλα λαλε κα μη σιωπησηις</span></span>). Literally, "stop being afraid (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> with present middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβεω</span></span>), but go on speaking (present active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span>) and do not become silent (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and first aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σιωπαω</span></span>, ingressive aorist)." Evidently there were signs of a gathering storm before this vision and message from the Lord Jesus came to Paul one night. Paul knew only too well what Jewish hatred could do as he had learned it at Damascus, Jerusalem, Antioch in Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe, Thessalonica, Beroea. He had clearly moments of doubt whether he had not better move on or become silent for a while in Corinth. Every pastor knows what it is to have such moods and moments. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:2">2 Thessalonians 3:2</span> (written at this time) we catch Paul's dejection of spirits. He was like Elijah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:4">1 Kings 19:4</span>) and Jeremiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+15:15">Jeremiah 15:15</span>). </p>
