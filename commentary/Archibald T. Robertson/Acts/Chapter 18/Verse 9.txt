 Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace  (Μη φοβου, αλλα λαλε κα μη σιωπησηις). Literally, "stop being afraid (μη with present middle imperative of φοβεω), but go on speaking (present active imperative of λαλεω) and do not become silent (μη and first aorist active of σιωπαω, ingressive aorist)." Evidently there were signs of a gathering storm before this vision and message from the Lord Jesus came to Paul one night. Paul knew only too well what Jewish hatred could do as he had learned it at Damascus, Jerusalem, Antioch in Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe, Thessalonica, Beroea. He had clearly moments of doubt whether he had not better move on or become silent for a while in Corinth. Every pastor knows what it is to have such moods and moments. In 2 Thessalonians 3:2 (written at this time) we catch Paul's dejection of spirits. He was like Elijah (1 Kings 19:4) and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 15:15).
