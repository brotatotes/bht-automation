<p><b> For two years </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ ετη δυο</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> with accusative for extent of time as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:8">Acts 19:8</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ μηνας τρεις</span></span> and often. But in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:31">Acts 20:31</span> Paul said to the Ephesian elders at Miletus that he laboured with them for the space of "three years." That may be a general expression and there was probably a longer period after the "two years" in the school of Tyrannus besides the six months in the synagogue. Paul may have preached thereafter in the house of Aquila and Priscilla for some months, the "for a while" of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>.</p>
<p><b>So that all they which dwelt in Asia heard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε παντας τους κατοικουντας την Ασιαν ακουσα</span></span>). Actual result with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span> and the infinitive with accusative of general reference as is common (also verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:11">Acts 19:11</span>) in the <i>Koine</i> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 999f.). Paul apparently remained in Ephesus, but the gospel spread all over the province even to the Lycus Valley including the rest of the seven churches of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:11">Revelation 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:2">Revelation 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>. Demetrius in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:26">Acts 19:26</span> will confirm the tremendous influence of Paul's ministry in Ephesus on Asia. Forty years after this Pliny in his famous letter to Trajan from Bithynia will say of Christianity: "For the contagion of this superstition has not only spread through cities, but also through villages and country places." It was during these years in Ephesus that Paul was greatly disturbed over the troubles in the Corinthian Church. He apparently wrote a letter to them now lost to us (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:9">1 Corinthians 5:9</span>), received messages from the household of Chloe, a letter from the church, special messengers, sent Timothy, then Titus, may have made a hurried trip himself, wrote our First Corinthians, was planning to go after the return of Titus to Troas where he was to meet him after Pentecost, when all of a sudden the uproar raised by Demetrius hurried Paul away sooner than he had planned. Meanwhile Apollos had returned from Corinth to Ephesus and refused to go back (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:12">1 Corinthians 16:12</span>). Paul doubtless had helpers like Epaphras and Philemon who carried the message over the province of Asia, Tychicus, and Trophimus of Asia who were with him on the last visit to Jerusalem (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>). Paul's message reached Greeks, not merely Hellenists and God-fearers, but some of the Greeks in the upper circles of life in Ephesus. </p>
