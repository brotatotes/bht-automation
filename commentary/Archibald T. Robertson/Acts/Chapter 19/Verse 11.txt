<p><b> Special miracles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμεις ου τας τυχουσας</span></span>). "Powers not the ones that happen by chance," "not the ordinary ones," litotes for "the extraordinary." All "miracles" or "powers" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμεις</span></span>) are supernatural and out of the ordinary, but here God regularly wrought (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποιε</span></span>), imperfect active) wonders beyond those familiar to the disciples and completely different from the deeds of the Jewish exorcists. This phrase is peculiar to Luke in the N.T. (also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:2">Acts 28:2</span>), but it occurs in the classical Greek and in the <i>Koine</i> as in III Macc. 3:7 and in papyri and inscriptions (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 255). In Samaria Philip wrought miracles to deliver the people from the influence of Simon Magus. Here in Ephesus exorcists and other magicians had built an enormous vogue of a false spiritualism and Paul faces unseen forces of evil. His tremendous success led some people to superstitious practices thinking that there was power in Paul's person. </p>
