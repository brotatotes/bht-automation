<p><b> Of the strolling Jews, exorcists </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των περιερχομενων Ιουδαιων εξορκιστων</span></span>). These exorcists travelled around (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span>) from place to place like modern Gypsy fortune-tellers. The Jews were especially addicted to such practices with spells of sorcery connected with the name of Solomon (Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. VIII. 2.5). See also Tobit 8:1-3. Jesus alludes to those in Palestine (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:27">Matthew 12:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:19">Luke 11:19</span>). The exorcists were originally those who administered an oath (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξορκιζω</span></span>, to exact an oath), then to use an oath as a spell or charm. Only instance here in the N.T. These men regarded Paul as one of their own number just as Simon Magus treated Simon Peter. Only here these exorcists paid Paul the compliment of imitation instead of offering money as Magus did.</p>
<p><b>To name over </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομαζειν επ</span></span>). They heard what Paul said and treated his words as a magic charm or spell to drive the evil spirits out.</p>
<p><b>I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hορκιζω υμας τον Ιησουν ον Παυλος κηρυσσε</span></span>). Note two accusatives with the verb of swearing (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:7">Mark 5:7</span>) as a causative verb (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 483). The papyri furnish numerous instances of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορκιζω</span></span> in such constructions (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 281). Note also the article with Jesus, "the Jesus," as if to identify the magic word to the demons with the addition "whom Paul preaches." They thought that success turned on the correct use of the magical formula. The Ephesian mysteries included Christianity, so they supposed. </p>
