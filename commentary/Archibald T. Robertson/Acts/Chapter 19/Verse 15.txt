 Jesus I know  (τον Ιησουν γινωσκω). "The (whom you mention) Jesus I recognize (γινωσκω)" and "the (whom you mentioned) Paul I am acquainted with (τον Παυλον επισταμα)." Clear distinction between γινωσκω and επισταμα.But who are ye?  (υμεις δε τινες εστε?). But you, who are you? Emphatic prolepsis.
