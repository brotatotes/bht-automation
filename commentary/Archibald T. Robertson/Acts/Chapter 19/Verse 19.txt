<p><b> Not a few of them that practised curious arts </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικανο των τα περιεργα πραξαντων</span></span>). Considerable number of the performers or exorcists themselves who knew that they were humbugs were led to renounce their evil practices. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεργα</span></span> (curious) is an old word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περι, εργα</span></span>) originally a piddler about trifles, a busybody (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:13">1 Timothy 5:13</span>), then impertinent and magical things as here. Only two examples in the N.T. It is a technical term for magic as the papyri and inscriptions show. Deissmann (<i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 323) thinks that these books here burned were just like the Magic Papyri now recovered from Egypt.</p>
<p><b>Burned them in the sight of all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεκαιον ενωπιον παντων</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακαιω</span></span>. It probably took a good while to do it, burned them completely (up, we say; down, the Greeks say, perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>). These Magical Papyri or slips of parchment with symbols or magical sentences written on them called <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εφεσια Γραμματα</span></span> (Ephesian Letters). These Ephesian Letters were worn as amulets or charms.</p>
<p><b>They brought them together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνενεγκαντες</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνφερω</span></span>. What a glorious conflagration it would be if in every city all the salacious, blasphemous, degrading books, pamphlets, magazines, and papers could be piled together and burned.</p>
<p><b>They counted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεψηφισαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνψηφιζω</span></span>, to reckon together. In LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+29:49">Jeremiah 29:49</span>). Only here in N.T. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συνκαταψηφιζω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:26">Acts 1:26</span>.</p>
<p><b>Fifty thousand pieces of silver </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αργυριου μυριαδας πεντε</span></span>). Five ten thousand (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυριαδας</span></span>) pieces of silver. Ephesus was largely Greek and probably the silver pieces were Greek drachmae or the Latin denarius, probably about ten thousand dollars or two thousand English pounds. </p>
