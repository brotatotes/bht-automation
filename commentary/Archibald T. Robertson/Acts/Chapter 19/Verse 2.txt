<p><b> Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε πνευμα αγιον ελαβετε πιστευσαντεσ?</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Π</span></span> in a direct question occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:6">Acts 1:6</span>, is not according to the old Greek idiom, but is common in the LXX and the N.T. as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:23">Luke 13:23</span> which see (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 916). Apparently Paul was suspicious of the looks or conduct of these professed disciples. The first aorist active participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευσαντες</span></span> is simultaneous with the second aorist active indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαβετε</span></span> and refers to the same event.</p>
<p><b>Nay, we did not so much as hear whether the Holy Spirit was </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αλλ' ουδε ε πνευμα αγιον εστιν ηκουσαμεν</span></span>). The reply of these ignorant disciples is amazing. They probably refer to the time of their baptism and mean that, when baptized, they did not hear whether (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> in indirect question) the Holy Spirit was (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> retained as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span>). Plain proof that they knew John's message poorly. </p>
