 Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed?  (ε πνευμα αγιον ελαβετε πιστευσαντεσ?). This use of Π in a direct question occurs in Acts 1:6, is not according to the old Greek idiom, but is common in the LXX and the N.T. as in Luke 13:23 which see (Robertson, Grammar, p. 916). Apparently Paul was suspicious of the looks or conduct of these professed disciples. The first aorist active participle πιστευσαντες is simultaneous with the second aorist active indicative ελαβετε and refers to the same event.Nay, we did not so much as hear whether the Holy Spirit was  (Αλλ' ουδε ε πνευμα αγιον εστιν ηκουσαμεν). The reply of these ignorant disciples is amazing. They probably refer to the time of their baptism and mean that, when baptized, they did not hear whether (ε in indirect question) the Holy Spirit was (εστιν retained as in John 7:39). Plain proof that they knew John's message poorly.
