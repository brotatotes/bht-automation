<p><b> No small stir </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταραχος ουκ ολιγος</span></span>). Same phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:18">Acts 12:18</span> and nowhere else in the N.T. Litotes.</p>
<p><b>Concerning the Way </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ της οδου</span></span>). See this phrase for Christianity in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:2">Acts 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:9">Acts 19:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:22">Acts 24:22</span> which see, like the "Jesus Way" of the Indians. There had already been opposition and "stir" before this stage (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:11-20">Acts 19:11-20</span>). The fight with wild beasts in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:32">1 Corinthians 15:32</span> (whatever it was) was before that Epistle was written and so before this new uproar. Paul as a Roman citizen could not be thrown to wild beasts, but he so pictured the violent opponents of Christ in Ephesus. </p>
