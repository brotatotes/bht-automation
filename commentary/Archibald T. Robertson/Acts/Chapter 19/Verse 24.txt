<p><b> Demetrius, a silversmith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δημητριος αργυροκοπος</span></span>). The name is common enough and may or may not be the man mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:12">3 John 1:12</span> who was also from the neighbourhood of Ephesus. There is on an inscription at Ephesus near the close of the century a Demetrius called <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεοποιος Αρτεμιδος</span></span> a temple warden of Artemis (Diana). Zoeckler suggests that Luke misunderstood this word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεοποιος</span></span> and translated it into <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αργυροκοπος</span></span>, a beater (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπτω</span></span>, to beat) of silver (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αργυρος</span></span>, silver), "which made silver shrines of Artemis" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιων ναους</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αργυρους</span></span>) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αρτεμιδος</span></span>). It is true that no silver shrines of the temple have been found in Ephesus, but only numerous terra-cotta ones. Ramsay suggests that the silver ones would naturally be melted down. The date is too late anyhow to identify the Demetrius who was <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεοποιος</span></span> with the Demetrius <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αργυροκοπος</span></span> who made little silver temples of Artemis, though B does not have the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αργυρους</span></span>. The poor votaries would buy the terra-cotta ones, the rich the silver shrines (Ramsay, <i>Paul the Traveller</i>, p. 278). These small models of the temple with the statue of Artemis inside would be set up in the houses or even worn as amulets. It is a pity that the Revised Version renders Artemis here. Diana as the Ephesian Artemis is quite distinct from the Greek Artemis, the sister of Apollo, the Diana of the Romans. This temple, built in the 6th century B.C., was burnt by Herostratus Oct. 13 B.C. 356, the night when Alexander the Great was born. It was restored and was considered one of the seven wonders of the world. Artemis was worshipped as the goddess of fertility, like the Lydian Cybele, a figure with many breasts. The great festival in May would offer Demetrius a golden opportunity for the sale of the shrines.</p>
<p><b>Brought no little business </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρειχετο ουκ ολιγην εργασιαν</span></span>). Imperfect middle, continued to bring (furnish, provide). The middle accents the part that Demetrius played as the leader of the guild of silversmiths, work for himself and for them.</p>
<p><b>Unto the craftsmen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταις τεχνιταις</span></span>). The artisans from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεχνη</span></span> (craft, art). Trade guilds were common in the ancient world. Demetrius had probably organized this guild and provided the capital for the enterprise. </p>
