<p><b> Whom he gathered together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ους συναθροισας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναθροιζω</span></span>, old verb to assemble together (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αθροος</span></span>, a crowd), in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:12">Acts 12:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>With the workmen of like occupation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τους περ τα τοιαυτα εργατας</span></span>). "And the workmen concerning such things," apparently those who made the marble and terra-cotta shrines who would also be affected in the same way. It was a gathering of the associated trades, not for a strike, for employer and employees met together, but in protest against the preaching of Paul.</p>
<p><b>We have our wealth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ευπορια ημιν εστιν</span></span>). The wealth is to us (dative of possession). This old word for wealth occurs here alone in the N.T. It is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορος</span></span>, easy to pass through, easy to accomplish, to be well off, wealthy, welfare, weal, well-being, rich. Demetrius appeals to this knowledge and self-interest of the artisans as the basis for their zeal for Artemis, piety for revenue. </p>
