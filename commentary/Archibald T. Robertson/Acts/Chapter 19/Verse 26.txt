<p><b> At Ephesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εφεσου</span></span>). Genitive of place as also with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ασιας</span></span> (Asia). Cf. Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 494f.</p>
<p><b>This Paul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Παυλος ουτος</span></span>). Contemptuous use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Hath turned away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετεστησεν</span></span>). Changed, transposed. First aorist active indicative, did change. Tribute to Paul's powers as a preacher borne out by Luke's record in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:10">Acts 19:10</span>. There may be an element of exaggeration on the part of Demetrius to incite the workmen to action, for the worship of Artemis was their wealth. Paul had cut the nerve of their business. There had long been a Jewish colony in Ephesus, but their protest against idolatry was as nothing compared with Paul's preaching (Furneaux).</p>
<p><b>Which are made with hands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δια χειρων γινομενο</span></span>). Note the present tense, made from time to time. No doubt Paul had put the point sharply as in Athens (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:29">Acts 17:29</span>). Isaiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+44:9-17">Isaiah 44:9-17</span>) had pictured graphically the absurdity of worshipping stocks and stones, flatly forbidden by the Old Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:4">Exodus 20:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+135:15-18">Psalms 135:15-18</span>). The people identified their gods with the images of them and Demetrius reflects that point of view. He was jealous of the brand of gods turned out by his factory. The artisans would stand by him on this point. It was a reflection on their work. </p>
