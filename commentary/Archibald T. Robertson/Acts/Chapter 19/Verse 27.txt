 This our trade  (τουτο το μερος). Part, share, task, job, trade.Come into disrepute  (εις απελεγμον ελθειν). Not in the old writers, but in LXX and Koine. Literally, reputation, exposure, censure, rejection after examination, and so disrepute. Their business of making gods would lose caste as the liquor trade (still called the trade in England) has done in our day. They felt this keenly and so Demetrius names it first. They felt it in their pockets.Of the great goddess Artemis  (της μεγαλης θεας Αρτεμιδος). She was generally known as the Great (η Μεγαλη). An inscription found at Ephesus calls her "the greatest god" (η μεγιστη θεος). The priests were eunuchs and there were virgin priestesses and a lower order of slaves known as temple-sweepers (νεωκορο, verse Acts 19:35).

Be reckoned as nothing, first aorist passive infinitive of λογιζομα and εις.Should even be deposed of her magnificence  (μελλειν τε κα καθαιρεισθα της μεγαλειοτητος αυτης). Note the present infinitive after μελλειν, ablative case (so best MSS.) after καθαιρεω, to take down, to depose, to deprive of. The word μεγαλειοτης occurs also in Luke 9:43 (the majesty of God) and in 2 Peter 1:16 of the transfiguration of Christ.

See Acts 11:28 for same use of οικουμενη. An exaggeration, to be sure, but Pausanias says that no deity was more widely worshipped. Temples of Artemis have been found in Spain and Gaul. Multitudo errantium non efficit veritatem (Bengel). Even today heathenism has more followers than Christianity. To think that all this splendour was being set at naught by one man and a despised Jew at that!
