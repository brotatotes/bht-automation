<p><b> This our trade </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο το μερος</span></span>). Part, share, task, job, trade.</p>
<p><b>Come into disrepute </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις απελεγμον ελθειν</span></span>). Not in the old writers, but in LXX and <i>Koine</i>. Literally, reputation, exposure, censure, rejection after examination, and so disrepute. Their business of making gods would lose caste as the liquor trade (still called the trade in England) has done in our day. They felt this keenly and so Demetrius names it first. They felt it in their pockets.</p>
<p><b>Of the great goddess Artemis </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της μεγαλης θεας Αρτεμιδος</span></span>). She was generally known as the Great (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η Μεγαλη</span></span>). An inscription found at Ephesus calls her "the greatest god" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η μεγιστη θεος</span></span>). The priests were eunuchs and there were virgin priestesses and a lower order of slaves known as temple-sweepers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεωκορο</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:35">Acts 19:35</span>). They had wild orgiastic exercises that were disgraceful with their Corybantic processions and revelries.</p>
<p><b>Be made of no account </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ουθεν λογισθηνα</span></span>). Be reckoned as nothing, first aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογιζομα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Should even be deposed of her magnificence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλειν τε κα καθαιρεισθα της μεγαλειοτητος αυτης</span></span>). Note the present infinitive after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλειν</span></span>, ablative case (so best MSS.) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαιρεω</span></span>, to take down, to depose, to deprive of. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγαλειοτης</span></span> occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:43">Luke 9:43</span> (the majesty of God) and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16">2 Peter 1:16</span> of the transfiguration of Christ. It is already in the LXX and Deissmann (<i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 363) thinks that the word runs parallel with terms used in the emperor-cult.</p>
<p><b>All Asia and the world </b> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολη (η) Ασια κα (η) οικουμενη</span></span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span> for same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικουμενη</span></span>. An exaggeration, to be sure, but Pausanias says that no deity was more widely worshipped. Temples of Artemis have been found in Spain and Gaul. <i>Multitudo errantium non efficit veritatem</i> (Bengel). Even today heathenism has more followers than Christianity. To think that all this splendour was being set at naught by one man and a despised Jew at that! </p>
