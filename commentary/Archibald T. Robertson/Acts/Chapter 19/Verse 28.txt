<p><b> They were filled with wrath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενο πλερεις θυμου</span></span>). Having become full of wrath.</p>
<p><b>Cried out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκραζον</span></span>). Inchoative imperfect, began to cry out and kept it up continuously. Reiteration was characteristic of the orgiastic exercises. The Codex Bezae adds after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυμου</span></span> (wrath): <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δραμοντες εις την αμφοδον</span></span> (running into the street), which they certainly did after the speech of Demetrius.</p>
<p><b>Great is Artemis of the Ephesians </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μεγαλη η Αρτεμις Εφεσιων</span></span>). D (Codex Bezae) omits <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span> (the) and makes it read: "Great Artemis of the Ephesians." This was the usual cry of the votaries in their orgies as the inscriptions show, an ejaculatory outcry or prayer instead of an argument as the other MSS. have it. That is vivid and natural (Ramsay, <i>Church in the Roman Empire</i>, pp. 135ff.). Yet on this occasion the artisans were making an argumentative protest and plea against Paul. An inscription at Dionysopolis has "Great is Apollo." </p>
