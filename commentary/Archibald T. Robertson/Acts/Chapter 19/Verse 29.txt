<p><b> With the confusion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της συγχυσεως</span></span>). Genitive case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επλησθη</span></span>. An old word, but in the N.T. only here, from verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συγχεω</span></span>, to pour together like a flood (only in Acts in the N.T.). Vivid description of the inevitable riot that followed "the appearance of such a body in the crowded agora of an excitable city" (Rackham) "vociferating the city's watch-word."</p>
<p><b>They rushed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωρμησαν</span></span>). Ingressive aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορμαω</span></span>, old verb for impetuous dashing, a case of mob psychology (mob mind), with one accord (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοθυμαδον</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:14">Acts 1:14</span>, etc.).</p>
<p><b>Into the theatre </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το θεατρον</span></span>). A place for seeing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεαομα</span></span>) spectacles, originally for dramatic representation (Thucydides, Herodotus), then for the spectators, then for the spectacle or show (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:9">1 Corinthians 4:9</span>). The theatre (amphitheatre) at Ephesus can still be traced in the ruins (Wood, <i>Ephesus</i>) and shows that it was of enormous size capable of seating fifty-six thousand persons (some estimate it only 24,500). It was the place for large public gatherings of any sort out of doors like our football and baseball parks. In particular, gladiatorial shows were held in these theatres.</p>
<p><b>Having seized Gaius and Aristarchus men of Macedonia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναρπασαντες Γαιον κα Αρισταρχον Μακεδονας</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:12">Acts 6:12</span> for this same verb. They wanted some victims for this "gladiatorial" show. These two men were "Paul's companions in travel" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεκδημους Παυλου</span></span>), together (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span>) with Paul in being abroad, away from home or people (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ-δημους</span></span>, late word, in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:19">2 Corinthians 8:19</span>). How the mob got hold of Gaius (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>) and Aristarchus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:2">Acts 27:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:24">Philemon 1:24</span>) we do not know whether by accidental recognition or by search after failure to get Paul. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:4">Romans 16:4</span> Paul speaks of Priscilla and Aquila as those "who for my life laid down their own necks." Paul lived with them in Ephesus as in Corinth. It is possible that Demetrius led the mob to their house and that they refused to allow Paul to go or to be seized at the risk of their own lives. Paul himself may have been desperately ill at this time as we know was the case once during his stay in Ephesus when he felt the answer of death in himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:9">2 Corinthians 1:9</span>) and when God rescued him. That may mean that, ill as he was, Paul wanted to go and face the mob in the theatre, knowing that it meant certain death. </p>
