<p><b> And when Paul was minded to enter in unto the people </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παυλου δε βουλομενου εισελθειν εις τον δημον</span></span>). Genitive absolute. Plainly Paul wanted to face the howling mob, whether it was the occasion pictured in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:9">2 Corinthians 1:9</span> or not. "St. Paul was not the man to leave his comrades in the lurch" (Knowling).</p>
<p><b>Suffered him not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ειων αυτον</span></span>). Imperfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαω</span></span>, common verb to allow, what Gildersleeve called the negative imperfect (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 885), denoting resistance to pressure. The more Paul insisted on going the more the disciples refused to agree to it and they won. </p>
