 Some therefore cried one thing and some another  (αλλο μεν ουν αλλο τ εκραζον). This classical use of αλλος αλλο (Robertson, Grammar, p. 747) appears also in Acts 2:12; Acts 21:34. Literally, "others cried another thing." The imperfect shows the repetition (kept on crying) and confusion which is also distinctly stated.For the assembly was in confusion  (ην γαρ η εκκλησια συνκεχυμενη). The reason for the previous statement. Periphrastic past perfect passive of συγχεω, συγχυνω (-υννω), to pour together, to commingle as in verse Acts 19:29 (συγχυσεως). It was not an "assembly" (εκκλησια, εκ, καλεω, to call out), but a wholly irregular, disorganized mob in a state (perfect tense) of confusion. There was "a lawful assembly" (verse Acts 19:39), but this mob was not one. Luke shows his contempt for this mob (Furneaux).Had come together  (συνεληλυθεισαν). Past perfect active of συνερχομα. It was an assembly only in one sense. For some reason Demetrius who was responsible for the mob preferred now to keep in the background, though he was known to be the ring-leader of the gathering (verse Acts 19:38). It was just a mob that shouted because others did.
