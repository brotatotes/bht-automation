<p><b> Some therefore cried one thing and some another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλο μεν ουν αλλο τ εκραζον</span></span>). This classical use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλος αλλο</span></span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 747) appears also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:12">Acts 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:34">Acts 21:34</span>. Literally, "others cried another thing." The imperfect shows the repetition (kept on crying) and confusion which is also distinctly stated.</p>
<p><b>For the assembly was in confusion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην γαρ η εκκλησια συνκεχυμενη</span></span>). The reason for the previous statement. Periphrastic past perfect passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συγχεω, συγχυνω (-υννω)</span></span>, to pour together, to commingle as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συγχυσεως</span></span>). It was not an "assembly" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησια, εκ, καλεω</span></span>, to call out), but a wholly irregular, disorganized mob in a state (perfect tense) of confusion. There was "a lawful assembly" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:39">Acts 19:39</span>), but this mob was not one. Luke shows his contempt for this mob (Furneaux).</p>
<p><b>Had come together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεληλυθεισαν</span></span>). Past perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνερχομα</span></span>. It was an assembly only in one sense. For some reason Demetrius who was responsible for the mob preferred now to keep in the background, though he was known to be the ring-leader of the gathering (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:38">Acts 19:38</span>). It was just a mob that shouted because others did. </p>
