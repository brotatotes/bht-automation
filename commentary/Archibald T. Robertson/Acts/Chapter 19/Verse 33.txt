<p><b> And they brought Alexander out of the crowd </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ δε του οχλου συνεβιβασαν Αλεξανδρον</span></span>). The correct text (Aleph A B) has this verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεβιβασαν</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνβιβαζω</span></span>, to put together) instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προεβιβασαν</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προβιβαζω</span></span>, to put forward). It is a graphic word, causal of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαινω</span></span>, to go, and occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:10">Acts 16:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:19">Colossians 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:16">Ephesians 4:16</span>. Evidently some of the Jews grew afraid that the mob would turn on the Jews as well as on the Christians. Paul was a Jew and so was Aristarchus, one of the prisoners. The Jews were as strongly opposed to idolatry as were the Christians.</p>
<p><b>The Jews putting him forward </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προβαλοντων αυτον των Ιουδαιων</span></span>). Genitive absolute of the second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προβαλλω</span></span>, old verb to push forward as leaves in the spring (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:30">Luke 21:30</span>). In the N.T. only in these two passages. Alexandria had already disgraceful scenes of Jew-baiting and there was real peril now in Ephesus with this wild mob. So Alexander was pushed forward as the champion to defend the Jews to the excited mob. He may be the same Alexander the coppersmith who did Paul much evil (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:14">2 Timothy 4:14</span>), against whom Paul will warn Timothy then in Ephesus. "The Jews were likely to deal in the copper and silver required for the shrines, so he may have had some trade connexion with the craftsmen which would give him influence" (Furneaux).</p>
<p><b>Beckoned with the hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατασεισας την χειρα</span></span>). Old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατασειω</span></span>, to shake down, here the hand, rapidly waving the hand up and down to get a hearing. In the N.T. elsewhere only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:17">Acts 12:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:16">Acts 13:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:40">Acts 21:40</span> where "with the hand" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη χειρ</span></span>, instrumental case) is used instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την χειρα</span></span> (the accusative).</p>
<p><b>Would have made a defence unto the people </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηθελεν απολογεισθα τω δημω</span></span>). Imperfect active, wanted to make a defence, tried to, started to, but apparently never got out a word. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Απολογεισθα</span></span> (present middle infinitive, direct middle, to defend oneself), regular word for formal apology, but in N.T. only by Luke and Paul (twice in Gospel, six times in Acts, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:15">Romans 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:19">2 Corinthians 12:19</span>). </p>
