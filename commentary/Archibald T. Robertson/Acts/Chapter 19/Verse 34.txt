<p><b> When they perceived </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγνοντες</span></span>). Recognizing, coming to know fully and clearly (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι-</span></span>), second aorist (ingressive) active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγινωσκω</span></span>. The masculine plural is left as nominative absolute or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πενδενς</span></span> without a verb. The rioters saw at once that Alexander was (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span>, present tense retained in indirect assertion) a Jew by his features.</p>
<p><b>An with one voice cried out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνη εγενετο μια εκ παντων κραζοντων</span></span>). Anacoluthon or construction according to sense. Literally, "one voice arose from all crying." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κραζοντων</span></span> agrees in case (ablative) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντων</span></span>, but Aleph A have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραζοντες</span></span>. This loose construction is not uncommon (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 436f.). Now at last the crowd became unanimous (one voice) at the sight of a hated Jew about to defend their attacks on the worship of Artemis. The unanimity lasted "about the space of two hours" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσε επ ωρας δυο</span></span>), "as if for two hours." Their creed centred in this prolonged yell: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians" with which the disturbance started (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:28">Acts 19:28</span>). </p>
