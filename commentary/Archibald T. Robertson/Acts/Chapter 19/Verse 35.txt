<p><b> The town-clerk </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο γραμματευς</span></span>). Ephesus was a free city and elected its own officers and the recorder or secretary was the chief magistrate of the city, though the proconsul of the province of Asia resided there. This officer is not a mere secretary of another officer or like the copyists and students of the law among the Jews, but the most influential person in Ephesus who drafted decrees with the aid of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατηγο</span></span>, had charge of the city's money, was the power in control of the assembly, and communicated directly with the proconsul. Inscriptions at Ephesus give frequently this very title for their chief officer and the papyri have it also. The precise function varied in different cities. His name appeared on the coin at Ephesus issued in his year of office.</p>
<p><b>Had quieted the multitude </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταστειλας τον οχλον</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταστελλω</span></span>, to send down, arrange dress (Euripides), lower (Plutarch), restrain (papyrus example), only twice in the N.T. (here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:36">Acts 19:36</span>, be quiet), but in LXX and Josephus. He evidently took the rostrum and his very presence as the city's chief officer had a quieting effect on the billowy turmoil and a semblance of order came. He waited, however, till the hubbub had nearly exhausted itself (two hours) and did not speak till there was a chance to be heard.</p>
<p><b>Saith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φησιν</span></span>). Historical present for vividness.</p>
<p><b>How that </b>. Merely participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουσαν</span></span> and accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολιν</span></span> in indirect discourse, no conjunction at all (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1040ff.), common idiom after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, to know.</p>
<p><b>Temple-keeper </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεωκορον</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεως</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναοσ)</span></span>, temple, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κορεω</span></span>, to sweep. Warden, verger, cleaner of the temple, a sacristan. So in Xenophon and Plato. Inscriptions so describe Ephesus as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεωκορον της Αρτεμιδος</span></span> as Luke has it here and also applied to the imperial <i>cultus</i> which finally had several such temples in Ephesus. Other cities claimed the same honour of being <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεωκορος</span></span>, but it was the peculiar boast of Ephesus because of the great temple of Artemis. A coin of A.D. 65 describes Ephesus as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεωκορος</span></span>. There are papyri examples of the term applied to individuals, one to Priene as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεωκορος</span></span> of the temple in Ephesus (Moulton and Milligan, <i>Vocabulary</i>).</p>
<p><b>And of the image which fell down from Jupiter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα του διοπετους</span></span>). Supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαλμα</span></span> (image), "the from heaven-fallen image." From Zeus (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διος</span></span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πετω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιπτω, πιπετω</span></span>), to fall. Zeus (Jupiter) was considered lord of the sky or heaven and that is the idea in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διοπετους</span></span> here. The legend about a statue fallen from heaven occurs concerning the statue of Artemis at Tauris, Minerva at Athens, etc. Thus the recorder soothed the vanity (Rackham) of the crowd by appeal to the world-wide fame of Ephesus as sacristan of Artemis and of her heaven-fallen image. </p>
