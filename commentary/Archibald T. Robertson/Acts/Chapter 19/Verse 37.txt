<p><b> Neither robbers of temples </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτε ιεροσυλους</span></span>). Common word in Greek writers from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερον</span></span>, temple, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συλαω</span></span>, to rob, be guilty of sacrilege. The word is found also on inscriptions in Ephesus. The Jews were sometimes guilty of this crime (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:22">Romans 2:22</span>), since the heathen temples often had vast treasures like banks. The ancients felt as strongly about temple-robbing as westerners used to feel about a horse-thief.</p>
<p><b>Nor blasphemers of our goddess </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτε βλασφημουντας την θεον ημων</span></span>). Nor those who blasphemed our goddess. That is to say, these men (Gaius and Aristarchus) as Christians had so conducted themselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:5">Colossians 4:5</span>) that no charge could be placed against them either in act (temple-robbery) or word (blasphemy). They had done a rash thing since these men are innocent. Paul had used tact in Ephesus as in Athens in avoiding illegalities. </p>
