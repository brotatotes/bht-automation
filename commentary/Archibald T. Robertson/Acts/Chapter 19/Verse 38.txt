<p><b> Have a matter against any one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχουσιν προς τινα λογον</span></span>). For this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω λογον</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:13">Colossians 3:13</span>. The town-clerk names Demetrius and the craftsmen (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεχνιτα</span></span>) as the parties responsible for the riot.</p>
<p><b>The courts are open </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγοραιο αγοντα</span></span>). Supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερα</span></span> (days), court days are kept, or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνοδο</span></span>, court-meetings are now going on, Vulgate <i>conventus forenses aguntur</i>. Old adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγορα</span></span> (forum) marketplace where trials were held. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:4">Acts 17:4</span>. There were regular court days whether they were in session then or not.</p>
<p><b>And there are proconsuls </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ανθυπατο εισιν</span></span>). Asia was a senatorial province and so had proconsuls (general phrase) though only one at a time, "a rhetorical plural" (Lightfoot). Page quotes from an inscription of the age of Trajan on an aqueduct at Ephesus in which some of Luke's very words occur (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεωκοροσ, ανθυπατοσ, γραμματευσ, δημος</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Let them accuse one another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγκαλειτωσαν αλληλοις</span></span>). Present active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγκαλεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν, καλεω</span></span>), old verb to call in one's case, to bring a charge against, with the dative. Luke uses the verb six times in Acts for judicial proceedings (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:38">Acts 19:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:40">Acts 19:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:28">Acts 23:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:29">Acts 23:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:2">Acts 26:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:7">Acts 26:7</span>). The town-clerk makes a definite appeal to the mob for orderly legal procedure as opposed to mob violence in a matter where money and religious prejudice unite, a striking rebuke to so-called lynch-law proceedings in lands today where Christianity is supposed to prevail. </p>
