<p><b> Anything about other matters </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ περαιτερω</span></span>). Most MSS. here have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ περ ετερων</span></span>, but B b Vulgate read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ περαιτερω</span></span> as in Plato's <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φαεδο</span></span>. Several papyri examples of it also. It is comparative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περαιτερος</span></span> of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περα</span></span>, beyond. Note also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιζητειτε</span></span>. Charges of illegal conduct (Page) should be settled in the regular legal way. But, if you wish to go further and pass resolutions about the matter exciting you, "it shall be settled in the regular assembly" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω εννομω εκκλησια</span></span>). "In the lawful assembly," not by a mob like this. Wood (<i>Ephesus</i>) quotes an inscription there with this very phrase "at every lawful assembly" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα πασαν εννομον εκκλησιαν</span></span>). The Roman officials alone could give the sanction for calling such a lawful or regular assembly. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιλυω</span></span> is an old one, but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:34">Mark 4:34</span> (which see) where Jesus privately opened or disclosed the parables to the disciples. The papyri give examples of the verb in financial transactions as well as of the metaphorical sense. The solution will come in the lawful assembly, not in a riot like this. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:20">2 Peter 1:20</span> where the substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιλυσις</span></span> occurs for disclosure or revelation (prophecy). </p>
