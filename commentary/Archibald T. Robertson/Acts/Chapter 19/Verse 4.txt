<p><b> With the baptism of repentance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισμα μετανοιας</span></span>). Cognate accusative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβαπτισεν</span></span> and the genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοιας</span></span> describing the baptism as marked by (case of species or genus), not as conveying, repentance just as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:4">Mark 1:4</span> and that was the work of the Holy Spirit. But John preached also the baptism of the Holy Spirit which the Messiah was to bring (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:7">Mark 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:16">Luke 3:16</span>). If they did not know of the Holy Spirit, they had missed the point of John's baptism.</p>
<p><b>That they should believe on him that should come after him, that is on Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον ερχομενον μετ' αυτον ινα πιστευσωσιν, τουτ' εστιν εις τον Ιησουν</span></span>). Note the emphatic prolepsis of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον ερχομενον μετ' αυτον</span></span> before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα πιστευσωσιν</span></span> with which it is construed. This is John's identical phrase, "the one coming after me" as seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:7">Mark 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:16">Luke 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span>. It is not clear that these "disciples" believed in a Messiah, least of all in Jesus. They were wholly unprepared for the baptism of John. Paul does not mean to say that John's baptism was inadequate, but he simply explains what John really taught and so what his baptism signified. </p>
