<p><b> When Paul had laid his hands upon them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιθεντος αυτοις του Παυλου χειρας</span></span>). Genitive absolute of second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτιθημ</span></span>. This act of laying on of the hands was done in Samaria by Peter and John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:16">Acts 8:16</span>) and in Damascus in the case of Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span>) and was followed as here by the descent of the Holy Spirit in supernatural power.</p>
<p><b>They spake with tongues </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλουν γλωσσαις</span></span>). Inchoative imperfect, began to speak with tongues as in Jerusalem at Pentecost and as in Caesarea before the baptism.</p>
<p><b>Prophesied </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επροφητευον</span></span>). Inchoative imperfect again, began to prophesy. The speaking with tongues and prophesying was external and indubitable proof that the Holy Spirit had come on these twelve uninformed disciples now fully won to the service of Jesus as Messiah. But this baptism in water did not "convey" the Holy Spirit nor forgiveness of sins. Paul was not a sacramentalist. </p>
