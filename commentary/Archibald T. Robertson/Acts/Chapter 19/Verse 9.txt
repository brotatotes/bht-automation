<p><b> But when some were hardened </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως δε τινες εσκληρυνοντο</span></span>). Imperfect passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκληρυνω</span></span>, causative like <i>hiphil</i> in Hebrew, to make hard (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκληρος</span></span>) or rough or harsh (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:24">Matthew 25:24</span>). In LXX and Hippocrates and Galen (in medical writings). In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:18">Romans 9:18</span> and 4 times in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:8">Hebrews 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:13">Hebrews 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:15">Hebrews 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:7">Hebrews 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:8">Hebrews 4:8</span> quoting and referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:8">Psalms 95:8</span> about hardening the heart like a gristle. The inevitable reaction against Paul went on even in Ephesus though slowly.</p>
<p><b>Disobedient </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επειθουν</span></span>). Imperfect again, showing the growing disbelief and disobedience (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απειθης</span></span>), both ideas as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:2">Acts 14:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span>, first refusal to believe and then refusal to obey. Both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκληρυνω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απειθεω</span></span> occur together, as here, in Ecclus. 30:12.</p>
<p><b>Speaking evil of the Way </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακολογουντες την οδον</span></span>). Late verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακολογος</span></span> (speaker of evil) for the old <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακως λεγω</span></span>. Already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:10">Mark 7:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:39">Mark 9:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:4">Matthew 15:4</span>. Now these Jews are aggressive opponents of Paul and seek to injure his influence with the crowd. Note "the Way" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:2">Acts 9:2</span> for Christianity.</p>
<p><b>He departed from them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστας απ' αυτων</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιστημ</span></span>, made an "apostasy" (standing off, cleavage) as he did at Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:7">Acts 18:7</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταβας</span></span>, making a change).</p>
<p><b>Separated the disciples </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφωρισεν τους μαθητας</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφοριζω</span></span>, old verb to mark limits (horizon) as already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span>. Paul himself was a spiritual Pharisee "separated" to Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>). The Jews regarded this withdrawal as apostasy, like separating the sheep from the goats (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:32">Matthew 25:32</span>). Paul now made a separate church as he had done at Thessalonica and Corinth.</p>
<p><b>In the school of Tyrannus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη σχολη Τυραννου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σχολη</span></span> (our school) is an old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχειν</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>) to hold on, leisure and then in later Greek (Plutarch, etc.) a place where there is leisure as here. Only this example in the N.T. This is the Greek notion of "school," the Jewish being that of "yoke" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>. The name Tyrannus (our tyrant) is a common one. It is an inscription in the Columbarium of the Empress Livia as that of a physician in the court. Furneaux suggests the possibility that a relative of this physician was lecturing on medicine in Ephesus and so as a friend of Luke, the physician, would be glad to help Paul about a place to preach. It was probably a public building or lecture hall with this name whether hired by Paul or loaned to him. The pagan sophists often spoke in such halls. The Codex Bezae adds "from the fifth hour to the tenth" as the time allotted Paul for his work in this hall, which is quite possible, from just before midday till the close of the afternoon (from before the noon meal till two hours before sunset) each day. Here Paul had great freedom and a great hearing. As the church grows there will be other places of meeting as the church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:19">1 Corinthians 16:19</span>). </p>
