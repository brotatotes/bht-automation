<p><b> Was now come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω συνπληρουσθα</span></span>). Luke's favourite idiom of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> with the articular present infinitive passive and the accusative of general reference, "in the being fulfilled completely (perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν-</span></span>) as to the day of Pentecost." Common verb, but only in Luke in N.T. In literal sense of filling a boat in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:23">Luke 8:23</span>, about days in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span> as here. Whether the disciples expected the coming of the Holy Spirit on this day we do not know. Blass holds that the present tense shows that the day had not yet come. It is a Hebrew idiom (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:25">Exodus 7:25</span>) and Luke may mean that the day of Pentecost was not yet over, was still going on, though Hackett takes it for the interval (fifty days) between Passover and Pentecost. Apparently this day of Pentecost fell on the Jewish Sabbath (our Saturday). It was the feast of first fruits.</p>
<p><b>All together in one place </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντες ομου επ το αυτο</span></span>). All together in the same place. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομου</span></span> here (correct text), not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοθυμαδον</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:14">Acts 1:14</span>, and so a bit of tautology. </p>
