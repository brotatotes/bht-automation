<p><b> Cretes and Arabians </b>. These two groups "seem to have been added to the list as an afterthought" (Knowling). Crete is an island to itself and Arabia was separate also though near Judea and full of Jews. The point is not that each one of these groups of Jews spoke a different language, but that wherever there was a local tongue they heard men speaking in it.</p>
<p><b>We do hear them speaking </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουομεν λαλουντων αυτων</span></span>). Genitive case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτων</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span> the participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλουντων</span></span> agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτων</span></span>, a sort of participial idiom of indirect discourse (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1040ff.).</p>
<p><b>The mighty works </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα μεγαλεια</span></span>). Old adjective for magnificent. In LXX, but only here (not genuine in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:49">Luke 1:49</span>) in the N.T. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16">2 Peter 1:16</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγαλειοτης</span></span> (majesty). </p>
