<p><b> Were perplexed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διηπορουντο</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαπορεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορος</span></span>) to be wholly at a loss. Old verb, but in N.T. only in Luke and Acts. They continued amazed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξισταντο</span></span>) and puzzled.</p>
<p><b>What meaneth this? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ θελε τουτο εινα</span></span>). Literally, what does this wish to be? </p>
