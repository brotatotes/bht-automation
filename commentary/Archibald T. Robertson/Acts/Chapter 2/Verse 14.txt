<p><b> Standing up with the eleven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταθεις συν τοις ενδεκα</span></span>). Took his stand with the eleven including Matthias, who also rose up with them, and spoke as their spokesman, a formal and impressive beginning. The Codex Bezae has "ten apostles." Luke is fond of this pictorial use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταθεις</span></span> (first aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>) as seen nowhere else in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:11">Luke 18:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:40">Luke 18:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:8">Luke 19:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:20">Acts 5:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:22">Acts 17:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:21">Acts 27:21</span>).</p>
<p><b>Lifted up his voice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επηρεν την φωνην αυτου</span></span>). This phrase only in Luke in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:29">Luke 11:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:14">Acts 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:11">Acts 14:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:22">Acts 22:22</span>), but is common in the old writers. First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαιρω</span></span>. The large crowd and the confusion of tongues demanded loud speaking. "This most solemn, earnest, yet sober speech" (Bengel). Codex Bezae adds "first" after "voice." Peter did it to win and hold attention.</p>
<p><b>Give ear unto my words </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωτισασθε τα ρηματα μου</span></span>). Late verb in LXX and only here in the N.T. First aorist middle from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωτιζομα</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν, ους</span></span>, ear) to give ear to, receive into the ear. People's ears differ greatly, but in public speech they have to be reached through the ear. That puts an obligation on the speaker and also on the auditors who should sit where they can hear with the ears which they have, an obligation often overlooked. </p>
