<p><b> Wonders </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τερατα</span></span>). Apparently akin to the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρεω</span></span>, to watch like a wonder in the sky,</p>
<p><b>miracle </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιραχυλυμ</span></span>), marvel, portent. In the New Testament the word occurs only in the plural and only in connection with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημεια</span></span> (signs) as here and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:43">Acts 2:43</span>. But</p>
<p><b>signs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημεια</span></span>) here is not in the LXX. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:20">Matthew 11:20</span>. In verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22">Acts 2:22</span> all three words occur together: powers, wonders, signs (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμεσι, τερασι, σημειοις</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>As above </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανω</span></span>). This word is not in the LXX nor is "beneath" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατω</span></span>), both probably being added to make clearer the contrast between heaven and earth.</p>
<p><b>Blood and fire and vapour of smoke </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιμα κα πυρ κα ατμιδα καπνου</span></span>). A chiasm as these words illustrate bloodshed and destruction by fire as signs here on earth. </p>
