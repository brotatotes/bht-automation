<p><b> Suddenly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφνω</span></span>). Old adverb, but in the N.T. only in Acts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:2">Acts 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:26">Acts 16:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:6">Acts 28:6</span>). Kin to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαιφνης</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:61">Acts 22:61</span>).</p>
<p><b>A sound </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηχος</span></span>). Our <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχο</span></span>. Old word, already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:37">Luke 4:37</span> for rumour and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:25">Luke 21:25</span> for the roar of the sea. It was not wind, but a roar or reverberation "as of the rushing of a mighty wind" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωσπερ φερομενης πνοης βιαιας</span></span>). This is not a strict translation nor is it the genitive absolute. It was "an echoing sound as of a mighty wind borne violently" (or rushing along like the whirr of a tornado). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πνοη</span></span> (wind) is used here (in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:25">Acts 17:25</span> though old word) probably because of the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span> of the Holy Spirit. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5-8">John 3:5-8</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span> occurs for both wind and Spirit.</p>
<p><b>Filled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επληρωσεν</span></span>). "As a bath is filled with water, that they might be baptized with the Holy Ghost, in fulfilment of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:5">Acts 1:5</span>" (Canon Cook).</p>
<p><b>They were sitting </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν καθημενο</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθημα</span></span>. </p>
