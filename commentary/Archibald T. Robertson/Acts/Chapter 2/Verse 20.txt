<p><b> Shall be turned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταστραφησετα</span></span>). Second future passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταστρεφω</span></span>, common verb, but only three times in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:20">Acts 2:20</span> from Joel; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:9">James 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7">Galatians 1:7</span>). These are the "wonders" or portents of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:19">Acts 2:19</span>. It is worth noting that Peter interprets these "portents" as fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost, though no such change of the sun into darkness or of the moon into blood is recorded. Clearly Peter does not interpret the symbolism of Joel in literal terms. This method of Peter may be of some service in the Book of Revelation where so many apocalyptic symbols occur as well as in the great Eschatological Discourse of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:24">Acts 2:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:25">Acts 2:25</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:6">Matthew 24:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span> Jesus had spoken of wars on earth and wonders in heaven.</p>
<p><b>Before the day of the Lord come, that great and notable day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πριν ελθειν ημεραν κυριου την μεγαλην κα επιφανη</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πριν</span></span> with the infinitive and the accusative of general reference is a regular Greek idiom. The use of the adjectives with the article is also good Greek, though the article is not here repeated as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:25">Acts 1:25</span>. The Day of the Lord is a definite conception without the article.</p>
<p><b>Notable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιφανη</span></span>) is the same root as epiphany (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιφανεια</span></span>) used of the Second Coming of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:14">1 Timothy 6:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:1">2 Timothy 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span>). It translates here the Hebrew word for "terrible." In the Epistles the Day of the Lord is applied (Knowling) to the Coming of Christ for judgment (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:2">1 Thessalonians 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:8">1 Corinthians 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:14">2 Corinthians 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:10">Philippians 1:10</span>). </p>
