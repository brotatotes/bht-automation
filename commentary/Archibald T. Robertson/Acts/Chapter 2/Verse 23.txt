<p><b> Him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτον</span></span>). "This one," resumptive and emphatic object of "did crucify and slay."</p>
<p><b>Being delivered up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκδοτον</span></span>). Verbal adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκδιδωμ</span></span>, to give out or over. Old word, but here only in the N.T. Delivered up by Judas, Peter means.</p>
<p><b>By the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη ωρισμενη βουλη κα προγνωση του θεου</span></span>). Instrumental case. Note both purpose (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλη</span></span>) and foreknowledge (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προγνωσις</span></span>) of God and "determined" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωρισμενη</span></span>, perfect passive participle, state of completion). God had willed the death of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>) and the death of Judas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:16">Acts 1:16</span>), but that fact did not absolve Judas from his responsibility and guilt (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:22">Luke 22:22</span>). He acted as a free moral agent.</p>
<p><b>By the hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια χειρος</span></span>). Luke is fond of these figures (hand, face, etc.) very much like the Hebrew though the vernacular of all languages uses them.</p>
<p><b>Lawless men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανομων</span></span>). Men without law, who recognize no law for their conduct, like men in high and low stations today who defy the laws of God and man. Old word, very common in the LXX.</p>
<p><b>Ye did crucify </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσπηξαντες</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσπηγνυμ</span></span>, rare compound word in Dio Cassius and here only in the N.T. One must supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω σταυρω</span></span> and so it means "fastened to the cross," a graphic picture like Paul's "nailed to the cross" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσηλωσας τω σταυρω</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:14">Colossians 2:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Did slay </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανειλατε</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative with first aorist vowel <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> as is common in the <i>Koine</i>. This verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναιρεω</span></span>, to take up, is often used for kill as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:2">Acts 12:2</span>. Note Peter's boldness now under the power of the Holy Spirit. He charges the people to their faces with the death of Christ. </p>
