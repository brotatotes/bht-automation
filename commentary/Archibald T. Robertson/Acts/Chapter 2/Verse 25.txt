 Concerning him  (εις αυτον). Peter interprets Psalms 16:8-11 as written by David and with reference to the Messiah. There is but one speaker in this Psalm and both Peter here and Paul in Acts 13:36 make it the Messiah. David is giving his own experience which is typical of the Messiah (Knowling).I beheld  (προορωμην). Imperfect middle without augment of προοραω, common verb, but only twice in the N.T., to see beforehand (Acts 21:29) or to see right before one as here. This idea of προ- is made plainer by "before my face" (ενωπιον μου).On my right hand  (εκ δεξιων μου). The Lord Jehovah like a defender or advocate stands at David's right hand as in trials in court (Psalms 109:31).That  (ινα) here is almost result.Moved  (σαλευθω). First aorist passive subjunctive of σαλευω, to shake like an earthquake.
