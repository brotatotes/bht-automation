<p><b> Concerning him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις αυτον</span></span>). Peter interprets <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:8-11">Psalms 16:8-11</span> as written by David and with reference to the Messiah. There is but one speaker in this Psalm and both Peter here and Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:36">Acts 13:36</span> make it the Messiah. David is giving his own experience which is typical of the Messiah (Knowling).</p>
<p><b>I beheld </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προορωμην</span></span>). Imperfect middle without augment of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προοραω</span></span>, common verb, but only twice in the N.T., to see beforehand (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:29">Acts 21:29</span>) or to see right before one as here. This idea of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ-</span></span> is made plainer by "before my face" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωπιον μου</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>On my right hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ δεξιων μου</span></span>). The Lord Jehovah like a defender or advocate stands at David's right hand as in trials in court (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+109:31">Psalms 109:31</span>).</p>
<p><b>That </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>) here is almost result.</p>
<p><b>Moved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαλευθω</span></span>). First aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαλευω</span></span>, to shake like an earthquake. </p>
