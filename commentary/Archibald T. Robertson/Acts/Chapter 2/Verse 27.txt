<p><b> In Hades </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Hαιδην</span></span>). Hades is the unseen world, Hebrew Sheol, but here it is viewed as death itself "considered as a rapacious destroyer" (Hackett). It does not mean the place of punishment, though both heaven and the place of torment are in Hades (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:23">Luke 16:23</span>). "Death and Hades are strictly parallel terms: he who is dead is in Hades" (Page). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> here=<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> is common enough. The Textus Receptus here reads <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Hαιδου</span></span> (genitive case) like the Attic idiom with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δομον</span></span> (abode) understood. "Hades" in English is not translation, but transliteration. The phrase in the Apostles' Creed, "descended into hell" is from this passage in Acts (Hades, not Gehenna). The English word "hell" is Anglo-Saxon from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαν</span></span>, to hide, and was used in the Authorized Version to translate both Hades as here and Gehenna as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:22">Matthew 5:22</span>.</p>
<p><b>Thy Holy One </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον οσιον σου</span></span>). Peter applies these words to the Messiah.</p>
<p><b>Corruption </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαφθοραν</span></span>). The word can mean destruction or putrefaction from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαφθειρω</span></span>, old word, but in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:34-37">Acts 13:34-37</span>. The Hebrew word in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:16">Acts 2:16</span> can mean also the pit or the deep. </p>
