<p><b> Parting asunder </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαμεριζομενα</span></span>). Present middle (or passive) participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαμεριζω</span></span>, old verb, to cleave asunder, to cut in pieces as a butcher does meat (aorist passive in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:17">Luke 11:17</span>). So middle here would mean, parting themselves asunder or distributing themselves. The passive voice would be "being distributed." The middle is probably correct and means that "the fire-like appearance presented itself at first, as it were, in a single body, and then suddenly parted in this direction and that; so that a portion of it rested on each of those present" (Hackett). The idea is not that each tongue was cloven, but each separate tongue looked like fire, not real fire, but looking like (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωσε</span></span>, as if) fire. The audible sign is followed by a visible one (Knowling). "Fire had always been, with the Jews, the symbol of the Divine presence (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:2">Exodus 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+5:4">Deuteronomy 5:4</span>). No symbol could be more fitting to express the Spirit's purifying energy and refining energy" (Furneaux). The Baptist had predicted a baptizing by the Messiah in the Holy Spirit and in fire (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>).</p>
<p><b>It sat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθισεν</span></span>). Singular verb here, though plural <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωπθησαν</span></span> with tongues (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γλωσσα</span></span>). A tongue that looked like fire sat upon each one. </p>
