<p><b> This Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτον τον Ιησουν</span></span>). Many of the name "Jesus," but he means the one already called "the Nazarene" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22">Acts 2:22</span>) and foretold as the Messiah in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:16">Acts 2:16</span> and raised from the dead by God in proof that he is the Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:24">Acts 2:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:32">Acts 2:32</span>), "this Jesus whom ye crucified" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36">Acts 2:36</span>). Other terms used of him in the Acts are the Messiah, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:31">Acts 2:31</span>, the one whom God "anointed" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:38">Acts 10:38</span>), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:41">John 1:41</span>, Jesus Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:34">Acts 9:34</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36">Acts 2:36</span> God made this Jesus Messiah, in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:20">Acts 3:20</span> the Messiah Jesus, in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:3">Acts 17:3</span> Jesus is the Messiah, in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:5">Acts 18:5</span> the Messiah is Jesus, in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:24">Acts 24:24</span> Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Whereof </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span>). Or "of whom." Either makes sense and both are true. Peter claims the whole 120 as personal witnesses to the fact of the Resurrection of Jesus from the dead and they are all present as Peter calls them to witness on the point. In Galilee over 500 had seen the Risen Christ at one time (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:6">1 Corinthians 15:6</span>) most of whom were still living when Paul wrote. Thus the direct evidence for the resurrection of Jesus piles up in cumulative force. </p>
