 This Jesus  (τουτον τον Ιησουν). Many of the name "Jesus," but he means the one already called "the Nazarene" (verse Acts 2:22) and foretold as the Messiah in Acts 2:16 and raised from the dead by God in proof that he is the Messiah (Acts 2:24; Acts 2:32), "this Jesus whom ye crucified" (verse Acts 2:36). Other terms used of him in the Acts are the Messiah, verse Acts 2:31, the one whom God "anointed" (Acts 10:38), as in John 1:41, Jesus Christ (Acts 9:34). In Acts 2:36 God made this Jesus Messiah, in Acts 3:20 the Messiah Jesus, in Acts 17:3 Jesus is the Messiah, in Acts 18:5 the Messiah is Jesus, in Acts 24:24 Christ Jesus.Whereof  (ου). Or "of whom." Either makes sense and both are true. Peter claims the whole 120 as personal witnesses to the fact of the Resurrection of Jesus from the dead and they are all present as Peter calls them to witness on the point. In Galilee over 500 had seen the Risen Christ at one time (1 Corinthians 15:6) most of whom were still living when Paul wrote. Thus the direct evidence for the resurrection of Jesus piles up in cumulative force.
