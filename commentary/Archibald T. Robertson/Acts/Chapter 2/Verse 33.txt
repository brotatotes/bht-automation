 By the right hand of God  (τη δεξια του θεου). This translation makes it the instrumental case. The margin has it "at" instead of "by," that is the locative case. And it will make sense in the true dative case, "to the right hand of God." These three cases came to have the same form in Greek. Romans 8:24 furnishes another illustration of like ambiguity (τη ελπιδ), saved by hope, in hope, or for hope. Usually it is quite easy to tell the case when the form is identical.Exalted  (υψωθεις). First aorist passive participle of υψοω, to lift up. Here both the literal and tropical sense occurs. Cf. John 12:32.The promise of the Holy Spirit  (την επαγγελιαν του πνευματος του αγιου). The promise mentioned in Acts 1:4 and now come true, consisting in the Holy Spirit "from the Father" (παρα του πατρος), sent by the Father and by the Son (John 15:26; John 16:7). See also Galatians 3:14.He hath poured forth  (εξεχεεν). Aorist active indicative of εκχεω the verb used by Joel and quoted by Peter already in verses Acts 2:17; Acts 2:18. Jesus has fulfilled his promise.This which ye see and hear  (τουτο ο υμεις κα βλεπετε κα ακουετε). This includes the sound like the rushing wind, the tongues like fire on each of them, the different languages spoken by the 120. "The proof was before their eyes in this new energy from heaven" (Furneaux), a culminating demonstration that Jesus was the Messiah.
