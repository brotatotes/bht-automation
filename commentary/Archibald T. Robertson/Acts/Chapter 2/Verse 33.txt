<p><b> By the right hand of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη δεξια του θεου</span></span>). This translation makes it the instrumental case. The margin has it "at" instead of "by," that is the locative case. And it will make sense in the true dative case, "to the right hand of God." These three cases came to have the same form in Greek. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:24">Romans 8:24</span> furnishes another illustration of like ambiguity (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη ελπιδ</span></span>), saved by hope, in hope, or for hope. Usually it is quite easy to tell the case when the form is identical.</p>
<p><b>Exalted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υψωθεις</span></span>). First aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υψοω</span></span>, to lift up. Here both the literal and tropical sense occurs. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:32">John 12:32</span>.</p>
<p><b>The promise of the Holy Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την επαγγελιαν του πνευματος του αγιου</span></span>). The promise mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:4">Acts 1:4</span> and now come true, consisting in the Holy Spirit "from the Father" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα του πατρος</span></span>), sent by the Father and by the Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:14">Galatians 3:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>He hath poured forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεχεεν</span></span>). Aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκχεω</span></span> the verb used by Joel and quoted by Peter already in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:18">Acts 2:18</span>. Jesus has fulfilled his promise.</p>
<p><b>This which ye see and hear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο ο υμεις κα βλεπετε κα ακουετε</span></span>). This includes the sound like the rushing wind, the tongues like fire on each of them, the different languages spoken by the 120. "The proof was before their eyes in this new energy from heaven" (Furneaux), a culminating demonstration that Jesus was the Messiah. </p>
