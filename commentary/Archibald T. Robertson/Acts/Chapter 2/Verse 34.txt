<p><b> Ascended not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου--ανεβη</span></span>). It is more emphatic than that: For not David ascended into the heavens. Peter quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1">Psalms 110:1</span> as proof. No passage in the O.T. is so constantly quoted as Messianic as this. "St. Peter does not demand belief upon his own assertion, but he again appeals to the Scriptures, and to words which could not have received a fulfilment in the case of David" (Knowling).</p>
<p><b>Sit thou </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθου</span></span>). Late <i>Koine</i> form for earlier <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθησο</span></span>, present middle imperative second singular of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθημα</span></span>. </p>
