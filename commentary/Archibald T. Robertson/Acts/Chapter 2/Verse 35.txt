<p><b> Till I make </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως αν θω</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως</span></span> for the future, a common Greek idiom. This dominion of Christ as Mediator will last till the plan of the kingdom is carried out (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:23-28">1 Corinthians 15:23-28</span>). Complete subjugation will come, perhaps referring to the custom of victorious kings placing their feet upon the necks of their enemies (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jos+10:24">Joshua 10:24</span>).</p>
<p><b>Therefore assuredly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ασφαλως ουν</span></span>). Assuredly therefore, without any slip or trip (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασφαλης</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφαλλω</span></span>, to trip, to slip. Peter draws a powerfully pungent conclusion by the use of the adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασφαλως</span></span> and the inferential conjunction <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν</span></span>. Peter's closing sentence drives home the point of his sermon: "This very Jesus whom ye crucified (note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις</span></span>, strongly emphatic</p>
<p><b>ye </b>), him God made both Lord and Messiah" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα κυριον κα Χριστον</span></span>), as David foretold in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:110">Acts 2:110</span> and as the events of this day have confirmed. The critics are disturbed over how Luke could have gotten the substance of this masterful address spoken on the spur of the moment with passion and power. They even say that Luke composed it for Peter and put the words in his mouth. If so, he made a good job of it. But Peter could have written out the notes of the address afterwards. Luke had plenty of chances to get hold of it from Peter or from others. </p>
