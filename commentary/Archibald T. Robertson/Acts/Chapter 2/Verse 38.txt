<p><b> Repent ye </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοησατε</span></span>). First aorist (ingressive) active imperative. Change your mind and your life. Turn right about and do it now. You <i>crucified</i> this Jesus. Now <i>crown</i> him in your hearts as Lord and Christ. This first.</p>
<p><b>And be baptized every one of you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα βαπτισθητω εκαστος υμων</span></span>). Rather, "And let each one of you be baptized." Change of number from plural to singular and of person from second to third. This change marks a break in the thought here that the English translation does not preserve. The first thing to do is make a radical and complete change of heart and life. Then let each one be baptized after this change has taken place, and the act of baptism be performed "in the name of Jesus Christ" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ονοματ Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). In accordance with the command of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ονομα</span></span>). No distinction is to be insisted on between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ονομα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ονοματ</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτιζω</span></span> since <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> are really the same word in origin. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:48">Acts 10:48</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ονοματ Ιησου Χριστου</span></span> occurs, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:16">Acts 8:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:5">Acts 19:5</span>. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span> means in the name or with the authority of one as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ονομα προφητου</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:41">Matthew 10:41</span>) as a prophet, in the name of a prophet. In the Acts the full name of the Trinity does not occur in baptism as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>, but this does not show that it was not used. The name of Jesus Christ is the distinctive one in Christian baptism and really involves the Father and the Spirit. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> for discussion of this point. "Luke does not give the form of words used in baptism by the Apostles, but merely states the fact that they baptized those who acknowledged Jesus as Messiah or as Lord" (Page).</p>
<p><b>Unto the remission of your sins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις αφεσιν των αμαρτιων υμων</span></span>). This phrase is the subject of endless controversy as men look at it from the standpoint of sacramental or of evangelical theology. In themselves the words can express aim or purpose for that use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> does exist as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις δοξαν ημων</span></span> (for our glory). But then another usage exists which is just as good Greek as the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> for aim or purpose. It is seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:41">Matthew 10:41</span> in three examples <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ονομα προφητου, δικαιου, μαθητου</span></span> where it cannot be purpose or aim, but rather the basis or ground, on the basis of the name of prophet, righteous man, disciple, because one is, etc. It is seen again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:41">Matthew 12:41</span> about the preaching of Jonah (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το κηρυγμα Ιωνα</span></span>). They repented because of (or at) the preaching of Jonah. The illustrations of both usages are numerous in the N.T. and the <i>Koine</i> generally (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 592). One will decide the use here according as he believes that baptism is essential to the remission of sins or not. My view is decidedly against the idea that Peter, Paul, or any one in the New Testament taught baptism as essential to the remission of sins or the means of securing such remission. So I understand Peter to be urging baptism on each of them who had already turned (repented) and for it to be done in the name of Jesus Christ on the basis of the forgiveness of sins which they had already received.</p>
<p><b>The gift of the Holy Ghost </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την δωρεαν του αγιου πνευματος</span></span>). The gift consists (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:17">Acts 8:17</span>) in the Holy Spirit (genitive of identification). </p>
