<p><b> The promise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η επαγγελια</span></span>). The promise made by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:4">Acts 1:4</span>) and foretold by Joel (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:18">Acts 2:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>To you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν</span></span>). You Jews. To your descendants, sons and daughters of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span>.</p>
<p><b>To all that are afar off </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασιν τοις εις μακραν</span></span>. The horizon widens and includes the Gentiles. Those "afar off" from the Jews were the heathen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:1">Isaiah 49:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:19">Isaiah 57:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:13">Ephesians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:17">Ephesians 2:17</span>). The rabbis so used it.</p>
<p><b>Shall call </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν προσκαλεσητα</span></span>). First aorist middle subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> in an indefinite relative clause, a perfectly regular construction. The Lord God calls men of every nation anywhere whether Jews or Gentiles. It may be doubted how clearly Peter grasped the significance of these words for he will have trouble over this very matter on the housetop in Joppa and in Caesarea, but he will see before long the full sweep of the great truth that he here proclaims under the impulse of the Holy Spirit. It was a great moment that Peter here reaches. </p>
