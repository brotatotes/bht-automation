<p><b> With many other words </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετεροις λογοις πλειοσιν</span></span>). Instrumental case. Not necessarily "different" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετεροις</span></span>), but "further," showing that Luke does not pretend to give all that Peter said. This idea is also brought out clearly by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλειοσιν</span></span> ("more," not "many"), more than these given by Luke.</p>
<p><b>He testified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεμαρτυρατο</span></span>). First aorist middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαμαρτυρομα</span></span>, old verb, to make solemn attestation or call to witness (perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>), while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρεω</span></span> is to bear witness. Page insists that here it should be translated "protested solemnly" to the Jews as it seems to mean in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:28">Luke 16:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:23">Acts 20:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:21">1 Timothy 5:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:14">2 Timothy 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:1">2 Timothy 4:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>And exhorted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα παρεκαλε</span></span>). Imperfect active, kept on exhorting.</p>
<p><b>Save yourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωθητε</span></span>). First aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωζω</span></span>. Literally, Be ye saved.</p>
<p><b>Crooked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκολιας</span></span>). Old word, opposite of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορθος</span></span>, straight. <i>Pravus</i> the opposite of <i>rectus</i>, a perversity for turning off from the truth. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:41">Luke 9:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:15">Philippians 2:15</span>. </p>
