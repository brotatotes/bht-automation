 With many other words  (ετεροις λογοις πλειοσιν). Instrumental case. Not necessarily "different" (ετεροις), but "further," showing that Luke does not pretend to give all that Peter said. This idea is also brought out clearly by πλειοσιν ("more," not "many"), more than these given by Luke.He testified  (διεμαρτυρατο). First aorist middle of διαμαρτυρομα, old verb, to make solemn attestation or call to witness (perfective use of δια), while μαρτυρεω is to bear witness. Page insists that here it should be translated "protested solemnly" to the Jews as it seems to mean in Luke 16:28; Acts 20:23; 1 Timothy 5:21; 2 Timothy 2:14; 2 Timothy 4:1.And exhorted  (κα παρεκαλε). Imperfect active, kept on exhorting.Save yourselves  (σωθητε). First aorist passive of σωζω. Literally, Be ye saved.Crooked  (σκολιας). Old word, opposite of ορθος, straight. Pravus the opposite of rectus, a perversity for turning off from the truth. Cf. Luke 9:41; Philippians 2:15.
