<p><b> They continued steadfastly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν προσκαρτυρουντες</span></span>). Periphrastic active imperfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκαρτυρεω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:14">Acts 1:14</span> (same participle in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:46">Acts 2:46</span>).</p>
<p><b>Fellowship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνια</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνος</span></span> (partner, sharer in common interest) and this from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινος</span></span> what is common to all. This partnership involves participation in, as the blood of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:1">Philippians 2:1</span>) or co-operation in the work of the gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:5">Philippians 1:5</span>) or contribution for those in need (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:4">2 Corinthians 8:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:13">2 Corinthians 9:13</span>). Hence there is wide diversity of opinion concerning the precise meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνια</span></span> in this verse. It may refer to the distribution of funds in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:44">Acts 2:44</span> or to the oneness of spirit in the community of believers or to the Lord's Supper (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:16">1 Corinthians 10:16</span>) in the sense of communion or to the fellowship in the common meals or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαε</span></span> (love-feasts).</p>
<p><b>The breaking of bread </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη κλασε του αρτου</span></span>). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλασις</span></span> is an old word, but used only by Luke in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:35">Luke 24:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:42">Acts 2:42</span>), though the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαω</span></span> occurs in other parts of the N.T. as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:46">Acts 2:46</span>. The problem here is whether Luke refers to the ordinary meal as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:35">Luke 24:35</span> or to the Lord's Supper. The same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαω</span></span> is used of breaking bread at the ordinary meal (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:30">Luke 24:30</span>) or the Lord's Supper (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19">Luke 22:19</span>). It is generally supposed that the early disciples attached so much significance to the breaking of bread at the ordinary meals, more than our saying grace, that they followed the meal with the Lord's Supper at first, a combination called <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπα</span></span> or love-feasts. "There can be no doubt that the Eucharist at this period was preceded uniformly by a common repast, as was the case when the ordinance was instituted" (Hackett). This led to some abuses as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:20">1 Corinthians 11:20</span>. Hence it is possible that what is referred to here is the Lord's Supper following the ordinary meal. "To simply explain <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη κλασε του αρτου</span></span> as='The Holy Communion' is to pervert the plain meaning of words, and to mar the picture of family life, which the text places before us as the ideal of the early believers" (Page). But in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7">Acts 20:7</span> they seem to have come together especially for the observance of the Lord's Supper. Perhaps there is no way to settle the point conclusively here.</p>
<p><b>The prayers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταις προσευχαις</span></span>). Services where they prayed as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:14">Acts 1:14</span>, in the temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:1">Acts 3:1</span>), in their homes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:23">Acts 4:23</span>). </p>
