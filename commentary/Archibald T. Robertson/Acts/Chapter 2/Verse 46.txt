 With one accord in the temple  (ομοθυμαδον εν τω ιερω). See on Acts 1:14 for ομοθυμαδον. They were still worshipping in the temple for no breach had yet come between Christians and Jews. Daily they were here and daily breaking bread at home (κατ' οικον) which looks like the regular meal.They did take their food  (μετελαμβανον τροφης). Imperfect tense again and clearly referring to the regular meals at home. Does it refer also to the possible αγαπα or to the Lord's Supper afterwards as they had common meals "from house to house" (κατ' οικον)? We know there were local churches in the homes where they had "worship rooms," the church in the house. At any rate it was "with singleness" (αφελοτητ) of heart. The word occurs only here in the N.T., though a late Koine word (papyri). It comes from αφελης, free from rock (φελλευς is stony ground), smooth. The old form was αφελεια.
