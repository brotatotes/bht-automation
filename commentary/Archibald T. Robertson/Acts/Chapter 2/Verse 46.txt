<p><b> With one accord in the temple </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοθυμαδον εν τω ιερω</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:14">Acts 1:14</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοθυμαδον</span></span>. They were still worshipping in the temple for no breach had yet come between Christians and Jews. Daily they were here and daily breaking bread at home (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ' οικον</span></span>) which looks like the regular meal.</p>
<p><b>They did take their food </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετελαμβανον τροφης</span></span>). Imperfect tense again and clearly referring to the regular meals at home. Does it refer also to the possible <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπα</span></span> or to the Lord's Supper afterwards as they had common meals "from house to house" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ' οικον</span></span>)? We know there were local churches in the homes where they had "worship rooms," the church in the house. At any rate it was "with singleness" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφελοτητ</span></span>) of heart. The word occurs only here in the N.T., though a late <i>Koine</i> word (papyri). It comes from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφελης</span></span>, free from rock (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φελλευς</span></span> is stony ground), smooth. The old form was <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφελεια</span></span>. </p>
