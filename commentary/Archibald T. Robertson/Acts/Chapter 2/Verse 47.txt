<p><b> Having favor </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχοντες χαριν</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:52">Luke 2:52</span> of the Boy Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Added </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσετιθε</span></span>). Imperfect active, kept on adding. If the Lord only always "added" those who join our churches. Note verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:41">Acts 2:41</span> where same verb is used of the 3,000.</p>
<p><b>To them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ το αυτο</span></span>). Literally, "together." Why not leave it so? "To the church" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εκκλησια</span></span>) is not genuine. Codex Bezae has "in the church."</p>
<p><b>Those that were being saved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους σωζομενους</span></span>). Present passive participle. Probably for repetition like the imperfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσετιθε</span></span>. Better translate it "those saved from time to time." It was a continuous revival, day by day. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σωζω</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωτηρια</span></span> is used for "save" in three senses (beginning, process, conclusion), but here repetition is clearly the point of the present tense. </p>
