<p><b> When this sound was heard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενης της φωνης ταυτης</span></span>). Genitive absolute with aorist middle participle. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνη</span></span> this time, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηχο</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:1">Acts 2:1</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φωνη</span></span> originally meant sound as of the wind (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:8">John 3:8</span>) or an instrument (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:7">1 Corinthians 14:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:8">1 Corinthians 14:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:10">1 Corinthians 14:10</span>), then voice of men. The meaning seems to be that the excited "other tongues" of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span> were so loud that the noise drew the crowd together. The house where the 120 were may have been (Hackett) on one of the avenues leading to the temple.</p>
<p><b>Were confounded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεχυθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνχεω</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνχυνω</span></span>, to pour together precisely like the Latin <i>confundo</i>, to confound. The Vulgate has it <i>mente confusa est</i>. It is an old verb, but in the N.T. only in Acts five times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:6">Acts 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:22">Acts 9:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:32">Acts 19:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:27">Acts 21:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:31">Acts 21:31</span>).</p>
<p><b>In his own language </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη ιδια διαλεκτω</span></span>). Locative case. Each one could understand his own language when he heard that. Every one that came heard somebody speaking in his native tongue. </p>
