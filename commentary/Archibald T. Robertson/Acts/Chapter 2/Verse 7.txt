<p><b> Were amazed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξισταντο</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξιστημ</span></span>, to stand out of themselves, wide-open astonishment.</p>
<p><b>Marvelled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθαυμαζον</span></span>). Imperfect active. The wonder grew and grew.</p>
<p><b>Galileans </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γαλιλαιο</span></span>). There were few followers of Jesus as yet from Jerusalem. The Galileans spoke a rude Aramaic (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:70">Mark 14:70</span>) and probably crude Greek vernacular also. They were not strong on language and yet these are the very people who now show such remarkable linguistic powers. These people who have come together are all Jews and therefore know Aramaic and the vernacular <i>Koine</i>, but there were various local tongues "wherein we were born" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν η εγεννηθημεν</span></span>). An example is the Lycaonian (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:11">Acts 14:11</span>). These Galilean Christians are now heard speaking these various local tongues. The lists in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9-11">Acts 2:9-11</span> are not linguistic, but geographical and merely illustrate how widespread the Dispersion (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διασπορα</span></span>) of the Jews was as represented on this occasion. Jews were everywhere, these "Jews among the nations" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:21">Acts 21:21</span>). Page notes four main divisions here: (I) The Eastern or Babylonian, like the Parthians, Medes, Elamites, Mesopotamians. (2) The Syrian like Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia. (3) The Egyptian like Egypt, Libya, Cyrene. (4) The Roman.</p>
<p><b>Jews and proselytes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσηλυτο</span></span>). These last from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσερχομα</span></span>, to come to, to join, Gentile converts to Judaism (circumcision, baptism, sacrifice). This proselyte baptism was immersion as is shown by I. Abrahams (<i>Studies in Pharisaism and the Gospels</i>, p. 38). Many remained uncircumcised and were called proselytes of the gate. </p>
