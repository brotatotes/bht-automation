<p><b> After the uproar was ceased </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα το παυσασθα τον θορυβον</span></span>). Literally, after the ceasing (accusative of articular aorist middle infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παυω</span></span>, to make cease) as to the uproar (accusative of general reference). Noise and riot, already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:5">Matthew 26:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:24">Matthew 27:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:38">Mark 5:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:2">Mark 14:2</span>; and see in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:34">Acts 21:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:18">Acts 24:18</span>. Pictures the whole incident as bustle and confusion.</p>
<p><b>Took leave </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασπαμενος</span></span>). First aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασπαζομα</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> intensive and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπαω</span></span>, to draw, to draw to oneself in embrace either in greeting or farewell. Here it is in farewell as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:6">Acts 21:6</span>. Salutation in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:7">Acts 21:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:19">Acts 21:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>Departed for to go into Macedonia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηλθεν πορευεσθα εις Μακεδονιαν</span></span>). Both verbs, single act and then process. Luke here condenses what was probably a whole year of Paul's life and work as we gather from II Corinthians, one of Paul's "weighty and powerful" letters as his enemies called them (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>). "This epistle more than any other is a revelation of S. Paul's own heart: it is his spiritual autobiography and <i>apologia pro vita sua</i>." </p>
