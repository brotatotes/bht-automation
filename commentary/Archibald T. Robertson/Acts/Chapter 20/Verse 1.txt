 After the uproar was ceased  (μετα το παυσασθα τον θορυβον). Literally, after the ceasing (accusative of articular aorist middle infinitive of παυω, to make cease) as to the uproar (accusative of general reference). Noise and riot, already in Matthew 26:5; Matthew 27:24; Mark 5:38; Mark 14:2; and see in Acts 21:34; Acts 24:18. Pictures the whole incident as bustle and confusion.Took leave  (ασπαμενος). First aorist middle participle of ασπαζομα, old verb from α intensive and σπαω, to draw, to draw to oneself in embrace either in greeting or farewell. Here it is in farewell as in Acts 21:6. Salutation in Acts 21:7; Acts 21:19.Departed for to go into Macedonia  (εξηλθεν πορευεσθα εις Μακεδονιαν). Both verbs, single act and then process. Luke here condenses what was probably a whole year of Paul's life and work as we gather from II Corinthians, one of Paul's "weighty and powerful" letters as his enemies called them (2 Corinthians 10:10). "This epistle more than any other is a revelation of S. Paul's own heart: it is his spiritual autobiography and apologia pro vita sua."
