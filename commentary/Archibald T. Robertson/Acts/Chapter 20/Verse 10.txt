<p><b> Fell on him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεπεσεν αυτω</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιπιπτω</span></span> with dative case as Elijah did (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:21">1 Kings 17:21</span>) and Elisha (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+4:34">2 Kings 4:34</span>).</p>
<p><b>Embracing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνπεριλαβων</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνπεριλαμβανω</span></span>, old verb to embrace completely (take hold together round), but only here in the N.T. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ezr+5:3">Ezra 5:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Make ye no ado </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη θορυβεισθε</span></span>). Stop (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and present middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θορυβεω</span></span>) making a noise (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θορυβος</span></span>) as the people did on the death of Jairus's daughter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:23">Matthew 9:23</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θορυβουμενου</span></span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:38">Mark 5:38</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θορυβου</span></span>) when Jesus asked <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ θορυβεισθε?</span></span> <b> For his life is in him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η γαρ ψυχη αυτου εν αυτω εστιν</span></span>). This language is relied on by Ramsay, Wendt, Zoeckler to show that Eutychus had not really died, but had merely swooned. Paul's language would suit that view, but it suits equally well the idea that he had just been restored to life and so is indecisive. Furneaux urges also the fact that his friends did not bring him back to the meeting till morning (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:12">Acts 20:12</span>) as additional evidence that it was a case of swooning rather than of death. But this again is not conclusive as they would naturally not take him back at once. One will believe here as the facts appeal to him. </p>
