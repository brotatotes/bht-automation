<p><b> When he was gone up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβας</span></span>). Second aorist active participle in sharp contrast to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβας</span></span> (went down) of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:10">Acts 20:10</span>.</p>
<p><b>Had broken bread </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλασας τον αρτον</span></span>). Probably the Eucharist to observe which ordinance Paul had come and tarried (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7">Acts 20:7</span>), though some scholars distinguish between what took place in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7">Acts 20:7</span> and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:11">Acts 20:11</span>, needlessly so as was stated on verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7">Acts 20:7</span>.</p>
<p><b>And eaten </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα γευσαμενος</span></span>). The word is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:10">Acts 10:10</span> of eating an ordinary meal and so might apply to the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αγαπη</span></span>, but it suits equally for the Eucharist. The accident had interrupted Paul's sermon so that it was observed now and then Paul resumed his discourse.</p>
<p><b>And had talked with them a long while </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφ' ικανον τε ομιλησας</span></span>). Luke, as we have seen, is fond of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικανος</span></span> for periods of time, for a considerable space of time, "even till break of day" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ αυγης</span></span>). Old word for brightness, radiance like German <i>Auge</i>, English eye, only here in the N.T. Occurs in the papyri and in modern Greek for dawn. This second discourse lasted from midnight till dawn and was probably more informal (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:27">Acts 10:27</span>) and conversational (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομιλησας</span></span>, though our word homiletics comes from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομιλεω</span></span>) than the discourse before midnight (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαλεγομα</span></span>, verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7">Acts 20:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:9">Acts 20:9</span>). He had much to say before he left.</p>
<p><b>So he departed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως εξηλθεν</span></span>). Thus Luke sums up the result. Paul left (went forth) only after all the events narrated by the numerous preceding participles had taken place. Effective aorist active indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξελθεν</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hουτως</span></span> here equals <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυμ δεμυμ</span></span>, now at length (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:7">Acts 27:7</span>) as Page shows. </p>
