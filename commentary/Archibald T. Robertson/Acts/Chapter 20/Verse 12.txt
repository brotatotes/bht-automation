<p><b> They brought the lad alive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγαγον τον παιδα ζωντα</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγω</span></span>. Evidently the special friends of the lad who now either brought him back to the room or (Rendall) took him home to his family. Knowling holds that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωντα</span></span> (living) here is pointless unless he had been dead. He had been taken up dead and now they brought him living.</p>
<p><b>Not a little </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μετριως</span></span>). Not moderately, that is a great deal. Luke is fond of this use of the figure <i>litotes</i> (use of the negative) instead of the strong positive (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:5">Acts 1:5</span>, etc.). D (Codex Bezae) has here instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγαγον</span></span> these words: <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλπαζομενων δε αυτων ηγαγεν τον νεανισκον ζωντα</span></span> (while they were saying farewell he brought the young man alive). This reading pictures the joyful scene over the lad's restoration as Paul was leaving. </p>
