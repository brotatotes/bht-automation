 They brought the lad alive  (ηγαγον τον παιδα ζωντα). Second aorist active indicative of αγω. Evidently the special friends of the lad who now either brought him back to the room or (Rendall) took him home to his family. Knowling holds that ζωντα (living) here is pointless unless he had been dead. He had been taken up dead and now they brought him living.Not a little  (ου μετριως). Not moderately, that is a great deal. Luke is fond of this use of the figure litotes (use of the negative) instead of the strong positive (Acts 1:5, etc.). D (Codex Bezae) has here instead of ηγαγον these words: αλπαζομενων δε αυτων ηγαγεν τον νεανισκον ζωντα (while they were saying farewell he brought the young man alive). This reading pictures the joyful scene over the lad's restoration as Paul was leaving.
