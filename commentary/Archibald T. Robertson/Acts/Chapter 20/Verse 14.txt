<p><b> Met us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεβαλλεν ημιν</span></span>). Imperfect active where the aorist (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεβαλεν</span></span>, as C D have it) would seem more natural. It may mean that as soon as (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span>) Paul "came near or began to meet us" (inchoative imperfect), we picked him up. Luke alone in the N.T. uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνβαλλω</span></span> to bring or come together either in a friendly sense as here or as enemies (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:31">Luke 14:31</span>).</p>
<p><b>To Mitylene </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Μιτυληνην</span></span>). The capital of Lesbos about thirty miles from Assos, an easy day's sailing. </p>
