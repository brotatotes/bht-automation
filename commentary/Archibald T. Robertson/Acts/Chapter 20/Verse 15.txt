<p><b> We came over against Chios </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηντησαμεν αντικρυς Χιου</span></span>). Luke uses this <i>Koine</i> verb several times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:19">Acts 18:19</span>), meaning to come right down in front of and the notion of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντα</span></span> is made plainer by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντικρυς</span></span>, face to face with, common "improper" preposition only here in the N.T. They probably lay off the coast (anchoring) during the night instead of putting into the harbour. The Island of Chios is about eight miles from the mainland.</p>
<p><b>The next day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη ετερα</span></span>). The third day in reality from Assos (the fourth from Troas), in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη επιουση</span></span> just before for Chios.</p>
<p><b>We touched at Samos </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεβαλομεν εις Σαμον</span></span>). Second aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβαλλω</span></span>, to throw alongside, to cross over, to put in by. So Thucydides III. 32. Only here in the N.T. though in Textus Receptus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:30">Mark 4:30</span>. The word parable (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολη</span></span>) is from this verb. The Textus Receptus adds here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μειναντες εν Τρογυλλιω</span></span> (and remaining at Trogyllium), but clearly not genuine. In passing from Chios to Samos they sailed past Ephesus to save time for Pentecost in Jerusalem (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:16">Acts 20:16</span>), if in control of the ship, or because the captain allowed Paul to have his way. The island of Samos is still further down the coast below Chios. It is not stated whether a stop was made here or not.</p>
<p><b>The day after </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εχομενη</span></span>). The day holding itself next to the one before. Note Luke's three terms in this verse (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη επιουσηι, τη ετεραι, τη εχομενη</span></span>). This would be the fourth from Assos.</p>
<p><b>To Miletus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Μιλητον</span></span>). About 28 miles south of Ephesus and now the site is several miles from the sea due to the silt from the Maeander. This city, once the chief city of the Ionian Greeks, was now quite eclipsed by Ephesus. </p>
