 We came over against Chios  (κατηντησαμεν αντικρυς Χιου). Luke uses this Koine verb several times (Acts 16:1; Acts 18:19), meaning to come right down in front of and the notion of αντα is made plainer by αντικρυς, face to face with, common "improper" preposition only here in the N.T. They probably lay off the coast (anchoring) during the night instead of putting into the harbour. The Island of Chios is about eight miles from the mainland.The next day  (τη ετερα). The third day in reality from Assos (the fourth from Troas), in contrast with τη επιουση just before for Chios.We touched at Samos  (παρεβαλομεν εις Σαμον). Second aorist active of παραβαλλω, to throw alongside, to cross over, to put in by. So Thucydides III. 32. Only here in the N.T. though in Textus Receptus in Mark 4:30. The word parable (παραβολη) is from this verb. The Textus Receptus adds here κα μειναντες εν Τρογυλλιω (and remaining at Trogyllium), but clearly not genuine. In passing from Chios to Samos they sailed past Ephesus to save time for Pentecost in Jerusalem (verse Acts 20:16), if in control of the ship, or because the captain allowed Paul to have his way. The island of Samos is still further down the coast below Chios. It is not stated whether a stop was made here or not.The day after  (τη εχομενη). The day holding itself next to the one before. Note Luke's three terms in this verse (τη επιουσηι, τη ετεραι, τη εχομενη). This would be the fourth from Assos.To Miletus  (εις Μιλητον). About 28 miles south of Ephesus and now the site is several miles from the sea due to the silt from the Maeander. This city, once the chief city of the Ionian Greeks, was now quite eclipsed by Ephesus.
