<p><b> For Paul had determined </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεκρικε γαρ ο Παυλος</span></span>). Past perfect active (correct text) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span> and not the aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκρινε</span></span>. Either Paul controlled the ship or the captain was willing to oblige him.</p>
<p><b>To sail past Ephesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραπλευσα την Εφεσον</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραπλεω</span></span>, old verb to sail beside, only here in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>That he might not have </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως μη γενητα αυτω</span></span>). Final clause (negative) with aorist middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span> and dative "that it might not happen to him."</p>
<p><b>To spend time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρονοτριβησα</span></span>). First aorist active of the late compound verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρονοτριβεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρονος</span></span>, time, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τριβω</span></span>, to spend), only here in the N.T. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τριβω</span></span>, to rub, to wear out by rubbing, lends itself to the idea of wasting time. It was only a year ago that Paul had left Ephesus in haste after the riot. It was not expedient to go back so soon if he meant to reach Jerusalem by Pentecost. Paul clearly felt (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:15">Acts 20:15</span>) that the presentation of this collection at Pentecost to the Jewish Christians would have a wholesome influence as it had done once before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>).</p>
<p><b>He was hastening </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσπευδεν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπευδω</span></span>, old verb to hasten as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:16">Luke 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:56">Luke 19:56</span>.</p>
<p><b>If it were possible for him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δυνατον ειη αυτω</span></span>). Condition of the fourth class (optative mode), if it should be possible for him. The form is a remote possibility. It was only some thirty days till Pentecost.</p>
<p><b>The day of Pentecost </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ημεραν της πεντηκοστης</span></span>). Note the accusative case. Paul wanted to be there for the whole day. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:1">Acts 2:1</span> for this very phrase. </p>
