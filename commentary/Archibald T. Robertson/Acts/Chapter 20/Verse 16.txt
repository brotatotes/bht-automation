 For Paul had determined  (κεκρικε γαρ ο Παυλος). Past perfect active (correct text) of κρινω and not the aorist εκρινε. Either Paul controlled the ship or the captain was willing to oblige him.To sail past Ephesus  (παραπλευσα την Εφεσον). First aorist active infinitive of παραπλεω, old verb to sail beside, only here in the N.T.That he might not have  (οπως μη γενητα αυτω). Final clause (negative) with aorist middle subjunctive of γινομα and dative "that it might not happen to him."To spend time  (χρονοτριβησα). First aorist active of the late compound verb χρονοτριβεω (χρονος, time, τριβω, to spend), only here in the N.T. The verb τριβω, to rub, to wear out by rubbing, lends itself to the idea of wasting time. It was only a year ago that Paul had left Ephesus in haste after the riot. It was not expedient to go back so soon if he meant to reach Jerusalem by Pentecost. Paul clearly felt (Acts 20:15) that the presentation of this collection at Pentecost to the Jewish Christians would have a wholesome influence as it had done once before (Acts 11:30).He was hastening  (εσπευδεν). Imperfect active of σπευδω, old verb to hasten as in Luke 2:16; Luke 19:56.If it were possible for him  (ε δυνατον ειη αυτω). Condition of the fourth class (optative mode), if it should be possible for him. The form is a remote possibility. It was only some thirty days till Pentecost.The day of Pentecost  (την ημεραν της πεντηκοστης). Note the accusative case. Paul wanted to be there for the whole day. See Acts 2:1 for this very phrase.
