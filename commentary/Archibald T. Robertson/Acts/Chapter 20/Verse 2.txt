<p><b> Those parts </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα μερη εκεινα</span></span>). We have no way of knowing why Luke did not tell of Paul's stay in Troas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span>) nor of meeting Titus in Macedonia (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:13-7">2 Corinthians 2:13-7</span>) nor of Paul's visit to Illyricum (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:19">Romans 15:19</span>) to give time for II Corinthians to do its work (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:2">Acts 20:2</span>), one of the most stirring experiences in Paul's whole career when he opened his heart to the Corinthians and won final victory in the church by the help of Titus who also helped him round up the great collection in Achaia. He wrote II Corinthians during this period after Titus arrived from Corinth. The unity of II Corinthians is here assumed. Paul probably met Luke again in Macedonia, but all this is passed by except by the general phrase: "had given them much exhortation" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλεσας αυτους λογω πολλω</span></span>). Literally, "having exhorted them (the Macedonian brethren) with much talk" (instrumental case).</p>
<p><b>Into Greece </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την Hελλαδα</span></span>). That is, Achaia (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:12">Acts 18:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:21">Acts 19:21</span>), and particularly Corinth, whither he had at last come again after repeated attempts, pauses, and delays (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1">2 Corinthians 13:1</span>). Now at last the coast was clear and Paul apparently had an open door in Corinth during these three months, so completely had Titus at last done away with the opposition of the Judaizers there. </p>
