 How that I shrank not  (ως ουδεν υπεστειλαμεν). Still indirect discourse (question) after επιστασθε (ye know) with ως like πως in verse Acts 20:18. First aorist middle of υποστελλω, old verb to draw under or back. It was so used of drawing back or down sails on a ship and, as Paul had so recently been on the sea, that may be the metaphor here. But it is not necessarily so as the direct middle here makes good sense and is frequent, to withdraw oneself, to cower, to shrink, to conceal, to dissemble as in Habakkuk 2:4 (Hebrews 10:38). Demosthenes so used it to shrink from declaring out of fear for others. This open candour of Paul is supported by his Epistles (1 Thessalonians 2:4; 1 Thessalonians 2:11; 2 Corinthians 4:2; Galatians 1:10).From declaring unto you  (του μη αναγγειλα υμιν). Ablative case of the articular first aorist active infinitive of αναγγελλω with the redundant negative after verbs of hindering, etc. (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1094).Anything that was profitable  (των συμφεροντων). Partitive genitive after ουδεν of the articular present active participle of συμφερω, to bear together, be profitable.Publicly  (δημοσια, adverb)and from house to house  (κα κατ' οικους). By (according to) houses. It is worth noting that this greatest of preachers preached from house to house and did not make his visits merely social calls. He was doing kingdom business all the while as in the house of Aquila and Priscilla (1 Corinthians 16:19).
