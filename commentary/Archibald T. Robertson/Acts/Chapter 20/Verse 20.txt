<p><b> How that I shrank not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ουδεν υπεστειλαμεν</span></span>). Still indirect discourse (question) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστασθε</span></span> (ye know) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πως</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:18">Acts 20:18</span>. First aorist middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποστελλω</span></span>, old verb to draw under or back. It was so used of drawing back or down sails on a ship and, as Paul had so recently been on the sea, that may be the metaphor here. But it is not necessarily so as the direct middle here makes good sense and is frequent, to withdraw oneself, to cower, to shrink, to conceal, to dissemble as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:4">Habakkuk 2:4</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:38">Hebrews 10:38</span>). Demosthenes so used it to shrink from declaring out of fear for others. This open candour of Paul is supported by his Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:4">1 Thessalonians 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:11">1 Thessalonians 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:2">2 Corinthians 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:10">Galatians 1:10</span>).</p>
<p><b>From declaring unto you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του μη αναγγειλα υμιν</span></span>). Ablative case of the articular first aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγγελλω</span></span> with the redundant negative after verbs of hindering, etc. (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1094).</p>
<p><b>Anything that was profitable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των συμφεροντων</span></span>). Partitive genitive after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν</span></span> of the articular present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφερω</span></span>, to bear together, be profitable.</p>
<p><b>Publicly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δημοσια</span></span>, adverb)</p>
<p><b>and from house to house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα κατ' οικους</span></span>). By (according to) houses. It is worth noting that this greatest of preachers preached from house to house and did not make his visits merely social calls. He was doing kingdom business all the while as in the house of Aquila and Priscilla (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:19">1 Corinthians 16:19</span>). </p>
