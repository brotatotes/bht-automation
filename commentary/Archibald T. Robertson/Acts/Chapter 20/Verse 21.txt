<p><b> Testifying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαμαρτυρομενος</span></span>). As Peter did (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:40">Acts 2:40</span>) where Luke uses this same word thoroughly Lucan and Pauline. So again in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:23">Acts 20:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span>. Paul here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span> includes both Jews and Greeks, to the Jew first.</p>
<p><b>Repentance toward God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την εις θεον μετανοιαν</span></span>)</p>
<p><b>and faith toward our Lord Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα πιστιν εις τον κυριον ημων Ιησουν</span></span>). These two elements run through the Epistle to the Romans which Paul had recently written and sent from Corinth. These two elements appear in all Paul's preaching whether "to Jews or Gentiles, to philosophers at Athens or to peasants at Lystra, he preached repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus" (Knowling). </p>
