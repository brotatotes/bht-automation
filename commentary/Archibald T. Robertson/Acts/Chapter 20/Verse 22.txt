 Bound in the spirit  (δεδεμενος τω πνευματ). Perfect passive participle of δεω, to bind, with the locative case. "Bound in my spirit" he means, as in Acts 19:21, from a high sense of duty. The mention of "the Holy Spirit" specifically in verse Acts 20:23 seems to be in contrast to his own spirit here. His own spirit was under the control of the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:16) and the sense does not differ greatly.Not knowing  (μη ειδως). Second perfect active participle of οιδα with μη.That shall befall me  (τα συναντησοντα εμο). Articular future active participle of συνανταω, to meet with (Acts 10:25), to befall (with associative instrumental case) and compare with συμβαντων (befell) in verse Acts 20:19. One of the rare instances of the future participle in the N.T.
