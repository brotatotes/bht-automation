<p><b> Bound in the spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεδεμενος τω πνευματ</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεω</span></span>, to bind, with the locative case. "Bound in my spirit" he means, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:21">Acts 19:21</span>, from a high sense of duty. The mention of "the Holy Spirit" specifically in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:23">Acts 20:23</span> seems to be in contrast to his own spirit here. His own spirit was under the control of the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:16">Romans 8:16</span>) and the sense does not differ greatly.</p>
<p><b>Not knowing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ειδως</span></span>). Second perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>That shall befall me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα συναντησοντα εμο</span></span>). Articular future active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνανταω</span></span>, to meet with (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:25">Acts 10:25</span>), to befall (with associative instrumental case) and compare with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμβαντων</span></span> (befell) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:19">Acts 20:19</span>. One of the rare instances of the future participle in the N.T. </p>
