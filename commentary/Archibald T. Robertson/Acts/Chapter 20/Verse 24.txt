<p><b> But I hold not my life of any account </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ουδενος λογου ποιουμα την ψυχην</span></span>). Neat Greek idiom, accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχην</span></span> and genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογου</span></span> and then Paul adds "dear unto myself" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμιαν εμαυτω</span></span>) in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχην</span></span> (really a combination of two constructions).</p>
<p><b>So that I may accomplish my course </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως τελειωσω δρομον μου</span></span>). Rather, "In order that" (purpose, not result). Aleph and B read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειωσω</span></span> here (first aorist active subjunctive) rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειωσα</span></span> (first aorist active infinitive). It is the lone instance in the N.T. of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> as a final particle (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 987). Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:25">Acts 13:25</span> in his sermon at Antioch in Pisidia described John as fulfilling his course and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:7">2 Timothy 4:7</span> he will say: "I have finished my course" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον δρομον τετελεκα</span></span>). He will run the race to the end.</p>
<p><b>Which I received from the Lord Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην ελαβον παρα του κυριου Ιησου</span></span>). Of that fact he never had a doubt and it was a proud boast (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13">Romans 11:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>The gospel of the grace of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ευαγγελιον της χαριτος του θεου</span></span>). To Paul the gospel consisted in the grace of God. See this word "grace" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις</span></span>) in Romans and his other Epistles. </p>
