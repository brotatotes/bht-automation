 But I hold not my life of any account  (αλλ' ουδενος λογου ποιουμα την ψυχην). Neat Greek idiom, accusative ψυχην and genitive λογου and then Paul adds "dear unto myself" (τιμιαν εμαυτω) in apposition with ψυχην (really a combination of two constructions).So that I may accomplish my course  (ως τελειωσω δρομον μου). Rather, "In order that" (purpose, not result). Aleph and B read τελειωσω here (first aorist active subjunctive) rather than τελειωσα (first aorist active infinitive). It is the lone instance in the N.T. of ως as a final particle (Robertson, Grammar, p. 987). Paul in Acts 13:25 in his sermon at Antioch in Pisidia described John as fulfilling his course and in 2 Timothy 4:7 he will say: "I have finished my course" (τον δρομον τετελεκα). He will run the race to the end.Which I received from the Lord Jesus  (ην ελαβον παρα του κυριου Ιησου). Of that fact he never had a doubt and it was a proud boast (Galatians 1:1; Romans 11:13).The gospel of the grace of God  (το ευαγγελιον της χαριτος του θεου). To Paul the gospel consisted in the grace of God. See this word "grace" (χαρις) in Romans and his other Epistles.
