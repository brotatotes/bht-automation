<p><b> And now, behold </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα νυν, ιδου</span></span>). Second time and solemn reminder as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:22">Acts 20:22</span>.</p>
<p><b>I know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω οιδα</span></span>). Emphasis on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω</span></span> which is expressed.</p>
<p><b>Ye all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις παντες</span></span>). In very emphatic position after the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψεσθε</span></span> (shall see) and the object (my face). Twice Paul will write from Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:24">Philippians 2:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:22">Philemon 1:22</span>) the hope of coming east again; but that is in the future, and here Paul is expressing his personal conviction and his fears. The Pastoral Epistles show Paul did come to Ephesus again (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:14">1 Timothy 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:13">1 Timothy 4:13</span>) and Troas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:13">2 Timothy 4:13</span>) and Miletus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:20">2 Timothy 4:20</span>). There need be no surprise that Paul's fears turned out otherwise. He had reason enough for them.</p>
<p><b>Among whom I went about </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν οις διηλθον</span></span>). Apparently Paul here has in mind others beside the ministers. They represented the church in Ephesus and the whole region where Paul laboured. </p>
