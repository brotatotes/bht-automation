<p><b> I testify </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρομα</span></span>). Elsewhere in the N.T. only in Paul's Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:3">Galatians 5:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17">Ephesians 4:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:12">1 Thessalonians 2:12</span>). It means "I call to witness" while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρεω</span></span> means "I bear witness."</p>
<p><b>This day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη σημερον ημερα</span></span>). The today day, the last day with you, our parting day.</p>
<p><b>I am pure from the blood of all men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαρος ειμ απο του αιματος παντων</span></span>). Paul was sensitive on this point as in Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:6">Acts 18:6</span>). It is much for any preacher to claim and it ought to be true of all. The papyri also give this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> with the ablative rather than the mere ablative after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαρος</span></span>. </p>
