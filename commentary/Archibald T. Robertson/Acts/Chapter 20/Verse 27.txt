<p>Paul here repeats the very words and idioms used in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:20">Acts 20:20</span>, adding "the whole counsel of God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασαν την βουλην του θεου</span></span>). All the counsel of God that concerned Paul's work and nothing inconsistent with the purpose of God of redemption through Christ Jesus (Page). </p>
