<p><b> Take heed unto yourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεχετε εαυτοις</span></span>). The full phrase had <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον νουν</span></span>, hold your mind on yourselves (or other object in the dative), as often in old writers and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+7:17">Job 7:17</span>. But the ancients often used the idiom with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουν</span></span> understood, but not expressed as here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:35">Acts 5:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:1">Luke 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:3">Luke 17:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:34">Luke 21:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:4">1 Timothy 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:13">1 Timothy 4:13</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Επεχε</span></span> is so used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:16">1 Timothy 4:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>To all the flock </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντ τω ποιμνιω</span></span>). Contracted form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμενιον = ποιμνη</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:16">John 10:16</span>) already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:32">Luke 12:32</span> and also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:29">Acts 20:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:2">1 Peter 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:3">1 Peter 5:3</span>. Common in old Greek.</p>
<p><b>Hath made </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθετο</span></span>). Did make, second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>, did appoint. Paul evidently believed that the Holy Spirit calls and appoints ministers.</p>
<p><b>Bishops </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισκοπους</span></span>). The same men termed elders in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17">Acts 20:17</span> which see.</p>
<p><b>To shepherd </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμαινειν</span></span>). Present active infinitive of purpose of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμαινω</span></span>, old verb to feed or tend the flock (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμνη, ποιμνιον</span></span>), to act as shepherd (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμην</span></span>). These ministers are thus in Paul's speech called elders (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17">Acts 20:17</span>), bishops (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>), and shepherds (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>). Jesus had used this very word to Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:16">John 21:16</span>, twice <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βοσκε</span></span>, feed, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:15">Acts 21:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:17">Acts 21:17</span>) and Peter will use it in addressing fellow-elders (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:2">1 Peter 5:2</span>) with memories, no doubt of the words of Jesus to him. The "elders" were to watch over as "bishops" and "tend and feed as shepherds" the flock. Jesus is termed "the shepherd and bishop of your souls" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:25">1 Peter 2:25</span> and "the great Shepherd of the sheep" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:20">Hebrews 13:20</span>. Jesus called himself "the good Shepherd" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>The church of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την εκκλησιαν του θεου</span></span>). The correct text, not "the church of the Lord" or "the church of the Lord and God" (Robertson, <i>Introduction to Textual Criticism of the N.T.</i>, p. 189).</p>
<p><b>He purchased </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεποιησατο</span></span>). First aorist middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιποιεω</span></span>, old verb to reserve, to preserve (for or by oneself, in the middle). In the N.T. only in Luke <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:33">Acts 17:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:13">1 Timothy 3:13</span>. The substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιποιησιν</span></span> (preservation, possession) occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span> ("a peculiar people" = a people for a possession) and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>With his own blood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του αιματος του ιδιου</span></span>). Through the agency of (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) his own blood. Whose blood? If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θεου</span></span> (Aleph B Vulg.) is correct, as it is, then Jesus is here called "God" who shed his own blood for the flock. It will not do to say that Paul did not call Jesus God, for we have <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9">Colossians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span> where he does that very thing, besides <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15-20">Colossians 1:15-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:5-11">Philippians 2:5-11</span>. </p>
