<p><b> When he had spent three months there </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησας μηνας τρεις</span></span>). Literally, "having done three months," the same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:33">Acts 14:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:23">Acts 18:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:13">James 5:13</span>. During this period Paul may have written Galatians as Lightfoot argued and certainly did Romans. We do not have to say that Luke was ignorant of Paul's work during this period, only that he did not choose to enlarge upon it.</p>
<p><b>And a plot was laid against him by the Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενης επιβουλης αυτω υπο των Ιουδαιων</span></span>). Genitive absolute, "a plot by the Jews having come against him." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Επιβουλη</span></span> is an old word for a plot against one. In the N.T. only in Acts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:24">Acts 9:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:3">Acts 20:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:19">Acts 20:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:30">Acts 23:30</span>). Please note that this plot is by the Jews, not the Judaizers whom Paul discusses so vehemently in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:2">Acts 20:2</span>. They had given Paul much anguish of heart as is shown in I Cor. and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:2">Acts 20:2</span>, but that trouble seems now past. It is Paul's old enemies in Corinth who had cherished all these years their defeat at the hands of Gallio (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:5-17">Acts 18:5-17</span>) who now took advantage of Paul's plans for departure to compass his death if possible.</p>
<p><b>As he was about to set sail for Syria </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλοντ αναγεσθα εις την Συριαν</span></span>). The participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλοντ</span></span> agrees in case (dative) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span>. For the sense of intending see also verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:13">Acts 20:13</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αναγεσθα</span></span> (present middle infinitive) is the common word for putting out to sea (going up, they said, from land) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:13">Acts 13:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>He determined </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο γνωμης</span></span>). The best MSS. here read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωμης</span></span> (predicate ablative of source like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιλυσεως</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:20">2 Peter 1:20</span>, Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 514), not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωμη</span></span> (nominative). "He became of opinion." The Jews had heard of Paul's plan to sail for Syria and intended in the hurly-burly either to kill him at the docks in Cenchreae or to push him overboard from the crowded pilgrim ship bound for the passover. Fortunately Paul learned of their plot and so eluded them by going through Macedonia. The Codex Bezae adds here that "the Spirit bade him return into Macedonia." </p>
