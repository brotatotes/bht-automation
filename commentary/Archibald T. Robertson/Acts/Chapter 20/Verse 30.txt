<p><b> From among your own selves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ υμων αυτων</span></span>). In sheep's clothing just as Jesus had foretold. The outcome fully justified Paul's apprehensions as we see in Colossians, Ephesians, I and II Timothy, Revelation. False philosophy, immorality, asceticism will lead some astray (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:8">Colossians 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:6">Ephesians 5:6</span>). John will picture "antichrists" who went out from us because they were not of us (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span>). There is a false optimism that is complacently blind as well as a despondent pessimism that gives up the fight.</p>
<p><b>Perverse things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεστραμμενα</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαστρεφω</span></span>, old verb to turn aside, twist, distort as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:8">Acts 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:10">Acts 13:10</span>.</p>
<p><b>To draw away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του αποσπαιν</span></span>). Articular genitive present active participle of purpose from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποσπαω</span></span>, old verb used to draw the sword (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:51">Matthew 26:51</span>), to separate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:41">Luke 22:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:1">Acts 21:1</span>). The pity of it is that such leaders of dissension can always gain a certain following. Paul's long residence in Ephesus enabled him to judge clearly of conditions there. </p>
