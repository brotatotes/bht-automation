<p><b> Wherefore watch ye </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διο γρηγορειτε</span></span>). Paul has concluded his defence of himself and his warning. Now he exhorts on the basis of it (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διο</span></span>) because of which thing. The very command of Jesus concerning the perils before his return as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:35">Mark 13:35</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γρηγορειτε</span></span>), the very form (late present imperative from the second perfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγρηγορα</span></span> of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγειρω</span></span>, to arouse). Stay awake.</p>
<p><b>I ceased not to admonish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ επαυσαμην νουθετων</span></span>). Participle describes Paul, I did not cease admonishing, night and day (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυκτα κα ημεραν</span></span>, accusative of extent of time, for three years <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τριετιαν</span></span>, accusative of extent of time also). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Νουθετων</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουθετεω</span></span>, to put sense into one. So Paul kept it up with tears (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:19">Acts 20:19</span>) if so be he could save the Ephesians from the impending perils. Forewarned is to be forearmed. Paul did his duty by them. </p>
