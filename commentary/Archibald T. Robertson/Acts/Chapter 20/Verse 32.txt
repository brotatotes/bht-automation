And as to the present things (or situation) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:29">Acts 4:29</span>.</p>
<p><b>I commend </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρατιθεμα</span></span>). Present middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρατιθημ</span></span>, old verb to place beside, middle, to deposit with one, to interest as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:2">2 Timothy 2:2</span>.

<p><b>Which is able to build up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω δυναμενω οικοδομησα</span></span>). God works through the word of his grace and so it is able to build up (edify); a favourite Pauline word (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:10-14">1 Corinthians 3:10-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20-22">Ephesians 2:20-22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:15">2 Timothy 3:15</span>; etc.), and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:21">James 1:21</span>.

Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:12">Colossians 1:12</span>. Stephen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:5">Acts 7:5</span> used the word "inheritance" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κληρονομιαν</span></span>), nowhere else in Acts, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>.
