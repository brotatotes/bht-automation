<p><b> No man's silver or gold or apparel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αργυριου η χρυσιου η ιματισμου ουδενος</span></span>). Genitive case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεθυμησα</span></span>. One of the slanders against Paul was that he was raising this collection, ostensibly for the poor, really for himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:17">2 Corinthians 12:17</span>). He includes "apparel" because oriental wealth consisted largely in fine apparel (not old worn out clothes). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+24:53">Genesis 24:53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:5">2 Kings 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:13">Psalms 45:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19">Matthew 6:19</span>. Paul did not preach just for money. </p>
