 No man's silver or gold or apparel  (αργυριου η χρυσιου η ιματισμου ουδενος). Genitive case after επεθυμησα. One of the slanders against Paul was that he was raising this collection, ostensibly for the poor, really for himself (2 Corinthians 12:17). He includes "apparel" because oriental wealth consisted largely in fine apparel (not old worn out clothes). See Genesis 24:53; 2 Kings 5:5; Psalms 45:13; Matthew 6:19. Paul did not preach just for money.
