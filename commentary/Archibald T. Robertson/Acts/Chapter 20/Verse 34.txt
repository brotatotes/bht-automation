<p><b> Ye yourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτο</span></span>). Intensive pronoun. Certainly they knew that the church in Ephesus had not supported Paul while there.</p>
<p><b>These hands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α χειρες αυτα</span></span>). Paul was not above manual labour. He pointed to his hands with pride as proof that he toiled at his trade of tent-making as at Thessalonica and Corinth for his own needs (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρειαις</span></span>) and for those with him (probably Aquila and Priscilla) with whom he lived and probably Timothy because of his often infirmities (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:23">1 Timothy 5:23</span>).</p>
<p><b>Ministered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπηρετησαν</span></span>). First aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπηρετεω</span></span>, to act as under rower, old verb, but in the N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:36">Acts 13:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:34">Acts 20:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:23">Acts 24:23</span>. While in Ephesus Paul wrote to Corinth: "We toil, working with our own hands" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:12">1 Corinthians 4:12</span>). "As he held them up, they saw a tongue of truth in every seam that marked them" (Furneaux). </p>
