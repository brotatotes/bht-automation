<p><b> I gave you an example </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεδειξα</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποδεικνυμ</span></span>, old verb to show under one's eyes, to give object lesson, by deed as well as by word (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:47">Luke 6:47</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυποδειγμα</span></span> means example (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:15">John 13:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:10">James 5:10</span>). So Paul appeals to his example in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:1">1 Corinthians 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:17">Philippians 3:17</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παντα</span></span> is accusative plural of general reference (in all things).</p>
<p><b>So labouring ye ought to help </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως κοπιωντας δε αντιλαμβανεσθα</span></span>). So, as I did. Necessity (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>). Toiling (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπιωντας</span></span>) not just for ourselves, but to help (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιλαμβανεσθα</span></span>), to take hold yourselves (middle voice) at the other end (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span>). This verb common in the old Greek, but in the N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:54">Luke 1:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:35">Acts 20:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:2">1 Timothy 6:2</span>. This noble plea to help the weak is the very spirit of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:14">1 Thessalonians 5:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6">Romans 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:14">1 Thessalonians 5:14</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντεχεσθε των ασθενουντων</span></span> we have Paul's very idea again. Every Community Chest appeal today re-echoes Paul's plea.</p>
<p><b>He himself said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος ειπεν</span></span>). Not in the Gospels, one of the sayings of Jesus in current use that Paul had received and treasured. Various other <i>Agrapha</i> of Jesus have been preserved in ancient writers and some in recently discovered papyri which may be genuine or not. We are grateful that Paul treasured this one. This Beatitude (on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακαριον</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3-11">Matthew 5:3-11</span>) is illustrated by the whole life of Jesus with the Cross as the culmination. Aristotle (Eth. IV. I) has a saying somewhat like this, but assigns the feeling of superiority as the reason (Page), an utterly different idea from that here. This quotation raises the question of how much Paul personally knew of the life and sayings of Jesus. </p>
