<p><b> Accompanied him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνειπετο αυτω</span></span>). Imperfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεπομα</span></span>, old and common verb, but only here in the N.T. The singular is used agreeing with the first name mentioned <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σωπατρος</span></span> and to be supplied with each of the others. Textus Receptus adds here "into Asia" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ της Ασιας</span></span>, as far as Asia), but the best documents (Aleph B Vulg. Sah Boh) do not have it. As a matter of fact, Trophimus went as far as Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:29">Acts 21:29</span>) and Aristarchus as far as Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:2">Acts 27:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>), The phrase could apply only to Sopatros. It is not clear though probable that Luke means to say that these seven brethren, delegates of the various churches (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:19-23">2 Corinthians 8:19-23</span>) started from Corinth with Paul. Luke notes the fact that they accompanied Paul, but the party may really have been made up at Philippi where Luke himself joined Paul, the rest of the party having gone on to Troas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:5">Acts 20:5</span>). These were from Roman provinces that shared in the collection (Galatia, Asia, Macedonia, Achaia). In this list three were from Macedonia, Sopater of Beroea, Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica; two from Galatia, Gaius of Derbe and Timothy of Lystra; two from Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. It is a bit curious that none are named from Achaia. Had Corinth failed after all (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:2">Acts 20:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:9">Acts 20:9</span>) to raise its share of the collection after such eager pledging? Rackham suggests that they may have turned their part over directly to Paul. Luke joined Paul in Philippi and could have handled the money from Achaia. It was an important event and Paul took the utmost pains to remove any opportunity for scandal in the handling of the funds. </p>
