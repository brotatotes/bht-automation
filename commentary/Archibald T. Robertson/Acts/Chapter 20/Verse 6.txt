<p><b> After the days of unleavened bread </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα τας ημερας των αζυμων</span></span>). Paul was a Jew, though a Christian, and observed the Jewish feasts, though he protested against Gentiles being forced to do it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:10">Galatians 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:16">Colossians 2:16</span>). Was Luke a proselyte because he notes the Jewish feasts as here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:9">Acts 27:9</span>? He may have noted them merely because Paul observed them. But this passover was a year after that in Ephesus when Paul expected to remain there till Pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:8">1 Corinthians 16:8</span>). He was hoping now to reach Jerusalem by Pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:16">Acts 20:16</span>) as he did. We do not know the precise year, possibly A.D. 56 or 57.</p>
<p><b>In five days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ ημερων πεντε</span></span>). Up to five days (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:37">Luke 2:37</span>). D has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεμπταιο</span></span>, "fifth day men," a correct gloss. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευτεραιο</span></span>, second-day men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:13">Acts 28:13</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:11">Acts 16:11</span> they made the voyage in two days. Probably adverse winds held them back here.</p>
<p><b>Seven days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επτα ημερας</span></span>). To atone for the short stay in Troas before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span>) when Paul was so restless. Now he preaches a week to them. </p>
