Paul was a Jew, though a Christian, and observed the Jewish feasts, though he protested against Gentiles being forced to do it (Galatians 4:10; Colossians 2:16). Was Luke a proselyte because he notes the Jewish feasts as here and in Acts 27:9? He may have noted them merely because Paul observed them. But this passover was a year after that in Ephesus when Paul expected to remain there till Pentecost (1 Corinthians 16:8). He was hoping now to reach Jerusalem by Pentecost (Acts 20:16) as he did. We do not know the precise year, possibly A.D. 56 or 57.In five days  (αχρ ημερων πεντε). Up to five days (cf. Luke 2:37). D has πεμπταιο, "fifth day men," a correct gloss. Cf. δευτεραιο, second-day men (Acts 28:13). In Acts 16:11 they made the voyage in two days. Probably adverse winds held them back here.Seven days  (επτα ημερας). To atone for the short stay in Troas before (2 Corinthians 2:12) when Paul was so restless. Now he preaches a week to them.
