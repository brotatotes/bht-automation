<p><b> Upon the first day of the week </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν δε μια των σαββατων</span></span>). The cardinal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μια</span></span> used here for the ordinal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτη</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:9">Mark 16:9</span>) like the Hebrew <i>ehadh</i> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:2">Mark 16:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:1">Matthew 28:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:1">Luke 24:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:1">John 20:1</span> and in harmony with the <i>Koine</i> idiom (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 671). Either the singular (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:9">Mark 16:9</span>) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαββατου</span></span> or the plural <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαββατον</span></span> as here was used for the week (sabbath to sabbath). For the first time here we have services mentioned on the first day of the week though in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:2">1 Corinthians 16:2</span> it is implied by the collections stored on that day. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:10">Revelation 1:10</span> the Lord's day seems to be the day of the week on which Jesus rose from the grave. Worship on the first day of the week instead of the seventh naturally arose in Gentile churches, though <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:26">John 20:26</span> seems to mean that from the very start the disciples began to meet on the first (or eighth) day. But liberty was allowed as Paul makes plain in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:5">Romans 14:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>When we were gathered together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνηγμενων ημων</span></span>). Genitive absolute, perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγω</span></span>, to gather together, a formal meeting of the disciples. See this verb used for gatherings of disciples in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:31">Acts 4:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:27">Acts 14:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:6">Acts 15:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:30">Acts 15:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:7">Acts 19:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:8">Acts 19:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:4">1 Corinthians 5:4</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:25">Hebrews 10:25</span> the substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισυναγωγην</span></span> is used for the regular gatherings which some were already neglecting. It is impossible for a church to flourish without regular meetings even if they have to meet in the catacombs as became necessary in Rome. In Russia today the Soviets are trying to break up conventicles of Baptists. They probably met on our Saturday evening, the beginning of the first day at sunset. So these Christians began the day (Sunday) with worship. But, since this is a Gentile community, it is quite possible that Luke means our Sunday evening as the time when this meeting occurs, and the language in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:19">John 20:19</span> "it being evening on that day the first day of the week" naturally means the evening following the day, not the evening preceding the day.</p>
<p><b>To break bread </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλασα αρτον</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of purpose of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαω</span></span>. The language naturally bears the same meaning as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:42">Acts 2:42</span>, the Eucharist or the Lord's Supper which usually followed the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αγαπη</span></span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:16">1 Corinthians 10:16</span>. The time came, when the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αγαπη</span></span> was no longer observed, perhaps because of the abuses noted in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:20">1 Corinthians 11:20</span>. Rackham argues that the absence of the article with bread here and its presence (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αρτον</span></span>) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:11">Acts 20:11</span> shows that the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αγαπη</span></span> is ] referred to in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7">Acts 20:7</span> and the Eucharist in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:11">Acts 20:11</span>, but not necessarily so because <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αρτον</span></span> may merely refer to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτον</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7">Acts 20:7</span>. At any rate it should be noted that Paul, who conducted this service, was not a member of the church in Troas, but only a visitor.</p>
<p><b>Discoursed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διελεγετο</span></span>). Imperfect middle because he kept on at length.</p>
<p><b>Intending </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλω</span></span>). Being about to, on the point of.</p>
<p><b>On the morrow </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη επαυριον</span></span>). Locative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερα</span></span> understood after the adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαυριον</span></span>. If Paul spoke on our Saturday evening, he made the journey on the first day of the week (our Sunday) after sunrise. If he spoke on our Sunday evening, then he left on our Monday morning.</p>
<p><b>Prolonged his speech </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παρετεινεν τον λογον</span></span>). Imperfect active (same form as aorist) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρατεινω</span></span>, old verb to stretch beside or lengthwise, to prolong. Vivid picture of Paul's long sermon which went on and on till midnight (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεχρ μεσονυκτιου</span></span>). Paul's purpose to leave early next morning seemed to justify the long discourse. Preachers usually have some excuse for the long sermon which is not always clear to the exhausted audience. </p>
