<p><b> Sat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθεζομενος</span></span>). Sitting (present middle participle describing his posture).</p>
<p><b>In the window </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ της θυριδος</span></span>). Old word diminutive from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυρα</span></span>, door, a little door. Latticed window (no glass) opened because of the heat from the lamps and the crowd. Our window was once spelt <i>windore</i> (Hudibras), perhaps from the wrong idea that it was derived from <i>wind</i> and <i>door</i>. Eutychus (a common slave name) was sitting on (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>) the window sill. Ahaziah "fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+1:2">2 Kings 1:2</span>). In the N.T. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυρις</span></span> only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:33">2 Corinthians 11:33</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια θυριδος</span></span>) through which Paul was let down through the wall in Damascus.</p>
<p><b>Borne down with deep sleep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταφερομενος υπνω βαθε</span></span>). Present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταφερω</span></span>, to bear down, and followed by instrumental case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπνω</span></span>). Describes the gradual process of going into deep sleep. Great medical writers use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαθυς</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπνος</span></span> as we do today (deep sleep). D here has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασε</span></span> (heavy) for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαθε</span></span> (deep).</p>
<p><b>As Paul discoursed yet longer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαλεγομενου του Παυλου επ πλειον</span></span>). Genitive absolute of present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαλεγομα</span></span> (cf. verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7">Acts 20:7</span>). with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ πλειον</span></span>. Eutychus struggled bravely to keep awake, vainly hoping that Paul would finish. But he went on "for more."</p>
<p><b>Being born down by his sleep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατενεχθεις απο του υπνου</span></span>). First aorist (effective) passive showing the final result of the process described by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταφερομενος</span></span>, finally overcome as a result of (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>) the (note article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του</span></span>) sleep (ablative case). These four participles (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθεζομενοσ, καταφερομενοσ, διαλεγομενου, κατενεχθεις</span></span>) have no connectives, but are distinguished clearly by case and tense. The difference between the present <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταφερομενος</span></span> and the aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατενεχθεις</span></span> of the same verb is marked.</p>
<p><b>Fell down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεσεν κατω</span></span>). Effective aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιπτω</span></span> with the adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατω</span></span>, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταπιπτω</span></span> (compound verb) could have been used (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:6">Acts 28:6</span>). Hobart (<i>Medical Language of St. Luke</i>) thinks that Luke shows a physician's interest in the causes of the drowsiness of Eutychus (the heat, the crowd, the smell of the lamps, the late hour, the long discourse). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:45">Luke 22:45</span>.</p>
<p><b>From the third story </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο του τριστεγου</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρεις</span></span> (three) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στεγη</span></span> (roof), adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τριστεγος</span></span> having three roofs.</p>
<p><b>Was taken up dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρθη νεκρος</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρω</span></span>. Luke does not say <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> (as) or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωσε</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:26">Mark 9:26</span> as if). The people considered him dead and Luke the physician seems to agree with that view. </p>
