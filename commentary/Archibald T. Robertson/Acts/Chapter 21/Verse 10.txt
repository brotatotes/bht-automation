<p><b> As we tarried </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιμενοντων ημων</span></span>). Genitive absolute. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> (additional) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:16">Acts 12:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>Many days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερας πλειους</span></span>). More days (than we expected), accusative of time.</p>
<p><b>A certain prophet named Agabus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητης ονοματ Αγαβος</span></span>). A prophet like the daughters of Philip, mentioned already in connection with the famine predicted by him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>), but apparently not a man of prominence like Barnabas, and so no allusion to that former prophecy. </p>
