More days (than we expected), accusative of time.A certain prophet named Agabus  (προφητης ονοματ Αγαβος). A prophet like the daughters of Philip, mentioned already in connection with the famine predicted by him (Acts 11:28), but apparently not a man of prominence like Barnabas, and so no allusion to that former prophecy.
