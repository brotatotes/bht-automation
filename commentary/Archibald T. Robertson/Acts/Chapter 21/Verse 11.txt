<p><b> Coming </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελθων</span></span>, second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>), taking (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρας</span></span>, first aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρω</span></span>, to take up),</p>
<p><b>binding </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δησας</span></span>, first aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεω</span></span>, to bind). Vivid use of three successive participles describing the dramatic action of Agabus.</p>
<p><b>Paul's girdle </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ζωνην του Παυλου</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωννυμ</span></span>, to gird. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:8">Acts 12:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>His own feet and hands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτου τους ποδας κα τας χειρας</span></span>). Basis for the interpretation. Old Testament prophets often employed symbolic deeds (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:11">1 Kings 22:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:2">James 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+13:1-7">Jeremiah 13:1-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+4:1-6">Ezekiel 4:1-6</span>). Jesus interpreted the symbolism of Peter's girding himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:18">John 21:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>So </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως</span></span>). As Agabus had bound himself. Agabus was just from Jerusalem and probably knew the feeling there against Paul. At any rate the Holy Spirit revealed it to him as he claims.</p>
<p><b>Shall deliver </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδωσουσιν</span></span>). Like the words of Jesus about himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:19">Matthew 20:19</span>). He was "delivered" into the hands of the Gentiles and it took five years to get out of those hands. </p>
