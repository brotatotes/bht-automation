<p><b> Both we and they of that place </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις τε κα ο εντοπιο</span></span>). Usual use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε κα</span></span> (both--and). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εντοπιο</span></span>, old word, only here in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Not to go up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του μη αναβαινειν</span></span>). Probably ablative of the articular present active infinitive with redundant negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεκαλουμεν</span></span> (imperfect active, conative). We tried to persuade him from going up. It can be explained as genitive, but not so likely: We tried to persuade him in respect to not going up. Vincent cites the case of Regulus who insisted on returning from Rome to Carthage to certain death and that of Luther on the way to the Diet of Worms. Spalatin begged Luther not to go on. Luther said: "Though devils be as many in Worms as tiles upon the roofs, yet thither will I go." This dramatic warning of Agabus came on top of that in Tyre (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:4">Acts 21:4</span>) and Paul's own confession in Miletus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:23">Acts 20:23</span>). It is small wonder that Luke and the other messengers together with Philip and his daughters (prophetesses versus prophet?) joined in a chorus of dissuasion to Paul. </p>
