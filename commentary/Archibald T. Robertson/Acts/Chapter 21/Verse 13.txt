<p><b> What are you doing weeping? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ ποιειτε κλαιοντεσ?</span></span>) Strong protest as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:5">Mark 11:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>Breaking my heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνθρυπτοντες μου την καρδιαν</span></span>). The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνθρυπτω</span></span>, to crush together, is late <i>Koine</i> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποθρυπτω</span></span>, to break off, both vivid and expressive words. So to enervate and unman one, weakening Paul's determination to go on with his duty.</p>
<p><b>I am ready </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω ετοιμως εχω</span></span>). I hold (myself) in readiness (adverb, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετοιμως</span></span>). Same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:14">2 Corinthians 12:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Not only to be bound </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μονον δεθηνα</span></span>). First aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεω</span></span> and note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μονον</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη μονον</span></span>, the usual negative of the infinitive because of the sharp contrast (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1095). Paul's readiness to die, if need be, at Jerusalem is like that of Jesus on the way to Jerusalem the last time. Even before that Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:51">Acts 9:51</span>) said that "he set his face to go on to Jerusalem." Later the disciples will say to Jesus, "Master, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither?" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:8">John 11:8</span>). The stature of Paul rises here to heroic proportions "for the name of the Lord Jesus" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ του ονοματος του κυριου Ιησου</span></span>). </p>
