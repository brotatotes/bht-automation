<p><b> When he would not be persuaded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πειθομενου αυτου</span></span>). Genitive absolute of the present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθω</span></span>. Literally, "he not being persuaded." That was all. Paul's will (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρδια</span></span>) was not broken, not even bent.</p>
<p><b>We ceased </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησυχασαμεν</span></span>). Ingressive aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησυχαζω</span></span>, old verb to be quiet, silent.</p>
<p><b>The will of the Lord be done </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του κυριου το θελημα γινεσθω</span></span>). Present middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>. There is a quaint naivete in this confession by the friends of Paul. Since Paul would not let them have their way, they were willing for the Lord to have his way, acquiescence after failure to have theirs. </p>
