<p><b> Certain of the disciples </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των μαθητων</span></span>). The genitive here occurs with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινες</span></span> understood as often in the Greek idiom, the partitive genitive used as nominative (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 502).</p>
<p><b>Bringing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγοντες</span></span>). Nominative plural participle agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινες</span></span> understood, not with case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαθητων</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>One Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ ω ξενισθωμεν Μνασων τιν Κυπριω αρχαιω μαθητη</span></span>). A thoroughly idiomatic Greek idiom, incorporation and attraction of the antecedent into the relative clause (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 718). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μνασων</span></span> is really the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγοντες</span></span> or the accusative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> understood and should be accusative, but it is placed in the clause after the relative and in the same locative case with the relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω</span></span> (due to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ'</span></span>, beside, with). Then the rest agrees in case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μνασων</span></span>. He was originally from Cyprus, but now in Caesarea. The Codex Bezae adds <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τινα κωμην</span></span> (to a certain village) and makes it mean that they were to lodge with Mnason at his home there about halfway to Jerusalem. This may be true. The use of the subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξενισθωμεν</span></span> (first aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξενιζω</span></span>, to entertain strangers as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:6">Acts 10:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:23">Acts 10:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:32">Acts 10:32</span> already) may be volitive of purpose with the relative (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 955, 989). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχαιω</span></span> for "early" may refer to the fact that he was one of the original disciples at Pentecost as Peter in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:7">Acts 15:7</span> uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερων αρχαιων</span></span> (early days) to refer to his experience at Ceasarea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:10">Acts 21:10</span>. "As the number of the first disciples lessened, the next generation accorded a sort of honour to the survivors" (Furneaux). </p>
