 Certain of the disciples  (των μαθητων). The genitive here occurs with τινες understood as often in the Greek idiom, the partitive genitive used as nominative (Robertson, Grammar, p. 502).Bringing  (αγοντες). Nominative plural participle agreeing with τινες understood, not with case of μαθητων.One Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge  (παρ ω ξενισθωμεν Μνασων τιν Κυπριω αρχαιω μαθητη). A thoroughly idiomatic Greek idiom, incorporation and attraction of the antecedent into the relative clause (Robertson, Grammar, p. 718). Μνασων is really the object of αγοντες or the accusative with παρα or προς understood and should be accusative, but it is placed in the clause after the relative and in the same locative case with the relative ω (due to παρ', beside, with). Then the rest agrees in case with Μνασων. He was originally from Cyprus, but now in Caesarea. The Codex Bezae adds εις τινα κωμην (to a certain village) and makes it mean that they were to lodge with Mnason at his home there about halfway to Jerusalem. This may be true. The use of the subjunctive ξενισθωμεν (first aorist passive of ξενιζω, to entertain strangers as in Acts 10:6; Acts 10:23; Acts 10:32 already) may be volitive of purpose with the relative (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 955, 989). The use of αρχαιω for "early" may refer to the fact that he was one of the original disciples at Pentecost as Peter in Acts 15:7 uses ημερων αρχαιων (early days) to refer to his experience at Ceasarea in Acts 21:10. "As the number of the first disciples lessened, the next generation accorded a sort of honour to the survivors" (Furneaux).
