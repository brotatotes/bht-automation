<p><b> When we were come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενων ημων</span></span>). Genitive absolute again, "we having come."</p>
<p><b>Received </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεδεξαντο</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αποδεχομα</span></span>, to receive from. This old compound only in Luke in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Gladly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασμενως</span></span>). Old adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησμενως</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδομα</span></span>, to be pleased. Here only in the N.T. Perhaps this first glad welcome was from Paul's personal friends in Jerusalem. </p>
