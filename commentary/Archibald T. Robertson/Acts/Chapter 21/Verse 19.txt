<p><b> He rehearsed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηγειτο</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηγεομα</span></span>, old verb to lead out, to draw out in narrative, to recount. So Paul is pictured as taking his time for he had a great story to tell of what had happened since they saw him last.</p>
<p><b>One by one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθ' ενα εκαστον</span></span>). According to each one (item) and the adverbial phrase used as an accusative after the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηγειτο</span></span> as Demosthenes does (1265), though it could be like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθ' ενα εκαστος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:33">Ephesians 5:33</span>.</p>
<p><b>Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span>). Genitive attracted from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> (accusative) into the case of the unexpressed antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>God had wrought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποιησεν ο θεος</span></span>). Summary constative aorist active indicative that gathers up all that God did and he takes pains to give God the glory. It is possible that at this formal meeting Paul observed an absence of warmth and enthusiasm in contrast with the welcome accorded by his friends the day before (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:17">Acts 21:17</span>). Furneaux thinks that Paul was coldly received on this day in spite of the generous offering brought from the Gentile Christians. "It looks as though his misgiving as to its reception (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:31">Romans 15:31</span>) was confirmed. Nor do we hear that the Christians of Jerusalem later put in so much as a word on his behalf with either the Jewish or the Roman authorities, or expressed any sympathy with him during his long imprisonment at Caesarea" (Furneaux). The most that can be said is that the Judaizers referred to by James do not appear actively against him. The collection and the plan proposed by James accomplished that much at any rate. It stopped the mouths of those lions. </p>
