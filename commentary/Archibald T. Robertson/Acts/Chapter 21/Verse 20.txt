<p><b> Glorified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοξαζον</span></span>). Inchoative imperfect, began to glorify God, though without special praise of Paul.</p>
<p><b>How many thousands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποσα μυριαδες</span></span>). Old word for ten thousand (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:19">Acts 19:19</span>) and then an indefinite number like our "myriads" (this very word) as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:1">Luke 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:20">Acts 21:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:14">Judges 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:11">Revelation 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:16">Revelation 9:16</span>. But it is a surprising statement even with allowable hyperbole, but one may recall <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:4">Acts 4:4</span> (number of the men--not women--about five thousand); <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:14">Acts 5:14</span> (multitudes both of men and women); <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:7">Acts 6:7</span>. There were undoubtedly a great many thousands of believers in Jerusalem and all Jewish Christians, some, alas, Judaizers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:2">Acts 11:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:1">Acts 15:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:5">Acts 15:5</span>). This list may include the Christians from neighbouring towns in Palestine and even some from foreign countries here at the Feast of Pentecost, for it is probable that Paul arrived in time for it as he had hoped. But we do not have to count the hostile Jews from Asia (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:27">Acts 21:27</span>) who were clearly not Christians at all.</p>
<p><b>All zealous for the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντες ζηλωτα του νομου</span></span>). Zealots (substantive) rather than zealous (adjective) with objective genitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του νομου</span></span>). The word zealot is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλοω</span></span>, to burn with zeal, to boil. The Greek used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλωτης</span></span> for an imitator or admirer. There was a party of Zealots (developed from the Pharisees), a group of what would be called "hot-heads," who brought on the war with Rome. One of this party, Simon Zelotes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:13">Acts 1:13</span>), was in the number of the twelve apostles. It is important to understand the issues in Jerusalem. It was settled at the Jerusalem Conference (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:15">Acts 21:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:2">Acts 21:2</span>) that the Mosaic ceremonial law was not to be imposed upon Gentile Christians. Paul won freedom for them, but it was not said that it was wrong for Jewish Christians to go on observing it if they wished. We have seen Paul observing the passover in Philippi (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:6">Acts 20:6</span>) and planning to reach Jerusalem for Pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:16">Acts 20:16</span>). The Judaizers rankled under Paul's victory and power in spreading the gospel among the Gentiles and gave him great trouble in Galatia and Corinth. They were busy against him in Jerusalem also and it was to undo the harm done by them in Jerusalem that Paul gathered the great collection from the Gentile Christians and brought it with him and the delegates from the churches. Clearly then Paul had real ground for his apprehension of trouble in Jerusalem while still in Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:25">Romans 15:25</span>) when he asked for the prayers of the Roman Christians (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:30-32">Acts 21:30-32</span>). The repeated warnings along the way were amply justified. </p>
