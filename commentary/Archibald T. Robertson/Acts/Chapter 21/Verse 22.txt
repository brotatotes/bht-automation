<p><b> What is it therefore? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ ουν εστιν?</span></span>). See this form of question by Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:15">1 Corinthians 14:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:26">1 Corinthians 14:26</span>). What is to be done about it? Clearly James and the elders do not believe these misrepresentations of Paul's teaching, but many do.</p>
<p><b>They will certainly hear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντως ακουσοντα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παντως</span></span> is old adverb, by all means, altogether, wholly, certainly as here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:4">Acts 28:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:23">Luke 4:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:10">1 Corinthians 9:10</span>. This future middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span> is the usual form instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουσω</span></span>. There was no way to conceal Paul's arrival nor was it wise to do so. B C and several cursives omit <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε πληθος συνελθειν</span></span> (The multitude must needs come together). </p>
