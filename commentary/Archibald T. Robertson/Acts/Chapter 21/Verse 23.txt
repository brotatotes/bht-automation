<p><b> Do therefore this </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο ουν ποιησον</span></span>). The elders had thought out a plan of procedure by which Paul could set the whole matter straight.</p>
<p><b>We have </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισιν ημιν</span></span>). "There are to us" (dative of possession as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:10">Acts 18:10</span>). Apparently members of the Jerusalem church.</p>
<p><b>Which have a vow on them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχην εχοντες αφ'</span></span>-- or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφ' εαυτων</span></span>). Apparently a temporary Nazarite vow like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:1-21">Numbers 6:1-21</span> and its completion was marked by several offerings in the temple, the shaving of the head (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:13-15">Numbers 6:13-15</span>). Either Paul or Aquila had such a vow on leaving Cenchreae (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:18">Acts 18:18</span>). "It was considered a work of piety to relieve needy Jews from the expenses connected with this vow, as Paul does here" (Page). The reading <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφ' εαυτων</span></span> would mean that they had taken the vow voluntarily or of themselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:57">Luke 12:57</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:5">2 Corinthians 3:5</span>), while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφ' εαυτων</span></span> means that the vow lies on them still. </p>
