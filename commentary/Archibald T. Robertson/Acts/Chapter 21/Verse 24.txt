<p><b> These take </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτους παραλαβων</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαμβανω</span></span>. Taking these alone.</p>
<p><b>Purify thyself with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνισθητ συν αυτοις</span></span>). First aorist passive imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνιζω</span></span>, old verb to purify, to make pure (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνος</span></span>). See the active voice in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:8">James 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22">1 Peter 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span>. It is possible to see the full passive force here, "Be purified." But a number of aorist passives in the <i>Koine</i> supplant the aorist middle forms and preserve the force of the middle (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 819). That is possible here. Hence, "Purify thyself" is allowable. The word occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:1">Numbers 6:1</span> for taking the Nazarite vow. The point is that Paul takes the vow with them. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνισμου</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:26">Acts 21:26</span>.</p>
<p><b>Be at charges for them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαπανησον επ' αυτοις</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαπαναω</span></span>, to incur expense, expend. Spend (money) upon (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ'</span></span>) them. Ramsay (<i>St. Paul the Traveller</i>, etc., p. 310) argues that Paul had use of considerable money at this period, perhaps from his father's estate. The charges for five men would be considerable. "A poor man would not have been treated with the respect paid him at Caesarea, on the voyage, and at Rome" (Furneaux).</p>
<p><b>That they may shave their heads </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ξυρησοντα την κεφαλην</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την κεφαλην</span></span>, the head (singular). Future middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυραω</span></span>, late form for the old <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυρεω</span></span>, to shave, middle to shave oneself or (causative) to get oneself shaved. This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> with the future indicative is like the classic <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως</span></span> with the future indicative and is common in the N.T. as in the <i>Koine</i> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 984).</p>
<p><b>And all shall know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα γνωσοντα</span></span>). This future middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span> (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουσοντα</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:22">Acts 21:22</span>) may be independent of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> or dependent on it like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυρησοντα</span></span>, though some MSS. (H L P) have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωσιν</span></span> (second aorist subjunctive, clearly dependent on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Of which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span>). Genitive plural of the relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> (accusative) object of the perfect passive verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηχηντα</span></span> (cf. verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:21">Acts 21:21</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηχηθησαν</span></span>) attracted into the case of the omitted antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span>. The instruction still in effect.</p>
<p><b>But that thou thyself walkest orderly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα στοιχεις κα αυτος</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Στοιχεις</span></span> is an old verb to go in a row (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοιχος</span></span>, row, rank, series), to walk in a line or by rule. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:25">Galatians 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:12">Romans 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:16">Philippians 3:16</span>. The rule is the law and Paul was not a sidestepper. The idea of the verb is made plain by the participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλασσων τον νομον</span></span> (keeping or observing the law). </p>
