<p><b> We wrote </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεστειλαμεν</span></span>). First aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστελλω</span></span>, to send to and so to write like our epistle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστολη</span></span>). Old verb, but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:20">Acts 15:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:22">Hebrews 13:22</span>. It is the very word used by James in this "judgment" at the Conference (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:20">Acts 15:20</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστειλα</span></span>). B D here read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστειλαμεν</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστελλω</span></span>, to send away, to give orders. Wendt and Schuerer object to this as a gloss. Rather is it an explanation by James that he does not refer to the Gentile Christians whose freedom from the Mosaic ceremonial law was guaranteed at the Jerusalem Conference. James himself presided at that Conference and offered the resolution that was unanimously adopted. James stands by that agreement and repeats the main items (four: anything sacrificed to idols, blood, anything strangled, fornication, for discussion see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:15">Acts 21:15</span>) from which they are to keep themselves (direct middle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλασσεσθα</span></span> of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλασσω</span></span>, indirect command after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριναντες</span></span> with accusative, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτους</span></span>, of general reference). James has thus again cleared the air about the Gentiles who have believed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπιστευκοτων</span></span>, perfect active participle genitive plural of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>). He asks that Paul will stand by the right of Jewish Christians to keep on observing the Mosaic law. He has put the case squarely and fairly. </p>
