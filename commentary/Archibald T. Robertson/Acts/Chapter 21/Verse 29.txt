<p><b> For </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>). Luke adds the reason for the wild charges made against Paul.</p>
<p><b>They had before seen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν προεωρακοτες</span></span>). Periphrastic past perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προοραω</span></span>, old verb to see before, whether time or place. Only twice in the N.T., here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:25">Acts 2:25</span> quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+15:8">Psalms 15:8</span>. Note the double reduplication in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-εω-</span></span> as in Attic (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 364).</p>
<p><b>With him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τροφιμον τον Εφεσιον εν τη πολε συν αυτω</span></span>). The Jews from Asia (Ephesus) knew Trophimus by sight as well as Paul. One day they saw both of them together (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span>) in the city. That was a fact. They had just seized Paul in the temple (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερον</span></span>). That was another fact.</p>
<p><b>They supposed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενομιζον</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομιζω</span></span>, common to think or suppose. Perfectly harmless word, but they did, as so many people do, put their supposed inference on the same basis with the facts. They did not see Trophimus with Paul now in the temple, nor had they ever seen him there. They simply argued that, if Paul was willing to be seen down street with a Greek Christian, he would not hesitate to bring him (therefore, did bring him, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισηγαγεν</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:28">Acts 21:28</span>) into the temple, that is into the court of Israel and therefore both Paul and Trophimus were entitled to death, especially Paul who had brought him in (if he had) and, besides, they now had Paul. This is the way of the mob-mind in all ages. Many an innocent man has been rushed to his death by the fury of a lynching party. </p>
