Rather, There came a running together (συν-δρομη from συν-τρεχω) of the people.

Second aorist middle participle of επιλαμβανομα with the genitive (cf. επεβαλαν in verse Acts 21:27).Dragged  (ειλκον). Imperfect active of ελκω (and also ελκυω), old verb to drag or draw.

Curiously enough both επιλαβομενο and ειλκυσαν occur in Acts 16:19 about the arrest of Paul and Silas in Philippi.Straightway the doors were shut  (ευθεως εκλεισθησαν α θυρα). With a bang and at once. First aorist (effective) passive of κλειω. The doors between the inner court and the court of the Gentiles.
