<p><b> As they were seeking to kill him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητουντων αυτων</span></span>). Genitive absolute of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητεω</span></span>, to seek, without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτων</span></span> (they). This was their real purpose.</p>
<p><b>Tidings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φασις</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαινω</span></span>, to show. Old word for the work of informers and then the exposure of secret crime. In LXX. Here only in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Came up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεβη</span></span>). Naturally in the wild uproar. The Roman guard during festivals was kept stationed in the Tower of Antonia at the northwest corner of the temple overlooking the temple and connected by stairs (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:35">Acts 21:35</span>).</p>
<p><b>To the chief captain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω χιλιαρχω</span></span>). Commander of a thousand men or cohort (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:16">Mark 15:16</span>). His name was Claudius Lysias.</p>
<p><b>Of the band </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της σπειρης</span></span>). Each legion had six tribunes and so each tribune (chiliarch) had a thousand if the cohort had its full quota. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1">Acts 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:1">Acts 27:1</span>. The word is the Latin <i>spira</i> (anything rolled up). Note the genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπειρης</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπειρας</span></span> (Attic).</p>
<p><b>Was in confusion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνχυννετα</span></span>). Present passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνχυννω</span></span> (see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:27">Acts 21:27</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεχεον</span></span>). This is what the conspirators had desired. </p>
