 Came near  (εγγισας). First aorist active participle of εγγιζω, to draw near, Koine verb from εγγυς, near, and common in the N.T.Laid hold on him  (επελαβετο αντου). See same verb in verse Acts 21:30.To be bound  (δεθηνα). First aorist passive infinitive of δεω (see verse Acts 21:11).With two chains  (αλυσεσ δυσ). Instrumental case of αλυσις, old word from α privative and λυω (not loosing, i.e. chaining). With two chains as a violent and seditious person, probably leader of a band of assassins (verse Acts 21:38). See on Mark 5:4.Inquired  (επυνθανετο). Imperfect middle of πυνθανομα, old and common verb used mainly by Luke in the N.T. Lysias repeated his inquiries.Who he was  (τις ειη). Present active optative of ειμ changed from εστιν (present indicative) in the indirect question, a change not obligatory after a past tense, but often done in the older Greek, rare in the N.T. (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1043f.).And what he had done  (κα τ εστιν πεποιηκως). Periphrastic perfect active indicative of ποιεω here retained, not changed to the optative as is true of ειη from εστιν in the same indirect question, illustrating well the freedom about it.
