<p><b> May I say something unto thee? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ε εξεστιν μο ειπειν τ προς σε?</span></span>). On this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> in a direct question see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:6">Acts 1:6</span>. The calm self-control of Paul in the presence of this mob is amazing. His courteous request to Lysias was in Greek to the chiliarch's amazement.</p>
<p><b>Dost thou know Greek? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hελληνιστ γινωσκεισ?</span></span>). Old Greek adverb in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hελληνιζω</span></span>, meaning "in Greek." "Do you know it in Greek?" In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:20">John 19:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>Art thou not then the Egyptian? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ουκ αρα συ ε ο Αιγυπτιοσ?</span></span>). Expects the answer <i>Yes</i> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα</span></span> argues the matter (therefore). The well-known (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span>) Egyptian who had given the Romans so much trouble.</p>
<p><b>Stirred up to sedition </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστατωσας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστατοω</span></span>, a late verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστατος</span></span>, outcast, and so to unsettle, to stir up, to excite, once known only in LXX and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:6">Acts 17:6</span> (which see); <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:38">Acts 21:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:12">Galatians 5:12</span>, but now found in several papyri examples with precisely this sense to upset.</p>
<p><b>Of the Assassins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των σικαριων</span></span>). Latin word <i>sicarius</i>, one who carried a short sword <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σιχα</span></span> under his cloak, a cutthroat. Josephus uses this very word for bands of robbers under this Egyptian (<i>War</i> II. 17,6 and 13,5; <i>Ant</i>. XX. 8,10). Josephus says that there were 30,000 who gathered on the Mount of Olives to see the walls of Jerusalem fall down and not merely 4,000 as Lysias does here. But Lysias may refer to the group that were armed thus (banditti) the core of the mob of 30,000. Lysias at once saw by Paul's knowledge of Greek that he was not the famous Egyptian who led the Assassins and escaped himself when Felix attacked and slew the most of them. </p>
