 I am  (Εγω μεν ειμ). In contrast with the wild guess of Lysias Paul uses μεν and δε. He tells briefly who he is:a Jew  (Ιουδαιος) by race,of Tarsus in Cilicia  (Ταρσευς της Κιλικιας) by country, belonging to Tarsus (this adjective Ταρσευς only here and Acts 9:11), and proud of it, one of the great cities of the empire with a great university.A citizen of no mean city  (ουκ ασημου πολεως πολιτης). Litotes again, "no mean" (ασημος, old adjective, unmarked, α privative and σημα, mark, insignificant, here only in the N.T.). This same litotes used by Euripides of Athens (Ion 8). But Paul calls himself a citizen (πολιτης) of Tarsus. Note the "effective assonance" (Page) in πολεως πολιτης. Paul now (δε) makes his request (δεομα) of Lysias.Give me leave  (επιτρεψον μο). First aorist active imperative of επιτρεπω, old and common verb to turn to, to permit, to allow. It was a strange request and a daring one, to wish to speak to this mob howling for Paul's blood.
