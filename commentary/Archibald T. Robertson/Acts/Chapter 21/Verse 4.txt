<p><b> Having found </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανευροντες</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανευρισκω</span></span>, to seek for, to find by searching (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα</span></span>). There was a church here, but it was a large city and the number of members may not have been large. Probably some of those that fled from Jerusalem who came to Phoenicia (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span>) started the work here. Paul went also through Phoenicia on the way to the Jerusalem Conference (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:3">Acts 15:3</span>). As at Troas and Miletus, so here Paul's indefatigible energy shows itself with characteristic zeal.</p>
<p><b>Through the Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του πνευματος</span></span>). The Holy Spirit undoubtedly who had already told Paul that bonds and afflictions awaited him in Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:23">Acts 20:23</span>).</p>
<p><b>That he should not set foot in Jerusalem </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη επιβαινειν εις Ιεροσολυμα</span></span>). Indirect command with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the present active infinitive, not to keep on going to Jerusalem (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1046). In spite of this warning Paul felt it his duty as before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:22">Acts 20:22</span>) to go on. Evidently Paul interpreted the action of the Holy Spirit as information and warning although the disciples at Tyre gave it the form of a prohibition. Duty called louder than warning to Paul even if both were the calls of God. </p>
