<p><b> That we had accomplished the days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαρτισα ημας τας ημερας</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαρτιζω</span></span>, to furnish perfectly, rare in ancient writers, but fairly frequent in the papyri. Only twice in the N.T., here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:17">2 Timothy 3:17</span>. Finish the exact number of days (seven) of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:4">Acts 21:4</span>. The accusative of general reference <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημας</span></span> is the usual construction and the infinitive clause is the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span>. We departed and went on our journey (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξελθοντες επορευομεθα</span></span>). Sharp distinction between the first aorist active participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξελθοντες</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξερχομα</span></span>, to go out) and the imperfect middle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επορευομεθα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορευω</span></span> (we were going on).</p>
<p><b>And they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προπεμποντων ημας παντων συν γυναιξ κα τεκνοις</span></span>). No "and" in the Greek, simply genitive absolute, "They all with wives and children accompanying us," just as at Miletus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>), same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προπεμπω</span></span> which see. The first mention of children in connection with the apostolic churches (Vincent). Vivid picture here as at Miletus, evident touch of an eyewitness.</p>
<p><b>Till we were out of the city </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως εξω της πολεως</span></span>). Note both adverbial prepositions (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως εξω</span></span>) clear outside of the city. </p>
