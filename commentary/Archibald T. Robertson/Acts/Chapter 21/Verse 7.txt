<p><b> Had finished </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διανυσαντες</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διανυω</span></span>, old verb to accomplish (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανυω</span></span>) thoroughly (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>), only here in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>From Tyre </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο Τυρου</span></span>). Page takes (Hackett also) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηντησαμεν</span></span> (we arrived) rather than with "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον πλουν</span></span>" (the voyage) and with good reason: "And we, having (thereby) finished the voyage, arrived from Tyre at Ptolemais." Ptolemais is the modern Acre, called Accho in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:31">Judges 1:31</span>. The harbour is the best on the coast of Palestine and is surrounded by mountains. It is about thirty miles south of Tyre. It was never taken by Israel and was considered a Philistine town and the Greeks counted it a Phoenician city. It was the key to the road down the coast between Syria and Egypt and had successively the rule of the Ptolemies, Syrians, Romans.</p>
<p><b>Saluted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασπασαμενο</span></span>). Here greeting as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:19">Acts 21:19</span> rather than farewell as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:1">Acts 20:1</span>. The stay was short, one day (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεραν μιαν</span></span>, accusative), but "the brethren" Paul and his party found easily. Possibly the scattered brethren (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span>) founded the church here or Philip may have done it. </p>
