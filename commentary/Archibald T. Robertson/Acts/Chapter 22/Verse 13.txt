<p><b> I looked up on him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβλεψα εις αυτον</span></span>). First aorist active indicative and same word as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβλεψον</span></span> (Receive thy sight). Hence here the verb means as the margin of the Revised Version has it: "I received my sight and looked upon him." For "look up" see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:11">John 9:11</span>. </p>
