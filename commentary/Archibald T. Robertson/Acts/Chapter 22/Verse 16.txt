<p><b> By baptized </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισα</span></span>). First aorist middle (causative), not passive, Get thyself baptized (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 808). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:2">1 Corinthians 10:2</span>. Submit yourself to baptism. So as to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολουσα</span></span>, Get washed off as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span>. It is possible, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span>, to take these words as teaching baptismal remission or salvation by means of baptism, but to do so is in my opinion a complete subversion of Paul's vivid and picturesque language. As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4-6">Romans 6:4-6</span> where baptism is the picture of death, burial and resurrection, so here baptism pictures the change that had already taken place when Paul surrendered to Jesus on the way (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:10">Acts 22:10</span>). Baptism here pictures the washing away of sins by the blood of Christ. </p>
