<p><b> He spake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεφωνε</span></span>). Imperfect active, was speaking. See aorist active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεφωνησεν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:40">Acts 21:40</span>.</p>
<p><b>They were the more quiet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλλον παρεσχον ησυχιαν</span></span>). Literally, The more (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλλον</span></span>) they furnished or supplied (second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεχω</span></span>) quietness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησυχιαν</span></span>, old word, in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:12">2 Thessalonians 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:11">1 Timothy 2:11</span>). Precisely this idiom occurs in Plutarch (<i>Cor</i>. 18) and the LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+34:29">Job 34:29</span>). Knowling notes the fondness of Luke for words of silence (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σιγη, σιγαω, ησυχαζω</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:4">Luke 14:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:26">Luke 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:18">Acts 11:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:17">Acts 12:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:12">Acts 15:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:14">Acts 21:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:40">Acts 21:40</span>. It is a vivid picture of the sudden hush that swept over the vast mob under the spell of the Aramaic. They would have understood Paul's <i>Koine</i> Greek, but they much preferred the Aramaic. It was a masterstroke. </p>
