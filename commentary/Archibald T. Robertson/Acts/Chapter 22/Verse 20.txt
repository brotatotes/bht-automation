<p><b> Was shed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεχυννετο</span></span>). Imperfect passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκχυννω</span></span> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:35">Matthew 23:35</span>), was being shed.</p>
<p><b>Witness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρος</span></span>). And "martyr" also as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:13">Revelation 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:6">Revelation 17:6</span>. Transition state for the word here.</p>
<p><b>I also was standing by </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αυτος ημην εφεστως</span></span>). Periphrastic second past perfect in form, but imperfect (linear) in sense since <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστωσ=ισταμενος</span></span> (intransitive).</p>
<p><b>Consenting </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνευδοκων</span></span>). The very word used by Luke in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span> about Paul. <i>Koine</i> word for being pleased at the same time with (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:48">Luke 11:48</span>). Paul adds here the item of "guarding the clothes of those who were slaying (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναιρουντων</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:32">Luke 23:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:2">Acts 12:2</span>) him" (Stephen). Paul recalls the very words of protest used by him to Jesus. He did not like the idea of running away to save his own life right where he had helped slay Stephen. He is getting on dangerous ground. </p>
