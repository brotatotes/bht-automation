 Was shed  (εξεχυννετο). Imperfect passive of εκχυννω (see on Matthew 23:35), was being shed.Witness  (μαρτυρος). And "martyr" also as in Revelation 2:13; Revelation 17:6. Transition state for the word here.I also was standing by  (κα αυτος ημην εφεστως). Periphrastic second past perfect in form, but imperfect (linear) in sense since εστωσ=ισταμενος (intransitive).Consenting  (συνευδοκων). The very word used by Luke in Acts 8:1 about Paul. Koine word for being pleased at the same time with (cf. Luke 11:48). Paul adds here the item of "guarding the clothes of those who were slaying (αναιρουντων as in Luke 23:32; Acts 12:2) him" (Stephen). Paul recalls the very words of protest used by him to Jesus. He did not like the idea of running away to save his own life right where he had helped slay Stephen. He is getting on dangerous ground.
