<p><b> They gave him audience </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουον</span></span>). Imperfect active, they kept on listening, at least with respectful attention.</p>
<p><b>Unto this word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ τουτου του λογου</span></span>). But "this word" was like a spark in a powder magazine or a torch to an oil tank. The explosion of pent-up indignation broke out instantly worse than at first (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:30">Acts 21:30</span>).</p>
<p><b>Away with such a fellow from the earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αιρε απο της γης τον τοιουτον</span></span>). They renew the cry with the very words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:36">Acts 21:36</span>, but with "from the earth" for vehemence.</p>
<p><b>For it is not fit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γαρ καθηκεν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθηκω</span></span>, old verb to come down to, to become, to fit. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</span>. The imperfect is a neat Greek idiom for impatience about an obligation: It was not fitting, he ought to have been put to death long ago. The obligation is conceived as not lived up to like our "ought" (past of owe). See Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 886. </p>
