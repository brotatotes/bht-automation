 As they cried out  (κραυγαζοντων αυτων). Genitive absolute with present active participle of κραυγαζω, a rare word in the old Greek from κραυγη (a cry). See on Matthew 12:19. Two other genitive absolutes here, ριπτουντων (throwing off, present active participle, frequent active variation of ριπτω) and βαλλοντων (present active participle of βαλλω, flinging). These present participles give a lively picture of the uncontrolled excitement of the mob in their spasm of wild rage.
