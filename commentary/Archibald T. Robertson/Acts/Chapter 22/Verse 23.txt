<p><b> As they cried out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραυγαζοντων αυτων</span></span>). Genitive absolute with present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραυγαζω</span></span>, a rare word in the old Greek from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραυγη</span></span> (a cry). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:19">Matthew 12:19</span>. Two other genitive absolutes here, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ριπτουντων</span></span> (throwing off, present active participle, frequent active variation of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ριπτω</span></span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλοντων</span></span> (present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλω</span></span>, flinging). These present participles give a lively picture of the uncontrolled excitement of the mob in their spasm of wild rage. </p>
