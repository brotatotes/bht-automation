 That he be examined by scourging  (μαστιξιν ανεταζεσθα αυτον). The present passive infinitive of ανεταζω in indirect command after ειπας (bidding). This verb does not occur in the old Greek (which used εξεταζω as in Matthew 2:8), first in the LXX, in the N.T. only here and verse Acts 22:29, but Milligan and Moulton's Vocabulary quotes an Oxyrhynchus papyrus of A.D. 127 which has a prefect using the word directing government clerks to "examine" (ανεταζειν) documents and glue them together into volumes (τομο). The word was evidently in use for such purposes. It was a kind of "third degree" applied to Paul by the use of scourges (μαστιξιν), instrumental plural of μαστιξ, old word for whip, as in Hebrews 11:36. But this way of beginning an inquiry by torture (inquisition) was contrary to Roman law (Page): Non esse a tormentis incipiendum, Divus Augustus statuit.That he might know  (ινα επιγνω). Final clause with ινα and second aorist active subjunctive of επιγνωσκω (full knowledge). Lysias was as much in the dark as ever, for Paul's speech had been in Aramaic and this second explosion was a mystery to him like the first.They so shouted  (ουτος επεφωνουν). Imperfect active progressive imperfect had been so shouting.
