<p><b> That he be examined by scourging </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαστιξιν ανεταζεσθα αυτον</span></span>). The present passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεταζω</span></span> in indirect command after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπας</span></span> (bidding). This verb does not occur in the old Greek (which used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεταζω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:8">Matthew 2:8</span>), first in the LXX, in the N.T. only here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:29">Acts 22:29</span>, but Milligan and Moulton's <i>Vocabulary</i> quotes an Oxyrhynchus papyrus of A.D. 127 which has a prefect using the word directing government clerks to "examine" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεταζειν</span></span>) documents and glue them together into volumes (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τομο</span></span>). The word was evidently in use for such purposes. It was a kind of "third degree" applied to Paul by the use of scourges (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαστιξιν</span></span>), instrumental plural of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαστιξ</span></span>, old word for whip, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:36">Hebrews 11:36</span>. But this way of beginning an inquiry by torture (inquisition) was contrary to Roman law (Page): <i>Non esse a tormentis incipiendum, Divus Augustus statuit</i>.</p>
<p><b>That he might know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα επιγνω</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγνωσκω</span></span> (full knowledge). Lysias was as much in the dark as ever, for Paul's speech had been in Aramaic and this second explosion was a mystery to him like the first.</p>
<p><b>They so shouted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος επεφωνουν</span></span>). Imperfect active progressive imperfect had been so shouting. </p>
