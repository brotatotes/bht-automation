<p><b> When they had tied him up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος προετειναν αυτον</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προτεινω</span></span>, old verb to stretch forward, only here in the N.T. Literally, "When they stretched him forward."</p>
<p><b>With the thongs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις ιμασιν</span></span>). If the instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιμας</span></span>, old word for strap or thong (for sandals as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:7">Mark 1:7</span>, or for binding criminals as here), then Paul was bent forward and tied by the thongs to a post in front to expose his back the better to the scourges. But <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις ιμασιν</span></span> may be dative case and then it would mean "for the lashes." In either case it is a dreadful scene of terrorizing by the chiliarch.</p>
<p><b>Unto the centurion that stood by </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τον εστωτα εκατονταρχον</span></span>). He was simply carrying out the orders of the chiliarch (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:54">Matthew 27:54</span>). Why had not Paul made protest before this?</p>
<p><b>Is it lawful? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε εξεστιν?</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> in indirect questions we have had before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:6">Acts 1:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>A Roman and uncondemned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ρομαιον κα ακατακριτον</span></span>). Just as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:37">Acts 16:37</span> which see. Blass says of Paul's question: <i>Interrogatio subironica est confidentiae plena</i>. </p>
