If the instrumental case of ιμας, old word for strap or thong (for sandals as Mark 1:7, or for binding criminals as here), then Paul was bent forward and tied by the thongs to a post in front to expose his back the better to the scourges. But τοις ιμασιν may be dative case and then it would mean "for the lashes." In either case it is a dreadful scene of terrorizing by the chiliarch.Unto the centurion that stood by  (προς τον εστωτα εκατονταρχον). He was simply carrying out the orders of the chiliarch (cf. Matthew 27:54). Why had not Paul made protest before this?Is it lawful?  (ε εξεστιν?). This use of ε in indirect questions we have had before (Acts 1:6).A Roman and uncondemned  (Ρομαιον κα ακατακριτον). Just as in Acts 16:37 which see. Blass says of Paul's question: Interrogatio subironica est confidentiae plena.
