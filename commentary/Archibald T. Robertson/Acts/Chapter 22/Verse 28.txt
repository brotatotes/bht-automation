<p><b> With a great sum </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλου κεφαλαιου</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφαλαιου</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφαλη</span></span>, head) for sums of money (principal as distinct from interest) is old and frequent in the papyri. Our word capital is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαπυτ</span></span> (head). The genitive is used here according to rule for price. "The sale of the Roman citizenship was resorted to by the emperors as a means of filling the exchequer, much as James I. made baronets" (Page). Dio Cassius (LX., 17) tells about Messalina the wife of Claudius selling Roman citizenship. Lysias was probably a Greek and so had to buy his citizenship.</p>
<p><b>But I am a Roman born </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω δε κα γεγεννημα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενναω</span></span>. The word "Roman" not in the Greek. Literally, "But I have been even born one," (i.e. born a Roman citizen). There is calm and simple dignity in this reply and pardonable pride. Being a citizen of Tarsus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:39">Acts 21:39</span>) did not make Paul a Roman citizen. Tarsus was an <i>urbs libera</i>, not a <i>colonia</i> like Philippi. Some one of his ancestors (father, grandfather) obtained it perhaps as a reward for distinguished service. Paul's family was of good social position. "He was educated by the greatest of the Rabbis; he was at an early age entrusted by the Jewish authorities with an important commission; his nephew could gain ready access to the Roman tribune; he was treated as a person of consequence by Felix, Festus, Agrippa, and Julius" (Furneaux). </p>
