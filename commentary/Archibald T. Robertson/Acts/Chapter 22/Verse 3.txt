<p><b> I am a Jew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω ειμ ανηρ Ιουδαιος</span></span>). Note use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω</span></span> for emphasis. Paul recounts his Jewish advantages or privileges with manifest pride as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:4">Acts 26:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:22">2 Corinthians 11:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:14">Galatians 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:4-7">Philippians 3:4-7</span>.</p>
<p><b>Born </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγεννημενος</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενναω</span></span>. See above in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:39">Acts 21:39</span> for the claim of Tarsus as his birth-place. He was a Hellenistic Jew, not an Aramaean Jew (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>Brought up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανατεθραμμενος</span></span>). Perfect passive participle again of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανατρεφω</span></span>, to nurse up, to nourish up, common old verb, but in the N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:20">Acts 7:20</span>, and MSS. in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:16">Luke 4:16</span>. The implication is that Paul was sent to Jerusalem while still young, "from my youth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:4">Acts 26:4</span>), how young we do not know, possibly thirteen or fourteen years old. He apparently had not seen Jesus in the flesh (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:16">2 Corinthians 5:16</span>).</p>
<p><b>At the feet of Gamaliel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τους ποδας Γαμαλιηλ</span></span>). The rabbis usually sat on a raised seat with the pupils in a circle around either on lower seats or on the ground. Paul was thus nourished in Pharisaic Judaism as interpreted by Gamaliel, one of the lights of Judaism. For remarks on Gamaliel see chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:34">Acts 5:34</span>. He was one of the seven Rabbis to whom the Jews gave the highest title <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ραββαν</span></span> (our Rabbi). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ραββ</span></span> (my teacher) was next, the lowest being <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ραβ</span></span> (teacher). "As Aquinas among the schoolmen was called <i>Doctor Angelicus</i>, and Bonaventura <i>Doctor Seraphicus</i>, so Gamaliel was called <i>the Beauty of the Law</i>" (Conybeare and Howson).</p>
<p><b>Instructed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπαιδευμενος</span></span>). Perfect passive participle again (each participle beginning a clause), this time of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδευω</span></span>, old verb to train a child (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παις</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:22">Acts 7:22</span> which see. In this sense also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20">1 Timothy 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:12">Titus 2:12</span>. Then to chastise as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:16">Luke 23:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:22">Luke 23:22</span> (which see); <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:25">2 Timothy 2:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:6">Hebrews 12:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>According to the strict manner </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα ακριβειαν</span></span>). Old word, only here in N.T. Mathematical accuracy, minute exactness as seen in the adjective in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:5">Acts 26:5</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:2">Romans 10:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:4">Galatians 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:4-7">Philippians 3:4-7</span>.</p>
<p><b>Of our fathers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατρωιου</span></span>). Old adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατερ</span></span>, only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:14">Acts 24:14</span> in N.T. Means descending from father to son, especially property and other inherited privileges. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πατρικος</span></span> (patrician) refers more to personal attributes and affiliations.</p>
<p><b>Being zealous for God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλωτης υπαρχων του θεου</span></span>). Not adjective, but substantive</p>
<p><b>zealot </b> (same word used by James of the thousands of Jewish Christians in Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:20">Acts 21:20</span> which see) with objective genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θεου</span></span> (for God). See also verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:17">Acts 28:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:3">2 Timothy 1:3</span> where he makes a similar claim. So did Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:13">Acts 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:30">Acts 5:30</span>) and Stephen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:32">Acts 7:32</span>). Paul definitely claims, whatever freedom he demanded for Gentile Christians, to be personally "a zealot for God" "even as ye all are this day" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως παντες υμεις εστε σημερον</span></span>). In his conciliation he went to the limit and puts himself by the side of the mob in their zeal for the law, mistaken as they were about him. He was generous surely to interpret their fanatical frenzy as zeal for God. But Paul is sincere as he proceeds to show by appeal to his own conduct. </p>
