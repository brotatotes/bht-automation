<p><b> To know the certainty </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωνα το ασφαλες</span></span>). Same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:34">Acts 21:34</span> which see.</p>
<p><b>Wherefore he was accused </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το τ κατεγορειτα</span></span>). Epexegetical after to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασφαλες</span></span>. Note article (accusative case) with the indirect question here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:1">Luke 22:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:23">Luke 22:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:24">Luke 22:24</span> (which see), a neat idiom in the Greek.</p>
<p><b>Commanded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκελευσεν</span></span>). So the Sanhedrin had to meet, but in the Tower of Antonia, for he brought Paul down (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταγαγων</span></span>, second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταγω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Set him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστησεν</span></span>). First aorist active (transitive) indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>, not the intransitive second aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστη</span></span>. Lysias is determined to find out the truth about Paul, more puzzled than ever by the important discovery that he has a Roman citizen on his hands in this strange prisoner. </p>
