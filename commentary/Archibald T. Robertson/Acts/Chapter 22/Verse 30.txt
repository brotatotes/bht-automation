 To know the certainty  (γνωνα το ασφαλες). Same idiom in Acts 21:34 which see.Wherefore he was accused  (το τ κατεγορειτα). Epexegetical after to ασφαλες. Note article (accusative case) with the indirect question here as in Luke 22:1; Luke 22:23; Luke 22:24 (which see), a neat idiom in the Greek.Commanded  (εκελευσεν). So the Sanhedrin had to meet, but in the Tower of Antonia, for he brought Paul down (καταγαγων, second aorist active participle of καταγω).Set him  (εστησεν). First aorist active (transitive) indicative of ιστημ, not the intransitive second aorist εστη. Lysias is determined to find out the truth about Paul, more puzzled than ever by the important discovery that he has a Roman citizen on his hands in this strange prisoner.
