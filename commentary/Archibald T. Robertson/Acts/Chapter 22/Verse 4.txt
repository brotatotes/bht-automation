<p><b> And I </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span>).</p>

<p><b>Unto the death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ θανατου</span></span>). Unto death, actual death of many as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span> shows.</p>

But it showed the lengths to which Paul went in his zeal for Judaism. </p>
