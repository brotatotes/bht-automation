 And it came to pass  (εγενετο δε). Rather than the common κα εγενετο and with the infinitive (περιαστραψα), one of the three constructions with κα (δε) εγενετο by Luke (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1042f.), followed by κα, by finite verb, by subject infinitive as here.As I made my journey  (μο πορευομενω). To me (dative after εγενετο, happened to me) journeying (participle agreeing with μο). See this same idiom in verse Acts 22:17. Luke uses εγενετο δε seventeen times in the gospel and twenty-one in the Acts.Unto Damascus  (τη Δαμασκω). Dative after εγγιζοντ (drawing nigh to).About noon  (περ μεσημβριαν). Mid (μεσος) day (ημερα), old word, in the N.T. only here and Acts 8:26 which see where it may mean "toward the south." An item not in ch. 9.Shone round about me  (περιαστραψα περ εμε). First aorist active infinitive of περιαστραπτω, to flash around, in LXX and late Greek, in the N.T. only here and Acts 9:3 which see. Note repetition of περ.A great light  (φως ικανον). Luke's favourite word ικανον (considerable). Accusative of general reference with the infinitive.
