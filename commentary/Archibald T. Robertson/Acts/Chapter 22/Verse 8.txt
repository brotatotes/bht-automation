 Of Nazareth  (ο Ναζωραιος). The Nazarene, not in Acts 9:5; Acts 26:15 and here because Jesus is mentioned now for the first time in the address. The form Ναζωραιος as in Matthew 2:23 (which see) is used also in Acts 24:5 for the followers of Jesus instead of Ναζαρηνος as in Mark 1:24, etc. (which see).
