<p><b> But they heard not the voice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την δε φωνην ουκ ηκουσαν</span></span>). The accusative here may be used rather than the genitive as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:7">Acts 22:7</span> to indicate that those with Paul did not understand what they heard (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</span>) just as they beheld the light (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:9">Acts 22:9</span>), but did not see Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</span>). The difference in cases allows this distinction, though it is not always observed as just noticed about <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</span>. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span> is used in the sense of understand (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:33">Mark 4:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:2">1 Corinthians 14:2</span>). It is one of the evidences of the genuineness of this report of Paul's speech that Luke did not try to smooth out apparent discrepancies in details between the words of Paul and his own record already in ch. 9. The Textus Receptus adds in this verse: "And they became afraid" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εμφοβο εγενοντο</span></span>). Clearly not genuine. </p>
