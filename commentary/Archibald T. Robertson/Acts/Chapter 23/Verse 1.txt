<p><b> Looking steadfastly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατενισας</span></span>). See on this word <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:10">Acts 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:12">Acts 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:15">Acts 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:55">Acts 7:55</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:9">Acts 13:9</span>. Paul may have had weak eyes, but probably the earnest gaze was to see if he recognized any faces that were in the body that tried Stephen and to which he apparently once belonged.</p>
<p><b>I have lived before God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπολιτευμα τω θεω</span></span>). Perfect middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολιτευω</span></span>, old verb to manage affairs of city (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολις</span></span>) or state, to be a citizen, behave as a citizen. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:27">Philippians 1:27</span>. The idea of citizenship was Greek and Roman, not Jewish. "He had lived as God's citizen, as a member of God's commonwealth" (Rackham). God (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεω</span></span>) is the dative of personal interest. As God looked at it and in his relation to God.</p>
<p><b>In all good conscience unto this day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παση συνειδησε αγαθη αχρ ταυτης της ημερας</span></span>). This claim seems to lack tact, but for brevity's sake Paul sums up a whole speech in it. He may have said much more than Luke here reports along the line of his speech the day before, but Paul did not make this claim without consideration. It appears to contradict his confession as the chief of sinners (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:13-16">1 Timothy 1:13-16</span>). But that depends on one's interpretation of "good conscience." The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνειδησις</span></span> is literally "joint-knowledge" in Greek, Latin (<i>conscientia</i>) and English "conscience" from the Latin. It is a late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνοιδα</span></span>, to know together, common in O.T., Apocrypha, Philo, Plutarch, New Testament, Stoics, ecclesiastical writers. In itself the word simply means consciousness of one's own thoughts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:2">Hebrews 10:2</span>), or of one's own self, then consciousness of the distinction between right and wrong (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:15">Romans 2:15</span>) with approval or disapproval. But the conscience is not an infallible guide and acts according to the light that it has (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7">1 Corinthians 8:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:10">1 Corinthians 8:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:19">1 Peter 2:19</span>). The conscience can be contaminated (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:22">Hebrews 10:22</span>, evil <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονηρας</span></span>). All this and more must be borne in mind in trying to understand Paul's description of his motives as a persecutor. Alleviation of his guilt comes thereby, but not removal of guilt as he himself felt (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:13-16">1 Timothy 1:13-16</span>). He means to say to the Sanhedrin that he persecuted Christians as a conscientious (though mistaken) Jew (Pharisee) just as he followed his conscience in turning from Judaism to Christianity. It is a pointed disclaimer against the charge that he is a renegade Jew, an opposer of the law, the people, the temple. Paul addresses the Sanhedrin as an equal and has no "apologies" (in our sense) to make for his career as a whole. The golden thread of consistency runs through, as a good citizen in God's commonwealth. He had the consolation of a good conscience (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:16">1 Peter 3:16</span>). The word does not occur in the Gospels and chiefly in Paul's Epistles, but we see it at work in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:9">John 8:9</span> (the interpolation <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:53-8">Acts 7:53-8</span>). </p>
