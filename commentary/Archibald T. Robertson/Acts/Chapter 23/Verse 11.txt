<p><b> The night following </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη επιουση νυκτ</span></span>). Locative case, on the next (following) night.</p>
<p><b>The Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κυριος</span></span>). Jesus. Paul never needed Jesus more than now. On a previous occasion the whole church prayed for Peter's release (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:5">Acts 12:5</span>), but Paul clearly had no such grip on the church as that, though he had been kindly welcomed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:18">Acts 21:18</span>). In every crisis Jesus appears to him (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:9">Acts 18:9</span>). It looked dark for Paul till Jesus spoke. Once before in Jerusalem Jesus spoke words of cheer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:18">Acts 22:18</span>). Then he was told to leave Jerusalem. Now he is to have "cheer" or "courage" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαρσε</span></span>). Jesus used this very word to others (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:2">Matthew 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:22">Matthew 9:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:49">Mark 10:49</span>). It is a brave word.</p>
<p><b>Thou hast testified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεμαρτυρω</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative second person singular of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαμαρτυρομα</span></span>, strong word (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:18">Acts 22:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>Must thou </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σε δε</span></span>). That is the needed word and on this Paul leans. His hopes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:21">Acts 19:21</span>) of going to Rome will not be in vain. He can bide Christ's time now. And Jesus has approved his witness in Jerusalem. </p>
