 The night following  (τη επιουση νυκτ). Locative case, on the next (following) night.The Lord  (ο κυριος). Jesus. Paul never needed Jesus more than now. On a previous occasion the whole church prayed for Peter's release (Acts 12:5), but Paul clearly had no such grip on the church as that, though he had been kindly welcomed (Acts 21:18). In every crisis Jesus appears to him (cf. Acts 18:9). It looked dark for Paul till Jesus spoke. Once before in Jerusalem Jesus spoke words of cheer (Acts 22:18). Then he was told to leave Jerusalem. Now he is to have "cheer" or "courage" (θαρσε). Jesus used this very word to others (Matthew 9:2; Matthew 9:22; Mark 10:49). It is a brave word.Thou hast testified  (διεμαρτυρω). First aorist middle indicative second person singular of διαμαρτυρομα, strong word (see on Acts 22:18).Must thou  (σε δε). That is the needed word and on this Paul leans. His hopes (Acts 19:21) of going to Rome will not be in vain. He can bide Christ's time now. And Jesus has approved his witness in Jerusalem.
