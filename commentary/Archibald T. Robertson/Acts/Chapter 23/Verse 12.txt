<p><b> Banded together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησαντες συστροφην</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:40">Acts 19:40</span> (riot), but here conspiracy, secret combination, binding together like twisted cords.</p>
<p><b>Bound themselves under a curse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεθεματισαν εαυτους</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθεματιζω</span></span>, a late word, said by Cremer and Thayer to be wholly Biblical or ecclesiastical. But Deissmann (<i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 95) quotes several examples of the verb in an Attic cursing tablet from Megara of the first or second century A.D. This proof shows that the word, as well as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθεμα</span></span> (substantive) from which the verb is derived, was employed by pagans as well as by Jews. Deissmann suggests that Greek Jews like the seven sons of Sceva may have been the first to coin it. It occurs in the LXX as well as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:71">Mark 14:71</span> (which see and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:5">Luke 21:5</span>); <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:12">Acts 23:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:14">Acts 23:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:21">Acts 23:21</span>. They placed themselves under an anathema or curse, devoted themselves to God (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+27:28">Leviticus 27:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:22">1 Corinthians 16:22</span>).</p>
<p><b>Drink </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειν=πιειν</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πινω</span></span>. For this shortened form see Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 343.</p>
<p><b>Till they had killed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως ου αποκτεινωσιν</span></span>). First aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκτεινω</span></span>, common verb. No reason to translate "had killed," simply "till they should kill," the aorist merely punctiliar action, the subjunctive retained instead of the optative for vividness as usual in the <i>Koine</i> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 974-6). Same construction in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:14">Acts 23:14</span>. King Saul took an "anathema" that imperilled Jonathan (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+14:24">1 Samuel 14:24</span>). Perhaps the forty felt that the rabbis could find some way to absolve the curse if they failed. See this verse repeated in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:21">Acts 23:21</span>. </p>
