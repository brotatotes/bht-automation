<p><b> Came to the chief priests and the elders </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσελθοντες τοις αρχιερευσιν κα τοις πρεσβυτεροις</span></span>). The Sanhedrin, just as Judas did (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:4">Luke 22:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>With a great curse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθεματ</span></span>). This use of the same word as the verb repeated in the instrumental case is in imitation of the Hebrew absolute infinitive and common in the LXX, the very idiom and words of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+13:15">Deuteronomy 13:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+20:17">Deuteronomy 20:17</span>, an example of translation Greek, though found in other languages (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 531). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:5">Luke 21:5</span> for the distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθεμα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθημα</span></span>. Jesus had foretold: "Whoso killeth you will think that he doeth God service" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:2">John 16:2</span>). </p>
