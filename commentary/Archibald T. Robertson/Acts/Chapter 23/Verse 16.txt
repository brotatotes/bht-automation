<p><b> Their lying in wait </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ενεδραν</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> (in) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδρα</span></span> (seat), ambush. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:3">Acts 25:3</span>. Accusative object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουσας</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>He came </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραγενομενος</span></span>). Second aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραγινομα</span></span>. It may mean, "having come upon them" and so discount their plot, a graphic touch. Vincent thinks that some Pharisee, since Paul was a Pharisee and so a member of the "guild," told his nephew of the plot. Perhaps, and perhaps not.</p>
<p><b>Told Paul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηγγειλεν τω Παυλω</span></span>). This nephew is not known otherwise. He may be a student here from Tarsus as Paul once was. Anyhow he knows what to do when he catches on to the conspirators. He had enough address to get into the barracks where Paul was. He ran the risk of death if discovered. </p>
