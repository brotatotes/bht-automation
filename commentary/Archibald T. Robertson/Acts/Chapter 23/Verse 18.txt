 Paul the prisoner  (ο δεσμιος Παυλος). Bound (δεσμιος) to a soldier, but not with two chains (Acts 21:33), and with some freedom to see his friends as later (Acts 28:16), in military custody (custodia militaris). This was better than custodia publica (public custody), the common prison, but more confining.Who hath something to say to thee  (εχοντα τ λαλησα σο). Same idiom as in verse Acts 23:17; Acts 23:19, but λαλησα here instead of απαγγειλα.
