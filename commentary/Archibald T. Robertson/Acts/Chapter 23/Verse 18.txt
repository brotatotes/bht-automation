<p><b> Paul the prisoner </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δεσμιος Παυλος</span></span>). Bound (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεσμιος</span></span>) to a soldier, but not with two chains (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:33">Acts 21:33</span>), and with some freedom to see his friends as later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:16">Acts 28:16</span>), in military custody (<i>custodia militaris</i>). This was better than <i>custodia publica</i> (public custody), the common prison, but more confining.</p>
<p><b>Who hath something to say to thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχοντα τ λαλησα σο</span></span>). Same idiom as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:17">Acts 23:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:19">Acts 23:19</span>, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλησα</span></span> here instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαγγειλα</span></span>. </p>
