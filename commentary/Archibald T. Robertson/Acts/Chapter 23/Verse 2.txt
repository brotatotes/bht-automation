<p><b> Ananias </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hανανιας</span></span>). Not the one in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2">Luke 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13">John 18:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:7">Acts 4:7</span>, but the son of Nebedaeus, nominated high priest by Herod, King of Chalcis, A.D. 48 and till A.D. 59. He was called to Rome A.D. 52 to answer "a charge of rapine and cruelty made against him by the Samaritans, but honourably acquitted" (Page). Though high priest, he was a man of bad character.</p>
<p><b>Them that stood by him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις παρεστωσιν αυτω</span></span>). Dative case of second perfect participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παριστημ</span></span>, to place, and intransitive. See the same form in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:4">Acts 23:4</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεστωτες</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>To smite him on the mouth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπτειν αυτου το στομα</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:45">Acts 12:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:17">Acts 18:17</span>. Cf. the treatment of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:22">John 18:22</span>). Ananias was provoked by Paul's self-assertion while on trial before his judges. "The act was illegal and peculiarly offensive to a Jew at the hands of a Jew" (Knowling). More self-control might have served Paul better. Smiting the mouth or cheek is a peculiarly irritating offence and one not uncommon among the Jews and this fact gives point to the command of Jesus to turn the other check (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:29">Luke 6:29</span> where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπτω</span></span> is also used). </p>
