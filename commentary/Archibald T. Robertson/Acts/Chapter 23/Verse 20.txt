<p><b> The Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Ιουδαιο</span></span>). As if the whole nation was in the conspiracy and so in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:12">Acts 23:12</span>. The conspirators may have belonged to the Zealots, but clearly they represented the state of Jewish feeling toward Paul in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><b>Have agreed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεθεντο</span></span>). Second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συντιθημ</span></span>, old verb to join together, to agree. Already this form in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:5">Luke 22:5</span> which see. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:22">John 9:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:9">Acts 24:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>To bring down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως καταγαγηις</span></span>). Very words of the conspirators in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:15">Acts 23:15</span> as if the young man overheard. Second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταγω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως</span></span> in final clause, still used, but nothing like so common as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> though again in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:23">Acts 23:23</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 985).</p>
<p><b>As though thou wouldest inquire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως μελλων πυνθανεσθα</span></span>). Just as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:15">Acts 23:15</span> except that here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλων</span></span> refers to Lysias instead of to the conspirators as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:15">Acts 23:15</span>. The singular is used by the youth out of deference to the authority of Lysias and so modifies a bit the scheming of the conspirators, not "absurd" as Page holds. </p>
