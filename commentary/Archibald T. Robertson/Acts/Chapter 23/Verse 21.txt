<p><b> Do not therefore yield unto them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συ ουν μη πεισθηις αυτοις</span></span>). First aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθω</span></span>, common verb, here to be persuaded by, to listen to, to obey, to yield to. With negative and rightly. Do not yield to them (dative) at all. On the aorist subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> in prohibitions against committing an act see Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 851-4.</p>
<p><b>For there lie in wait </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεδρευουσιν γαρ</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεδρευω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεδρα</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:16">Acts 23:16</span>), in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:54">Luke 11:54</span> which see.</p>
<p><b>Till they have slain him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως ου ανελωσιν αυτον</span></span>). Same idiom as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:12">Acts 23:12</span> save that here we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανελωσιν</span></span> (second aorist active subjunctive) instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκτεινωσιν</span></span> (another word for kill), "till they slay him."</p>
<p><b>Looking for the promise from thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσδεχομενο την απο σου επαγγελιαν</span></span>). This item is all that is needed to put the scheme through, the young man shrewdly adds. </p>
