<p><b> Tell no man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν εκλαλησα</span></span>). Indirect command (<i>oratio obliqua</i>) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραγγειλας</span></span> (charging) with first aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλαλεω</span></span> (in ancient Greek, but here only in N.T.), but construction changed to direct in rest of the sentence (<i>oratio recta</i>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:4">Acts 1:4</span>, "that thou hast signified these things to me" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ταυτα ενεφανισας προς εμε</span></span>). Same verb here as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:15">Acts 23:15</span>. This change is common in the N.T. (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1047). </p>
