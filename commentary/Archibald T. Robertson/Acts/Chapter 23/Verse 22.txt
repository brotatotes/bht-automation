 Tell no man  (μηδεν εκλαλησα). Indirect command (oratio obliqua) after παραγγειλας (charging) with first aorist active infinitive of εκλαλεω (in ancient Greek, but here only in N.T.), but construction changed to direct in rest of the sentence (oratio recta) as in Acts 1:4, "that thou hast signified these things to me" (οτ ταυτα ενεφανισας προς εμε). Same verb here as in verse Acts 23:15. This change is common in the N.T. (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1047).
