<p><b> Provide beasts </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτενη παραστησα</span></span>). Change from direct to indirect discourse just the opposite of that in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:22">Acts 23:22</span>.</p>
<p><b>Beasts </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτηνη</span></span>). For riding as here or for baggage. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:34">Luke 10:34</span>. Asses or horses, but not war-horses. Since Paul was chained to a soldier, another animal would be required for baggage. It was also seventy miles and a change of horses might be needed. The extreme precaution of Lysias is explained in some Latin MSS. as due to fear of a night attack with the result that he might be accused to Felix of bribery. Luke also probably accompanied Paul.</p>
<p><b>To bring safe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα διασωσωσιν</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασωζω</span></span>, old verb, to save through (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) to a finish. Eight times in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:36">Matthew 14:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:3">Luke 7:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:24">Acts 23:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:43">Acts 27:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:44">Acts 27:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:1">Acts 28:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:4">Acts 28:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:20">1 Peter 3:20</span>).</p>
<p><b>Unto Felix the governor </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς Φηλικα τον ηγεμονα</span></span>). Felix was a brother of Pallas, the notorious favourite of Claudius. Both had been slaves and were now freedmen. Felix was made procurator of Judea by Claudius A.D. 52. He held the position till Festus succeeded him after complaints by the Jews to Nero. He married Drusilla the daughter of Herod Agrippa I with the hope of winning the favour of the Jews. He was one of the most depraved men of his time. Tacitus says of him that "with all cruelty and lust he exercised the power of a king with the spirit of a slave." The term "governor" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγεμων</span></span>) means "leader" from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγεομα</span></span>, to lead, and was applied to leaders of all sorts (emperors, kings, procurators). In the N.T. it is used of Pilate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:2">Matthew 27:2</span>), of Felix, (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:24">Acts 23:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:26">Acts 23:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:33">Acts 23:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:1">Acts 24:1</span>), of Festus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:30">Acts 26:30</span>). </p>
