<p><b> And he wrote </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραψας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span>, agreeing with the subject (Lysias) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπεν</span></span> (said) back in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:23">Acts 23:23</span> (beginning).</p>
<p><b>After this form </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχουσαν τον τυπον τουτον</span></span>). Textus Receptus has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεχουσαν</span></span>. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπον</span></span> (type or form) like <i>exemplum</i> in Latin (Page who quotes Cicero <i>Ad Att</i>. IX. 6. 3) may give merely the purport or substantial contents of the letter. But there is no reason for thinking that it is not a genuine copy since the letter may have been read in open court before Felix, and Luke was probably with Paul. The Roman law required that a subordinate officer like Lysias in reporting a case to his superior should send a written statement of the case and it was termed <i>elogium</i>. A copy of the letter may have been given Paul after his appeal to Caesar. It was probably written in Latin. The letter is a "dexterous mixture of truth and falsehood" (Furneaux) with the stamp of genuineness. It puts things in a favourable light for Lysias and makes no mention of his order to scourge Paul. </p>
