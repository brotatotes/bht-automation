 Was seized  (συλλημφθεντα). First aorist passive participle of συλλαμβανω.Rescued him having learned that he was a Roman  (εξειλαμεν μαθων οτ Ρομαιος εστιν). Wendt, Zoeckler, and Furneaux try to defend this record of two facts by Lysias in the wrong order from being an actual lie as Bengel rightly says. Lysias did rescue Paul and he did learn that he was a Roman, but in this order. He did not first learn that he was a Roman and then rescue him as his letter states. The use of the aorist participle (μαθων from μανθανω) after the principal verb εξειλαμεν (second aorist middle of εξαιρεω, to take out to oneself, to rescue) can be either simultaneous action or antecedent. There is in Greek no such idiom as the aorist participle of subsequent action (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1112-14). Lysias simply reversed the order of the facts and omitted the order for scourging Paul to put himself in proper light with Felix his superior officer and actually poses as the protector of a fellow Roman citizen.
