<p><b> Thou whited wall </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοιχε κεκονιαμενε</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κονιαω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κονια</span></span>, dust or lime). The same word used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:27">Matthew 23:27</span> for "whited sepulchres" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταφο κεκονιαμενο</span></span>) which see. It is a picturesque way of calling Ananias a hypocrite, undoubtedly true, but not a particularly tactful thing for a prisoner to say to his judge, not to say Jewish high priest. Besides, Paul had hurled back at him the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπτειν</span></span> (smite) in his command, putting it first in the sentence (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπτειν σε μελλε ο θεος</span></span>) in strong emphasis. Clearly Paul felt that he, not Ananias, was living as a good citizen in God's commonwealth.</p>
<p><b>And sittest thou to judge me? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κα συ καθη κρινων με?</span></span>) Literally, "And thou (being what thou art) art sitting (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθη</span></span>, second person singular middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθημα</span></span>, late form for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθησα</span></span>, the uncontracted form) judging me." Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:30">Luke 22:30</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κα συ</span></span> at the beginning of a question expresses indignation.</p>
<p><b>Contrary to the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρανομων</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρανομεω</span></span>, old verb to act contrary to the law, here alone in the N.T., "acting contrary to the law." </p>
