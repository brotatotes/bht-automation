 When it was shown to me that there would be a plot  (μηνυθεισης μο επιβουλης εσεσθα). Two constructions combined; genitive absolute (μηνυθεισης επιβουλης, first aorist passive participle of μηνυω) and future infinitive (εσεσθα as if επιβουλην accusative of general reference used) in indirect assertion after μηνυω (Robertson, Grammar, p. 877).Charging his accusers also  (παραγγειλας κα τοις κατηγοροις). First aorist active participle of παραγγελλω with which compare μαθων above (verse Acts 23:27), not subsequent action. Dative case in κατηγοροις.Before thee  (επ σου). Common idiom for "in the presence of" when before a judge (like Latin apud) as in Acts 24:20; Acts 24:21; Acts 25:26; Acts 26:2. What happened to the forty conspirators we have no way of knowing. Neither they nor the Jews from Asia are heard of more during the long five years of Paul's imprisonment in Caesarea and Rome.
