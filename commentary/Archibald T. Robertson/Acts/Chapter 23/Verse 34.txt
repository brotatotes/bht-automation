<p><b> When he had read it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγνους</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγινωσκω</span></span>, to know again, to read.</p>
<p><b>Of what province he was </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ ποιας επαρχειας εστιν</span></span>). Tense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> (is) retained in indirect question. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ποιας</span></span> is strictly "of what kind of" province, whether senatorial or imperial. Cilicia, like Judea, was under the control of the propraetor of Syria (imperial province). Paul's arrest was in Jerusalem and so under the jurisdiction of Felix unless it was a matter of insurrection when he could appeal to the propraetor of Syria. </p>
