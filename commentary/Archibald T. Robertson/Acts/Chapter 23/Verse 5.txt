<p><b> I wist not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ηιδειν</span></span>). Second past perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span> used as an imperfect. The Greek naturally means that Paul did not know that it was the high priest who gave the order to smite his mouth. If this view is taken, several things may be said by way of explanation. The high priest may not have had on his official dress as the meeting was called hurriedly by Lysias. Paul had been away so long that he may not have known Ananias on sight. And then Paul may have had poor eyesight or the high priest may not have been sitting in the official seat. Another way of explaining it is to say that Paul was so indignant, even angry, at the command that he spoke without considering who it was that gave the order. The Greek allows this idea also. At any rate Paul at once recognizes the justice of the point made against him. He had been guilty of irreverence against the office of high priest as the passage from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:18">Exodus 22:18</span> (LXX) shows and confesses his fault, but the rebuke was deserved. Jesus did not threaten (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:23">1 Peter 2:23</span>) when smitten on the cheek (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:22">John 18:22</span>), but he did protest against the act and did not turn the other cheek. </p>
