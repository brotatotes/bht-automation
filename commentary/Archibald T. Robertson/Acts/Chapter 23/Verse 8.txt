<p><b> There is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη εινα αναστασιν μητε αγγελον μητε πνευμα</span></span>). Infinitive with negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> in indirect assertion. These points constitute the chief doctrinal differences between the Pharisees and the Sadducees.</p>
<p><b>Both </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμφοτερα</span></span>). Here used though three items of belief are mentioned as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:16">Acts 19:16</span> where the seven sons of Sceva are thus described. This idiom is common enough in papyri and Byzantine Greek (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 745). </p>
