 Strove  (διεμαχοντο). Imperfect middle of διαμαχομα, old Attic verb, to fight it out (between, back and forth, fiercely). Here only in the N.T. It was a lively scrap and Luke pictures it as going on. The Pharisees definitely take Paul's side.And what if a spirit hath spoken to him or an angel?  (ε δε πνευμα ελαλησεν αυτω η αγγελοσ?). This is aposiopesis, not uncommon in the N.T., as in Luke 13:9; John 6:62 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1203). See one also in Exodus 32:32.
