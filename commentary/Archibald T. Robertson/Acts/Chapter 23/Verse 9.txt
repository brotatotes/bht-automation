<p><b> Strove </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεμαχοντο</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαμαχομα</span></span>, old Attic verb, to fight it out (between, back and forth, fiercely). Here only in the N.T. It was a lively scrap and Luke pictures it as going on. The Pharisees definitely take Paul's side.</p>
<p><b>And what if a spirit hath spoken to him or an angel? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δε πνευμα ελαλησεν αυτω η αγγελοσ?</span></span>). This is aposiopesis, not uncommon in the N.T., as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:9">Luke 13:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:62">John 6:62</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1203). See one also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:32">Exodus 32:32</span>. </p>
