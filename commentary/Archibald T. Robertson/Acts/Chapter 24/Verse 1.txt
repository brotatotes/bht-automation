<p><b> And with an Orator, one Tertullus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ρητορος Τερτυλλου τινος</span></span>). A deputation of elders along with the high priest Ananias, not the whole Sanhedrin, but no hint of the forty conspirators or of the Asian Jews. The Sanhedrin had become divided so that now it is probably Ananias (mortally offended) and the Sadducees who take the lead in the prosecution of Paul. It is not clear whether after five days is from Paul's departure from Jerusalem or his arrival in Caesarea. If he spent nine days in Jerusalem, then the five days would be counted from then (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:11">Acts 24:11</span>). The employment of a Roman lawyer (Latin <i>orator</i>) was necessary since the Jews were not familiar with Roman legal procedure and it was the custom in the provinces (Cicero <i>pro Cael</i>. 30). The speech was probably in Latin which Paul may have understood also. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ρητωρ</span></span> is a common old Greek word meaning a forensic orator or advocate but here only in the N.T. The Latin <i>rhetor</i> was a teacher of rhetoric, a very different thing. Tertullus is a diminutive of Tertius (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:22">Romans 16:22</span>).</p>
<p><b>Informed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεφανισαν</span></span>). Same verb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:15">Acts 23:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:22">Acts 23:22</span>, somewhat like our modern "indictment," certainly accusations "against Paul" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα του Παυλου</span></span>). They were down on Paul and the hired barrister was prosecuting attorney. For the legal form see <i>Oxyrhynchus Papyri</i>, Vol. II., p. 162, line 19. </p>
