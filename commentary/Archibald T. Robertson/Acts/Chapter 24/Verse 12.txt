<p><b> Disputing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαλεγομενον</span></span>). Simply conversing, discussing, arguing, and then disputing, common verb in old Greek and in N.T. (especially in Acts).</p>
<p><b>Stirring up a crowd </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστασιν ποιουντα οχλου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Επιστασις</span></span> is a late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφιστημ</span></span>, to make an onset or rush. Only twice in the N.T., <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:28">2 Corinthians 11:28</span> (the pressure or care of the churches) and here (making a rush of a crowd). The papyri give examples also for "onset." So Paul denies the two charges that were serious and the only one that concerned Roman law (insurrection). </p>
