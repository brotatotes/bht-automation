 I confess  (ομολογω). The only charge left was that of being a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. This Paul frankly confesses is true. He uses the word in its full sense. He is "guilty" of that.After the Way  (κατα την οδον). This word Paul had already applied to Christianity (Acts 22:4). He prefers it to "sect" (αιρεσιν which means a choosing, then a division). Paul claims Christianity to be the real (whole, catholic) Judaism, not a "sect" of it. But he will show that Christianity is not a deviation from Judaism, but the fulfilment of it (Page) as he has already shown in Acts 24:3; Acts 24:9.So serve I the God of our fathers  (ουτως λατρευω τω πατρωιω θεω). Paul has not stretched the truth at all. He has confirmed the claim made before the Sanhedrin that he is a spiritual Pharisee in the truest sense (Acts 23:6). He reasserts his faith in all the law and the prophets, holding to the Messianic hope. A curious "heretic" surely!Which these themselves also look for  (ην κα αυτο ουτο προσδεχοντα). Probably with a gesture towards his accusers. He does not treat them all as Sadducees. See Titus 2:13 for similar use of the verb (προσδεχομενο την μακαριαν ελπιδα, looking for the happy hope).
