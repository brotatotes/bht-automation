<p><b> I confess </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογω</span></span>). The only charge left was that of being a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. This Paul frankly confesses is true. He uses the word in its full sense. He is "guilty" of that.</p>
<p><b>After the Way </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα την οδον</span></span>). This word Paul had already applied to Christianity (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:4">Acts 22:4</span>). He prefers it to "sect" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρεσιν</span></span> which means a choosing, then a division). Paul claims Christianity to be the real (whole, catholic) Judaism, not a "sect" of it. But he will show that Christianity is not a deviation from Judaism, but the fulfilment of it (Page) as he has already shown in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:3">Acts 24:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:9">Acts 24:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>So serve I the God of our fathers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως λατρευω τω πατρωιω θεω</span></span>). Paul has not stretched the truth at all. He has confirmed the claim made before the Sanhedrin that he is a spiritual Pharisee in the truest sense (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:6">Acts 23:6</span>). He reasserts his faith in all the law and the prophets, holding to the Messianic hope. A curious "heretic" surely!</p>
<p><b>Which these themselves also look for </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην κα αυτο ουτο προσδεχοντα</span></span>). Probably with a gesture towards his accusers. He does not treat them all as Sadducees. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span> for similar use of the verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσδεχομενο την μακαριαν ελπιδα</span></span>, looking for the happy hope). </p>
