<p><b> That there shall be a resurrection </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστασιν μελλειν εσεσθα</span></span>). Indirect assertion with infinitive and accusative of general reference (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστασιν</span></span>) after the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελπιδα</span></span> (hope). The future infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσεσθα</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλειν</span></span> is also according to rule, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλω</span></span> being followed by either present, aorist, or future infinitive (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 870, 877, 878).</p>
<p><b>Both of the just and the unjust </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιων τε κα αδικων</span></span>). Apparently at the same time as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:31">Acts 17:31</span>). Gardner thinks that Luke here misrepresents Paul who held to no resurrection save for those "in Christ," a mistaken interpretation of Paul in my opinion. The Talmud teaches the resurrection of Israelites only, but Paul was more than a Pharisee. </p>
