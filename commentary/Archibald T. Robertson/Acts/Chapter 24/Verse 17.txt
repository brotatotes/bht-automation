 After many years  (δι' ετων πλειονων). "At an interval (δια) of more (πλειονων) years" (than a few, one must add), not "after many years." If, as is likely Paul went up to Jerusalem in Acts 18:22, that was some five years ago and would justify "πλειονων" (several years ago or some years ago).To bring alms  (ελεημοσυνας ποιησον). Another (see προσκυνησων in verse Acts 24:11) example of the future participle of purpose in the N.T. These "alms" (on ελεημοσυνας see on Matthew 6:1; Matthew 6:4; Acts 10:2, common in Tobit and is in the papyri) were for the poor saints in Jerusalem (1 Corinthians 16:1-4; 1 Corinthians 16:2; 1 Corinthians 16:9; Romans 15:26) who were none the less Jews. "And offerings" (κα προσφορας). The very word used in Acts 21:26 of the offerings or sacrifices made by Paul for the four brethren and himself. It does not follow that it was Paul's original purpose to make these "offerings" before he came to Jerusalem (cf. Acts 18:18). He came up to worship (verse Acts 24:11) and to be present at Pentecost (Acts 20:16).
