<p><b> After many years </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ετων πλειονων</span></span>). "At an interval (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) of more (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλειονων</span></span>) years" (than a few, one must add), not "after many years." If, as is likely Paul went up to Jerusalem in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:22">Acts 18:22</span>, that was some five years ago and would justify "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλειονων</span></span>" (several years ago or some years ago).</p>
<p><b>To bring alms </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεημοσυνας ποιησον</span></span>). Another (see <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνησων</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:11">Acts 24:11</span>) example of the future participle of purpose in the N.T. These "alms" (on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεημοσυνας</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1">Matthew 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:4">Matthew 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:2">Acts 10:2</span>, common in Tobit and is in the papyri) were for the poor saints in Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:1-4">1 Corinthians 16:1-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:2">1 Corinthians 16:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:9">1 Corinthians 16:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:26">Romans 15:26</span>) who were none the less Jews. "And offerings" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα προσφορας</span></span>). The very word used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:26">Acts 21:26</span> of the offerings or sacrifices made by Paul for the four brethren and himself. It does not follow that it was Paul's original purpose to make these "offerings" before he came to Jerusalem (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:18">Acts 18:18</span>). He came up to worship (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:11">Acts 24:11</span>) and to be present at Pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:16">Acts 20:16</span>). </p>
