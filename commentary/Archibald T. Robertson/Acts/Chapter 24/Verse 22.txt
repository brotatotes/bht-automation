 Having more exact knowledge  (ακριβεστερον ειδως). "Knowing" (second perfect active participle of οιδα) "more accurately" (comparative of adverb ακριβως). More accurately than what? Than the Sanhedrin supposed he had "concerning the Way" (τα περ της οδου, the things concerning the Way, common in Acts for Christianity). How Felix had gained this knowledge of Christianity is not stated. Philip the Evangelist lived here in Caesarea and there was a church also. Drusilla was a Jewess and may have told him something. Besides, it is wholly possible that Felix knew of the decision of Gallio in Corinth that Christianity was a religio licita as a form of Judaism. As a Roman official he knew perfectly well that the Sanhedrin with the help of Tertullus had failed utterly to make out a case against Paul. He could have released Paul and probably would have done so but for fear of offending the Jews whose ruler he was and the hope that Paul (note "alms" in verse Acts 24:17) might offer him bribes for his liberty.Deferred them  (ανεβαλετο αυτους). Second aorist middle indicative of αναβαλλω, old verb (only here in N.T.) to throw or toss up, to put back or off, in middle to put off from one, to delay, to adjourn. Felix adjourned the case without a decision under a plausible pretext, that he required the presence of Lysias in person, which was not the case. Lysias had already said that Paul was innocent and was never summoned to Caesarea, so far as we know. Since Paul was a Roman citizen, Lysias could have thrown some light on the riot, if he had any.Shall come down  (καταβη). Second aorist active subjunctive of καταβαινω.I will determine your matter  (διαγνωσομα τα καθ' υμας). Future middle of διαγινωσκω, old and common verb to know accurately or thoroughly (δια). In the N.T. only here (legal sense) and Acts 23:15. "The things according to you" (plural, the matters between Paul and the Sanhedrin).
