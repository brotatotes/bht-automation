<p><b> Having more exact knowledge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακριβεστερον ειδως</span></span>). "Knowing" (second perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span>) "more accurately" (comparative of adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακριβως</span></span>). More accurately than what? Than the Sanhedrin supposed he had "concerning the Way" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα περ της οδου</span></span>, the things concerning the Way, common in Acts for Christianity). How Felix had gained this knowledge of Christianity is not stated. Philip the Evangelist lived here in Caesarea and there was a church also. Drusilla was a Jewess and may have told him something. Besides, it is wholly possible that Felix knew of the decision of Gallio in Corinth that Christianity was a <i>religio licita</i> as a form of Judaism. As a Roman official he knew perfectly well that the Sanhedrin with the help of Tertullus had failed utterly to make out a case against Paul. He could have released Paul and probably would have done so but for fear of offending the Jews whose ruler he was and the hope that Paul (note "alms" in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:17">Acts 24:17</span>) might offer him bribes for his liberty.</p>
<p><b>Deferred them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεβαλετο αυτους</span></span>). Second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαλλω</span></span>, old verb (only here in N.T.) to throw or toss up, to put back or off, in middle to put off from one, to delay, to adjourn. Felix adjourned the case without a decision under a plausible pretext, that he required the presence of Lysias in person, which was not the case. Lysias had already said that Paul was innocent and was never summoned to Caesarea, so far as we know. Since Paul was a Roman citizen, Lysias could have thrown some light on the riot, if he had any.</p>
<p><b>Shall come down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβη</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβαινω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>I will determine your matter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαγνωσομα τα καθ' υμας</span></span>). Future middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαγινωσκω</span></span>, old and common verb to know accurately or thoroughly (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>). In the N.T. only here (legal sense) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:15">Acts 23:15</span>. "The things according to you" (plural, the matters between Paul and the Sanhedrin). </p>
