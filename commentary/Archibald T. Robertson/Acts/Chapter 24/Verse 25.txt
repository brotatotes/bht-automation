<p><b> Was terrified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμφοβος γενομενος</span></span>). Ingressive aorist middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>, "becoming terrified." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εμφοβος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβος</span></span>) old word, in the N.T. only <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:5">Luke 24:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:5">Acts 10:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:25">Acts 24:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:13">Revelation 11:13</span>.
