 Was terrified  (εμφοβος γενομενος). Ingressive aorist middle of γινομα, "becoming terrified." Εμφοβος (εν and φοβος) old word, in the N.T. only Luke 24:5; Acts 10:5; Acts 24:25; Revelation 11:13. Paul turned the tables completely around and expounded "the faith in Christ Jesus" as it applied to Felix and Drusilla and discoursed (διαλεγομενου αυτου, genitive absolute) concerning "righteousness" (δικαιοσυνης) which they did not possess, "self-control" or temperance (εγκρατειας) which they did not exhibit, and "the judgment to come" (του κριματος του μελλοντος) which was certain to overtake them. Felix was brought under conviction, but apparently not Drusilla. Like another Herodias her resentment was to be feared (Knowling).Go thy way for this time  (το νυν εχον πορευου). The ancient Greek has this use of το νυν εχον (Tobit 7:11) in the accusative of time, "as for the present or holding the now."When I have a convenient season  (καιρον μεταλαβων). Second aorist active participle of the old verb μεταλαμβανω, to find a share in, to obtain. It was his "excuse" for dodging the personal turn that Paul had given.
