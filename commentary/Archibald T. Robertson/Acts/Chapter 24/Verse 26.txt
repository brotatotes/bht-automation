<p><b> He hoped withal </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμα κα ελπιζων</span></span>). "At the same time also hoping." Paul had mentioned the "alms" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:17">Acts 24:17</span>) and that excited the avarice of Felix for "money" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρηματα</span></span>). Roman law demanded exile and confiscation for a magistrate who accepted bribes, but it was lax in the provinces. Felix had doubtless received them before. Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. XX. 8, 9) represents Felix as greedy for money.</p>
<p><b>The oftener </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυκνοτερον</span></span>). Comparative adverb of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυκνος</span></span>, old word, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:33">Luke 5:33</span> which see and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:23">1 Timothy 5:23</span>.

Paul kept on not offering a bribe, but Felix continued to have hopes (present tense <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελπιζων</span></span>), kept on sending for him (present tense <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταπεμπομενος</span></span>), and kept on communing (imperfect active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωμιλε</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομιλεω</span></span>, old word as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:11">Acts 20:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:14">Luke 24:14</span>, which see, only N.T. examples of this word).
