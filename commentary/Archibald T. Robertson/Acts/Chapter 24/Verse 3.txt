<p><b> In all ways and in all places </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντη τε κα πανταχου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παντη</span></span>, old adverb of manner only here in N.T. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πανταχου</span></span> also old adverb of place, several times in N.T. But these adverbs most likely go with the preceding clause about "reforms" rather than as here translated with "we accept" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδεχομεθα</span></span>). But "with all gratitude" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα πασης ευχαριστιας</span></span>) does naturally go with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδεχομεθα</span></span>. </p>
