 That I be not further tedious unto thee  (ινα μη επ πλειον σε ενκοπτω). Koine verb (Hippocrates, Polybius) to cut in on (or into), to cut off, to impede, to hinder. Our modern telephone and radio illustrate it well. In the N.T. (Acts 24:4; 1 Thessalonians 2:18; Galatians 5:7; Romans 15:22; 1 Peter 3:7). "That I may not cut in on or interrupt thee further (επ πλειον) in thy reforms." Flattery still.Of thy clemency  (τη ση επιεικεια). Instrumental case of old word from επιεικης and this from επ and εικος (reasonable, likely, fair). "Sweet Reasonableness" (Matthew Arnold), gentleness, fairness. An επιεικης man is "one who makes reasonable concessions" (Aristotle, Eth. V. 10), while δικαιος is "one who insists on his full rights" (Plato, Leg. 757 D) as translated by Page.A few words  (συντομως). Old adverb from συντεμνω, to cut together (short), abbreviate. Like δια βραχεων in Hebrews 13:22. In N.T. only here and Acts 24:16 (shorter conclusion).
