<p><b> For we have found </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευροντες γαρ</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκω</span></span>, but without a principal verb in the sentence. Probably we have here only a "summary of the charges against Paul" (Page).</p>
<p><b>A pestilent fellow </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λοιμον</span></span>). An old word for pest, plague, pestilence, Paul the pest. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:11">Luke 21:11</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λοιμο κα λιμο</span></span>, pestilences and famines) which see. Latin <i>pestis</i>. Think of the greatest preacher of the ages being branded a pest by a contemporary hired lawyer.</p>
<p><b>A mover of insurrections </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κινουντα στασεις</span></span>). This was an offence against Roman law if it could be proven. "Plotted against at Damascus, plotted against at Jerusalem, expelled from Pisidian Antioch, stoned at Lystra, scourged and imprisoned at Philippi, accused of treason at Thessalonica, haled before the proconsul at Corinth, cause of a serious riot at Ephesus, and now finally of a riot at Jerusalem" (Furneaux). Specious proof could have been produced, but was not. Tertullus went on to other charges with which a Roman court had no concern (instance Gallio in Corinth).</p>
<p><b>Throughout the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα την οικουμενην</span></span>). The Roman inhabited earth (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γην</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:6">Acts 17:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>A ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτοστατην της των Ναζωραιων αιρεσεως</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πρωτοστατης</span></span> is an old word in common use from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>, a front-rank man, a chief, a champion. Here only in the N.T. This charge is certainly true. About "sect" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρεσις</span></span>) see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:17">Acts 5:17</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ναζωραιο</span></span> here only in the plural in the N.T., elsewhere of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:23">Matthew 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:71">Matthew 26:71</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:37">Luke 18:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:5">John 18:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:7">John 18:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:19">John 19:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22">Acts 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:6">Acts 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:10">Acts 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:14">Acts 6:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:8">Acts 22:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:9">Acts 26:9</span>). The disciple is not above his Master. There was a sneer in the term as applied to Jesus and here to his followers. </p>
