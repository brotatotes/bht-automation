This whole verse with some words at the end of verse Acts 24:6 and the beginning of verse Acts 24:8 in the Textus Receptus ("And would have judged according to our law. But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands, commanding his accusers to come unto thee") is absent from Aleph A B H L P 61 (many other cursives) Sahidic Bohairic. It is beyond doubt a later addition to the incomplete report of the speech of Tertullus. As the Revised Version stands, verse Acts 24:8 connects with verse Acts 24:6. The motive of the added words is clearly to prejudice Felix against Lysias and they contradict the record in Acts 24:21. Furneaux holds them to be genuine and omitted because contradictory to Acts 24:21. More likely they are a clumsy attempt to complete the speech of Tertullus.
