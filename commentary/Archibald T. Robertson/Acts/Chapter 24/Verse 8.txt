<p><b> From whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ' ου</span></span>). Referring to Paul, but in the Textus Receptus referring to Lysias.</p>
<p><b>By examining him thyself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος ανακρινας</span></span>). Not by torture, since Paul was a Roman citizen, but by hearing what Paul has to say in defence of himself. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ανακρινω</span></span> is to examine thoroughly up and down as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:14">Luke 23:14</span>. </p>
