Judea was not strictly a province, but a department (Page) of the province of Syria which was under a <i>propraetor</i> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγατυς Χαεσαρις</span></span>) while Judea was under a <i>procurator</i> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτροπος</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>After three days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα τρεις ημερας</span></span>). So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:17">Acts 28:17</span> in Rome.
