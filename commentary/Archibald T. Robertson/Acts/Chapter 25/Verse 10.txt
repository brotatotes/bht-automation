<p><b> I am standing before Caesar's judgment-seat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hεστως επ του βηματος Καισαρος ειμ</span></span>). Periphrastic present perfect indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστως ειμ</span></span>), second perfect participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστως</span></span> of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span> (intransitive). Paul means to say that he is a Roman citizen before a Roman tribunal. Festus was the representative of Caesar and had no right to hand him over to a Jewish tribunal. Festus recognized this by saying to Paul "wilt thou" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελεις</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Where I ought to be judged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου με δε κρινεσθα</span></span>). Rather, "Where I must be judged," for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> expresses necessity (it is necessary). Paul exposes the conduct of Festus with merciless precision.</p>
<p><b>As thou also very well knowest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως κα συ καλλιον επιγινωσκεις</span></span>). "As thou also dost understand (hast additional knowledge, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγινωσκεις</span></span>) better" (than thou art willing to admit). That this is Paul's meaning by the use of the comparative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλλιον</span></span> (positive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλως</span></span>) is made plain by the confession of Festus to Agrippa in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:18">Acts 25:18</span>. Paul says that Festus knows that he has done no wrong to the Jews at all (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν ηδικηκα</span></span>) and yet he is trying to turn him over to the wrath of the Jews in Jerusalem. </p>
