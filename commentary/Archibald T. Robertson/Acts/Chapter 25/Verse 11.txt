<p><b> If I am a wrong-doer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μεν ουν αδικω</span></span>). Condition of the first class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and the present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικη</span></span>): "If I am in the habit of doing injustice," assuming it to be true for the sake of argument.</p>
<p><b>And have committed anything worthy of death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αξιον θανατου πεπραχα</span></span>). Same condition with the difference in tense (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπραχα</span></span>, perfect active indicative) of a single case instead of a general habit. Assuming either or both Paul draws his conclusion.</p>
<p><b>I refuse not to die </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου παραιτουμα το αποθανειν</span></span>). Old verb to ask alongside, to beg from, to deprecate, to refuse, to decline. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:18">Luke 14:18</span>. Josephus (<i>Life</i>, 29) has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θανειν ου παραιτουμα</span></span>. Here the articular second aorist active infinitive is in the accusative case the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραιτουμα</span></span>: "I do not beg off dying from myself."</p>
<p><b>But if none of these things is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δε ουδεν εστιν</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δε</span></span> here is contrasted with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν</span></span> just before. No word for "true" in the Greek. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εστιν</span></span> ("is") in the Greek here means "exists." Same condition (first class, assumed as true).</p>
<p><b>Whereof these accuse me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων ουτο κατηγορουσιν μου</span></span>). Genitive of relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον</span></span> by attraction from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> (accusative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηγορουσιν</span></span>) to case of the unexpressed antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span> ("of these things"). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μου</span></span> is genitive of person after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηγορουσιν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>No man can give me up to them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεις με δυνατα αυτοις χαρισασθα</span></span>). "Can" legally. Paul is a Roman citizen and not even Festus can make a free gift (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρισασθα</span></span>) of Paul to the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p><b>I appeal unto Caesar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Καισαρα επικαλουμα</span></span>). Technical phrase like Latin <i>Caesarem appello</i>. Originally the Roman law allowed an appeal from the magistrate to the people (<i>provocatio ad populum</i>), but the emperor represented the people and so the appeal to Caesar was the right of every Roman citizen. Paul had crossed the Rubicon on this point and so took his case out of the hands of dilatory provincial justice (really injustice). Roman citizens could make this appeal in capital offences. There would be expense connected with it, but better that with some hope than delay and certain death in Jerusalem. Festus was no better than Felix in his vacillation and desire to curry favour with the Jews at Paul's expense. No doubt Paul's long desire to see Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:21">Acts 19:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:22-28">Romans 15:22-28</span>) and the promise of Jesus that he would see Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:11">Acts 23:11</span>) played some part in Paul's decision. But he made it reluctantly for he says in Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:19">Acts 28:19</span>): "I was constrained to appeal." But acquittal at the hands of Festus with the hope of going to Rome as a free man had vanished. </p>
