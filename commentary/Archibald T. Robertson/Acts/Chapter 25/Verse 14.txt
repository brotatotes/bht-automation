<p><b> Tarried </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διετριβον</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διατριβω</span></span>, common verb for spending time (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:19">Acts 12:19</span>, etc.).</p>
<p><b>Many days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλειους ημερας</span></span>). More days (than a few). Accusative case for extent of time.</p>
<p><b>Laid Paul's case </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεθετο τα κατα τον Παυλον</span></span>). Second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανατιθημ</span></span>, old verb to set before, to place up, as if for consultation in conference. Only twice in N.T. here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:2">Galatians 2:2</span>. The motive of Festus is not given, though it was natural enough in view of the quandary of Festus about Paul (the things about Paul) and Agrippa's interest in and responsibility for Jewish worship in the temple in Jerusalem. It is quite possible that Festus had a bit of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εννυ</span></span> over the visit of these Jewish dignitaries as "more days" went by. Hence the tone of Festus about Paul in this proposal for the entertainment of Agrippa and Bernice is certainly one of superficial and supremely supercilious indifference.</p>
<p><b>Left a prisoner </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλελιμμενος δεσμιος</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλειπω</span></span>, to leave behind. Paul is one of Felix's left overs (left behind), a sort of "junk" left on his hands. This cowardly Roman procurator thus pictures the greatest of living men and the greatest preacher of all time to this profligate pair (brother and sister) of sinners. Undoubtedly today in certain circles Christ and his preachers are held up to like contempt. </p>
