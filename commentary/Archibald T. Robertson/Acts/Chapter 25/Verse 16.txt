<p><b> It is not the custom of the Romans </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ουκ εστιν εθος Ρωμαιοις</span></span>). If a direct quotation, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> is recitative as in Authorized Version. Canterbury Revision takes it as indirect discourse after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκριθην</span></span> (I answered), itself in a relative clause (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς ους</span></span>) with the present tense (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span>, is) preserved as is usual. There is a touch of disdain (Furneaux) in the tone of Festus. He may refer to a demand of the Jews before they asked that Paul be brought to Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:3">Acts 25:3</span>). At any rate there is a tone of scorn towards the Jews.</p>
<p><b>Before that the accused have </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πριν η ο κατηγορουμενος εχο</span></span>). This use of the optative in this temporal clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πριν η</span></span> instead of the subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν εχη</span></span> is in conformity with literary Greek and occurs only in Luke's writings in the N.T. (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 970). This sequence of modes is a mark of the literary style occasionally seen in Luke. It is interesting here to note the succession of dependent clauses in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:14-16">Acts 25:14-16</span>.</p>
<p><b>The accusers face to face </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα προσωπον τους κατηγορους</span></span>). Same word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηγορος</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:30">Acts 23:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:35">Acts 23:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:18">Acts 25:18</span>. This all sounds fair enough.</p>
<p><b>And have had opportunity to make his defence concerning the matter laid against him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοπον τε απολογιας λαβο περ του εγκληματος</span></span>). Literally, "And should receive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαβο</span></span> optative for same reason as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχο</span></span> above, second aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>) opportunity for defence (objective genitive) concerning the charge" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγκληματος</span></span> in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:19">Acts 23:19</span> which see). </p>
