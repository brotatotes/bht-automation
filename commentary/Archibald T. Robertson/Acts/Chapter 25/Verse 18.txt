 Brought  (εφερον). Imperfect active of φερω, referring to their repeated charges.Of such evil things as I supposed  (ων εγω υπενοουν πονηρων). Incorporation of the antecedent πονηρων into the relative clause and change of the case of the relative from the accusative α object of υπενοουν to the genitive like πονηρων (Robertson, Grammar, p. 719). Note the imperfect active υπενοουν of υπονοεω to emphasize Festus's state of mind about Paul before the trial. This old verb only three times in the N.T. (here, Acts 13:25 which see; Acts 27:27).
