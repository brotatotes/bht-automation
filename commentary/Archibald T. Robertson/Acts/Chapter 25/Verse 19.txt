<p><b>Concerning their own religion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ της ιδιας δεισιδαιμονιας</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:22">Acts 17:22</span> for discussion of this word.

<p><b>And of one Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα περ τινος Ιησου</span></span>). This is the climax of supercilious scorn toward both Paul and "one Jesus."</p>
<p><b>Who was dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεθνηκοτος</span></span>). Perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θνησκω</span></span> agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησου</span></span> (genitive). As being dead.</p>
