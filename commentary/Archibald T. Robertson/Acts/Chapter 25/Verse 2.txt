<p><b> The principal men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πρωτο</span></span>). The first men, the leading men of the city, besides the chief priests. In verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:15">Acts 25:15</span> we have "the chief priests and the elders." These chief men among the Jews would desire to pay their respects to the new Procurator on his first visit to Jerusalem. There was another high priest now, Ishmael in place of Ananias.</p>
<p><b>Informed him against Paul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεφανισαν αυτω κατα του Παυλου</span></span>). "This renewal of the charge after two years, on the very first opportunity, is a measure, not only of their unsleeping hatred, but of the importance which they attached to Paul's influence" (Furneaux).</p>
<p><b>Besought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεκαλουν</span></span>). Imperfect active, kept on beseeching as a special favour to the Jews. </p>
