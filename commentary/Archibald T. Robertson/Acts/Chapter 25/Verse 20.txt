<p><b> Being perplexed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απορουμενος</span></span>). Present middle participle of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απορεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορος</span></span> way), to be in doubt which way to turn, already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:20">Mark 6:20</span> which see and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:4">Luke 24:4</span>. The Textus Receptus has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> after here, but critical text has only the accusative which this verb allows (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:20">Mark 6:20</span>) as in Thucydides and Plato.</p>
<p><b>How to inquire concerning these things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την περ τουτων ζητησιν</span></span>). Literally, "as to the inquiry concerning these things." This is not the reason given by Luke in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:9">Acts 25:9</span> (wanting to curry favour with the Jews), but doubtless this motive also actuated Festus as both could be true.</p>
<p><b>Whether he would go to Jerusalem </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε βουλοιτο πορευεσθα εις Ιεροσολυμα</span></span>). Optative in indirect question after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγον</span></span> (asked or said) imperfect active, though the present indicative could have been retained with change of person: "Dost thou wish, etc.," (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε βουλη</span></span>, etc.). See Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1031, 1044. This is the question put to Paul in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:9">Acts 25:9</span> though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελεις</span></span> is there used. </p>
