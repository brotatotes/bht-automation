 Being perplexed  (απορουμενος). Present middle participle of the common verb απορεω (α privative and πορος way), to be in doubt which way to turn, already in Mark 6:20 which see and Luke 24:4. The Textus Receptus has εις after here, but critical text has only the accusative which this verb allows (Mark 6:20) as in Thucydides and Plato.How to inquire concerning these things  (την περ τουτων ζητησιν). Literally, "as to the inquiry concerning these things." This is not the reason given by Luke in verse Acts 25:9 (wanting to curry favour with the Jews), but doubtless this motive also actuated Festus as both could be true.Whether he would go to Jerusalem  (ε βουλοιτο πορευεσθα εις Ιεροσολυμα). Optative in indirect question after ελεγον (asked or said) imperfect active, though the present indicative could have been retained with change of person: "Dost thou wish, etc.," (ε βουλη, etc.). See Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1031, 1044. This is the question put to Paul in verse Acts 25:9 though θελεις is there used.
