<p><b> When Paul had appealed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του Παυλου επικαλεσαμενου</span></span>). Genitive absolute with first aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επικαλεομα</span></span>, the technical word for appeal (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:11">Acts 25:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:12">Acts 25:12</span>). The first aorist passive infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρηθηνα</span></span> (to be kept) is the object of the participle.</p>
<p><b>For the decision of the emperor </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την του Σεβαστου διαγνωσιν</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διαγνωσιν</span></span> (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαγνωσομα</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:22">Acts 24:22</span>, I will determine) is the regular word for a legal examination (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χογνιτιο</span></span>), thorough sifting (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>), here only in N.T. Instead of "the Emperor" it should be "the Augustus," as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σεβαστος</span></span> is simply the Greek translation of <i>Augustus</i>, the adjective (Revered, Reverent) assumed by Octavius B.C. 27 as the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνομεν</span></span> that summed up all his various offices instead of <i>Rex</i> so offensive to the Romans having led to the death of Julius Caesar. The successors of Octavius assumed <i>Augustus</i> as a title. The Greek term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σεβαστος</span></span> has the notion of worship (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεβασμα</span></span> in Acts <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:25">Acts 17:25</span>). In the N.T. only here, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:25">Acts 25:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:1">Acts 27:1</span> (of the legion). It was more imposing than "Caesar" which was originally a family name (always official in the N.T.) and it fell in with the tendency toward emperor-worship which later played such a large part in Roman life and which Christians opposed so bitterly. China is having a revival of this idea in the insistence on bowing three times to the picture of Sun-Yat-Sen.</p>
<p><b>Till I should send him to Caesar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως αν αναπεμψω αυτον προς Καισαρα</span></span>). Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπεμψω</span></span> can be either future indicative or first aorist subjunctive (identical in first person singular), aorist subjunctive the usual construction with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως</span></span> for future time (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 876). Literally, "send up" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα</span></span>) to a superior (the emperor). Common in this sense in the papyri and <i>Koine</i> writers. Here "Caesar" is used as the title of Nero instead of "Augustus" as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span> (Lord) occurs in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:26">Acts 25:26</span>. </p>
