<p><b> I also could wish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβουλομην κα αυτος</span></span>). The imperfect for courtesy, rather than the blunt <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομα</span></span>, I wish, I want. Literally, "I myself also was wishing" (while you were talking), a compliment to the interesting story told by Festus. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> with the imperfect would really mean that he does not wish (a conclusion of the second class condition, determined as unfulfilled). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αν</span></span> with the optative would show only a languid desire. The imperfect is keen enough and yet polite enough to leave the decision with Festus if inconvenient for any reason (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 885-7). Agrippa may have heard much about Christianity. </p>
