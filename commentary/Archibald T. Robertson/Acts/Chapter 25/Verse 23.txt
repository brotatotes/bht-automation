<p><b> When Agrippa was come and Bernice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελθοντος του Αγριππα κα της Βερνικης</span></span>). Genitive absolute, the participle agreeing in number and gender (masculine singular, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελθοντος</span></span>) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αγριππα</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βερνικης</span></span> being added as an afterthought.</p>
<p><b>With great pomp </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα πολλης φαντασιας</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φαντασια</span></span> is a <i>Koine</i> word (Polybius, Diodorus, etc.) from the old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανταζω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:21">Hebrews 12:21</span>) and it from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαινω</span></span>, common verb to show, to make an appearance. This is the only N.T. example of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαντασια</span></span>, though the kindred common word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαντασμα</span></span> (appearance) occurs twice in the sense of apparition or spectre (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:26">Matthew 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:49">Mark 6:49</span>). Herodotus (VII. 10) used the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανταζω</span></span> for a showy parade. Festus decided to gratify the wish of Agrippa by making the "hearing" of Paul the prisoner (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:22">Acts 25:22</span>) an occasion for paying a compliment to Agrippa (Rackham) by a public gathering of the notables in Caesarea. Festus just assumed that Paul would fall in with this plan for a grand entertainment though he did not have to do it.</p>
<p><b>Into the place of hearing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ακροατηριον</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακροαομα</span></span> (to be a hearer) and, like the Latin <i>auditorium</i>, in Roman law means the place set aside for hearing, and deciding cases. Here only in the N.T. Late word, several times in Plutarch and other <i>Koine</i> writers. The hearing was "semi-official" (Page) as is seen in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:26">Acts 25:26</span>.</p>
<p><b>With the chief captains </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν τε χιλιαρχοις</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χιλιαρχς</span></span>, each a leader of a thousand. There were five cohorts of soldiers stationed in Caesarea.</p>
<p><b>And the principal men of the city </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ανδρασιν τοις κατ' εξοχην</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ' εξοχην</span></span>, like our French phrase <i>par excellence</i>, occurs here only in the N.T., and not in the ancient Greek, but it is found in inscriptions of the first century A.D. (Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εξοχη</span></span> in medical writers is any protuberance or swelling. Cf. our phrase "outstanding men."</p>
<p><b>At the command of Festus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κελευσαντος του Φηστου</span></span>). Genitive absolute again, "Festus having commanded." </p>
