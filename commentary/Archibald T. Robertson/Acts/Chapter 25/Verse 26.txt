<p><b> No certain thing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασφαλες τι--ου</span></span>). Nothing definite or reliable (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφαλλω</span></span>, to trip). All the charges of the Sanhedrin slipped away or were tripped up by Paul. Festus confesses that he had nothing left and thereby convicts himself of gross insincerity in his proposal to Paul in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:9">Acts 25:9</span> about going up to Jerusalem. By his own statement he should have set Paul free. The various details here bear the marks of the eyewitness. Luke was surely present and witnessed this grand spectacle with Paul as chief performer.</p>
<p><b>Unto my lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω κυριω</span></span>). Augustus (Octavius) and Tiberius refused the title of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριος</span></span> (lord) as too much like <i>rex</i> (king) and like master and slave, but the servility of the subjects gave it to the other emperors who accepted it (Nero among them). Antoninus Pius put it on his coins. Deissmann (<i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 105) gives an ostracon dated Aug. 4, A.D. 63 with the words "in the year nine of Nero the lord" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενατου Νερωνος του κυριου</span></span>). Deissmann (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 349ff.) runs a most interesting parallel "between the cult of Christ and the cult of Caesar in the application of the term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριος</span></span>, lord" in ostraca, papyri, inscriptions. Beyond a doubt Paul has all this fully in mind when he says in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span> that "no one is able to say <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος Ιησους</span></span> except in the Holy Spirit" (cf. also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:11">Philippians 2:11</span>). The Christians claimed this word for Christ and it became the test in the Roman persecutions as when Polycarp steadily refused to say " Lord Caesar" and insisted on saying "Lord Jesus" when it meant his certain death.</p>
<p><b>Before you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφ' υμων</span></span>). The whole company. In no sense a new trial, but an examination in the presence of these prominent men to secure data and to furnish entertainment and pleasure to Agrippa (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:22">Acts 25:22</span>).</p>
<p><b>Especially before thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλιστα επ σου</span></span>). Out of courtesy. It was the main reason as verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:22">Acts 25:22</span> shows. Agrippa was a Jew and Festus was glad of the chance to see what he thought of Paul's case.</p>
<p><b>After examination had </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της ανακρισεως γενομενης</span></span>). Genitive absolute, "the examination having taken place." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ανακρισις</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακρινω</span></span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:19">Acts 12:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:8">Acts 24:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:18">Acts 28:18</span>) is a legal term for preliminary examination. Only here in the N.T. Inscriptions and papyri give it as examination of slaves or other property.</p>
<p><b>That I may have somewhat to write </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως σχω τ γραψω</span></span>). Ingressive aorist subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχω</span></span> (may get) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως</span></span> (final particle like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ γραψω</span></span> in indirect question after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχω</span></span> is either future indicative or aorist subjunctive (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1045). Festus makes it plain that this is not a "trial," but an examination for his convenience to help him out of a predicament. </p>
