<p><b> Unreasonable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλογον</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span> (reason, speech). "Without reason" as of animals (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:10">Judges 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:12">2 Peter 2:12</span>), "contrary to reason" here. These the only N.T. instances and in harmony with ancient usage.</p>
<p><b>In sending </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεμποντα</span></span>). Note accusative case with the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημανα</span></span> though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μο</span></span> (dative) just before. Cf. same variation in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17">Acts 22:17</span>.</p>
<p><b>Signify </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημανα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive (not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημηνα</span></span>, the old form) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημαινω</span></span>, to give a sign (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>The charges </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας αιτιας</span></span>). This naive confession of Festus reveals how unjust has been his whole treatment of Paul. He had to send along with the appeal of Paul <i>litterae dimissoriae</i> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολ</span></span>) which would give a statement of the case (Page). </p>
