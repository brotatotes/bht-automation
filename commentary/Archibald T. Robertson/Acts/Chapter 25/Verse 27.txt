 Unreasonable  (αλογον). Old word from α privative and λογος (reason, speech). "Without reason" as of animals (Judges 1:10; 2 Peter 2:12), "contrary to reason" here. These the only N.T. instances and in harmony with ancient usage.In sending  (πεμποντα). Note accusative case with the infinitive σημανα though μο (dative) just before. Cf. same variation in Acts 15:22; Acts 22:17.Signify  (σημανα). First aorist active infinitive (not σημηνα, the old form) of σημαινω, to give a sign (σημειον).The charges  (τας αιτιας). This naive confession of Festus reveals how unjust has been his whole treatment of Paul. He had to send along with the appeal of Paul litterae dimissoriae (αποστολ) which would give a statement of the case (Page).
