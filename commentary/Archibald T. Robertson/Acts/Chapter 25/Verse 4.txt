<p><b> Howbeit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν ουν</span></span>). No antithesis expressed, though Page considers <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:6">Acts 25:6</span> to be one. They probably argued that it was easier for one man (Paul) to come to Jerusalem than for many to go down there. But Festus was clearly suspicious (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:6">Acts 25:6</span>) and was wholly within his rights to insist that they make their charges in Caesarea where he held court.</p>
<p><b>Was kept in charge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρεισθα</span></span>). Present passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρεω</span></span> in indirect assertion. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hοτ</span></span> with finite verb is more common after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκρινομα</span></span>, but the infinitive with the accusative of general reference is proper as here (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1036).</p>
<p><b>Shortly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ταχε</span></span>). In quickness, in speed. Old and common usage, seen already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:8">Luke 18:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:7">Acts 12:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:18">Acts 22:18</span>. Festus is clearly within his rights again since his stay in Caesarea had been so brief. He did go down in "eight or ten days" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:6">Acts 25:6</span>). Luke did not consider the matter important enough to be precise. </p>
