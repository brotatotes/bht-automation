<p><b> While Paul said in his defence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του Παυλου απολογουμενου</span></span>). Genitive absolute again, present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολογεομα</span></span>, old verb to make defence as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:33">Acts 19:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:10">Acts 24:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:1">Acts 26:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:2">Acts 26:2</span>. The recitative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> of the Greek before a direct quotation is not reproduced in English.</p>
<p><b>Have I sinned at all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ημαρτον</span></span>). Constative aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτανω</span></span>, to miss, to sin. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span> is cognate accusative (or adverbial accusative). Either makes sense. Paul sums up the charges under the three items of law of the Jews, the temple, the Roman state (Caesar). This last was the one that would interest Festus and, if proved, would render Paul guilty of treason (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαjεστας</span></span>). Nero was Emperor A.D. 54-68, the last of the emperors with any hereditary claim to the name "Caesar." Soon it became merely a title like Kaiser and Czar (modern derivatives). In Acts only "Caesar" and "Augustus" are employed for the Emperor, not "King" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βασιλευς</span></span>) as from the time of Domitian. Paul's denial is complete and no proof had been presented. Luke was apparently present at the trial. </p>
