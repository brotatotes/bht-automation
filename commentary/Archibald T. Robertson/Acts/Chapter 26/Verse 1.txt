<p><b> Thou art permitted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτρεπετα σο</span></span>). Literally, It is permitted thee. As if Agrippa were master of ceremonies instead of Festus. Agrippa as a king and guest presides at the grand display while Festus has simply introduced Paul.</p>
<p><b>For thyself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ σεαυτου</span></span>). Some MSS. have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> (concerning). Paul is allowed to speak in his own behalf. No charges are made against him. In fact, Festus has admitted that he has no real proof of any charges.</p>
<p><b>Stretched forth his hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτεινας την χειρα</span></span>). Dramatic oratorical gesture (not for silence as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:17">Acts 12:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:16">Acts 13:16</span>) with the chain still upon it (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:29">Acts 26:29</span>) linking him to the guard. First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτεινω</span></span>, to stretch out.</p>
<p><b>Made his defence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απελογειτο</span></span>). Inchoative imperfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολογεομα</span></span> (middle), "began to make his defence." This is the fullest of all Paul's defences. He has no word of censure of his enemies or of resentment, but seizes the opportunity to preach Christ to such a distinguished company which he does with "singular dignity" (Furneaux). He is now bearing the name of Christ "before kings" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span>). In general Paul follows the line of argument of the speech on the stairs (chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:22">Acts 26:22</span>). </p>
