<p><b> I both shut up many </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλους τε κατεκλεισα</span></span>). Effective aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακλειω</span></span>, old word to shut down like a trap door, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:20">Luke 3:20</span>. Double use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε</span></span> (both--and).</p>
<p><b>Having received authority from the chief priests </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την παρα των αρχιερεων εξουσιαν λαβων</span></span>). "The authority," he says. Paul was the official persecutor of the saints under the direction of the Sanhedrin. He mentions "chief priests" (Sadducees), though a Pharisee himself. Both parties were co-operating against the saints.</p>
<p><b>And when they were put to death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναιρουμενων τε αυτων</span></span>). Genitive absolute with present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναιρεω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>I gave my vote against them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηνεγκα ψηφον</span></span>). "I cast down my pebble" (a black one). The ancient Greeks used white pebbles for acquittal (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>), black ones for condemnation as here (the only two uses of the word in the N.T.). Paul's phrase (not found elsewhere) is more vivid than the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταψηφιζω</span></span> for voting. They literally cast the pebbles into the urn. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμψηφιζω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:19">Acts 19:19</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συγκαταψεφιζο</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:26">Acts 1:26</span>. If Paul's language is taken literally here, he was a member of the Sanhedrin and so married when he led the persecution. That is quite possible, though he was not married when he wrote <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:7">1 Corinthians 7:7</span>, but a widower. It is possible to take the language figuratively for approval, but not so natural. </p>
