 I both shut up many  (πολλους τε κατεκλεισα). Effective aorist active of κατακλειω, old word to shut down like a trap door, in N.T. only here and Luke 3:20. Double use of τε (both--and).Having received authority from the chief priests  (την παρα των αρχιερεων εξουσιαν λαβων). "The authority," he says. Paul was the official persecutor of the saints under the direction of the Sanhedrin. He mentions "chief priests" (Sadducees), though a Pharisee himself. Both parties were co-operating against the saints.And when they were put to death  (αναιρουμενων τε αυτων). Genitive absolute with present passive participle of αναιρεω.I gave my vote against them  (κατηνεγκα ψηφον). "I cast down my pebble" (a black one). The ancient Greeks used white pebbles for acquittal (Revelation 2:17), black ones for condemnation as here (the only two uses of the word in the N.T.). Paul's phrase (not found elsewhere) is more vivid than the usual καταψηφιζω for voting. They literally cast the pebbles into the urn. Cf. συμψηφιζω in Acts 19:19, συγκαταψεφιζο in Acts 1:26. If Paul's language is taken literally here, he was a member of the Sanhedrin and so married when he led the persecution. That is quite possible, though he was not married when he wrote 1 Corinthians 7:7, but a widower. It is possible to take the language figuratively for approval, but not so natural.
