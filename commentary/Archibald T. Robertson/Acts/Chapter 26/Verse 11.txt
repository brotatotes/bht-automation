 Punishing  (τιμωρων). Old word τιμωρεω originally to render help, to succor (τιμωρος, from τιμη and ουρος), then to avenge (for honour). In N.T. only here and Acts 22:5.I strove to make them blaspheme  (ηναγκαζον βλασφημειν). Conative imperfect active of αναγκαζω, old verb from αναγκη (necessity, compulsion). The tense, like the imperfect in Matthew 3:14; Luke 1:59, leaves room to hope that Paul was not successful in this effort, for he had already said that he brought many "unto death" (Acts 22:4).I persecuted  (εδιωκον). Imperfect active again, repeated attempts. The old verb διωκω was used to run after or chase game and then to chase enemies. The word "persecute" is the Latin persequor, to follow through or after. It is a vivid picture that Paul here paints of his success in hunting big game, a grand heresy hunt.Even unto foreign cities  (κα εις εξω πολεις). We know of Damascus, and Paul evidently planned to go to other cities outside of Palestine and may even have done so before the fateful journey to Damascus.
