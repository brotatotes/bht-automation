<p><b> Punishing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμωρων</span></span>). Old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμωρεω</span></span> originally to render help, to succor (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμωρος</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμη</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουρος</span></span>), then to avenge (for honour). In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:5">Acts 22:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>I strove to make them blaspheme </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηναγκαζον βλασφημειν</span></span>). Conative imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγκαζω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγκη</span></span> (necessity, compulsion). The tense, like the imperfect in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:14">Matthew 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:59">Luke 1:59</span>, leaves room to hope that Paul was not successful in this effort, for he had already said that he brought many "unto death" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:4">Acts 22:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>I persecuted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιωκον</span></span>). Imperfect active again, repeated attempts. The old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωκω</span></span> was used to run after or chase game and then to chase enemies. The word "persecute" is the Latin <i>persequor</i>, to follow through or after. It is a vivid picture that Paul here paints of his success in hunting big game, a grand heresy hunt.</p>
<p><b>Even unto foreign cities </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εις εξω πολεις</span></span>). We know of Damascus, and Paul evidently planned to go to other cities outside of Palestine and may even have done so before the fateful journey to Damascus. </p>
