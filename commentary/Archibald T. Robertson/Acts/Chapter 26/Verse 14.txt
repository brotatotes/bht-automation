<p><b> When we were all fallen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντων καταπεσοντων ημων</span></span>). Genitive absolute with second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταπιπτω</span></span>. In the Hebrew language (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη Εβραιδ διαλεκτω</span></span>). Natural addition here, for Paul is speaking in Greek, not Aramaic as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:2">Acts 22:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>It is hard for thee to kick against the goad </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκληρον σο προς κεντρα λακτιζειν</span></span>). Genuine here, but not in chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:9">Acts 26:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:22">Acts 26:22</span>. A common proverb as Aeschylus <i>Ag</i>. 1624: <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προς κεντρα μη λακτιζε</span></span>. "It is taken from an ox that being pricked with a goad kicks and receives a severer wound" (Page). Cf. the parables of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:35">Matthew 13:35</span>). Blass observes that Paul's mention of this Greek and Latin proverb is an indication of his culture. Besides he mentions (not invents) it here rather than in chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:22">Acts 26:22</span> because of the culture of this audience. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κεντρον</span></span> means either sting as of bees (II Macc. 14:19) and so of death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:55">1 Corinthians 15:55</span>) or an iron goad in the ploughman's hand as here (the only two N.T. examples). Note plural here (goads) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λακτιζειν</span></span> is present active infinitive so that the idea is "to keep on kicking against goads." This old verb means to kick with the heel (adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαξ</span></span>, with the heel), but only here in the N.T. There is a papyrus example of kicking (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λακτιζω</span></span>) with the feet against the door. </p>
