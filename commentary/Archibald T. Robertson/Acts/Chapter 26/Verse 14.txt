 When we were all fallen  (παντων καταπεσοντων ημων). Genitive absolute with second aorist active participle of καταπιπτω. In the Hebrew language (τη Εβραιδ διαλεκτω). Natural addition here, for Paul is speaking in Greek, not Aramaic as in Acts 22:2.It is hard for thee to kick against the goad  (σκληρον σο προς κεντρα λακτιζειν). Genuine here, but not in chapters Acts 26:9; Acts 26:22. A common proverb as Aeschylus Ag. 1624: Προς κεντρα μη λακτιζε. "It is taken from an ox that being pricked with a goad kicks and receives a severer wound" (Page). Cf. the parables of Jesus (Matthew 13:35). Blass observes that Paul's mention of this Greek and Latin proverb is an indication of his culture. Besides he mentions (not invents) it here rather than in chapter Acts 26:22 because of the culture of this audience. Κεντρον means either sting as of bees (II Macc. 14:19) and so of death (1 Corinthians 15:55) or an iron goad in the ploughman's hand as here (the only two N.T. examples). Note plural here (goads) and λακτιζειν is present active infinitive so that the idea is "to keep on kicking against goads." This old verb means to kick with the heel (adverb λαξ, with the heel), but only here in the N.T. There is a papyrus example of kicking (λακτιζω) with the feet against the door.
