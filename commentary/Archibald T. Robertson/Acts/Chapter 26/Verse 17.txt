<p><b> Delivering thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαιρουμενος σε</span></span>). Present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαιρεω</span></span>, old verb and usually so rendered, but the old Greek also uses it for "choose" as also in LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+48:10">Isaiah 48:10</span>). The papyri give examples of both meanings and either makes good sense here. God was continually rescuing Paul "out of the hands of Jews and Gentiles and Paul was a chosen vessel" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span>). Modern scholars are also divided. </p>
