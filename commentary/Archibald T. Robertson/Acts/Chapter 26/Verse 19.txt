 Wherefore  (οθεν). This relatival adverb (cf. Acts 14:26; Acts 28:13) gathers up all that Paul has said.I was not disobedient  (ουκ εγενομην απειθης). Litotes again, "I did not become (second aorist middle indicative of γινομα) disobedient" (απειθης, old word already in Luke 1:17).Unto the heavenly vision  (τη ουρανιω οπτασια). A later form of οψις, from οπταζω, in LXX, and in N.T. (Luke 1:22; Luke 24:23; Acts 26:19; 2 Corinthians 12:1). Only time that Paul uses it about seeing Christ on the Damascus road, but no reflection on the reality of the event.
