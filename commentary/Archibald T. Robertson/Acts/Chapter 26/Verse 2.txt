 I think myself happy  (ηγημα εμαυτον μακαριον). See on Matthew 5:3 for μακαριος. Blass notes that Paul, like Tertullus, begins with captatio benevolentiae, but absque adulatione. He says only what he can truthfully speak. For ηγημα see Philippians 3:7; 1 Timothy 6:1 (perfect middle indicative of ηγεομα), I have considered.That I am to make my defence  (μελλων απολογεισθα). Literally, "being about to make my defence."Whereof I am accused  (ων εγκαλουμα). Genitive with εγκαλουμα as in Acts 19:40 or by attraction from accusative of relative (α) to case of antecedent (παντων).
