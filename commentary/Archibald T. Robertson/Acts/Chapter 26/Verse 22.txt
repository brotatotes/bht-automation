<p><b> Having therefore obtained </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν τυχων</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυγχανω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>The help that is from God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επικουριας της απο του θεου</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επικουρεω</span></span>, to aid, and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επικουρος</span></span>, ally, assister. Only here in N.T. God is Paul's ally. All of the plots of the Jews against Paul had failed so far.</p>
<p><b>I stand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστηκα</span></span>). Second perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>, to place, intransitive to stand. Picturesque word (Page) of Paul's stability and fidelity (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:1">Philippians 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>Both to small and great </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μικρω τε κα μεγαλω</span></span>). Dative singular (rather than instrumental, taking <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρουμενος</span></span> middle, not passive) and use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε κα</span></span> links the two adjectives together in an inclusive way. These two adjectives in the singular (representative singular rather than plural) can apply to age (young and old) or to rank (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:18">Revelation 11:18</span>) as is specially suitable here with Festus and Agrippa present. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:10">Acts 8:10</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:11">Hebrews 8:11</span>) the phrase explains <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντες</span></span> (all).</p>
<p><b>Saying nothing but what </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν εκτος λεγων ων</span></span>). "Saying nothing outside of those things which." The ablative relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span> is attracted into the case of the unexpressed antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span> and so ablative after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτος</span></span> (adverbial preposition common in LXX, the papyri. In N.T. here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:18">1 Corinthians 6:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:27">1 Corinthians 15:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:2">2 Corinthians 12:2</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:29">Luke 16:29</span> about Moses and the prophets. </p>
