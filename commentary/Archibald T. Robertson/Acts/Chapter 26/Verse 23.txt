<p><b> How that the Christ must suffer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε παθητος ο Χριστος</span></span>). Literally, "if the Messiah is subject to suffering." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ε</span></span> can here mean "whether" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:15">Hebrews 7:15</span>. This use of a verbal in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-τος</span></span> for capability or possibility occurs in the N.T. alone in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παθητος</span></span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 157). This word occurs in Plutarch in this sense. It is like the Latin <i>patibilis</i> and is from <i>pascho</i>. Here alone in N.T. Paul is speaking from the Jewish point of view. Most rabbis had not rightly understood <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:53">Acts 26:53</span>. When the Baptist called Jesus "the Lamb of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>) it was a startling idea. It is not then "must suffer" here, but "can suffer." The Cross of Christ was a stumbling-block to the rabbis.</p>
<p><b>How that he first by the resurrection of the dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε πρωτος εξ αναστασεως νεκρων</span></span>). Same construction with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> (whether). This point Paul had often discussed with the Jews: "whether he (the Messiah) by a resurrection of dead people." Others had been raised from the dead, but Christ is the first (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτος</span></span>) who arose from the dead and no longer dies (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:19">Romans 6:19</span>) and proclaims light (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φως μελλε καταγγελλειν</span></span>). Paul is still speaking from the Jewish standpoint: "is about to (going to) proclaim light." See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span> for "light" and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:32">Luke 2:32</span>.</p>
<p><b>Both to the people and to the Gentiles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω τε λαω κα τοις εθνεσιν</span></span>). See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:17">Acts 26:17</span>. It was at the word Gentiles (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνη</span></span>) that the mob lost control of themselves in the speech from the stairs (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:21">Acts 22:21</span>). So it is here, only not because of that word, but because of the word "resurrection" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστασις</span></span>). </p>
