<p><b> As he thus made his defence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτα αυτου απολογουμενου</span></span>). Genitive absolute again with present middle participle. Paul was still speaking when Festus interrupted him in great excitement.</p>
<p><b>With a loud voice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγαλη τη φωνη</span></span>). Associative instrumental case showing manner (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 530) and the predicate use of the adjective, "with the voice loud" (elevated).</p>
<p><b>Thou art mad </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαινη</span></span>). Old verb for raving. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:20">John 10:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:15">Acts 12:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:23">1 Corinthians 14:23</span>. The enthusiasm of Paul was too much for Festus and then he had spoken of visions and resurrection from the dead (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:8">Acts 26:8</span>). "Thou art going mad" (linear present), Festus means.</p>
<p><b>Thy much learning doth turn thee to madness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα πολλα σε γραμματα εις μανιαν περιτρεπε</span></span>). "Is turning thee round." Old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιτρεπω</span></span>, but only here in N.T. Festus thought that Paul's "much learning" (="many letters," cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:15">John 7:15</span> of Jesus) of the Hebrew Scriptures to which he had referred was turning his head to madness (wheels in his head) and he was going mad right before them all. The old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μανια</span></span> (our mania, frenzy, cf. maniac) occurs here only in N.T. Note unusual position of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σε</span></span> between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραμματα</span></span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 418, 420) </p>
