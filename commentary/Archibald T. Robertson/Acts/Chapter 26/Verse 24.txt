Paul was still speaking when Festus interrupted him in great excitement.With a loud voice  (μεγαλη τη φωνη).

Old verb περιτρεπω, but only here in N.T. Festus thought that Paul's "much learning" (="many letters," cf. John 7:15 of Jesus) of the Hebrew Scriptures to which he had referred was turning his head to madness (wheels in his head) and he was going mad right before them all. The old word μανια (our mania, frenzy, cf. maniac) occurs here only in N.T. Note unusual position of σε between πολλα and γραμματα (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 418, 420)
