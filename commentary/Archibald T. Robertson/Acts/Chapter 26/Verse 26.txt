 For the king knoweth of these things  (επιστατα γαρ περ τουτων ο βασιλευς). Επιστατα (present middle probably Ionic form of εφιστημ) is a literary word and suits well here (cf. Acts 24:10).Freely  (παρρησιαζομενος). Present middle participle, speaking fully, making a clean breast of it. From παρρησια (παν, ρησις) (cf. Acts 13:46).Is hidden from him  (λανθανειν αυτον). Escapes his notice. Infinitive in indirect discourse after πειθομα (I am persuaded).
