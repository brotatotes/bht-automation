<p><b> With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ολιγω με πειθεις Χριστιανον ποιησα</span></span>). The Authorized rendering is impossible: "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εν ολιγω</span></span> does not mean "almost." That would require <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολιγου, παρ' ολιγον</span></span>, or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε ολιγου</span></span>. It is not clear, however, precisely what <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ολιγο</span></span> does mean. It may refer to time (in little time) or a short cut, but that does not suit well <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν μεγαλω</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:29">Acts 26:29</span>. Tyndale and Crammer rendered it "somewhat" (in small measure or degree). There are, alas, many "somewhat" Christians. Most likely the idea is "in (or with) small effort you are trying to persuade (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθεις</span></span>, conative present active indicative) me in order to make me a Christian." This takes the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησα</span></span> to be purpose (Page renders it by "so as") and thus avoids trying to make <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησα</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσθα</span></span> (become). The aorist is punctiliar action for single act, not "perfect." The tone of Agrippa is ironical, but not unpleasant. He pushes it aside with a shrug of the shoulders. The use of "Christian" is natural here as in the other two instances (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:16">1 Peter 4:16</span>). </p>
