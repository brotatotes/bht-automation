 With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian  (εν ολιγω με πειθεις Χριστιανον ποιησα). The Authorized rendering is impossible: "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian." Εν ολιγω does not mean "almost." That would require ολιγου, παρ' ολιγον, or δε ολιγου. It is not clear, however, precisely what εν ολιγο does mean. It may refer to time (in little time) or a short cut, but that does not suit well εν μεγαλω in verse Acts 26:29. Tyndale and Crammer rendered it "somewhat" (in small measure or degree). There are, alas, many "somewhat" Christians. Most likely the idea is "in (or with) small effort you are trying to persuade (πειθεις, conative present active indicative) me in order to make me a Christian." This takes the infinitive ποιησα to be purpose (Page renders it by "so as") and thus avoids trying to make ποιησα like γενεσθα (become). The aorist is punctiliar action for single act, not "perfect." The tone of Agrippa is ironical, but not unpleasant. He pushes it aside with a shrug of the shoulders. The use of "Christian" is natural here as in the other two instances (Acts 11:26; 1 Peter 4:16).
