 I would to God  (ευξαιμην αν τω θεω). Conclusion of fourth-class condition (optative with αν), undetermined with less likelihood, the so-called potential optative (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1021). Polite and courteous wish (first aorist middle optative of ευχομα).Whether with little or with much  (κα εν μικρω κα εν μεγαλω). Literally, "both in little and in great," or "both with little and with great pains" or "both in some measure and in great measure." Paul takes kindly the sarcasm of Agrippa.Such as I am  (τοιουτους οποιος κα εγω ειμ). Accusative τοιουτους with the infinitive γενεσθα. Paul uses these two qualitative pronouns instead of repeating the word "Christian."Except these bonds  (παρεκτος των δεσμων τουτων). Ablative case with παρεκτος (late preposition for the old παρεκ). Paul lifts his right manacled hand with exquisite grace and good feeling.
