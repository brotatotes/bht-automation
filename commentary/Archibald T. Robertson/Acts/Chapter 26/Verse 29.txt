<p><b> I would to God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευξαιμην αν τω θεω</span></span>). Conclusion of fourth-class condition (optative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span>), undetermined with less likelihood, the so-called potential optative (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1021). Polite and courteous wish (first aorist middle optative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχομα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Whether with little or with much </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εν μικρω κα εν μεγαλω</span></span>). Literally, "both in little and in great," or "both with little and with great pains" or "both in some measure and in great measure." Paul takes kindly the sarcasm of Agrippa.</p>
<p><b>Such as I am </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοιουτους οποιος κα εγω ειμ</span></span>). Accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοιουτους</span></span> with the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσθα</span></span>. Paul uses these two qualitative pronouns instead of repeating the word "Christian."</p>
<p><b>Except these bonds </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεκτος των δεσμων τουτων</span></span>). Ablative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεκτος</span></span> (late preposition for the old <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεκ</span></span>). Paul lifts his right manacled hand with exquisite grace and good feeling. </p>
