<p><b> Especially because thou art expert </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλιστα γνωστην οντα σε</span></span>). Or like the margin, "because thou art especially expert," according as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλιστα</span></span> is construed. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γνωστην</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span> and means a knower, expert, connoisseur. Plutarch uses it and Deissmann (<i>Light</i>, etc., p. 367) restores it in a papyrus. Agrippa had the care of the temple, the appointment of the high priest, and the care of the sacred vestments. But the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οντα σε</span></span> gives trouble here coming so soon after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σου</span></span> (genitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>). Some MSS. insert <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισταμενος</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδως</span></span> (knowing) but neither is genuine. Page takes it as "governed by the sense of thinking or considering." Knowling considers it an anacoluthon. Buttmann held it to be an accusative absolute after the old Greek idiom. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τυχον</span></span> is such an instance though used as an adverb (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:6">1 Corinthians 16:6</span>). It is possible that one exists in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>. See other examples discussed in Robertson's <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 490f.</p>
<p><b>Customs and questions </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθων τε κα ζητηματων</span></span>). Both <i>consuetudinum in practicis</i> and <i>quaestionum in theoreticis</i> (Bengel). Agrippa was qualified to give Paul an understanding and a sympathetic hearing. Paul understands perfectly the grand-stand play of the whole performance, but he refused to be silent and chose to use this opportunity, slim as it seemed, to get a fresh hearing for his own case and to present the claims of Christ to this influential man. His address is a masterpiece of noble apologetic.</p>
<p><b>Patiently </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακροθυμως</span></span>). Adverb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακροθυμος</span></span>. Only here in the N.T., though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακροθυμια</span></span> occurs several times. Vulgate has <i>longanimiter</i>. Long spirit, endurance, opposite of impatience. So Paul takes his time. </p>
