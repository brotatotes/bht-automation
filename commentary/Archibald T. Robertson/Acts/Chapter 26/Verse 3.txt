 Especially because thou art expert  (μαλιστα γνωστην οντα σε). Or like the margin, "because thou art especially expert," according as μαλιστα is construed. Γνωστην is from γινωσκω and means a knower, expert, connoisseur. Plutarch uses it and Deissmann (Light, etc., p. 367) restores it in a papyrus. Agrippa had the care of the temple, the appointment of the high priest, and the care of the sacred vestments. But the accusative οντα σε gives trouble here coming so soon after σου (genitive with επ). Some MSS. insert επισταμενος or ειδως (knowing) but neither is genuine. Page takes it as "governed by the sense of thinking or considering." Knowling considers it an anacoluthon. Buttmann held it to be an accusative absolute after the old Greek idiom. Τυχον is such an instance though used as an adverb (1 Corinthians 16:6). It is possible that one exists in Ephesians 1:18. See other examples discussed in Robertson's Grammar, pp. 490f.Customs and questions  (εθων τε κα ζητηματων). Both consuetudinum in practicis and quaestionum in theoreticis (Bengel). Agrippa was qualified to give Paul an understanding and a sympathetic hearing. Paul understands perfectly the grand-stand play of the whole performance, but he refused to be silent and chose to use this opportunity, slim as it seemed, to get a fresh hearing for his own case and to present the claims of Christ to this influential man. His address is a masterpiece of noble apologetic.Patiently  (μακροθυμως). Adverb from μακροθυμος. Only here in the N.T., though μακροθυμια occurs several times. Vulgate has longanimiter. Long spirit, endurance, opposite of impatience. So Paul takes his time.
