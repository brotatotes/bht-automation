<p><b> They spake one to another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλουν προς αλληλους</span></span>). Imperfect active, describing the eager conversation of the dignitaries about Paul's wonderful speech.</p>
<p><b>Nothing worthy of death or bonds </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν θανατου η δεσμων αξιον</span></span>). This is the unanimous conclusion of all these dignitaries (Romans, Jews, Greeks) as it was of Festus before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:25">Acts 25:25</span>). But Paul had not won any of them to Christ. The conclusion leaves Festus in a predicament. Why had he not set Paul free before this? </p>
