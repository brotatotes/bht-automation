<p><b> This man might have been set at liberty </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Απολελυσθα εδυνατο ο ανθρωπος ουτος</span></span>). Conclusion of the second class condition (determined as unfulfilled) without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:19">Acts 24:19</span> because of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδυνατο</span></span> (verb of possibility, Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1014). Note perfect passive infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολελυσθα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολυω</span></span>. He certainly "could have been set free." Why was it not done?</p>
<p><b>If he had not appealed unto Caesar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη επεκεκλητο Καισαρα</span></span>). Condition of the second class with the past perfect middle indicative (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 1015) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επικαλεω</span></span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:11">Acts 25:11</span>). But Paul <i>only</i> appealed to Caesar after Festus had tried to shift him back to Jerusalem and had refused to set him free in Caesarea. Festus comes out with no honour in the case. Since Agrippa was a favourite at court perhaps Festus would be willing to write favourably to Caesar. </p>
