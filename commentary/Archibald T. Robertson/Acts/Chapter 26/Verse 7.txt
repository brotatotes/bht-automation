<p><b> Our twelve tribes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το δωδεκαφυλον ημων</span></span>). A word found only here in N.T. and in Christian and Jewish writings, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωδεκαμηνον</span></span> (twelve month) is common in the papyri and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεκαφυλος</span></span> (ten tribes) in Herodotus. Paul's use of this word for the Jewish people, like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταις δωδεκα φυλαις</span></span>, the twelve tribes), shows that Paul had no knowledge of any "lost ten tribes." There is a certain national pride and sense of unity in spite of the dispersion (Page).</p>
<p><b>Earnestly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εκτενεια</span></span>). A late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτεινω</span></span>, to stretch out, only here in N.T., but in papyri and inscriptions. Page refers to Simeon and Anna (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:25-28">Luke 2:25-28</span>) as instances of Jews looking for the coming of the Messiah. Note the accusative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυκτα κα ημεραν</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:31">Acts 20:31</span>.</p>
<p><b>Hope to attain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελπιζε καταντησα</span></span>). This Messianic hope had been the red thread running through Jewish history. Today, alas, it is a sadly worn thread for Jews who refuse to see the Messiah in Jesus.</p>
<p><b>I am accused by Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγκαλουμα υπο Ιουδαιων</span></span>). The very word used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:28">Acts 23:28</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεκαλουν</span></span>) which see, and by Jews of all people in the world whose mainspring was this very "hope." It is a tremendously effective turn. </p>
