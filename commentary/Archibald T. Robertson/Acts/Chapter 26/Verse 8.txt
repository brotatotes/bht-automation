<p><b> Incredible with you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιστον παρ' υμιν</span></span>). This old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιστον</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστος</span></span>) means either unfaithful (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:46">Luke 12:46</span>), unbelieving (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:27">John 20:27</span>), or unbelievable as here). Paul turns suddenly from Agrippa to the audience (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ' υμιν</span></span>, plural), most of whom were probably Gentiles and scouted the doctrine of the resurrection as at Athens (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:32">Acts 17:32</span>).</p>
<p><b>If God doth raise the dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε ο θεος νεκρους εγειρε</span></span>). Condition of the first class assuming that God does raise dead people. Only God can do it. This rhetorical question needs no answer, though the narrative resumed in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:9">Acts 26:9</span> does it in a way. </p>
