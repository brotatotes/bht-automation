<p><b> I verily thought with myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω μεν ουν εδοξα εμαυτω</span></span>). Personal construction instead of the impersonal, a touch of the literary style. Paul's "egoism" is deceived as so often happens.</p>
<p><b>I ought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειν</span></span>). Infinitive the usual construction with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκεω</span></span>. Necessity and a sense of duty drove Paul on even in this great sin (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:1">Acts 23:1</span>), a common failing with persecutors.</p>
<p><b>Contrary </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εναντια</span></span>). Old word (adjective), over against, opposite (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:4">Acts 27:4</span>), then hostile to as here. </p>
