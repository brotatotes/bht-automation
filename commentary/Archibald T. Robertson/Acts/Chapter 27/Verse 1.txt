<p><b> That we should sail </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του αποπλειν ημας</span></span>). This genitive articular infinitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκριθη</span></span> like the LXX construction translating the Hebrew infinitive construct is awkward in Greek. Several similar examples in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:1">Luke 17:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:25">Acts 10:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:3">Acts 20:3</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1068). Luke alone uses this old verb in N.T. He uses nine compounds of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεω</span></span>, to sail. Note the reappearance of "we" in the narrative. It is possible, of course, that Luke was not with Paul during the series of trials at Caesarea, or at least, not all the time. But it is natural for Luke to use "we" again because he and Aristarchus are travelling with Paul. In Caesarea Paul was the centre of the action all the time whether Luke was present or not. The great detail and minute accuracy of Luke's account of this voyage and shipwreck throw more light upon ancient seafaring than everything else put together. Smith's <i>Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul</i> is still a classic on the subject. Though so accurate in his use of sea terms, yet Luke writes like a landsman, not like a sailor. Besides, the character of Paul is here revealed in a remarkable fashion.</p>
<p><b>They delivered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδιδουν</span></span>). Imperfect active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωμεγα</span></span> form rather than the old <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-μ</span></span> form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδιδοσαν</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:33">Acts 4:33</span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδωμ</span></span>. Perhaps the imperfect notes the continuance of the handing over.</p>
<p><b>Certain other prisoners </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινας ετερους δεσμωτας</span></span>). Bound (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεσμωτας</span></span>) like Paul, but not necessarily appellants to Caesar, perhaps some of them condemned criminals to amuse the Roman populace in the gladiatorial shows, most likely pagans though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερους</span></span> does not have to mean different kind of prisoners from Paul.</p>
<p><b>Of the Augustan band </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπειρης Σεβαστης</span></span>). Note Ionic genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπειρης</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπειρας</span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:1">Matthew 27:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1">Acts 10:1</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χοορτις Αυγυσταε</span></span>. We do not really know why this cohort is called "Augustan." It may be that it is part of the imperial commissariat (<i>frumentarii</i>) since Julius assumes chief authority in the grain ship (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:11">Acts 27:11</span>). These legionary centurions when in Rome were called <i>peregrini</i> (foreigners) because their work was chiefly in the provinces. This man Julius may have been one of them. </p>
