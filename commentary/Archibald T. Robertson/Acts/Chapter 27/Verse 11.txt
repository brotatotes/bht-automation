<p><b> Gave more heed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλλον επειθετο</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθω</span></span>, to yield to (with the dative case). The "Frumentarian" centurion ranked above the captain and owner. As a military officer the centurion was responsible for the soldiers, the prisoners, and the cargo of wheat. It was a government ship. Though the season was not advanced, the centurion probably feared to risk criticism in Rome for timidity when the wheat was so much needed in Rome (Knowling).</p>
<p><b>To the master </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω κυβερνητη</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυβερναω</span></span>, to steer, and so steersman, pilot, sailing-master. Common in this sense in the papyri. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:17">Revelation 18:17</span>.</p>
<p><b>And to the owner of the ship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τω ναυκληρω</span></span>). Old word compounded of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναυς</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κληρος</span></span> and used for owner of the ship who acted as his own skipper or captain. The papyri examples (Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>) all have the meaning "captain" rather than "owner." </p>
