<p><b> Because the haven was not commodious to winter in </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανευθετου του λιμενος υπαρχοντος προς παραχειμασιαν</span></span>). Genitive absolute again present tense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαρχω</span></span>: "The harbour being unfit (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανευθετου</span></span>, this compound not yet found elsewhere, simplex in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:62">Luke 9:62</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:35">Luke 14:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:7">Hebrews 6:7</span>) for wintering" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραχειμασια</span></span>, only here in N.T., but in Polybius and Diodorus, in an inscription A.D. 48, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραχειμαζω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>The more part advised </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πλειονες εθεντο βουλην</span></span>). Second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>, ancient idiom with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλην</span></span>, to take counsel, give counsel. Lysias held a council of the officers of the ship on the issue raised by Paul.</p>
<p><b>If by any means they could reach Phoenix and winter there </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε πως δυναιντο καταντησαντες εις Φοινικα παραχειμασα</span></span>). The optative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναιντο</span></span> (present middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμα</span></span>) here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> is a condition of the fourth class with the notion of purpose implied and indirect discourse (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1021). "We vote for going on the chance that we may be able" (Page). Phoenix is the town of palms (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:13">John 12:13</span>), the modern Lutro, the only town in Crete on the southern coast with a harbour fit for wintering, though Wordsworth and Page argue for Phineka which suits Luke's description better. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραχειμαζω</span></span>, to winter, is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειμων</span></span> (see also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:11">Acts 28:11</span>). Used in several <i>Koine</i> writers.</p>
<p><b>Looking northeast and southeast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεποντα κατα λιβα κα κατα χωρον</span></span>). There are two ways of interpreting this language. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λιπς</span></span> means the southwest wind and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρος</span></span> the northwest wind. But what is the effect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> with these words? Does it mean "facing" the wind? If so, we must read "looking southwest and northwest." But <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> can mean down the line of the wind (the way the wind is blowing). If so, then it is proper to translate "looking northeast and southeast." This translation suits Lutro, the other suits Phoenike. Ramsay takes it to be Lutro, and suggests that sailors describe the harbour by the way it looks as they go into it (the subjectivity of the sailors) and that Luke so speaks and means Lutro which faces northeast and southeast. On the whole Lutro has the best of the argument. </p>
