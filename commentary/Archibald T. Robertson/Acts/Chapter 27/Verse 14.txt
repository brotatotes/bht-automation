<p><b> After no long time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετ' ου πολυ</span></span>). Litotes again.</p>
<p><b>Beat down from it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβαλεν κατ' αυτης</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλω</span></span>, to throw. Here "dashed" (intransitive). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αυτης</span></span> is in the ablative, not genitive case, beat "down from it" (Crete), not "against it or on it." (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 606). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αυτης</span></span> cannot refer to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλοιον</span></span> (boat) which is neuter. So the ablative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:13">Mark 5:13</span>, Homer also. The Cretan mountains are over 7,000 feet high.</p>
<p><b>A tempestuous wind which is called Euraquilo </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεμος τυφωνικος ο καλουμενος Ευρακυλων</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τυφων=Τυφως</span></span> was used for the typhoon, a violent whirlwind (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυρβο</span></span>) or squall. This word gives the character of the wind. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ευρακυλων</span></span> (reading of Aleph A B against the Textus Receptus <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ευροκλυδων</span></span>) has not been found elsewhere. Blass calls it a hybrid word compounded of the Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρος</span></span> (east wind) and the Latin <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αθυιλο</span></span> (northeast). It is made like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρονοτος</span></span> (southeast). The Vulgate has <i>euroaquilo</i>. It is thus the east north east wind. Page considers Euroclydon to be a corruption of Euraquilo. Here the name gives the direction of the wind. </p>
