<p><b> Running under the lee of </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποδραμοντες</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτρεχω</span></span>. Same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο</span></span> as in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεπλευσαμεν</span></span> (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:4">Acts 27:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:8">Acts 27:8</span>) for "under the lee", under the protection of. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Νησιον</span></span> is diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νησος</span></span>, a small island. The MSS. vary between Cauda (B) and Clauda (Aleph).</p>
<p><b>To secure the boat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περικρατεις γενεσθα της σκαφης</span></span>). "To become masters (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περικρατεις</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατος</span></span>, power over, found in Susannah and ecclesiastical writers, and here only in N.T.) of the boat ("dug out," like Indian boats, literally, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκαπτω</span></span>, to dig, old word, here only in N.T. and verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:30">Acts 27:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:32">Acts 27:32</span>). The smooth water behind the little island enabled them to do this.</p>
<p><b>When they had hoisted it up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην αραντες</span></span>). "Which (the little boat) having hoisted up (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αραντες</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:13">Acts 27:13</span>)." Even so it was "with difficulty" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μολις</span></span>). Perhaps the little boat was waterlogged.</p>
<p><b>Used helps </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βοηθειαις εχρωντο</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χραομα</span></span> with instrumental case. The "helps" were ropes or chains, no doubt.</p>
<p><b>Under-girding the ship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποζωννυντες το πλοιον</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποζωννυμ</span></span>. Old verb, here only in N.T. Probably cables (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποζωματα</span></span>) or ropes were used under the hull of the ship laterally or even longitudinally, tightly secured on deck. This "frapping" was more necessary for ancient vessels because of the heavy mast. The little island made it possible to do this also.</p>
<p><b>Lest we be cast upon the Syrtis </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη εις την Συρτιν εκπεσωσιν</span></span>). Final clause after verb of fearing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβουμενο</span></span>) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπιπτω</span></span>, old verb to fall out or off, to be cast away. So here and verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:26">Acts 27:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:29">Acts 27:29</span>, a classical use of the verb for a ship driven out of its course on to shoals or rocks (Page who cites Xenophon, <i>Anab</i>. VII. 5, 12). The Syrtis was the name for two quicksands between Carthage and Cyrenaica, this clearly being the Syrtis Major most dangerous because of the sandbanks (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συρτις</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συρω</span></span>). The wind would drive the ship right into this peril if something were not done.</p>
<p><b>They lowered the gear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλασαντες το σκευος</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλαω</span></span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:4">Luke 5:4</span> for lowering the nets). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σκευος</span></span> means vessel or gear. They slackened or reduced sail, especially the mainsail, but leaving enough to keep the ship's head as close to the wind as was practicable.</p>
<p><b>So were driven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως εφεροντο</span></span>). Imperfect passive indicative again as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:15">Acts 27:15</span> with the addition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως</span></span> (thus). The ship was now fixed as near to the wind (E N E) as possible (seven points). That would enable the ship to go actually W by N and so avoid the quicksands. J. Smith has shown that, a day being lost around Cauda, the ship going 36 miles in 24 hours in 13 days would make 468 miles. The Island of Malta (Melita) is precisely in that direction (W by N) from Cauda and is 480 miles. Page sees a difficulty about this explanation of the steady drift of the ship in the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαφερομενον</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:27">Acts 27:27</span>, but that was at the end of the drifting and the varied winds could have come then and not before. The whole narrative as explained carefully in Smith's <i>Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul</i> is a masterpiece of precise and accurate scholarship. A resume of his results appears in my <i>Luke the Historian in the Light of Research</i>. </p>
