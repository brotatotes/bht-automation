<p><b> In a ship of Adramyttium </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλοιω Hαδραμυντηνω</span></span>). A boat belonging to Adramyttium, a city in Mysia in the province of Asia. Probably a small coasting vessel on its way home for the winter stopping at various places (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοπους</span></span>). Julius would take his chances to catch another ship for Rome. The usual way to go to Rome was to go to Alexandria and so to Rome, but no large ship for Alexandria was at hand.</p>
<p><b>We put to sea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηχθημεν</span></span>). First aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγω</span></span>, usual word in Luke.</p>
<p><b>Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οντος συν ημιν Αρισταρχου Μακεδονος Θεσσαλονικεως</span></span>). Genitive absolute. Ramsay suggests that Luke and Aristarchus accompanied Paul as his slaves since they would not be allowed to go as his friends. But Luke was Paul's physician and may have gained permission on that score. </p>
