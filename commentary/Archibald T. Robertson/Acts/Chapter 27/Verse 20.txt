<p><b> When neither sun nor stars shone upon us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητε ηλιου μητε αστρων επιφαινοντων</span></span>). Genitive absolute again.</p>
<p><b>For many days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ πλειονας ημερας</span></span>). For more days than a few.</p>
<p><b>No small tempest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειμονος ουκ ολιγου</span></span>). Litotes again.</p>
<p><b>All hope that we should be saved was now taken away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λοιπον περιηιρειτο ελπις πασα του σωζεσθα ημας</span></span>). "For the rest (or future) there began to be taken from around us (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιηιρειτο</span></span> inchoative imperfect and see use of the verb in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:16">2 Corinthians 13:16</span> of the veil) all hope of the being saved so far as we were concerned." Despair was beginning to settle like a fog on all their hopes. Had Paul lost hope? </p>
