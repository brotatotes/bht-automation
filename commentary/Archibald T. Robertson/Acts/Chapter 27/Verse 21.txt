<p><b> When they had been long without food </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλης τε ασιτιας υπαρχουσης</span></span>). Genitive absolute, the old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασιτια</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασιτος</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:33">Acts 27:33</span>) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σιτος</span></span>, food, here alone in N.T. Literally, "There being much abstinence from food." They had plenty of grain on board, but no appetite to eat (sea-sickness) and no fires to cook it (Page). "Little heart being left for food" (Randall). Galen and other medical writers use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασιτια</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασιτος</span></span> for want of appetite.</p>
<p><b>Stood forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταθεις</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15">Acts 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:14">Acts 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:22">Acts 17:22</span>. Pictorial word (Page) that sets forth the vividness and solemnity of the scene (Knowling).</p>
<p><b>Ye should have hearkened unto me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδε μεν πειθαρχησαντας μο</span></span>). Literally, "It was necessary for you hearkening unto me not to set sail (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη αναγεσθα</span></span>)." It was not the "I told you so" of a small nature, "but a reference to the wisdom of his former counsel in order to induce acceptance of his present advice" (Furneaux). The first aorist active participle is in the accusative of general reference with the present infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγεσθα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>And have gotten this injury and loss </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδησα τε την υβριν ταυτην κα την ζημιαν</span></span>). This Ionic form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδησα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδαω</span></span>) rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδηνα</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδανα</span></span> is common in late Greek (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 349). The Revised Version thus carries over the negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> to this first aorist active infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδησα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδαω</span></span> (cf. on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:26">Matthew 16:26</span>). But Page follows Thayer in urging that this is not exact, that Paul means that by taking his advice they ought to have escaped this injury and loss. "A person is said in Greek 'to gain a loss' when, being in danger of incurring it, he by his conduct saves himself from doing so." This is probably Paul's idea here. </p>
