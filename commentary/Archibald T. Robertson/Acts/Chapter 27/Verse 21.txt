 When they had been long without food  (πολλης τε ασιτιας υπαρχουσης). Genitive absolute, the old word ασιτια from ασιτος (verse Acts 27:33) α privative and σιτος, food, here alone in N.T. Literally, "There being much abstinence from food." They had plenty of grain on board, but no appetite to eat (sea-sickness) and no fires to cook it (Page). "Little heart being left for food" (Randall). Galen and other medical writers use ασιτια and ασιτος for want of appetite.Stood forth  (σταθεις). As in Acts 1:15; Acts 2:14; Acts 17:22. Pictorial word (Page) that sets forth the vividness and solemnity of the scene (Knowling).Ye should have hearkened unto me  (εδε μεν πειθαρχησαντας μο). Literally, "It was necessary for you hearkening unto me not to set sail (μη αναγεσθα)." It was not the "I told you so" of a small nature, "but a reference to the wisdom of his former counsel in order to induce acceptance of his present advice" (Furneaux). The first aorist active participle is in the accusative of general reference with the present infinitive αναγεσθα.And have gotten this injury and loss  (κερδησα τε την υβριν ταυτην κα την ζημιαν). This Ionic form κερδησα (from κερδαω) rather than κερδηνα or κερδανα is common in late Greek (Robertson, Grammar, p. 349). The Revised Version thus carries over the negative μη to this first aorist active infinitive κερδησα from κερδαω (cf. on Matthew 16:26). But Page follows Thayer in urging that this is not exact, that Paul means that by taking his advice they ought to have escaped this injury and loss. "A person is said in Greek 'to gain a loss' when, being in danger of incurring it, he by his conduct saves himself from doing so." This is probably Paul's idea here.
