 For there stood by me  (παρεστη γαρ μο). Second aorist active (intransitive) indicative of παριστημ with the locative case (beside me). The very form used by Paul of his trial (2 Timothy 4:17) when "the Lord stood by me" (ο δε κυριος μο παρεστη) when others deserted him. This angel of the God whom Paul serves (in distinction from the heathen gods) is the reason for Paul's present confidence.
