<p><b> For there stood by me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεστη γαρ μο</span></span>). Second aorist active (intransitive) indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παριστημ</span></span> with the locative case (beside me). The very form used by Paul of his trial (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:17">2 Timothy 4:17</span>) when "the Lord stood by me" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε κυριος μο παρεστη</span></span>) when others deserted him. This angel of the God whom Paul serves (in distinction from the heathen gods) is the reason for Paul's present confidence. </p>
