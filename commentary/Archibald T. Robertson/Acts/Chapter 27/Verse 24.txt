 Thou must stand before Caesar  (Καισαρ σε δε παραστηνα). Note the same δε (must) as in Acts 23:11 when Jesus appeared to Paul in Jerusalem and the same verb παραστηνα (second aorist active infinitive) used in verse Acts 27:23.Hath granted thee  (κεχαριστα σο). Perfect middle indicative of χαριζομα and that from χαρις, a gift or grace. The lives of those that sailed with Paul God had spared as a gift (χαρις) to Paul.
