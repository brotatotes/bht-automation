<p><b> Wherefore be of good cheer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διο ευθυμειτε</span></span>). God had spoken. That was enough. This old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευθυμος</span></span> in the N.T. only here, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:25">Acts 27:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:13">James 5:13</span>. See the adjective <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:36">Acts 27:36</span>.</p>
<p><b>For I believe God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω γαρ τω θεω</span></span>). This is Paul's reason for his own good cheer and for his exhortation to confidence in spite of circumstances so untoward. Paul had doubtless prayed for his own life and for the lives of all. He was sure that he was to bear his witness in Rome. </p>
