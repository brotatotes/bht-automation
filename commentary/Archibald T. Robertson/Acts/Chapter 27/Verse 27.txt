<p><b>In the sea of Adria </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω Hαδρια</span></span>). Not the Adriatic Sea as we now call the sea between Italy and the mainland of Illyricum, but all the lower Mediterranean between Italy and Greece. Luke's usage is like that of Strabo.</p>
<p><b>Surmised </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπενοουν</span></span>). Imperfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπονοεω</span></span>, inchoative, began to suspect.</p>
<p><b>That they were drawing near to some country </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσαγειν τινα αυτοις χωραν</span></span>).
