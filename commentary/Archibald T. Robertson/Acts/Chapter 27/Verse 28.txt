<p><b> They sounded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βολισαντες</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βολιζω</span></span> rare verb only here and in Eustathius who says it was familiar in ancient Greek. Apparently from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βολις</span></span>, a missile or dart, and so to throw down the lead into the sea, to heave the lead, to take soundings. The inscriptions give <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βολιμος</span></span> for "leaden."</p>
<p><b>Twenty fathoms </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οργυιας εικοσ</span></span>). This old word, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορεγω</span></span>, to stretch, means the distance from one outstretched middle finger tip to the other likewise out-stretched.</p>
<p><b>After a little space </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βραχυ διαστησαντες</span></span>). Literally, "standing apart a little" (second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διιστημ</span></span>), that is, the ship going a short distance further on. A ship today approaching St. Paul's Bay by the rocky point of Koura would pass first twenty, then fifteen fathoms (Furneaux). </p>
