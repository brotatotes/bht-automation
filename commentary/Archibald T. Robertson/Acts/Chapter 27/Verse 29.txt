<p><b> Lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη που κατα τραχεις τοπους εκπεσωμεν</span></span>). The usual construction after a verb of fearing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the aorist subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπεσωμεν</span></span>). Literally, "Lest somewhere (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">που</span></span>) we should fall out down against (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>) rocky places." The change in the soundings made it a very real fear. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τραχεις</span></span> (rough) is old adjective, but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:5">Luke 3:5</span> (from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:4">Isaiah 40:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>Four anchors </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγκυρας τεσσαρας</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγκη</span></span>. In N.T. only in this chapter, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ριπτω</span></span> here, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτεινω</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:30">Acts 27:30</span>, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιαιρεω</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:40">Acts 27:40</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:19">Hebrews 6:19</span> (figuratively of hope).</p>
<p><b>From the stern </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ πρυμνης</span></span>). Old word, but in N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:38">Mark 4:38</span>; here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:41">Acts 27:41</span> in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωιρα</span></span> (prow). The usual practice was and is to anchor by the bows. "With a view to running the ship ashore anchoring from the stern would, it is said, be best" (Page). Nelson is quoted as saying that he had been reading <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:27">Acts 27:27</span> the morning of the Battle of Copenhagen (April, 1801) where he anchored his ships from the stern.</p>
<p><b>Wished for the day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηυχοντο</span></span>). Imperfect middle, kept on praying for "day to come" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεραν γενεσθα</span></span>) before the anchors broke under the strain of the storm or began to drag. If the ship had been anchored from the prow, it would have swung round and snapped the anchors or the stern would have faced the beach. </p>
