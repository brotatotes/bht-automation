 The sailors  (των ναυτων). Old word from ναυς (ship), in N.T. only here, verse Acts 27:30; Revelation 18:17.Were seeking  (ζητουντων). Genitive absolute again with present active participle of ζητεω to seek.Had lowered  (χαλασαντων). Aorist active participle of χαλαζω.Under colour  (προφασε). Possibly the same word as "prophecy" (from προ-φημ, to speak forth), but here pretence, pretext, although it may come from προφαινω, to show forth. The use here is an old one and appears also in Mark 12:40; Luke 20:47; 1 Thessalonians 2:5; Philippians 1:18.As though  (ως). The alleged reason, a common Greek idiom with ως and the participle (Robertson, Grammar, p. 966). Here with μελλοντων.From the foreship  (εκ πρωιρης). Old word for prow of the ship. In the N.T. only here and verse Acts 27:41. Note here εκτεινειν (lay out, stretch out) rather than ριψαντες (casting) in verse Acts 27:29, for they pretended to need the small boat to stretch out or lay out the anchors in front.
