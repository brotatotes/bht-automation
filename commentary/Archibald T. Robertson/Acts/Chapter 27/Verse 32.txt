<p><b> The ropes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα σχοινια</span></span>). Diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχοινος</span></span>, old word, but in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:15">John 2:15</span>. Paul is now saviour of the ship and the soldiers quickly cut loose the skiff and "let her fall off" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειασαν αυτην εκπεσειν</span></span>) rather than be the means of the escape of the sailors who were needed. This dastardly scheme of the sailors would have brought frightful loss of life. </p>
