<p><b> While the day was coming on </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ ου ημερα ημελλεν γινεσθα</span></span>). More likely here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ ου</span></span> (for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ τουτου ω</span></span>) with the imperfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημελλεν</span></span>, has its usual meaning, "until which time day was about to come on (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινεσθα</span></span>, present middle infinitive, linear action)." That is Paul kept on exhorting or beseeching (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεκαλε</span></span>, imperfect active) them until dawn began to come on (cf. verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:39">Acts 27:39</span> when day came). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:13">Hebrews 3:13</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ ου</span></span> with the present indicative has to mean "so long as" or while, but that is not true here (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 975). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:46">Acts 2:46</span> for the same phrase for partaking food (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταλαμβανω τροφης</span></span>, genitive case) as also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:34">Acts 27:34</span>. Paul wanted them to be ready for action when day really came. "Fourteenth day" repeated (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:27">Acts 27:27</span>), only here in the accusative of duration of time (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεραν</span></span>). It is not clear whether the "waiting" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσδοκωντες</span></span>, present active participle predicate nominative complementary participle after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διατελειτε</span></span>, Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1121) means fourteen days of continuous fasting or only fourteen successive nights of eager watching without food. Galen and Dionysius of Halicarnassus employ the very idiom used here by Luke (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασιτος διατελεω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Having taken nothing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηθεν προσλαβομενο</span></span>). Second aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσλαμβανω</span></span> with the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηθεν</span></span> rather than the more usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν</span></span>. Probably Paul means that they had taken no regular meals, only bits of food now and then. </p>
