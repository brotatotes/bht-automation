 For this is for your safety  (τουτο γαρ προς της υμετερας σωτηριας υπαρχε). Note σωτηρια in sense of "safety," literal meaning, not spiritual salvation. This is the only instance in the N.T. of the use of προς with the ablative meaning "from the side of" your safety, though a classic idiom (Robertson, Grammar, p. 623), an example of Luke's literary style.Perish  (απολειτα). Future middle (intransitive) of απολλυμ (-υω), to destroy. So the oldest MSS. rather than πεσειτα from πιπτω, to fall. This proverbial expression occurs also in Luke 21:18 which see and in 1 Samuel 14:45; 2 Samuel 14:11; 1 Kings 1:52.
