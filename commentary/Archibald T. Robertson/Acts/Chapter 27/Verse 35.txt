<p><b> Gave thanks to God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστησεν τω θεω</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστεω</span></span> from which our word "Eucharist" comes. It was saying grace like the head of a Hebrew family and the example of Paul would encourage the others to eat. Probably Paul, Luke, and Aristarchus had memories of the Lord's supper (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:42">Acts 2:42</span>) while to others it was only an ordinary meal (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:30">Luke 24:30</span>). </p>
