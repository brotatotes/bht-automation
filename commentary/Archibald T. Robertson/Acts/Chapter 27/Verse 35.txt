 Gave thanks to God  (ευχαριστησεν τω θεω). First aorist active indicative of ευχαριστεω from which our word "Eucharist" comes. It was saying grace like the head of a Hebrew family and the example of Paul would encourage the others to eat. Probably Paul, Luke, and Aristarchus had memories of the Lord's supper (Acts 2:42) while to others it was only an ordinary meal (Luke 24:30).
