<p><b> Two hundred three-score and sixteen souls </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακοσια εβδομηκοντα εξ</span></span>). The Vatican Manuscript (B) has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> in place of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακοσια</span></span> (two hundred) which Westcott and Hort put in the margin. But Alford is probably correct in suggesting that the scribe of B wrote <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> by repeating the omega in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλοιω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ς</span></span> = 200 (Greek numeral). If the number 276 seems large, it is to be remembered that we do not know the size of the ship. Josephus (<i>Life</i>, 3) says that there were 600 on the ship that took him to Italy. The grain ships were of considerable size. The number included sailors, soldiers, and prisoners. A muster or roll call may have been made. </p>
