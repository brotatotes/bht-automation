<p><b> They knew not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ επεγινωσκον</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγινωσκω</span></span>, to recognize. Probably conative, tried to recognize and could not (Conybeare and Howson). The island was well-known (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:1">Acts 28:1</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεγνωμεν</span></span>), but St. Paul's Bay where the wreck took place was some distance from the main harbour (Valetta) of Melita (Malta).</p>
<p><b>They perceived </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατενοουν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατανοεω</span></span>, gradually perceived after some effort as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:16">Acts 11:16</span>. This beach seemed their only hope.</p>
<p><b>They took counsel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβουλευοντο</span></span>). Imperfect middle showing the process of deliberation and doubt. The bay "having a beach" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχοντα αιγιαλον</span></span>) is a phrase found in Xenophon's <i>Anabasis</i> VI. 4, 4.</p>
<p><b>Whether they could drive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δυναιντο εκσωσα</span></span>). This use of the optative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> in questions of this sort (implied indirect) is a neat Greek idiom (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1021). B C Bohairic read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκσωσα</span></span> (first aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκσωζω</span></span>), to save out (so Westcott and Hort), instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξωσα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξωθεω</span></span>, to push out, as Textus Receptus). </p>
