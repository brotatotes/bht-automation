<p><b> We sailed under the lee of Cyprus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεπλευσαμεν την Κυπρον</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποπλεω</span></span>, to sail under. Cyprus was thus on the left between the ship and the wind from the northwest, under the protection of Cyprus.</p>
<p><b>Because the winds were contrary </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το τους ανεμους εινα εναντιους</span></span>). The articular infinitive after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> and the accusative of general reference (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεμους</span></span>) with predicate accusative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εναντιους</span></span>, facing them, in their very teeth if they went that way). The Etesian winds were blowing from the northwest so that they could not cut straight across from Sidon to Patara with Cyprus on the right. They must run behind Cyprus and hug the shore of Cilicia and Pamphylia. </p>
