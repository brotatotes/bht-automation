 We sailed under the lee of Cyprus  (υπεπλευσαμεν την Κυπρον). First aorist active indicative of υποπλεω, to sail under. Cyprus was thus on the left between the ship and the wind from the northwest, under the protection of Cyprus.Because the winds were contrary  (δια το τους ανεμους εινα εναντιους). The articular infinitive after δια and the accusative of general reference (ανεμους) with predicate accusative (εναντιους, facing them, in their very teeth if they went that way). The Etesian winds were blowing from the northwest so that they could not cut straight across from Sidon to Patara with Cyprus on the right. They must run behind Cyprus and hug the shore of Cilicia and Pamphylia.
