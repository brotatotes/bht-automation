<p><b> Casting off </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιελοντες</span></span>). Second aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιαιρεω</span></span>. Literally, "Having taken away from around," that is all four anchors from around the stern. Cf. the other verbs with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγκυρας</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:29">Acts 27:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:30">Acts 27:30</span>.</p>
<p><b>They left them in the sea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειων εις την θαλασσαν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαω</span></span>, either descriptive or inchoative. They let the anchors go and the ropes fell down into the sea.</p>
<p><b>At the same time loosing the bands of the rudders </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμα ανεντες τας ζευκτηριας των πηδαλιων</span></span>). On the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμα</span></span> with the participle, old Greek idiom see Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1139. The second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανιημ</span></span>, to relax, loosen up. Old verb, in N.T. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:26">Acts 16:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:40">Acts 27:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:9">Ephesians 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:5">Hebrews 13:5</span>. Thayer notes that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζευκτηριας</span></span> (bands) occurs nowhere else, but several papyri use it of yokes and waterwheels (Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>). The word for rudders (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πηδαλιον</span></span>) is an old one (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πηδον</span></span>, the blade of an oar), but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:4">James 3:4</span>. Page notes that the ancient ships had a pair of paddle rudders like those of the early northmen, one on each quarter. The paddle rudders had been fastened while the ship was anchored.</p>
<p><b>Hoisting up the foresail to the wind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαραντες τον αρτεμωνα τη πνεουση</span></span>). Supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυρα</span></span> (breeze) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνεουση</span></span> (blowing). It is not clear what "sail" is meant by "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτεμωνα</span></span>." No other example in Greek is known, though the scholiast to Juvenal XII. 68 explains <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ςελο προρα συο</span></span> by <i>artemone solo</i>. Hence "foresail" is probably correct.</p>
<p><b>They made for the beach </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατειχον εις τον αιγιαλον</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεχω</span></span>, to hold down, perhaps inchoative. "They began to hold the ship steadily for the beach." </p>
