 To save Paul  (διασωσα τον Παυλον). Effective first aorist active infinitive of διασωζω. And no wonder for the centurion knew now how much they all owed to Paul.Stayed them from their purpose  (εκωλευσεν αυτους του βουληματος.) Ablative case of βουλημα after εκωλευσεν (from κωλευω, to hinder, common verb).And get first to land  (πρωτους εις την γην εξιενα). This classic verb εξειμ occurs four times in Acts (Acts 13:42; Acts 17:15; Acts 20:7; Acts 27:32) and nowhere else in the N.T. It was a wise command.
