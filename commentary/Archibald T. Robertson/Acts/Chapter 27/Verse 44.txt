<p><b> Some on planks </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ους μεν επ σανισιν</span></span>). Common Greek idiom (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ους μεν--ους δε</span></span>) for "some--some." The only N.T. instance of the old Greek word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σανις</span></span> for board or plank. The breaking of the ship gave scraps of timber which some used.</p>
<p><b>They all escaped safe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντας διασωθηνα</span></span>). First aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασωζω</span></span> (the very word used for the desire of the centurion about Paul) with accusative of general reference, the clause being subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span>. So Luke in this marvellous narrative, worthy of any historian in any age, shows how Paul's promise was fulfilled (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:24">Acts 27:24</span>). Paul the prisoner is the hero of the voyage and shipwreck, a wonderful example of God's providential care. </p>
