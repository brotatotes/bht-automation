<p><b> Coasting along </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλεγομενο</span></span>). Present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλεγω</span></span>, to lay beside, not from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span>, to collect or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span>, to say. Diodorus Siculus uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλεγομα</span></span> in precisely this sense of coasting along, like Latin <i>legere oram</i>. In N.T. only here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:13">Acts 27:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>Fair Havens </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Καλους Λιμενας</span></span>). This harbour is named Kalus Limeonas, a small bay two miles east of Cape Matala. It opens to the East and Southeast, but is not fit to winter in. This harbour would protect them for a time from the winds.</p>
<p><b>The city of Lasea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολις Λασεα</span></span>). Neither Lasea nor Fair Havens is mentioned by any ancient writer, two of the hundred cities of Crete. </p>
