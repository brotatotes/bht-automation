<p><b> Where much time was spent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hικανου χρονου διαγενομενου</span></span>). Genitive absolute again with second aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαγινομα</span></span>, to come in between (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>). "Considerable time intervening," since they became weatherbound in this harbour, though some take it since they left Caesarea.</p>
<p><b>And the voyage was now dangerous </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα οντος ηδη επισφαλους</span></span>). Genitive absolute, "and the voyage being already (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη</span></span>=Latin <i>jam</i>) dangerous" (old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφαλλω</span></span>, to trip, to fall, and so prone to fall, here only in N.T.).</p>
<p><b>Because the Fast was now already gone by </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το κα την νηστειαν ηδη παρεληλυθενα</span></span>). Accusative (after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) of the articular infinitive perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρερχομα</span></span>, to pass by, with the accusative of general reference (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηστειαν</span></span>, the great day of atonement of the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+16:29">Leviticus 16:29</span>) occurring about the end of September. The ancients considered navigation on the Mediterranean unsafe from early October till the middle of March. In A.D. 59 the Fast occurred on Oct. 5. There is nothing strange in Luke using this Jewish note of time as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:6">Acts 20:6</span> though a Gentile Christian. Paul did it also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:8">1 Corinthians 16:8</span>). It is no proof that Luke was a Jewish proselyte. We do not know precisely when the party left Caesarea (possibly in August), but in ample time to arrive in Rome before October if conditions had been more favourable. But the contrary winds had made the voyage very slow and difficult all the way (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:7">Acts 27:7</span>) besides the long delay here in this harbour of Fair Havens.</p>
<p><b>Paul admonished them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρηινη ο Παυλος</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραινεω</span></span>, old word to exhort from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αινεω</span></span>, to praise (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:8">Acts 3:8</span>), only here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:22">Acts 27:22</span> in N.T. It is remarkable that a prisoner like Paul should venture to give advice at all and to keep on doing it (imperfect tense inchoative, began to admonish and kept on at it). Paul had clearly won the respect of the centurion and officers and also felt it to be his duty to give this unasked for warning.</p>
<p><b>I perceive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεωρω</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεωρος</span></span>, a spectator. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:18">Luke 10:18</span>. Paul does not here claim prophecy, but he had plenty of experience with three shipwrecks already (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:25">2 Corinthians 11:25</span>) to justify his apprehension.</p>
<p><b>Will be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλειν εσεσθα</span></span>). Infinitive in indirect assertion followed by future infinitive after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλειν</span></span> in spite of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> which would naturally call for present indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλε</span></span>, an anacoluthon due to the long sentence (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 478).</p>
<p><b>With injury </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα υβρεως</span></span>). An old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> (above, upper, like our "uppishness") and so pride, insult, personal injury, the legal word for personal assault (Page). Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. III. 6, 4) uses it of the injury of the elements.</p>
<p><b>Loss </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζημιαν</span></span>). Old word, opposite of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδος</span></span>, gain or profit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:7">Philippians 3:7</span>). Nowhere else in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Lading </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορτιου</span></span>). Diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορτος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερω</span></span>, to bear) only in form. Common word, but in N.T. only here in literal sense, as metaphor in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:30">Matthew 11:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:4">Matthew 23:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:46">Luke 11:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:5">Galatians 6:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>But also of our lives </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα κα των ψυχων</span></span>). Common use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span> for life, originally "breath of life" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:10">Acts 20:10</span>), and also "soul" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:2">Acts 14:2</span>). Fortunately no lives were lost, though all else was. But this outcome was due to the special mercy of God for the sake of Paul (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:24">Acts 27:24</span>), not to the wisdom of the officers in rejecting Paul's advice. Paul begins now to occupy the leading role in this marvellous voyage. </p>
