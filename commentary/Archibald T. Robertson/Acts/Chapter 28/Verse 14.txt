<p><b> Where we found brethren </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου ευροντες αδελφους</span></span>). Possibly from Alexandria, but, as Blass observes, it is no more strange to find "brethren" in Christ in Puteoli when Paul arrives than in Rome. There was a large Jewish quarter.</p>
<p><b>Seven days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερας επτα</span></span>). Accusative of extent of time. Paul and his party remained so long at the urgent request of the brethren. He was still a prisoner, but clearly Julius was only too glad to show another courtesy to Paul to whom they all owed their lives. It was 130 miles by land from Puteoli to Rome over one of the great Roman roads.</p>
<p><b>And so we came to Rome </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουτως εις την Ρομην ηλθαμεν</span></span>). So at last. Luke is exultant as Page observes: <i>Paulus Romae captivus: triumphus unicus</i>. It is the climax of the book of Acts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:21">Acts 19:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:11">Acts 23:11</span>), but not the close of Paul's career. Page rightly remarks that a new paragraph should begin with verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:15">Acts 28:15</span>, for brethren came from Rome and this part of the journey is touched with the flavour of that incident. The great event is that Paul reached Rome, but not as he had once hoped (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:22-29">Romans 15:22-29</span>). </p>
