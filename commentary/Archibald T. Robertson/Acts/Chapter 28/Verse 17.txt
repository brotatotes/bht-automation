 Those that were the chief of the Jews  (τους οντας των Ιουδαιων πρωτους). This use of πρωτος for the leading men of a city or among the Jews we have already had in Acts 13:50; Acts 25:2; Luke 19:47. Literally, "Those that were first among the Jews." The position of the participle οντας between the article and the adjective πρωτους is regular (Robertson, Grammar, p. 777).When they were come together  (συνελθοντων αυτων). Genitive absolute again. Paul could not go to the synagogue, as his custom was, being a bound prisoner. So he invited the Jewish leaders to come to his lodging and hear his explanation of his presence in Rome as a prisoner with an appeal to Caesar. He is anxious that they may understand that this appeal was forced upon him by Festus following Felix and lot because he has come to make an attack on the Jewish people. He was sure that false reports had come to Rome. These non-Christian Jews accepted Paul's invitation.Nothing against  (ουδεν εναντιον). Adjective here as in Acts 26:9, not preposition as in Acts 7:10; Acts 8:32. From εν and αντιος (αντ), face to face. Concessive participle ποιησας as in verse Acts 28:4 (διασωθεντα) which see.Yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans  (δεσμιος εξ Ιεροσολυμων παρεδοθην εις τας χειρας των Ρομαιων). This condensed statement does not explain how he "was delivered," for in fact the Jews were trying to kill him when Lysias rescued him from the mob (Acts 22:27-36). The Jews were responsible for his being in the hands of the Romans, though they had hoped to kill him first.
