<p><b> Those that were the chief of the Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους οντας των Ιουδαιων πρωτους</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτος</span></span> for the leading men of a city or among the Jews we have already had in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:50">Acts 13:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:2">Acts 25:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:47">Luke 19:47</span>. Literally, "Those that were first among the Jews." The position of the participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οντας</span></span> between the article and the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτους</span></span> is regular (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 777).</p>
<p><b>When they were come together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνελθοντων αυτων</span></span>). Genitive absolute again. Paul could not go to the synagogue, as his custom was, being a bound prisoner. So he invited the Jewish leaders to come to his lodging and hear his explanation of his presence in Rome as a prisoner with an appeal to Caesar. He is anxious that they may understand that this appeal was forced upon him by Festus following Felix and lot because he has come to make an attack on the Jewish people. He was sure that false reports had come to Rome. These non-Christian Jews accepted Paul's invitation.</p>
<p><b>Nothing against </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν εναντιον</span></span>). Adjective here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:9">Acts 26:9</span>, not preposition as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:10">Acts 7:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:32">Acts 8:32</span>. From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span>), face to face. Concessive participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησας</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:4">Acts 28:4</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασωθεντα</span></span>) which see.</p>
<p><b>Yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεσμιος εξ Ιεροσολυμων παρεδοθην εις τας χειρας των Ρομαιων</span></span>). This condensed statement does not explain how he "was delivered," for in fact the Jews were trying to kill him when Lysias rescued him from the mob (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:27-36">Acts 22:27-36</span>). The Jews were responsible for his being in the hands of the Romans, though they had hoped to kill him first. </p>
