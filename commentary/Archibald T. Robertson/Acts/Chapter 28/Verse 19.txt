<p><b> When the Jews spake against it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιλεγοντων των Ιουδαιων</span></span>). Genitive absolute again, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιλεγοντων</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιλεγω</span></span>) common verb for speaking against as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:45">Acts 13:45</span>. <i>Clementer dicit</i> (Bengel). "The word is a mild one to describe the bitter enmity of the Jews" (Knowling).</p>
<p><b>I was constrained </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηναγκασθην</span></span>). "I was compelled," first aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγκαζω</span></span>, the very word used of Paul's efforts to get the Christians to blaspheme (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:11">Acts 26:11</span>) which see. Paul was compelled to appeal to Caesar (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:11">Acts 25:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:12">Acts 25:12</span> for this phrase), unless Paul was willing to be the victim of Jewish hate when he had done no wrong.</p>
<p><b>Not that I had aught to accuse my nation of </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ ως του εθνους μου εχων τ κατηγορειν</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> with a participle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχων</span></span>) is common in Greek for the alleged reason. The genitive case with the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηγορειν</span></span> is regular. Paul says <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνος</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαος</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:17">Acts 24:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:4">Acts 26:4</span>. </p>
