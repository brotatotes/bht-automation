<p><b> The barbarians </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο βαρβαρο</span></span>). The Greeks called all men "barbarians" who did not speak Greek (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:14">Romans 1:14</span>), not "barbarians" in our sense of rude and uncivilized, but simply "foreign folk." Diodorus Siculus (V. 12) says that it was a colony of the Phoenicians and so their language was Punic (Page). The word originally meant an uncouth repetition (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρβαρ</span></span>) not understood by others (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:11">1 Corinthians 14:11</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:11">Colossians 3:11</span> Paul couples it with Scythian as certainly not Christian. These are (with verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:4">Acts 28:4</span> below) the only N.T. instances.</p>
<p><b>Showed us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρειχαν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεχω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-αν</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ον</span></span> as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειχαν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:7">Mark 8:7</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 339). It was their habit on this occasion, Luke means, they kept on showing.</p>
<p><b>No common kindness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου την τυχουσαν φιλανθρωπιαν</span></span>). The old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλανθρωπια</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλος</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπος</span></span>), love of mankind, occurs in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:4">Titus 3:4</span> (adverb in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:3">Acts 27:3</span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:11">Acts 19:11</span> for this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου την τυχουσαν</span></span>, "not the kindness that happens every day." They were not "wreckers" to take advantage of the calamity.</p>
<p><b>They kindled a fire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αψαντες πυραν</span></span>). The only N.T. example and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:3">Acts 28:3</span> of the old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρ</span></span>, fire), a pile of burning fuel (sticks). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απτω</span></span>, to set fire to, to kindle. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπτω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:49">Luke 12:49</span>.</p>
<p><b>Received us all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσελαβοντο παντας ημας</span></span>). Second aorist middle (indirect indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσλαμβανω</span></span>. They took us all to themselves (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:26">Acts 18:26</span>).</p>
<p><b>The present </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον εφεστωτα</span></span>). Second perfect active participle (intransitive) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφιστημ</span></span>, "the rain that stood upon them" (the pouring rain). Only in Luke and Paul in N.T. </p>
