<p><b> Did I intreat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεκαλεσα</span></span>). Did I invite you.</p>
<p><b>Because of the hope of Israel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινεκεν της ελπιδος του Ισραελ</span></span>). Genitive with preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινεκεν</span></span>. The hope of the Messiah is his point as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:6">Acts 26:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>I am bound with this chain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αλυσιν ταυτην περικειμα</span></span>). This old verb means to lie around as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:2">Luke 17:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</span>. But it is also used as the passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιτιθημ</span></span>, to place around with the accusative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιτιθημ</span></span> retained. It is a transitive passive. Paul does not lie around the chain, but the chain lies around him, a curious reversal of the imagery (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 815). </p>
