 Did I intreat  (παρεκαλεσα). Did I invite you.Because of the hope of Israel  (εινεκεν της ελπιδος του Ισραελ). Genitive with preposition εινεκεν. The hope of the Messiah is his point as in Acts 26:6.I am bound with this chain  (την αλυσιν ταυτην περικειμα). This old verb means to lie around as in Luke 17:2; Hebrews 12:1. But it is also used as the passive of περιτιθημ, to place around with the accusative of περιτιθημ retained. It is a transitive passive. Paul does not lie around the chain, but the chain lies around him, a curious reversal of the imagery (Robertson, Grammar, p. 815).
