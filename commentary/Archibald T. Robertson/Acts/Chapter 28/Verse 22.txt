<p><b> But we desire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιουμεν δε</span></span>). Old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιοω</span></span>, to deem worthy, to think right or proper as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:38">Acts 15:38</span> which see. They think it only fair to hear Paul's side of his case.</p>
<p><b>Concerning this sect </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ της αιρεσεως ταυτης</span></span>). Paul had identified Christianity with Judaism (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:20">Acts 28:20</span>) in its Messianic hope. The language seems to imply that the number of Christians in Rome was comparatively small and mainly Gentile. If the edict of Claudius for the expulsion of the Jews from Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span>) was due to disturbance over Christ (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χρηστυς</span></span>), then even in Rome the Jews had special reason for hostility towards Christians.</p>
<p><b>Everywhere spoken against </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πανταχου αντιλεγετα</span></span>). Cf. verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:19">Acts 28:19</span>. The line of cleavage between Jew and Christian was now sharply drawn everywhere. </p>
