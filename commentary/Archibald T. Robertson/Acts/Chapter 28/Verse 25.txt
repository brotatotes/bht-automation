It was a triumph to gain adherents at all in such an audience.They departed  (απελυοντο). Imperfect middle (direct) indicative, "They loosed themselves from Paul." Graphic close.After that Paul had spoken one word  (ειποντος του Παυλου ρημα εν). Genitive absolute. One last word (like a preacher) after the all day exposition.Well  (καλως). Cf. Matthew 14:7; Mark 7:6; Mark 7:9 (irony). Here strong indignation in the very position of the word (Page).To your fathers  (προς τους πατερας υμων). So Aleph A B instead of ημων (our) like Stephen in Acts 7:52 whose words Paul had heard. By mentioning the Holy Spirit Paul shows (Knowling) that they are resisting God (Acts 7:52).
