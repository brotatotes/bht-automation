<p><b> Say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον</span></span>). Second aorist active imperative instead of the old form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπε</span></span>. The quotation is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:9">Isaiah 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:10">Isaiah 6:10</span>. This very passage is quoted by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:14">Matthew 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:15">Matthew 13:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:12">Mark 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:10">Luke 8:10</span>) in explanation of his use of parables and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:40">John 12:40</span> the very point made by Paul here, "the disbelief of the Jews in Jesus" (Page). See on Matthew for discussion of the language used. Here the first time ("go to this people and say") does not occur in Matthew. It is a solemn dirge of the doom of the Jews for their rejection of the Messiah foreseen so long ago by Isaiah. </p>
