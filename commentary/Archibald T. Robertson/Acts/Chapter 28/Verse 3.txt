<p><b>A viper </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχιδνα</span></span>). The old word used by the Baptist of the Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:7">Luke 3:7</span>) and by Jesus also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:34">Matthew 12:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:33">Matthew 23:33</span>). It is objected that there is little wood in the island today and no vipers, though Lewin as late as 1853 believes that he saw a viper near St. Paul's Bay. But the island now has 1,200 people to the square mile and snakes of any kind have a poor chance. The viper has also disappeared from Arran as the island became more frequented (Knowling). Ramsay thinks that the small constrictor (<i>Coronella Austriaca</i>) which still exists in the island may be the "viper," though it has no poison fangs, but clings and bites. The natives thought that it was a poisonous viper.</p>
