 But they expected  (ο δε προσεδοκων). Imperfect active, were expecting, continued to expect.That he would have swollen  (αυτον μελλειν πιμπρασθα). More exactly, "Expecting him to be about (or that he was about) to swell up." Πιμπρασθα is present middle infinitive from πιμπρημ, to blow, to burn, to inflame, to cause to swell. Πρηθω, to swell, seems connected and both use the aorist επρησα. Our word "inflammation" likewise means a burning and a swelling. This verb is a common medical term used as Luke has it. It occurs here only in N.T.Or fallen down dead suddenly  (η καταπιπτειν αφνω νεκρον). Rather, "or was about to fall down dead suddenly." The two common results of a bite by a viper or other poisonous snake, both medical terms used by Luke.But when they were long in expectation  (επ πολυ δε αυτων προσδοκωντων). Genitive absolute. "But while they were expecting for much time."Nothing amiss come to him  (μηδεν ατοπον εις αυτον γινομενον). "Nothing out of place coming to him" (present middle participle). Μηδεν the usual negative of the participle and the accusative case the object of θεωρουντων (genitive absolute).Changed their minds  (μεταβαλομενο). Aorist middle (direct) participle of μεταβαλλω, old verb to turn about or around, turning themselves about, changing their minds. Plato uses this very verb in middle voice for changing the mind.That he was a god  (αυτον εινα θεον). Accusative and infinitive in indirect discourse. At Lystra Paul was first received as a god (Mercury) and then they stoned him to kill him (Acts 14:11; Acts 14:19). So fickle is popular favour.
