<p><b> But they expected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε προσεδοκων</span></span>). Imperfect active, were expecting, continued to expect.</p>
<p><b>That he would have swollen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον μελλειν πιμπρασθα</span></span>). More exactly, "Expecting him to be about (or that he was about) to swell up." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πιμπρασθα</span></span> is present middle infinitive from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιμπρημ</span></span>, to blow, to burn, to inflame, to cause to swell. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πρηθω</span></span>, to swell, seems connected and both use the aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επρησα</span></span>. Our word "inflammation" likewise means a burning and a swelling. This verb is a common medical term used as Luke has it. It occurs here only in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Or fallen down dead suddenly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η καταπιπτειν αφνω νεκρον</span></span>). Rather, "or was about to fall down dead suddenly." The two common results of a bite by a viper or other poisonous snake, both medical terms used by Luke.</p>
<p><b>But when they were long in expectation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ πολυ δε αυτων προσδοκωντων</span></span>). Genitive absolute. "But while they were expecting for much time."</p>
<p><b>Nothing amiss come to him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν ατοπον εις αυτον γινομενον</span></span>). "Nothing out of place coming to him" (present middle participle). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μηδεν</span></span> the usual negative of the participle and the accusative case the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεωρουντων</span></span> (genitive absolute).</p>
<p><b>Changed their minds </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταβαλομενο</span></span>). Aorist middle (direct) participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταβαλλω</span></span>, old verb to turn about or around, turning themselves about, changing their minds. Plato uses this very verb in middle voice for changing the mind.</p>
<p><b>That he was a god </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον εινα θεον</span></span>). Accusative and infinitive in indirect discourse. At Lystra Paul was first received as a god (Mercury) and then they stoned him to kill him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:11">Acts 14:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:19">Acts 14:19</span>). So fickle is popular favour. </p>
