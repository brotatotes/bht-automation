<p><b> Lay </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακεισθα</span></span>). Common verb for the sick (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:30">Mark 1:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:6">John 5:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>Sick </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεχομενον</span></span>). "Held together." Common verb again for the sick as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:38">Luke 4:38</span>.</p>
<p><b>Of fever </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρετοις</span></span>). Instrumental case, and plural "fevers," medical term for intermittent attacks of fever (Demosthenes, Lucian, medical writers).</p>
<p><b>Dysentery </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυσεντεριω</span></span>). Instrumental case also. Late form of the older <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυσεντερια</span></span> and only here in N.T. Our very word <i>dysentery</i>. Another medical term of which Luke uses so many. Hippocrates often mentions these two diseases together.</p>
<p><b>Laying his hands on him healed him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιθεις τας χειρας αυτω ιασατο αυτον</span></span>). Either like the laying on of hands in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:14">James 5:14</span>, the gift of healing (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:9">1 Corinthians 12:9</span>), or the tender interest of Jesus when he took hold of the hand of Peter's mother-in-law (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:31">Mark 1:31</span>). Ramsay argues that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιαομα</span></span> is employed here of the miraculous healing by Paul while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεραπευω</span></span> is used of the cures by Luke the physician (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:9">Acts 28:9</span>). This is a general distinction and it is probably observed here, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:18">Luke 6:18</span> (which see) both verbs are employed of the healings by Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Came and were healed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσηρχοντο κα εθεραπευοντο</span></span>). Imperfect middle and imperfect passive. A regular stream of patients came during these months. Luke had his share in the honours, "us" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημας</span></span>), and no doubt his share in the cures.</p>
<p><b>With many honours </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλαις τιμαις</span></span>). Instrumental case. The word was often applied to payment for professional services as we today speak of an honorarium.</p>
<p><b>They put on board </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεθεντο</span></span>). Second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτιθημ</span></span>, to put on. The idea of "on board" is merely suggested by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγομενοις</span></span> (when we sailed) "the things for our needs" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα προς τας χρειας</span></span>). </p>
