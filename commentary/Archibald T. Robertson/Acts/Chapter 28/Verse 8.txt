 Lay  (κατακεισθα). Common verb for the sick (Mark 1:30; John 5:6).Sick  (συνεχομενον). "Held together." Common verb again for the sick as in Luke 4:38.Of fever  (πυρετοις). Instrumental case, and plural "fevers," medical term for intermittent attacks of fever (Demosthenes, Lucian, medical writers).Dysentery  (δυσεντεριω). Instrumental case also. Late form of the older δυσεντερια and only here in N.T. Our very word dysentery. Another medical term of which Luke uses so many. Hippocrates often mentions these two diseases together.Laying his hands on him healed him  (επιθεις τας χειρας αυτω ιασατο αυτον). Either like the laying on of hands in James 5:14, the gift of healing (1 Corinthians 12:9), or the tender interest of Jesus when he took hold of the hand of Peter's mother-in-law (Mark 1:31). Ramsay argues that ιαομα is employed here of the miraculous healing by Paul while θεραπευω is used of the cures by Luke the physician (verse Acts 28:9). This is a general distinction and it is probably observed here, but in Luke 6:18 (which see) both verbs are employed of the healings by Jesus.Came and were healed  (προσηρχοντο κα εθεραπευοντο). Imperfect middle and imperfect passive. A regular stream of patients came during these months. Luke had his share in the honours, "us" (ημας), and no doubt his share in the cures.With many honours  (πολλαις τιμαις). Instrumental case. The word was often applied to payment for professional services as we today speak of an honorarium.They put on board  (επεθεντο). Second aorist middle indicative of επιτιθημ, to put on. The idea of "on board" is merely suggested by αναγομενοις (when we sailed) "the things for our needs" (τα προς τας χρειας).
