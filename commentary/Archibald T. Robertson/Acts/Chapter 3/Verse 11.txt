<p>The Codex Bezae adds "as Peter and John went out."</p>
<p><b>As he held </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατουντος αυτου</span></span>). Genitive absolute of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατεω</span></span>, to hold fast, with accusative rather than genitive to get hold of (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:13">Acts 27:13</span>). Old and common verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατος</span></span> (strength, force). Perhaps out of gratitude and partly from fear (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:38">Luke 8:38</span>).</p>
<p><b>In the porch that is called Solomon's </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τη στοα τη καλουμενη Σολομωντος</span></span>). The adjective Stoic (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοικος</span></span>) is from this word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοα</span></span> (porch). It was on the east side of the court of the Gentiles (Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. XX. 9, 7) and was so called because it was built on a remnant of the foundations of the ancient temple. Jesus had once taught here (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:23">John 10:23</span>).</p>
<p><b>Greatly wondering </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκθαμβο</span></span>). Wondering out of (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>) measure, already filled with wonder (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαμβους</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:10">Acts 3:10</span>). Late adjective. Construction according to sense (plural, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαος</span></span> singular) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:16">Acts 5:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:7">Acts 6:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1">Acts 11:1</span>, etc. </p>
