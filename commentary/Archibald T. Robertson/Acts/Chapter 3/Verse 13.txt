 His servant Jesus  (τον παιδα Ιησουν). This phrase occurs in Isaiah 42:1; Isaiah 52:13 about the Messiah except the name "Jesus" which Peter adds, the first part of the quotation is from Exodus 3:6; Exodus 5:30. The LXX translated the Hebrew ebhedh by παις, the servant of Jehovah being a Messianic designation. But the phrase "servant of God" (παις θεου) is applied also to Israel (Luke 1:54) and to David (Luke 1:69; Acts 4:25). Paul terms himself δουλος θεου (Titus 1:1). Παις is just child (boy or girl), and it was also used of a slave (Matthew 8:6; Matthew 8:8; Matthew 8:13). But it is not here υιος (son) that Peter uses, but παις. Luke quotes Peter as using it again in this Messianic sense in Acts 3:26; Acts 4:27; Acts 4:30.Whom ye delivered up  (ον υμεις μεν παρεδωκατε). Note emphatic use of υμεις (ye). No δε to correspond to μεν. First aorist active (κ aorist) plural indicative of παραδιδωμ (usual form παρεδοτε, second aorist).When he  (εκεινου). Emphatic pronoun, that one, in contrast with "ye" (υμεις), genitive absolute with κριναντος, here the nearest word (Pilate), the latter.
