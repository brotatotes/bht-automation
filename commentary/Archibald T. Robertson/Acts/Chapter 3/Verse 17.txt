 And now  (κα νυν). Luke is fond of these particles of transition (Acts 7:34; Acts 10:5; Acts 20:25; Acts 22:16) and also κα τα νυν (Acts 4:29; Acts 5:38; Acts 22:32; Acts 27:22), and even κα νυν ιδου (Acts 13:11; Acts 20:22).I wot  (οιδα). Old English for "I know."In ignorance  (κατα αγνοιαν). This use of κατα occurs in the Koine. See also Philemon 1:14. One may see Luke 23:34 for the words of the Saviour on the Cross. "They had sinned, but their sin was not of so deep a dye that it could not have been still more heinous" (Hackett). If they had known what they were doing, they would not knowingly have crucified the Messiah (1 Corinthians 2:8).
