<p><b> And now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα νυν</span></span>). Luke is fond of these particles of transition (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:34">Acts 7:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:5">Acts 10:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:25">Acts 20:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:16">Acts 22:16</span>) and also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τα νυν</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:29">Acts 4:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:38">Acts 5:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:32">Acts 22:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:22">Acts 27:22</span>), and even <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα νυν ιδου</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:11">Acts 13:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:22">Acts 20:22</span>).</p>

<p><b>In ignorance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα αγνοιαν</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> occurs in the <i>Koine</i>.

One may see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:34">Luke 23:34</span> for the words of the Saviour on the Cross. "They had sinned, but their sin was not of so deep a dye that it could not have been still more heinous" (Hackett). If they had known what they were doing, they would not knowingly have crucified the Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:8">1 Corinthians 2:8</span>). </p>
