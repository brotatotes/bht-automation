<p><b> Foreshewed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκατηγγειλεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκαταγγελλω</span></span>, late compound to announce fully beforehand. Only twice in the N.T. in the critical text (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:18">Acts 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:52">Acts 7:52</span>).</p>
<p><b>That his Christ should suffer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παθειν τον Χριστον αυτου</span></span>). Accusative of general reference with the aorist active infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παθειν</span></span> of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασχω</span></span>) in indirect discourse (predictive purpose of God). Their crime, though real, was carrying out God's purpose (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>). See the same idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:3">Acts 17:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:23">Acts 26:23</span>. This "immense paradox" (Page) was a stumbling block to these Jews as it is yet (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:23">1 Corinthians 1:23</span>). Peter discusses the sufferings of Christ in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:13">1 Peter 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:1">1 Peter 5:1</span>. </p>
