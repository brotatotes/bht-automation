<p><b> Repent therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοησατε ουν</span></span>). Peter repeats to this new crowd the command made in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span> which see. God's purpose and patience call for instant change of attitude on their part. Their guilt does not shut them out if they will turn.</p>
<p><b>And turn again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα επιστρεψατε</span></span>). Definitely turn to God in conduct as well as in mind.</p>
<p><b>That your sins may be blotted out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς το εξαλιφθηνα υμων τας αμαρτιας</span></span>). Articular infinitive (first aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαλειφω</span></span>, to wipe out, rub off, erase, smear out, old verb, but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:14">Colossians 2:14</span>) with the accusative of general reference and with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> and the accusative to express purpose.</p>
<p><b>That so </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως αν</span></span>). Final particle with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and the aorist active subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελθωσιν</span></span> (come) and not "when" as the Authorized Version has it. Some editors put this clause in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:20">Acts 3:20</span> (Westcott and Hort, for instance).</p>
<p><b>Seasons of refreshing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιρο αναψυξεως</span></span>). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναψυξις</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναψυχω</span></span>, to cool again or refresh, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:16">2 Timothy 1:16</span>) is a late word (LXX) and occurs here alone in the N.T. Surely repentance will bring "seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord." </p>
