<p><b> Was carried </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβασταζετο</span></span>). Imperfect passive, picturing the process as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:1">Acts 3:1</span>.</p>

<p><b>Beautiful </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hωραιαν</span></span>). This gate is not so called elsewhere. It may have been the Gate of Nicanor on the east side looking towards Kidron described by Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. XV. 11, 3; <i>War</i> V. 5, 3) as composed chiefly of Corinthian brass and very magnificent. </p>
