 And that he may send the Christ who hath been appointed for you, even Jesus  (κα αποστειλη τον προκεχειρισμενον υμιν Χριστον Ιησουν). First aorist active subjunctive with οπως αν as in Acts 15:17 and Luke 2:35. There is little real difference in idea between οπως αν and ινα αν. There is a conditional element in all purpose clauses. The reference is naturally to the second coming of Christ as verse Acts 3:21 shows. Knowling admits "that there is a spiritual presence of the enthroned Jesus which believers enjoy as a foretaste of the visible and glorious Presence of the Παρουσια." Jesus did promise to be with the disciples all the days (Matthew 28:20), and certainly repentance with accompanying seasons of refreshing help get the world ready for the coming of the King. The word προκεχειρισμενον (perfect passive participle of προχειριζω, from προχειρος, at hand, to take into one's hands, to choose) is the correct text here, not προκεκηρυγμενον. In the N.T. only here and Acts 22:14; Acts 26:16. It is not "Jesus Christ" here nor "Christ Jesus," but "the Messiah, Jesus," identifying Jesus with the Messiah. See the Second Epiphany of Jesus foretold also in 1 Timothy 6:15 and the First Epiphany described in 1 Peter 1:20.
