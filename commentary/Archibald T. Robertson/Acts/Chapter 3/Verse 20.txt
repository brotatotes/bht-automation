<p><b> And that he may send the Christ who hath been appointed for you, even Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αποστειλη τον προκεχειρισμενον υμιν Χριστον Ιησουν</span></span>). First aorist active subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως αν</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:17">Acts 15:17</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:35">Luke 2:35</span>. There is little real difference in idea between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως αν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα αν</span></span>. There is a conditional element in all purpose clauses. The reference is naturally to the second coming of Christ as verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:21">Acts 3:21</span> shows. Knowling admits "that there is a spiritual presence of the enthroned Jesus which believers enjoy as a foretaste of the visible and glorious Presence of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παρουσια</span></span>." Jesus did promise to be with the disciples all the days (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:20">Matthew 28:20</span>), and certainly repentance with accompanying seasons of refreshing help get the world ready for the coming of the King. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκεχειρισμενον</span></span> (perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προχειριζω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προχειρος</span></span>, at hand, to take into one's hands, to choose) is the correct text here, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκεκηρυγμενον</span></span>. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:16">Acts 26:16</span>. It is not "Jesus Christ" here nor "Christ Jesus," but "the Messiah, Jesus," identifying Jesus with the Messiah. See the Second Epiphany of Jesus foretold also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:15">1 Timothy 6:15</span> and the First Epiphany described in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span>. </p>
