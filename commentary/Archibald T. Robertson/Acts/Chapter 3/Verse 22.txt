<p><b> Like unto me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως εμε</span></span>). As me, literally; Moses (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+18:14-18">Deuteronomy 18:14-18</span>) claims that God raised him up as a prophet and that another and greater one will come, the Messiah. The Jews understood Moses to be a type of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:21">John 1:21</span>). God spoke to Moses face to face (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:11">Exodus 33:11</span>) and he was the greatest of the prophets (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+34:10">Deuteronomy 34:10</span>). </p>
