<p><b> That prophet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του προφητου εκεινου</span></span>). Emphasizes the future prophet as on "him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span>) before "hearken." They had refused to "hearken" to Moses and now, alas, many had refused to "hearken" to Christ.</p>
<p><b>Shall be utterly destroyed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξολεθρευθησετα</span></span>). First future passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξολε-</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span>) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θρευω</span></span>, a late verb, to destroy utterly (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span>), only here in the N.T., common in the LXX. </p>
