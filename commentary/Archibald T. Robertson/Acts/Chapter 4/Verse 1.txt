<p><b> The captain of the temple </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο στρατηγος του ιερου</span></span>). Twenty-four bands of Levites guarded the temple, one guard at a time. They watched the gates. The commander of each band was called captain (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατηγος</span></span>). Josephus names this captain of the temple police next to the high priest (<i>War</i>. VI. 5, 3).</p>
<p><b>The Sadducees </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Σαδδουκαιο</span></span>). Most of the priests were Sadducees now and all the chief priests since John Hyrcanus I deserted the Pharisees (Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. XVII. 10, 6; XVIII. 1, 4; XX. 9, 1). The Sadducees were slow to line up with the Pharisees against Jesus, but they now take the lead against Peter and John.</p>
