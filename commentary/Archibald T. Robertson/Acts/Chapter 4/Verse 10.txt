 Be it known  (γνωστον εστω). Imperative present active third singular of ειμ, to be, and the verbal adjective γνωστον.Whom ye crucified  (ον υμεις εσταυρωσατε). Too good a chance to miss, and so Peter boldly charges the Sanhedrin with responsibility for the death of Jesus. Note υμεις (ye) again.Whom God raised from the dead  (ον ο θεος ηγειρεν εκ νεκρων). Note repetition of ον (whom). This is God's answer to their act of crucifixion.In him doth this man stand  (εν τουτω ουτος παρεστηκεν). Rather (note play on ουτος), "In this one (ον, ον) this one stands (present perfect active indicative, intransitive)." In Jesus this man stands before you whole (υγιης). It was a centre shot.
