The experts, the architects, had rejected Jesus for their building (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span>) as Jesus himself had pointed out (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:17">Luke 21:17</span>). This very Rejected Stone God had made the head of the corner (either the highest corner stone right under the roof or the corner stone under the building, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>) as Jesus showed, as Peter here declares and repeats later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:6">1 Peter 2:6</span>). </p>
