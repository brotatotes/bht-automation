<p><b> Salvation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η σωτηρια</span></span>). The Messianic salvation as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:31">Acts 5:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:11">Acts 17:11</span> and as Jesus meant in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:22">John 4:22</span>. It is amazing to see Peter speaking thus to the Sanhedrin and proclaiming the necessity of salvation (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε σωθηνα</span></span>) in the name of Jesus Christ and in no other. If this was true then, it is true today. There is no second (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερον</span></span>) name to go beside that of Jesus in India, China, Japan, or America. </p>
