<p><b> The boldness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την παρρησιαν</span></span>). Telling it all (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν, ρησια</span></span>). See also verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:29">Acts 4:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:31">Acts 4:31</span>. Actually Peter had turned the table on the Sanhedrin and had arraigned them before the bar of God.</p>
<p><b>Had perceived </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλαβομενο</span></span>). Second aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλαμβανω</span></span>, common verb to grasp strongly (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>), literally or with the mind (especially middle voice), to comprehend. The rulers recalled Peter and John from having seen them often with Jesus, probably during the temple teaching, etc.</p>
<p><b>They were unlearned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγραμματο εισιν</span></span>). Present indicative retained in indirect discourse. Unlettered men without technical training in the professional rabbinical schools of Hillel or Shammai. Jesus himself was so regarded (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:15">John 7:15</span>, "not having learned letters").</p>
<p><b>And ignorant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ιδιωτα</span></span>). Old word, only here in the N.T. and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:24">1 Corinthians 14:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:6">2 Corinthians 11:6</span>. It does not mean "ignorant," but a layman, a man not in office (a private person), a common soldier and not an officer, a man not skilled in the schools, very much like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγραμματος</span></span>. It is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιος</span></span> (one's own) and our "idiosyncracy" is one with an excess of such a trait, while "idiot" (this very word) is one who has nothing but his idiosyncracy. Peter and John were men of ability and of courage, but they did not belong to the set of the rabbis.</p>
<p><b>They marvelled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθαυμαζον</span></span>). Imperfect (inchoative) active, began to wonder and kept it up.</p>
<p><b>Took knowledge of them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεγινωσκον αυτους</span></span>). Imperfect (inchoative) active again, they began to recognize them as men that they had seen with Jesus. </p>
