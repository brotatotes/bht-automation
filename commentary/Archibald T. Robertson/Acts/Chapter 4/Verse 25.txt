<p><b> By the mouth of our father David </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του πατρος ημων δια πνευματος αγιου στοματος Δαυειδ</span></span>). From <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:1">Psalms 2:1</span>. here ascribed to David. Baumgarten suggests that the whole company sang the second Psalm and then Peter applied it to this emergency. The Greek MSS. do not have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> (by) here before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοματος</span></span>, but only <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματος αγιου</span></span> (the Holy Spirit). Hort calls this a "primitive error" perhaps due to an early scribe who omitted this second <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> so close to the first <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> (Robertson, <i>Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the N.T.</i>, p. 238). A small list of such primitive errors is there given as suggested by Dr. Hort.</p>
<p><b>Why </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα τ</span></span>). This Greek idiom calls for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενητα</span></span> (second aorist middle subjunctive),</p>
<p><b>That what may happen </b>.</p>
<p><b>The Gentiles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνη</span></span>). So always in LXX, while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαο</span></span> (peoples) can include Jews.</p>
<p><b>Did rage </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφρυαξαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρυασσω</span></span>, late word, to neigh like a horse, to prance or stamp the ground, to put on lofty airs. Only here in the N.T. in this quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:1">Psalms 2:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Imagine </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμελετησαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελεταω</span></span>. Old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελετη</span></span> (care), to practise, to caution, as orators and rhetoricians. Only here in the N.T. in this quotation. </p>
