 By the mouth of our father David  (του πατρος ημων δια πνευματος αγιου στοματος Δαυειδ). From Psalms 2:1. here ascribed to David. Baumgarten suggests that the whole company sang the second Psalm and then Peter applied it to this emergency. The Greek MSS. do not have δια (by) here before στοματος, but only δια before πνευματος αγιου (the Holy Spirit). Hort calls this a "primitive error" perhaps due to an early scribe who omitted this second δια so close to the first δια (Robertson, Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the N.T., p. 238). A small list of such primitive errors is there given as suggested by Dr. Hort.Why  (ινα τ). This Greek idiom calls for γενητα (second aorist middle subjunctive),That what may happen .The Gentiles  (εθνη). So always in LXX, while λαο (peoples) can include Jews.Did rage  (εφρυαξαν). First aorist active indicative of φρυασσω, late word, to neigh like a horse, to prance or stamp the ground, to put on lofty airs. Only here in the N.T. in this quotation from Psalms 2:1.Imagine  (εμελετησαν). First aorist active indicative of μελεταω. Old verb from μελετη (care), to practise, to caution, as orators and rhetoricians. Only here in the N.T. in this quotation.
