 Both Herod and Pontios Pilate  (Hηρωιδης τε κα Ποντιυς Πειλατος). Luke alone (Luke 23:12) tells of the reconciliation between Herod and Pilate at the trial of Jesus. So Peter and the rest interpret this prophecy as directly fulfilled in their conduct towards Jesus Christ.Whom thou didst anoint  (ον εχρισας). As in verse Acts 4:26 (cf. Luke 4:18; Isaiah 61:1). Inaugurated as King Messiah.
