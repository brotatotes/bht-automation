<p><b> Both Herod and Pontios Pilate </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hηρωιδης τε κα Ποντιυς Πειλατος</span></span>). Luke alone (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:12">Luke 23:12</span>) tells of the reconciliation between Herod and Pilate at the trial of Jesus. So Peter and the rest interpret this prophecy as directly fulfilled in their conduct towards Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><b>Whom thou didst anoint </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον εχρισας</span></span>). As in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:26">Acts 4:26</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:18">Luke 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span>). Inaugurated as King Messiah. </p>
