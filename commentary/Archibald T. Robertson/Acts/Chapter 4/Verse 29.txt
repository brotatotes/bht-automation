<p><b> And now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τα νυν</span></span>). "And as to (accusative of general reference) the now things (the present situation)." Only in the Acts in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:38">Acts 5:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:30">Acts 17:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:32">Acts 20:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:22">Acts 27:22</span>).</p>
<p><b>Grant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δος</span></span>). Second aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>, urgency of the aorist, Do it now.</p>
<p><b>To speak thy word with all boldness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα παρρησιας πασης λαλειν τον λογον σου</span></span>). Literally, "with all boldness to go on speaking (present active infinitive) thy word." Peter and John had defied the Sanhedrin in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:20">Acts 4:20</span>, but all the same and all the more they pray for courage in deed to live up to their brave words. A wholesome lesson. </p>
