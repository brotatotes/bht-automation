<p><b> In ward </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τηρησιν</span></span>). Probably in one of the chambers of the temple. In safe keeping (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρεω</span></span>, to guard). Old word, in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:18">Acts 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:19">1 Corinthians 7:19</span>. So in papyri.</p>
<p><b>Now eventide </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσπερα ηδη</span></span>). Hence no trial could take place before the next day, a regulation violated in the case of Jesus. </p>
