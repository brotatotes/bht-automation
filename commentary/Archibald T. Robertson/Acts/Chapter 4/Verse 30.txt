<p><b> While thou stretchest forth thy hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω την χειρα εκτεινειν σε</span></span>). Luke's favourite idiom, "In the stretching out (articular present active infinitive) the hand as to thee" (accusative of general reference), the second allusion to God's "hand" in this prayer (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:28">Acts 4:28</span>).</p>
<p><b>To heal </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ιασιν</span></span>). For healing. See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:22">Acts 4:22</span>.</p>
<p><b>And that signs and wonders may be done </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα σημεια κα τερατα γινεσθα</span></span>). Either to be taken as in the same construction as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτεινειν</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω</span></span> as Revised Version has it here or to be treated as subordinate purpose to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω εκτεινειν</span></span> (as Knowling, Page, Wendt, Hackett). The latter most likely true. They ask for a visible sign or proof that God has heard this prayer for courage to be faithful even unto death. </p>
