<p><b> Of one heart and soul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρδια κα ψυχη μια</span></span>). It is not possible to make sharp distinction between heart and soul here (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:30">Mark 12:30</span>), only that there was harmony in thought and affection. But the English translation is curiously unlike the Greek original. "There was one heart and soul (nominative case, not genitive as the English has it) in the multitude (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του πληθους</span></span>, subjective genitive) of those who believed."</p>
<p><b>Not one of them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε εις</span></span>). More emphatic than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεις</span></span>, "not even one."</p>
<p><b>Common </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινα</span></span>). In the use of their property, not in the possession as Luke proceeds to explain. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινος</span></span> is kin to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span> (together with)=<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυν</span></span> (Epic) and so <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυνοσ=κοινος</span></span>. See this word already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:44">Acts 2:44</span>. The idea of unclean (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:15">Acts 10:15</span>) is a later development from the original notion of common to all. </p>
