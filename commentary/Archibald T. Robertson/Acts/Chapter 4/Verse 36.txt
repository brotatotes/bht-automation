<p><b> Barnabas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βαρναβας</span></span>). His name was Joseph (correct text, and not Jesus) and he is mentioned as one illustration of those in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:34">Acts 4:34</span> who selling brought the money. The apostles gave him the nickname Barnabas by which later he was known because of this noble deed. This fact argues that all did not actually sell, but were ready to do so if needed. Possibly Joseph had a larger estate than some others also. The meaning of the nickname is given by Luke as "son of consolation or exhortation" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος παρακλησεως</span></span>). Doubtless his gifts as a preacher lay along this same line. Rackham thinks that the apostles gave him this name when he was recognized as a prophet. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:23">Acts 11:23</span> the very word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεκαλε</span></span> (exhorted) is used of Barnabas up at Antioch. He is the type of preacher described by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span>. Encouragement is the chief idea in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακλησις</span></span> though exhortation, comfort, consolation are used to render it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:31">Acts 9:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:15">Acts 13:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:31">Acts 15:31</span>). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:9">Acts 16:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:12">Acts 20:12</span>. It is not necessary to think that the apostles coined the name Barnabas for Joseph which originally may have come from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βαρνεβους</span></span> (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, pp. 308-10), son of Nebo, or even the Hebrew <i>Bar Nebi</i> (son of a prophet). But, whatever the origin, the popular use is given by Luke. He was even called apostle along with Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:14">Acts 14:14</span>) in the broad sense of that word. </p>
