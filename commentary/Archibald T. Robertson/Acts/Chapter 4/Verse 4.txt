<p><b> Men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανδρων</span></span>). Strictly, men and not women, for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπος</span></span> is the term for both men and women. But in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:31">Luke 11:31</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανδρες</span></span> seems to include both men and women and that is possible here, though by no means certain, for see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:21">Matthew 14:21</span> where the women and children are expressly excepted. </p>
