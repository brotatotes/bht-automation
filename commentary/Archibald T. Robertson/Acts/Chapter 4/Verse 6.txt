 Annas  (Hαννας). One of the rulers or chief priests, ex-high priest (A.D. 7-14) and father-in-law ofCaiaphas  (Καιαφας) who was actual high priest at that time, though the title clung to Annas as here (both so called in Luke 3:2), Caiaphas so by Roman law, Annas so in the opinion of the Jews. They with John and Alexander are the leaders among the Sadducees in pressing the case against Peter and John.
