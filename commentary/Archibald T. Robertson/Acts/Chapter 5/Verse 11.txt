<p><b> Upon the whole church </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφ' ολην την εκκλησιαν</span></span>). Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησια</span></span> for the first time in Acts of the believers in Jerusalem. Twice already in the Gospels, once of the whole body of believers or the Kingdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>), the other of the local body (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:17">Matthew 18:17</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:38">Acts 7:38</span> it is used of the whole congregation of Israel while in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:32">Acts 19:32</span> it is used of a public assembly in Ephesus. But already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span> it is applied to the church which Saul was persecuting in their homes when not assembled. So here the etymological meaning of "assembly" disappears for "the church" were now the scattered saints hiding in their separate homes. The whole body of believers in Jerusalem and all who heard of the fate of Ananias and Sapphira (beautiful, her name means) were in awe and dread. It was already a dangerous thing to be a follower of Christ unless one was willing to walk straight. </p>
