 Which is the sect of the Sadducees  (η ουσα αιρεσις των Σαδδουκαιων). Literally, "the existing sect of the Sadducees" or "the sect which is of the Sadducees," η being the article, not the relative. Hαιρεσις means a choosing, from αιρεομα, to take for oneself, to choose, then an opinion chosen or tenet (possibly 2 Peter 2:1), then parties or factions (Galatians 5:20; 1 Corinthians 11:19; possibly 2 Peter 2:1). It is applied here to the Sadducees; to the Pharisees in Acts 15:5; Acts 26:5; to the Christians in Acts 24:5-14; Acts 28:22. Already Luke has stated that the Sadducees started the persecution of Peter and John (Acts 4:1). Now it is extended to "the apostles" as a whole since Christianity has spread more rapidly in Jerusalem than before it began.
