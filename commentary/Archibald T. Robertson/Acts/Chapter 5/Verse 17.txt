<p><b> Which is the sect of the Sadducees </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ουσα αιρεσις των Σαδδουκαιων</span></span>). Literally, "the existing sect of the Sadducees" or "the sect which is of the Sadducees," <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span> being the article, not the relative. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hαιρεσις</span></span> means a choosing, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρεομα</span></span>, to take for oneself, to choose, then an opinion chosen or tenet (possibly <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>), then parties or factions (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:20">Galatians 5:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:19">1 Corinthians 11:19</span>; possibly <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>). It is applied here to the Sadducees; to the Pharisees in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:5">Acts 15:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:5">Acts 26:5</span>; to the Christians in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:5-14">Acts 24:5-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:22">Acts 28:22</span>. Already Luke has stated that the Sadducees started the persecution of Peter and John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:1">Acts 4:1</span>). Now it is extended to "the apostles" as a whole since Christianity has spread more rapidly in Jerusalem than before it began. </p>
