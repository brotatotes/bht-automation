<p><b> With jealousy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλου</span></span>). Genitive case. Old word from zeo, to boil, our zeal. In itself it means only warmth, ardour, zeal, but for a bad cause or from a bad motive, jealousy, envy, rivalry results (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:45">Acts 13:45</span>). Common in the epistles.</p>
<p><b>In public ward </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τηρησε δημοσια</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:3">Acts 4:3</span> only with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δημοσια</span></span> (public) added, in the public prison, perhaps not the "common" prison, but any prison is bad enough. In verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:19">Acts 5:19</span> it is called "the prison" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της φυλακης</span></span>), the guardhouse. </p>
