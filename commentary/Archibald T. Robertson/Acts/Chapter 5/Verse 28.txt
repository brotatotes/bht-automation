<p><b> We straitly charged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παραγγελια παρηγγειλαμεν</span></span>). Like the Hebrew idiom (common in the LXX), though found in Greek, with charging (instrumental case) we charged (cf. same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:15">Luke 22:15</span>). Somewhat like the cognate accusative. The command referred to occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:17">Acts 4:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:18">Acts 4:18</span> and the refusal of Peter and John in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:20">Acts 4:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>To bring upon us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαγαγειν εφ' ημας</span></span>). Note repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>. Second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαγω</span></span>, old verb, but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>. The Sanhedrin gladly took the blood of Christ on their heads and their children to Pilate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:25">Matthew 27:25</span>). Paul tried to save the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:6">Acts 18:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:20">Acts 22:20</span>). "<b>This man </b>" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ανθρωπου τουτου</span></span>). Contemptuous slur and refusal to call the name of Jesus as in the Talmud later. </p>
