<p><b> We must </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>). Moral necessity left them no choice. They stood precisely where Peter and John were when before the Sanhedrin before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:20">Acts 4:20</span>).</p>
<p><b>Obey </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθαρχειν</span></span>). Old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθομα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχη</span></span>, to obey a ruler. Only by Luke and Paul in the N.T. </p>
