<p><b> Filled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επληρωσεν</span></span>). The very verb used of the filling by the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:31">Acts 4:31</span>). Satan the adversary is the father of lies (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>). He had entered into Judas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:3">Luke 22:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:27">John 13:27</span>) and now he has filled the heart of Ananias with a lie.</p>
<p><b>To lie to the Holy Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψευσασθα σε το πνευμα το αγιον</span></span>). Infinitive (aorist middle) of purpose with accusative of general reference (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σε</span></span>) and the accusative of the person (object) as often in Greek writers, though here only in the N.T. with this verb. Usual dative of the person in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:4">Acts 5:4</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωποις</span></span>, men, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω θεω</span></span>, God). The Holy Spirit had been given them to guide them into truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:13">John 15:13</span>). </p>
