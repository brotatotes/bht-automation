<p><b> We are witnesses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις εσμεν μαρτυρες</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:32">Acts 2:32</span>.</p>
<p><b>Things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρηματων</span></span>). Literally, sayings, but like the Hebrew <i>dabhar</i> for "word" it is here used for "things."</p>
<p><b>And so is the Holy Ghost </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα το πνευμα το αγιον</span></span>). The word for "is" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span>) is not in the Greek, but this is plainly the meaning. Peter claims the witness of the Holy Spirit to the raising of Jesus Christ, God's Son, by the Father. </p>
