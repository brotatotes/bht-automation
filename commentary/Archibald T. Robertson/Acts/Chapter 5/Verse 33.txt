<p><b> Were cut to the heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεπριοντο</span></span>). Imperfect passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαπριω</span></span> old verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια, πριω</span></span>), to saw in two (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>), to cut in two (to the heart). Here it is rage that cuts into their hearts, not conviction of sin as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:37">Acts 2:37</span>. Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:54">Acts 7:54</span> (after Stephen's speech) in the N.T. (cf. Simeon's prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:35">Luke 2:35</span>).</p>
<p><b>Were minded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβουλοντο</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομα</span></span>. They were plotting and planning to kill (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανελειν</span></span>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:33">Luke 23:33</span> which see) then and there. The point in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:7">Acts 4:7</span> was whether the apostles deserved stoning for curing the cripple by demoniacal power, but here it was disobedience to the command of the Sanhedrin which was not a capital offence. "They were on the point of committing a grave judicial blunder" (Furneaux). </p>
