<p><b> Refrain from </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστητε απο</span></span>). Second aorist (ingressive) active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιστημ</span></span> of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:37">Acts 5:37</span>. Do ye stand off from these men. "Hands off" was the policy of Gamaliel.</p>
<p><b>For if--be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ εαν--η</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hοτ</span></span> gives the reason for the advice. Gamaliel presents two alternatives in terms of two conditional clauses. The first one is stated as a condition of the third class, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> with the present subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span>, undetermined with prospect of determination. Assuming that it is from men, "it will be overthrown" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλυθησετα</span></span>, first future passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλυω</span></span>, to loosen down like a falling house) as was true of the following of Theudas and Judas the Galilean. </p>
