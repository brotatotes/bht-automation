<p><b> But if it is of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δε εκ θεου εστιν</span></span>). The second alternative is a condition of the first class, determined as fulfilled, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> with the present indicative. By the use of this idiom Gamaliel does put the case more strongly in favor of the apostles than against them. This condition <i>assumes</i> that the thing is so without <i>affirming</i> it to be true. On the basis of this alternative Gamaliel warns the Sanhedrin that they cannot "overthrow" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλυσα</span></span>) these men for they in that case must "overthrow" God,</p>
<p><b>lest haply ye be found </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ποτε--υρεθητε</span></span>, negative purpose with first aorist passive subjunctive)</p>
<p><b>even to be fighting against God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα θεομαχο</span></span>, late adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαχομα</span></span>, in LXX and here only in the N.T.). </p>
