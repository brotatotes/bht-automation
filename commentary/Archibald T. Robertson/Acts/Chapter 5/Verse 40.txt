<p><b> To him they agreed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεισθησαν αυτω</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθω</span></span>, to persuade, the passive to be persuaded by, to listen to, to obey. Gamaliel's shrewd advice scored as against the Sadducaic contention (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:17">Acts 5:17</span>).</p>
<p><b>Not to speak </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη λαλειν</span></span>). The Sanhedrin repeated the prohibition of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:18">Acts 4:18</span> which the apostles had steadily refused to obey. The Sanhedrin stood by their guns, but refused to shoot. It was a "draw" with Gamaliel as tactical victor over the Sadducees. Clearly now the disciples were set free because only the Sadducees had become enraged while the Pharisees held aloof. </p>
