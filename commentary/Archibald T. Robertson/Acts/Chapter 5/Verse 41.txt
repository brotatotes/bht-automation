<p><b> They therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μεν ουν</span></span>). No answering <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>They were counted worthy to suffer dishonour for the Name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηξιωθησαν υπερ του ονοματος ατιμασθηνα</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταξιοω</span></span>, old verb to count worthy. Three times in N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:35">Luke 20:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:41">Acts 5:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:5">2 Thessalonians 1:5</span>). First aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατιμαζω</span></span>, old verb to make one dishonoured (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατιμος</span></span>). Forms here an oxymoron (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οξυς</span></span>, sharp, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μορος</span></span>, foolish) pointedly foolish saying "which is witty or impressive through sheer contradiction or paradox as laborious idleness, sublime indifference" (Vincent). The apostles felt honoured by dishonour. Note the same use of "the Name" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:7">James 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:7">3 John 1:7</span>. With the Jews this absolute use of "the Name" meant Jehovah. The Christians now apply it to Jesus. </p>
