<p><b> Every day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασαν ημεραν</span></span>). Accusative of extent of time, all through every day.</p>
<p><b>In the temple and at home </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ιερω κα κατ' οικον</span></span>). This was a distinct triumph to go back to the temple where they had been arrested (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:25">Acts 5:25</span>) and at home or from house to house, as it probably means (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:46">Acts 2:46</span>). It was a great day for the disciples in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><b>They ceased not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ επαυοντο</span></span>). Imperfect middle. They kept it up.</p>
<p><b>Jesus as the Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον Χριστον Ιησουν</span></span>). Jesus is the direct object of the participles <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκοντες</span></span> (teaching) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιζομενο</span></span> (preaching or evangelizing) while "the Christ" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον Χριστον</span></span>) is the predicate accusative. These words give the substance of the early apostolic preaching as these opening chapters of Acts show, that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah of promise. Gamaliel had opened the prison doors for them and they took full advantage of the opportunity that now was theirs. </p>
