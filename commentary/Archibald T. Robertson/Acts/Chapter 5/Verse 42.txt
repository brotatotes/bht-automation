 Every day  (πασαν ημεραν). Accusative of extent of time, all through every day.In the temple and at home  (εν τω ιερω κα κατ' οικον). This was a distinct triumph to go back to the temple where they had been arrested (verse Acts 5:25) and at home or from house to house, as it probably means (cf. Acts 2:46). It was a great day for the disciples in Jerusalem.They ceased not  (ουκ επαυοντο). Imperfect middle. They kept it up.Jesus as the Christ  (τον Χριστον Ιησουν). Jesus is the direct object of the participles διδασκοντες (teaching) and ευαγγελιζομενο (preaching or evangelizing) while "the Christ" (τον Χριστον) is the predicate accusative. These words give the substance of the early apostolic preaching as these opening chapters of Acts show, that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah of promise. Gamaliel had opened the prison doors for them and they took full advantage of the opportunity that now was theirs.
