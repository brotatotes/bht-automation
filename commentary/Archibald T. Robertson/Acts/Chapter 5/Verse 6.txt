 The young men  (ο νεωτερο). Literally the younger men (contrast with ο πρεσβυτερο, the elder men). Same as νεανισκο in verse Acts 5:10 and so no order in the young church. Perhaps these young men were acting as ushers or actual pallbearers.Wrapped him round  (συνεστειλαν). First aorist active indicative of συστελλω, old verb, to draw together, or contract (1 Corinthians 7:29), to roll together, to wrap with bandages, to enshroud as here. Nowhere else in the N.T. Frequent in medical writers. They may have used their own mantles. The time for burial was short in Jerusalem for sanitary reasons and to avoid ceremonial defilement.
