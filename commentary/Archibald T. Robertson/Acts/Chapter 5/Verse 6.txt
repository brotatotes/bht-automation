<p><b> The young men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο νεωτερο</span></span>). Literally the younger men (contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πρεσβυτερο</span></span>, the elder men). Same as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεανισκο</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:10">Acts 5:10</span> and so no order in the young church. Perhaps these young men were acting as ushers or actual pallbearers.</p>
<p><b>Wrapped him round </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεστειλαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συστελλω</span></span>, old verb, to draw together, or contract (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:29">1 Corinthians 7:29</span>), to roll together, to wrap with bandages, to enshroud as here. Nowhere else in the N.T. Frequent in medical writers. They may have used their own mantles. The time for burial was short in Jerusalem for sanitary reasons and to avoid ceremonial defilement. </p>
