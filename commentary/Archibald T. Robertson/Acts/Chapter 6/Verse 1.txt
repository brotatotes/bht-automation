<p><b> When the number of the disciples was multiplying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληθυνοντων των μαθητων</span></span>). Genitive absolute of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληθυνω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληθος</span></span>, fulness, to increase. The new freedom from the intercession of Gamaliel was bearing rich fruit.</p>
<p><b>A murmuring of the Grecian Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γογγυσμος των Hελληνιστων</span></span>). Late onomatopoetic word (LXX) from the late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γογγυζω</span></span>, to mutter, to murmur. The substantive occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:12">John 7:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:14">Philippians 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:9">1 Peter 4:9</span>. It is the secret grumblings that buzz away till they are heard. These "Grecian Jews" or Hellenists are members of the church in Jerusalem who are Jews from outside of Palestine like Barnabas from Cyprus. These Hellenists had points of contact with the Gentile world without having gone over to the habits of the Gentiles, the Jews of the Western Dispersion. They spoke Greek.</p>
<p><b>Against the Hebrews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τους Εβραιους</span></span>). The Jewish Christians from Jerusalem and Palestine. The Aramaean Jews of the Eastern Dispersion are usually classed with the Hebrew (speaking Aramaic) as distinct from the Grecian Jews or Hellenists.</p>
<p><b>Were neglected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεθεωρουντο</span></span>). Imperfect passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραθεωρεω</span></span>, old verb, to examine things placed beside (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>) each other, to look beyond (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> also), to overlook, to neglect. Here only in the N.T. These widows may receive daily (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθημερινη</span></span>, late adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθ' ημεραν</span></span>, only here in the N.T.) help from the common fund provided for all who need it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:32-37">Acts 4:32-37</span>). The temple funds for widows were probably not available for those who have now become Christians. Though they were all Christians here concerned, yet the same line of cleavage existed as among the other Jews (Hebrew or Aramaean Jews and Hellenists). It is not here said that the murmuring arose among the widows, but because of them. Women and money occasion the first serious disturbance in the church life. There was evident sensitiveness that called for wisdom. </p>
