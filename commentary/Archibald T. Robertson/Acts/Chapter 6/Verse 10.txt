<p><b> They were not able to withstand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ισχυον αντιστηνα</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυω</span></span>, to have strength, and ingressive second aorist active (intransitive) infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθιστημ</span></span>. They continued unable (without strength enough) to take a stand against. Stephen knocked them down, Saul included, as fast as they got up. Stephen was like a battery charged and in action.</p>
<p><b>The wisdom and spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη σοφια κα πνευματ</span></span>). Dative case. They stood up against Stephen's wisdom and the Holy Spirit "by whom he spoke" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω ελαλε</span></span>). Instrumental case and the relative agrees with "Spirit." He kept on speaking so (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλε</span></span>, imperfect active). It was a desperate situation. </p>
