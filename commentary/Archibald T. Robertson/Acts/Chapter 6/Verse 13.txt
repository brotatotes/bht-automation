<p><b> False witnesses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρας ψευδεις</span></span>). Just as Caiaphas did with Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Ceaseth not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου παυετα</span></span>). Wild charge just like a false witness that Stephen talks in the synagogues against the law and the holy temple. </p>
