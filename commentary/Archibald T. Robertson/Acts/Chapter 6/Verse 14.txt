<p><b> We have heard him say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακηκοαμεν αυτου λεγοντος</span></span>). The only direct testimony and evidently wrong. Curiously like the charge brought against Jesus before Caiaphas that he would destroy the temple and build it again in three days. Undoubtedly Stephen had said something about Christianity before as meant for others besides Jews. He had caught the spirit of Jesus about worship as shown to the woman at Sychar in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:4">Acts 6:4</span> that God is spirit and to be worshipped by men anywhere and everywhere without having to come to the temple in Jerusalem. It was inflammable material surely and it was easy to misrepresent and hard to clear up.</p>
<p><b>This Jesus of Nazareth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησους ο Ναζωραιος ουτος</span></span>). With contempt. </p>
