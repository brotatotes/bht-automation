<p><b> As if the face of an angel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωσε προσωπον αγγελου</span></span>). Even his enemies saw that, wicked as they were. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:30">Exodus 34:30</span> for the face of Moses when he came down from Sinai (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span>). Page quotes Tennyson: "God's glory smote him on the face." Where were Peter and John at this crisis? Apparently Stephen stands alone before the Sanhedrin as Jesus did. But he was not alone for he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:56">Acts 7:56</span>). There was little that Peter and John could have done if they had been present. Gamaliel did not interpose this time for the Pharisees were behind the charges against Stephen, false though they were as Gamaliel could have found out. </p>
