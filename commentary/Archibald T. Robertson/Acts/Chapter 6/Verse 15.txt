 As if the face of an angel  (ωσε προσωπον αγγελου). Even his enemies saw that, wicked as they were. See Exodus 34:30 for the face of Moses when he came down from Sinai (2 Corinthians 3:7).

But he was not alone for he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God (Acts 7:56). There was little that Peter and John could have done if they had been present. Gamaliel did not interpose this time for the Pharisees were behind the charges against Stephen, false though they were as Gamaliel could have found out.
