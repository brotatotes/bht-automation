<p><b> The multitude </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πληθος</span></span>). The whole church, not just the 120.</p>
<p><b>Fit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρεστον</span></span>). Pleasing, verbal adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρεσκω</span></span>, to please, old word, but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:3">Acts 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:29">John 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:22">1 John 3:22</span>. <i>Non placet</i>.</p>
<p><b>Should forsake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλειψαντας</span></span>). Late first aorist active participle for usual second aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλιποντας</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλειπω</span></span>, to leave behind.</p>
<p><b>Serve tables </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονειν τραπεζαις</span></span>). Present active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονεω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κονις</span></span>, dust), to raise a dust in a hurry, to serve, to minister either at table (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:20">John 12:20</span>), or other service (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:25">John 12:25</span>), to serve as deacon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:10">1 Timothy 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:13">1 Timothy 3:13</span>). "Tables" here hardly means money-tables as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:15">John 2:15</span>, but rather the tables used in the common daily distribution of the food (possibly including the love-feasts, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:43-47">Acts 2:43-47</span>). This word is the same root as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονια</span></span> (ministration) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονος</span></span> (deacon) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8-13">1 Timothy 3:8-13</span>. It is more frequently used in the N.T. of ministers (preachers) than of deacons, but it is quite possible, even probable, that the office of deacon as separate from bishop or elder grew out of this incident in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1-7">Acts 6:1-7</span>. Furneaux is clear that these "seven" are not to be identified with the later "deacons" but why he does not make clear. </p>
