<p><b> Pleased </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρεσεν</span></span>). Aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρεσκω</span></span> like Latin <i>placuit</i> when a vote was taken. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωπιον</span></span> before "the whole multitude" is like the LXX.</p>
<p><b>They chose </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξελεξαντο</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεγω</span></span>, to pick out for oneself. Each one of the seven has a Greek name and was undoubtedly a Hellenist, not an Aramaean Jew. Consummate wisdom is here displayed for the murmuring had come from the Hellenists, seven of whom were chosen to take proper care of the widows of Hellenists. This trouble was settled to stay settled so far as we know. Nothing is here told of any of the seven except Stephen who is "a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit" and Nicolas "a proselyte of Antioch" (who was not then born a Jew, but had come to the Jews from the Greek world). </p>
