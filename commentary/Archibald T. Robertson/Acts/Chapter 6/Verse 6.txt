 They laid their hands on them  (επεθηκαν αυτοις τας χειρας). First aorist active indicative of επιτιθημ. Probably by the apostles who ratified the choice (verse Acts 6:3). The laying on of hands "was a symbol of the impartation of the gifts and graces which they needed to qualify them for the office. It was of the nature of a prayer that God would bestow the necessary gifts, rather than a pledge that they were actually conferred" (Hackett).
