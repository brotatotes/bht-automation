<p><b> They laid their hands on them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεθηκαν αυτοις τας χειρας</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτιθημ</span></span>. Probably by the apostles who ratified the choice (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:3">Acts 6:3</span>). The laying on of hands "was a symbol of the impartation of the gifts and graces which they needed to qualify them for the office. It was of the nature of a prayer that God would bestow the necessary gifts, rather than a pledge that they were actually conferred" (Hackett). </p>
