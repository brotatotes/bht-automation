<p><b>Multiplied </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επληθυνετο</span></span>). Imperfect passive. The two imperfects kept pace with each other.</p>
<p><b>Of the priests </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των ιερων</span></span>). Who were usually Sadducees. It was a sad day for Annas and Caiaphas and all the sect of the Sadducees (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:17">Acts 5:17</span>).</p>
<p><b>Were obedient to </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπηκουον</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπακουω</span></span>, repetition, one after another.</p>
<p><b>The faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη πιστε</span></span>).
