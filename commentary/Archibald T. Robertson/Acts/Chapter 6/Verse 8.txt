<p><b> Wrought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποιε</span></span>). Imperfect active, repeatedly wrought. Evidently a man like Stephen would not confine his "ministry" to "serving tables." He was called in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:5">Acts 6:5</span> "full of faith and the Holy Spirit." Here he is termed "full of grace (so the best MSS., not faith) and power." The four words give a picture of remarkable attractiveness. The grace of God gave him the power and so "he kept on doing great wonders and signs among the people." He was a sudden whirlwind of power in the very realm of Peter and John and the rest. </p>
