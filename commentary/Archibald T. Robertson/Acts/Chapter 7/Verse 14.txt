<p><b> Three-score and fifteen souls </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ψυχαις εβδομηκοντα πεντε</span></span>). Stephen follows the LXX which counts some grandchildren of Joseph and so makes it 75 whereas <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+46:26">Genesis 46:26</span> has 66 and then the next verse makes it <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:70">Acts 7:70</span> including Jacob and Joseph with his two sons. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> means "consisting in." </p>
