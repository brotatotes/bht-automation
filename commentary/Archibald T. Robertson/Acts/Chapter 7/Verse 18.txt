<p><b> Another king </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλευς ετερος</span></span>). A different kind of king also, probably a king of the new dynasty after the shepherd kings had been expelled from Egypt.</p>
<p><b>Who knew not Joseph </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος ουκ ηιδε τον Ιωσηφ</span></span>). Second past perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span> used like an imperfect. Joseph's history and services meant nothing to the new king. "The previous dynasty had been that of the Hyksos: the new king was Ahmes who drove out the Hyksos" (Knobel). </p>
