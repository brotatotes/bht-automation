 Another king  (βασιλευς ετερος). A different kind of king also, probably a king of the new dynasty after the shepherd kings had been expelled from Egypt.Who knew not Joseph  (ος ουκ ηιδε τον Ιωσηφ). Second past perfect of οιδα used like an imperfect. Joseph's history and services meant nothing to the new king. "The previous dynasty had been that of the Hyksos: the new king was Ahmes who drove out the Hyksos" (Knobel).
