<p><b> When he was cast out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτεθεντος αυτου</span></span>). Genitive absolute with first aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτιθημ</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Took up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανειλατο</span></span>). Second aorist middle indicative (with first aorist vowel <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> as often in the <i>Koine</i>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναιρεω</span></span>, common in the N.T. in the sense of take up and make away with, to kill as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:28">Acts 7:28</span>, but here only in the N.T. in the original sense of taking up from the ground and with the middle voice (for oneself). Quoted here from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:5">Exodus 2:5</span>. The word was used of old for picking up exposed children as here. Vincent quotes Aristophanes (<i>Clouds</i>, 531): "I exposed (the child), and some other women, having taken it, adopted (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανειλετο</span></span>) it." Vulgate has <i>sustulit</i>. "Adopted" is the idea here. "After the birth of a child the father took it up to his bosom, if he meant to rear it; otherwise it was doomed to perish" (Hackett).</p>
<p><b>Nourished him for her own son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεθρεψατο αυτον εαυτη εις υιον</span></span>). Literally, "she nursed him up for herself (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτη</span></span> besides middle voice) as a son." This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>=as occurs in the old Greek, but is very common in the LXX as a translation of the Hebrew <i>le</i>. The tradition is that she designed Moses for the throne as the Pharaoh had no son (Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. ii. 9, 7). </p>
