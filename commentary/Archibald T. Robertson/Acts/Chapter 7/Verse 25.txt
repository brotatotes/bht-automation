<p><b> He supposed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενομιζεν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομιζω</span></span>. He was supposing, Stephen explains, when he smote the Egyptian.</p>
<p><b>That his brethren understood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιενα τους αδελφους</span></span>). Present active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιημ</span></span>, to send (put) together, to grasp, to comprehend, in indirect discourse with the accusative of general reference.</p>
<p><b>By his hand was giving them deliverance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια χειρος αυτου διδωσιν σοτηριαν αυτοις</span></span>). Picturesque use of "hand" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>, present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span> retained in indirect discourse after imperfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενομιζεν</span></span>. But they understood not (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε ου συνηκαν</span></span>). Page notes "the rhetorical power of these words" from Stephen. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συνηκαν</span></span> (first aorist indicative, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κ</span></span> aorist) refers to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιενα</span></span> just before. </p>
