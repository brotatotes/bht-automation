 Thrust him away  (απωσατο αυτον). First aorist middle indicative (Koine for Attic απεωσατο) of απωθεω, to push away from oneself in middle voice as here, common in old Greek. Again in verse Acts 7:39; Acts 13:46; Romans 11:1; 1 Timothy 1:19. It is always the man who is doing the wrong who is hard to reconcile.
