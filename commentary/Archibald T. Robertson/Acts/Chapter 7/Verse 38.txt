<p><b> In the church in the wilderness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη εκκλησια εν τη ερημω</span></span>). Better rendered "congregation" here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:12">Hebrews 2:12</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:22">Psalms 22:22</span>), the people of Israel gathered at Mt. Sinai, the whole nation. Moses is here represented as receiving the law from an angel as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+33:2">Deuteronomy 33:2</span>, LXX) and so was a mediator (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεσιτης</span></span>) or middle man between the angel and the people whereas Jesus is the Mediator of a better covenant (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:6">Hebrews 8:6</span>). But Exodus does not speak of an angel.</p>
<p><b>Living oracles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογια ζωντα</span></span>). A <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογιον</span></span> is a little word (diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span>). Common in the old Greek, LXX, Philo, in ecclesiastical writers for sayings of Christ, Papias (for instance) saying that Matthew wrote in Hebrew (Aramaic) "Logia of Jesus." Oxyrhynchus papyri fragments called "Logia of Jesus" are of much interest though only fragments. The Greeks used it of the "oracles" or brief sayings from Delphi. In the N.T. the word occurs only four times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:38">Acts 7:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:2">Romans 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:11">1 Peter 4:11</span>). Here the participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωντα</span></span>, living, is the same used by Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4">1 Peter 2:4</span>.), stone (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθος</span></span>) of Christ and Christians. The words from God to Moses are still "living" today. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:11">1 Peter 4:11</span> the word is applied to one who speaks <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογια θεου</span></span> (oracles of God). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:2">Romans 3:2</span> Paul refers to the substance of the law and of prophecy. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span> the writer means the substance of the Christian religious teaching. </p>
