<p><b> They made a calf </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμοσχοποιησαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μοσχοποιεω</span></span>, here only in the N.T. and unknown elsewhere. The LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:3">Exodus 32:3</span>) has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποιησε μοσχον</span></span> from which phrase the word is evidently made. Aaron made the calf, but so did the people (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:35">Exodus 32:35</span>).</p>
<p><b>The idol </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω ειδωλω</span></span>). Stephen calls it by the right name. The people said it was their way of worshipping Jehovah! So the Egyptians worshipped the bull Apis at Memphis as the symbol of Osiris (the sun). They had another sacred bull Mnevis at Leontopolis. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ειδωλον</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδος</span></span>, form or figure) is the image or likeness of anything. The heathen worship the god through the image or idol.</p>
<p><b>Rejoiced </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευφραινοντο</span></span>). Imperfect, middle, kept on rejoicing (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:6">Exodus 32:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:18">Exodus 32:18</span>) or making merry. </p>
