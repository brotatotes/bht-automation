<p><b> Gave them up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδωκεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδωμ</span></span>. This same form occurs three times like clods on a coffin in a grave in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:24">Romans 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:26">Romans 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</span> where Paul speaks of God giving the heathen up to their lusts.</p>
<p><b>To serve the host of heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λατρευειν τη στρατια του ουρανου</span></span>). The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λατρευω</span></span> is used of the worship of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:10">Matthew 4:10</span>) as well as of idols as here (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λατρον</span></span>, hire, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λατρις</span></span>, hireling, then to serve). But the worship of the host of heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+17:3">Deuteronomy 17:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+17:16">2 Kings 17:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+21:3">2 Kings 21:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+33:3">2 Chronicles 33:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+33:5">2 Chronicles 33:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+8:2">Jeremiah 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+19:13">Jeremiah 19:13</span>) is Sabaism or worship of the host (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατια</span></span>) of heaven (sun, moon, and stars) instead of the Lord of hosts. This star-worship greatly injured the Jews.</p>
<p><b>In the book of the prophets </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν βιβλω των προφητων</span></span>). That is the twelve minor prophets which the Jews counted as one book (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:40">Acts 13:40</span>). This quotation is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="am+5:25-27">Amos 5:25-27</span>. The greater prophets were Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel.</p>
<p><b>Slain beasts </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφαγια</span></span>). Here only in the N.T. (from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="am+5:25">Amos 5:25</span>) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφαγη</span></span>, slaughter, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφαζω</span></span>, to slay. </p>
