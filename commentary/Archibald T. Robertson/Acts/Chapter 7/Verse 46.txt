<p><b> Asked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηιτησατο</span></span>). Aorist middle (indirect) indicative, asked for himself (as a favour to himself). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:2">2 Samuel 7:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>A habitation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνωμα</span></span>). Like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+132:5">Psalms 132:5</span>, but it was a house that David proposed to build (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:2">2 Samuel 7:2</span>), not a tent (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνη</span></span>) which already existed. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σκηνωμα</span></span> here means a more permanent abode (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικον</span></span>, house, in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:47">Acts 7:47</span>), though from the same root as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνη</span></span>. </p>
