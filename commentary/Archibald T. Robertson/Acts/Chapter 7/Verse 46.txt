 Asked  (ηιτησατο). Aorist middle (indirect) indicative, asked for himself (as a favour to himself). Cf. 2 Samuel 7:2.A habitation  (σκηνωμα). Like Psalms 132:5, but it was a house that David proposed to build (2 Samuel 7:2), not a tent (σκηνη) which already existed. Σκηνωμα here means a more permanent abode (οικον, house, in verse Acts 7:47), though from the same root as σκηνη.
