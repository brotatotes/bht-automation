Note emphatic position of "not" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ουχ</span></span>), "But not does the Most High dwell." The presence of the Most High is not confined in any building, even one so splendid as Solomon's Temple as Solomon himself foresaw and acknowledged in his prayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:27">1 Kings 8:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+6:18">2 Chronicles 6:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>In houses made with hands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν χειροποιητοις</span></span>). No word here for "houses" or "temples" in correct text (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναοις</span></span> temples in Textus Receptus). Literally, "In things made with hands" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρ</span></span>, hand, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιητος</span></span>, verbal adjective of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>). It occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:58">Mark 14:58</span> of the temple and of the sanctuary of Moab (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+16:12">Isaiah 16:12</span>). It occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:24">Acts 7:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11">Hebrews 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:24">Hebrews 9:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:11">Ephesians 2:11</span>.
