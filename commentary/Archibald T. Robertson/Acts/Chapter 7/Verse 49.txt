<p><b> What manner of house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ποιον οικον</span></span>). What sort of a house? This interrogative is sometimes scornful as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:7">Acts 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:32">Luke 6:32</span> (Page). So Stephen shows by Isaiah that Solomon was right that the temple was not meant to "confine" God's presence and that Jesus had rightly shown that God is a spirit and can be worshipped anywhere by any individual of any race or land. It is a tremendous argument for the universality and spirituality of Christianity free from the shackles of Jewish racial and national limitations, but its very strength only angered the Sanhedrin to desperation. </p>
