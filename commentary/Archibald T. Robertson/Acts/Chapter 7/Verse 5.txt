<p><b> Not so much as to set his foot on </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε βημα ποδος</span></span>). From <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+2:5">Deuteronomy 2:5</span>. Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαινω</span></span>, to go, to step. "Stepping of a foot," only instance of this original meaning in the N.T. From this it comes to mean a platform reached by steps, official seat of a judge (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:19">Matthew 27:19</span>). The field purchased by Abraham (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+23:9-17">Genesis 23:9-17</span>) was not a gift from God.</p>
<p><b>Promised </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επηγγειλατο</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαγγελλω</span></span>, common verb. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:7">Genesis 12:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:8">Genesis 17:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:4">Genesis 48:4</span> for this promise. So God appeared again to Abraham in a strange land.</p>
<p><b>In possession </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις κατασχεσιν</span></span>). Late word, in LXX, and in N.T. only here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:45">Acts 7:45</span>. From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεχω</span></span>, to hold back, then to hold fast (or down), to possess. It was fulfilled in the descendants of Abraham.</p>
<p><b>When as yet he had no child </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ οντος αυτω τεκνου</span></span>). Genitive absolute with negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> to emphasize actual absence of a child. He had only the promise of God about the land and the child. </p>
