<p><b> Which of the prophets </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινα των προφητων</span></span>). Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:47">Luke 11:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:29-37">Matthew 23:29-37</span>) had charged them with this very thing. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+36:16">2 Chronicles 36:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>Which shewed before </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκαταγγειλαντας</span></span>). The very prophets who foretold the coming of the Messiah their fathers killed.</p>
<p><b>The coming </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της ελευσεως</span></span>). Not in ancient Greek or LXX and only here in the N.T. (in a few late writers).</p>
<p><b>Betrayers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προδοτα</span></span>). Just like Judas Iscariot. He hurled this old biting word at them. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:16">Luke 6:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:4">2 Timothy 3:4</span>. It cut like a knife. It is blunter than Peter in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:13">Acts 3:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>Murderers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φονεις</span></span>). The climax with this sharp word used of Barabbas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:14">Acts 3:14</span>). </p>
