 Ye who  (οιτινες). The very ones who, quippe qui, often in Acts when the persons are enlarged upon (Acts 8:15; Acts 9:35; Acts 10:41; Acts 10:47).As it was ordained by angels  (εις διαταγας αγγελων). About angels see on Acts 7:38.

At (or as) the appointment of angels (cf. Matthew 10:41; Matthew 12:41 for this use of εις).And kept it not  (κα ουκ εφυλαξατε). Like a whipcracker these words cut to the quick. They gloried in possessing the law and openly violated it (Romans 2:23).
