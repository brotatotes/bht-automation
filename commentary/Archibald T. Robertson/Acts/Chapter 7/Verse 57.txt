<p><b> Stopped their ears </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεσχον τα ωτα αυτων</span></span>). Second aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεχω</span></span>, to hold together. They held their ears together with their hands and affected to believe Stephen guilty of blasphemy (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:65">Matthew 26:65</span>).</p>
<p><b>Rushed upon him with one accord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωρμησαν ομοθυμαδον επ' αυτον</span></span>). Ingressive aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορμαω</span></span>, to rush impetuously as the hogs did down the cliff when the demons entered them (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:33">Luke 8:33</span>). No vote was taken by the Sanhedrin. No scruple was raised about not having the right to put him to death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:31">John 8:31</span>). It may have taken place after Pilate's recall and before his successor came or Pilate, if there, just connived at such an incident that did not concern Rome. At any rate it was mob violence like modern lynching that took the law into the hands of the Sanhedrin without further formalities.</p>
<p><b>Out of the city </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ της πολεως</span></span>). To keep from defiling the place with blood. But they sought to kill Paul as soon as they got him out of the temple area (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:30">Acts 21:30</span>).</p>
<p><b>Stoned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελιθοβολουν</span></span>). Imperfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθοβολεω</span></span>, began to stone, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθοβολος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθος</span></span>, stone, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλω</span></span>, to throw), late Greek verb, several times in the N.T. as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:34">Luke 13:34</span>. Stoning was the Jewish punishment for blasphemy (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+24:14-16">Leviticus 24:14-16</span>).</p>
<p><b>The witnesses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μαρτυρες</span></span>). The false testifiers against Stephen suborned by the Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:11">Acts 6:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:13">Acts 6:13</span>). These witnesses had the privilege of casting the first stones (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+13:10">Deuteronomy 13:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+17:7">Deuteronomy 17:7</span>) against the first witness for Christ with death (<i>martyr</i> in our modern sense of the word).</p>
<p><b>At the feet of a young man named Saul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα τους ποδας νεανιου καλουμενου Σαυλου</span></span>). Beside (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>) the feet. Our first introduction to the man who became the greatest of all followers of Jesus Christ. Evidently he was not one of the "witnesses" against Stephen, for he was throwing no stones at him. But evidently he was already a leader in the group of Pharisees. We know from later hints from Saul (Paul) himself that he had been a pupil of Gamaliel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:3">Acts 22:3</span>). Gamaliel, as the Pharisaic leader in the Sanhedrin, was probably on hand to hear the accusations against Stephen by the Pharisees. But, if so, he does not raise his voice against this mob violence. Saul does not seem to be aware that he is going contrary to the views of his master, though pupils often go further than their teachers. </p>
