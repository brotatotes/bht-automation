<p><b>Four hundred years </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετη τετρακοσια</span></span>). Accusative of duration of time. As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:13">Genesis 15:13</span>, but a round number as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:40">Exodus 12:40</span> the time is 430 years. But in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:17">Galatians 3:17</span> Paul, following the LXX in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:40">Exodus 12:40</span>, takes the 430 years to cover the period in Canaan and the stay in Egypt, cutting the sojourn in Egypt to about half. Josephus gives it both ways. Hackett suggests two solutions, one that there were two ways of reckoning the period among the Jews with no way of settling it, the other that by the 430 years in Egypt the writers meant to include Canaan also as merely the preliminary to the period in Egypt. </p>
