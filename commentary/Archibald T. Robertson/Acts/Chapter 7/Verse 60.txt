 Kneeled down  (θεις τα γονατα). Second aorist active participle of τιθημ, placing the knees (on the ground). This idiom is not in the old Greek for kneeling, but Luke has it five times (Luke 22:41; Acts 7:60; Acts 9:40; Acts 22:36; Acts 21:5) and Mark once (Acts 15:19). Jesus was standing at the right hand of God and Stephen knelt before him in worship and called on him in prayer.Lay not this sin to their charge  (μη στησηις αυτοις ταυτην την αμαρτιαν). First aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive with μη, regular Greek idiom, Place not to them or against them (dative αυτοις) this sin. The very spirit of Jesus towards his enemies as he died upon the Cross (Luke 23:34).He fell asleep  (εκοιμηθη). First aorist passive indicative of κοιμαω, to put to sleep. Old verb and the metaphor of sleep for death is common in all languages, but it is peculiarly appropriate here as Jesus used it of Lazarus. See also Acts 13:36; 1 Corinthians 15:18, etc. Our word cemetery (κοιμητηριον) is the sleeping place of the dead. Knowling calls εκοιμηθη here "a picture word of rest and calmness which stands in dramatic contrast to the rage and violence of the scene."
