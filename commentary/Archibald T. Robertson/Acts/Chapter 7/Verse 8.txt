<p><b> The covenant of circumcision </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαθηκην περιτομης</span></span>). A covenant marked by (genitive) circumcision (no article) of which circumcision is the sign (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:11">Romans 4:11</span>) as set forth in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:9-14">Genesis 17:9-14</span>. In the ancient Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαθηκη</span></span> was usually will (Latin, <i>testamentum</i>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνθηκη</span></span> was used for covenant (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span>, together, rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>, between). But the LXX and the N.T. use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαθηκη</span></span> for covenant (will in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span>) as Lightfoot on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16">Galatians 3:16</span> says: "The LXX translation and New Testament writers probably preferred <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαθηκη</span></span> as better expressing the</p>
<p><b>free grace </b> of God than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνθηκη</span></span>."</p>
<p><b>And so </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουτως</span></span>). After the covenant was made and as a sign and seal of it. </p>
