<p><b> Was consenting </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην συνευδοκων</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνευδοκεω</span></span>, a late double compound (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν, ευ, δοκεω</span></span>) that well describes Saul's pleasure in the death (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναιρεσις</span></span>, taking off, only here in the N.T., though old word) of Stephen. For the verb see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:32">Luke 23:32</span>. Paul himself will later confess that he felt so (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:20">Acts 22:20</span>), coolly applauding the murder of Stephen, a heinous sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:32">Romans 1:32</span>). It is a gruesome picture. Chapter 7 should have ended here.</p>
<p><b>On that day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εκεινη τη ημερα</span></span>). On that definite day, that same day as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:41">Acts 2:41</span>.</p>
<p><b>A great persecution </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωγμος μεγας</span></span>). It was at first persecution from the Sadducees, but this attack on Stephen was from the Pharisees so that both parties are now united in a general persecution that deserves the adjective "great." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:21">Matthew 13:21</span> for the old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωγμος</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωκω</span></span>, to chase, hunt, pursue, persecute.</p>
<p><b>Were all scattered abroad </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντες διεσπαρησαν</span></span>). Second aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασπειρω</span></span>, to scatter like grain, to disperse, old word, in the N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:4">Acts 8:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>Except the apostles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλην των αποστολων</span></span>). Preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλην</span></span> (adverb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεον</span></span>, more) with the ablative often in Luke. It remains a bit of a puzzle why the Pharisees spared the apostles. Was it due to the advice of Gamaliel in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:34-40">Acts 5:34-40</span>? Or was it the courage of the apostles? Or was it a combination of both with the popularity of the apostles in addition? </p>
