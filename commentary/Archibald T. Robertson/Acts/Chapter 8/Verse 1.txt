 Was consenting  (ην συνευδοκων). Periphrastic imperfect of συνευδοκεω, a late double compound (συν, ευ, δοκεω) that well describes Saul's pleasure in the death (αναιρεσις, taking off, only here in the N.T., though old word) of Stephen. For the verb see on Luke 23:32. Paul himself will later confess that he felt so (Acts 22:20), coolly applauding the murder of Stephen, a heinous sin (Romans 1:32). It is a gruesome picture. Chapter 7 should have ended here.On that day  (εν εκεινη τη ημερα). On that definite day, that same day as in Acts 2:41.A great persecution  (διωγμος μεγας). It was at first persecution from the Sadducees, but this attack on Stephen was from the Pharisees so that both parties are now united in a general persecution that deserves the adjective "great." See on Matthew 13:21 for the old word διωγμος from διωκω, to chase, hunt, pursue, persecute.Were all scattered abroad  (παντες διεσπαρησαν). Second aorist passive indicative of διασπειρω, to scatter like grain, to disperse, old word, in the N.T. only in Acts 8:1; Acts 8:4; Acts 11:19.Except the apostles  (πλην των αποστολων). Preposition πλην (adverb from πλεον, more) with the ablative often in Luke. It remains a bit of a puzzle why the Pharisees spared the apostles. Was it due to the advice of Gamaliel in Acts 5:34-40? Or was it the courage of the apostles? Or was it a combination of both with the popularity of the apostles in addition?
