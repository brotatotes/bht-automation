<p><b> That power of God which is called Great </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η Δυναμις του θεου η καλουμενη Μεγαλη</span></span>). Apparently here already the oriental doctrine of emanations or aeons so rampant in the second century. This "power" was considered a spark of God himself and Jerome (in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:24">Acts 8:24</span>) quotes Simon (Page) as saying: <i>Ego sum sermo Dei, ... ego omnipotens, ego omnia Dei</i>. Simon claimed to <i>impersonate God</i>. </p>
