<p><b> And Simon also himself believed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hο δε Σιμων κα αυτος επιστευσεν</span></span>). Note the same verb in the aorist tense <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευσεν</span></span>. What did he believe? Evidently that Jesus was this "power of God" not himself (Simon). He saw that the miracles wrought by Philip in the name of Christ were genuine while he knew that his own were frauds. He wanted this power that Philip had to add to his own pretensions. "He was probably half victim of self-delusion, half conscious impostor" (Furneaux). He was determined to get this new "power," but had no sense of personal need of Jesus as Saviour for his sins. So he submitted to baptism (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισθεις</span></span>, first aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτιζω</span></span>), clear proof that baptism does not convey salvation.</p>
<p><b>He continued with Philip </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην προσκαρτερων τω Φιλιππω</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκαρτερεω</span></span> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:46">Acts 2:46</span>). He stuck to Philip (dative case) to find out the secret of his power.</p>
<p><b>Beholding </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεωρων</span></span>). Watching the signs and miracles (powers, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμεις</span></span> that threw his "power" in the shade) as they were wrought (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομενας</span></span>, present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>). The more he watched the more the wonder grew (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξιστατο</span></span>). He had "amazed" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:9">Acts 8:9</span>) the people by his tricks and he was himself more "amazed" than they by Philip's deeds. </p>
