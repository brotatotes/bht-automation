<p><b> That Samaria had received </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ δεδεκτα η Σαμαρια</span></span>). The district here, not the city as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:5">Acts 8:5</span>. Perfect middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεχομα</span></span> retained in indirect discourse. It was a major event for the apostles for now the gospel was going into Samaria as Jesus had predicted (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8">Acts 1:8</span>). Though the Samaritans were nominally Jews, they were not held so by the people. The sending of Peter and John was no reflection on Philip, but was an appropriate mission since "many Christian Jews would be scandalized by the admission of Samaritans" (Furneaux). If Peter and John sanctioned it, the situation would be improved. John had once wanted to call down fire from heaven on a Samaritan village (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:54">Luke 9:54</span>). </p>
