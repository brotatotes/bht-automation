<p><b> That they might receive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως λαβωσιν</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>, final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως</span></span>. Did they wish the Samaritan Pentecost to prove beyond a doubt that the Samaritans were really converted when they believed? They had been baptized on the assumption that the Holy Spirit had given them new hearts. The coming of the Holy Spirit with obvious signs (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:44-48">Acts 10:44-48</span>) as in Jerusalem would make it plain. </p>
