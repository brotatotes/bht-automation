 He was fallen  (ην επιπεπτωκος). Periphrastic past perfect active of επιπιπτω, old verb.

We should not use "it" for the Holy Spirit.Only they had been baptized  (μονον δε βαβαπτισμενο υπηρχον). Periphrastic past perfect passive of βαπτιζω with υπαρχω (see verse Acts 8:9 προυπηρχον), instead of ησαν.Into the name  (εις το ονομα). Better, in the name (see on Acts 2:38).
