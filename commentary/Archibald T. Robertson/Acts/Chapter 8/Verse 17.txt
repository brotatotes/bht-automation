<p><b> Laid they their hands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επετιθεσαν τας χειρας</span></span>). Imperfect active, repetition. The laying on of hands did not occur at the great Pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:33">Acts 2:33</span>) nor in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:31">Acts 4:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:44">Acts 10:44</span> nor is it mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:14">Acts 8:14</span>. It is mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:7">Acts 6:7</span> about the deacons and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:3">Acts 13:3</span> when Barnabas and Saul left Antioch. And in Saul's case it was Ananias who laid his hands on him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span>). Hence it cannot be concluded that the Holy Spirit was received only by the laying on of the hands of the apostles or by the hands of anyone. The so-called practice of "confirmation" appeals to this passage, but inconclusively.</p>
<p><b>They received </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαμβανον</span></span>). Imperfect active, repetition as before and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ πασσυ</span></span> with the laying on of the hands. </p>
