<p><b> When Simon saw </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιδων δε ο Σιμων</span></span>). This participle (second aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>) shows plainly that those who received the gift of the Holy Spirit spoke with tongues. Simon now saw power transferred to others. Hence he was determined to get this new power.</p>
<p><b>He offered them money </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσηνεγκεν χρηματα</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσφερω</span></span>. He took Peter to be like himself, a mountebank performer who would sell his tricks for enough money. Trafficking in things sacred like ecclesiastical preferments in England is called "Simony" because of this offer of Simon. </p>
