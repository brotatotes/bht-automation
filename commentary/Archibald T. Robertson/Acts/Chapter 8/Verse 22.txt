<p><b> Wickedness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακιας</span></span>). Only here in Luke's writings, though old word and in LXX (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:1">1 Peter 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:16">1 Peter 2:16</span>).</p>
<p><b>If perhaps </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε αρα</span></span>). <i>Si forte</i>. This idiom, though with the future indicative and so a condition of the first class (determined as fulfilled), yet minimizes the chance of forgiveness as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:13">Mark 11:13</span>. Peter may have thought that his sin was close to the unpardonable sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:31">Matthew 12:31</span>), but he does not close the door of hope.</p>
<p><b>The thought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η επινοια</span></span>). Old Greek word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επινοεω</span></span>, to think upon, and so purpose. Only here in the N.T. </p>
