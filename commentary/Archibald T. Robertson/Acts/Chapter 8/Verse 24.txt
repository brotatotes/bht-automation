<p><b> Pray ye for me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δεηθητε υμεις υπερ εμου</span></span>). Emphasis on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις</span></span> (you). First aorist passive imperative. Simon is thoroughly frightened by Peter's words, but shows no sign of personal repentance or change of heart. He wants to escape the penalty for his sin and hopes that Peter can avert it. Peter had clearly diagnosed his case. He was an unconverted man in spite of his profession of faith and baptism. There is no evidence that he ever changed his life at all.</p>
<p><b>Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span>). Genitive by attraction of the accusative relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> to case of the unexpressed antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span> (of those things), a common Greek idiom. </p>
