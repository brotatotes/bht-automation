<p><b> Toward the South </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα μεσημβριαν</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεσος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερα</span></span>, midday or noon as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:16">Acts 22:16</span>, the only other example in the N.T. That may be the idea here also, though "towards the South" gets support from the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα λιβα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:12">Acts 27:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>The same is desert </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτη εστιν ερημος</span></span>). Probably a parenthetical remark by Luke to give an idea of the way. One of the ways actually goes through a desert. Gaza itself was a strong city that resisted Alexander the Great five months. It was destroyed by the Romans after war broke out with the Jews. </p>
