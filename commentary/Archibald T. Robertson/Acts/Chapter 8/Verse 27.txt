<p><b> A eunuch of great authority </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευνουχος δυναστης</span></span>). Eunuchs were often employed by oriental rulers in high posts. <i>Dynasty</i> comes from this old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναστης</span></span> used of princes in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:52">Luke 1:52</span> and of God in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:15">1 Timothy 6:15</span>. Eunuchs were not allowed to be Jews in the full sense (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+23:1">Deuteronomy 23:1</span>), but only proselytes of the gate. But Christianity is spreading to Samaritans and to eunuchs.</p>
<p><b>Candace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κανδακης</span></span>). Not a personal name, but like Pharaoh and Ptolemy, the title of the queens of Ethiopia. This eunuch apparently brought the gospel to Ethiopia.</p>
<p><b>Treasure </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαζης</span></span>). Persian word, common in late Greek and Latin for the royal treasure, here only in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>For to worship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνησων</span></span>). Future active participle expressing purpose, a common idiom in the ancient Greek, but rare in the N.T. (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1128). </p>
