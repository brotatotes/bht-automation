<p><b> Laid waste </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελυμαινετο</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυμαινομα</span></span>, old verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυμη</span></span>, injury), to dishonour, defile, devastate, ruin. Only here in the N.T. Like the laying waste of a vineyard by a wild boar (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+79:13">Psalms 79:13</span>). Picturesque description of the havoc carried on by Saul now the leader in the persecution. He is victor over Stephen now who had probably worsted him in debate in the Cilician synagogue in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><b>Into every house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα τους οικους</span></span>). But Luke terms it "the church" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την εκκλησιαν</span></span>). Plainly not just an "assembly," but an organized body that was still "the church" when scattered in their own homes, "an unassembled assembly" according to the etymology. Words do not remain by the etymology, but travel on with usage.</p>
<p><b>Haling </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συρων</span></span>). Literally, dragging forcibly (=hauling). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συρω</span></span>, old verb.</p>
<p><b>Men and women </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανδρας κα γυναικας</span></span>). A new feature of the persecution that includes the women. They met it bravely as through all the ages since (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:2">Acts 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:4">Acts 22:4</span>). This fact will be a bitter memory for Paul always.</p>
<p><b>Committed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδιδου</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδωμ</span></span>, old verb, kept on handing them over to prison. </p>
