 Laid waste  (ελυμαινετο). Imperfect middle of λυμαινομα, old verb (from λυμη, injury), to dishonour, defile, devastate, ruin. Only here in the N.T. Like the laying waste of a vineyard by a wild boar (Psalms 79:13). Picturesque description of the havoc carried on by Saul now the leader in the persecution. He is victor over Stephen now who had probably worsted him in debate in the Cilician synagogue in Jerusalem.Into every house  (κατα τους οικους). But Luke terms it "the church" (την εκκλησιαν). Plainly not just an "assembly," but an organized body that was still "the church" when scattered in their own homes, "an unassembled assembly" according to the etymology. Words do not remain by the etymology, but travel on with usage.Haling  (συρων). Literally, dragging forcibly (=hauling). Present active participle of συρω, old verb.Men and women  (ανδρας κα γυναικας). A new feature of the persecution that includes the women. They met it bravely as through all the ages since (cf. Acts 9:2; Acts 22:4). This fact will be a bitter memory for Paul always.Committed  (παρεδιδου). Imperfect active of παραδιδωμ, old verb, kept on handing them over to prison.
