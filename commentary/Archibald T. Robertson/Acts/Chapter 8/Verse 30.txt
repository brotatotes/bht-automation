<p><b> Understandest thou what thou readest? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αρα γε γινωσκεις α αναγινωσκεισ?</span></span>) The interrogative particle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα</span></span> and the intensive particle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γε</span></span> indicate doubt on Philip's part. The play (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρανομασια</span></span>) upon the words in the Greek is very neat:</p>
<p><b>Do you know what you know again (read)? </b> The verb for read (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγινωσκο</span></span>) means to know the letters again, recognize, read. The famous comment of Julian about the Christian writings is often quoted: <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ανεγνων, εγνων, κατεγνων</span></span> (I read, I understood, I condemned). The keen retort was: <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ανεγνωσ, αλλ'ουκ εγνωσ, ε γαρ εγνωσ, ουκ αν κατεγνως</span></span> (You read, but did not understand; for if you had understood, you would not have condemned). </p>
