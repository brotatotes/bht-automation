 How can I, except some one shall guide me?  (Πως γαρ αν δυναιμην εαν με τις οδηγησε με?). This is a mixed condition, the conclusion coming first belongs to the fourth class (undetermined with less likelihood of being determined) with αν and the optative, but the condition (εαν, instead of the usual ε, and the future indicative) is of the first class (determined or fulfilled. Robertson, Grammar, p. 1022), a common enough phenomenon in the Koine. The eunuch felt the need of some one to guide (οδηγεω from οδηγος, guide, and that from οδος, way, and εγεομα, to lead).
