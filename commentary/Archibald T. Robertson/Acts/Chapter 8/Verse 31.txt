<p><b> How can I, except some one shall guide me? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πως γαρ αν δυναιμην εαν με τις οδηγησε με?</span></span>). This is a mixed condition, the conclusion coming first belongs to the fourth class (undetermined with less likelihood of being determined) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and the optative, but the condition (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span>, instead of the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span>, and the future indicative) is of the first class (determined or fulfilled. Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1022), a common enough phenomenon in the <i>Koine</i>. The eunuch felt the need of some one to guide (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδηγεω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδηγος</span></span>, guide, and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδος</span></span>, way, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγεομα</span></span>, to lead). </p>
