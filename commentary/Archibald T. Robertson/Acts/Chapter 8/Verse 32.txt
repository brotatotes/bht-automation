 The place  (ε περιοχη). See the verb περιεχε so used in 1 Peter 2:6. The word is used either of the section as in Codex A before the beginning of Mark or the contents of a passage. He was here reading one particular passage (Isaiah 53:7). The quotation is from the LXX which has some variations from the Hebrew.
