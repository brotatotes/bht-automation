<p><b> Was taken away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρω</span></span>, to take away. It is not clear what the meaning is here either in the Hebrew or the LXX. Knowling suggests that the idea is that justice was withheld, done away with, in his death, as it certainly was in the death of Christ. </p>
