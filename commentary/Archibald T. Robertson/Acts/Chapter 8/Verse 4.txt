<p><b> They therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μεν ουν</span></span>). Demonstrative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> as often (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:6">Acts 1:6</span>, etc.) though it will make sense as the article with the participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασπαρεντες</span></span>. The general statement is made here by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν</span></span> and a particular instance (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>) follows in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:5">Acts 8:5</span>. The inferential particle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν</span></span>) points back to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:3">Acts 8:3</span>, the persecution by young Saul and the Pharisees. Jesus had commanded the disciples not to depart from Jerusalem till they received the Promise of the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:4">Acts 1:4</span>), but they had remained long after that and were not carrying the gospel to the other peoples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8">Acts 1:8</span>). Now they were pushed out by Saul and began as a result to carry out the Great Commission for world conquest, that is those "scattered abroad" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασπαρεντες</span></span>, second aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασπειρω</span></span>). This verb means disperse, to sow in separate or scattered places (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) and so to drive people hither and thither. Old and very common verb, especially in the LXX, but in the N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:4">Acts 8:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>Went about </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διηλθον</span></span>). Constative second aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διερχομα</span></span>, to go through (from place to place, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>). Old and common verb, frequent for missionary journeys in the Acts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:40">Acts 5:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:40">Acts 8:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:32">Acts 9:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:6">Acts 13:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>Preaching the word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιζομενο τον λογον</span></span>). Evangelizing or gospelizing the word (the truth about Christ). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span> Luke explains more fully the extent of the labours of these new preachers of the gospel. They were emergency preachers, not ordained clergymen, but men stirred to activity by the zeal of Saul against them. The blood of the martyrs (Stephen) was already becoming the seed of the church. "The violent dispersion of these earnest disciples resulted in a rapid diffusion of the gospel" (Alvah Hovey). </p>
