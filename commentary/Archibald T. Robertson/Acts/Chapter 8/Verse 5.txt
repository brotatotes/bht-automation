<p><b> Philip </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φιλιππος</span></span>). The deacon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:5">Acts 6:5</span>) and evangelist (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:8">Acts 21:8</span>), not the apostle of the same name (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:18">Mark 3:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>To the city of Samaria </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την πολιν της Σαμαριας</span></span>). Genitive of apposition. Samaria is the name of the city here. This is the first instance cited of the expansion noted in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:4">Acts 8:4</span>. Jesus had an early and fruitful ministry in Samaria (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:4">Acts 8:4</span>), though the twelve were forbidden to go into a Samaritan city during the third tour of Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:5">Matthew 10:5</span>), a temporary prohibition withdrawn before Jesus ascended on high (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8">Acts 1:8</span>).</p>
<p><b>Proclaimed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκηρυσσεν</span></span>). Imperfect active, began to preach and kept on at it. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιζομενο</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:4">Acts 8:4</span> of missionaries of good news (Page) while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκηρυσσεν</span></span> here presents the preacher as a herald. He is also a teacher (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκαλος</span></span>) like Jesus. Luke probably obtained valuable information from Philip and his daughters about these early days when in his home in Caesarea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:8">Acts 21:8</span>). </p>
