<p><b> Gave heed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσειχον</span></span>). Imperfect active as in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:10">Acts 8:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:11">Acts 8:11</span>, there with dative of the person (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span>), here with the dative of the thing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις λεγομενοις</span></span>). There is an ellipse of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουν</span></span> (mind). They kept on giving heed or holding the mind on the things said by Philip, spell-bound, in a word.</p>
<p><b>When they heard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ακουειν αυτους</span></span>). Favourite Lukan idiom, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> and the locative case of the articlar infinitive with the accusative of general reference "in the hearing as to them."</p>
<p><b>Which he did </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α εποιε</span></span>). Imperfect active again, which he kept on doing from time to time. Philip wrought real miracles which upset the schemes of Simon Magus. </p>
