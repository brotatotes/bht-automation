 Coming in and laying  (εισελθοντα κα επιθεντα). Second aorist (ingressive) active participles picturing the punctiliar act as a sort of indirect discourse after verbs of sensation (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1040-2). Some ancient documents do not have "in a vision" here.Receive his sight  (αναβλεψε). First aorist active subjunctive with οπως (purpose). See again as in Acts 9:17.
