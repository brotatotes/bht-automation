<p><b> How much evil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσα κακα</span></span>). How many evil things. Saul's reputation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>) as a persecutor had preceded him.</p>
<p><b>To thy saints </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις αγιοις</span></span>). Dative of disadvantage. "Used here for the first time as a name for the Christians" (Knowling), but it came to be the common and normal (Hackett) term for followers of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:32">Acts 9:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:41">Acts 9:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:2">1 Corinthians 1:2</span>, etc.). This common word is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το αγος</span></span>, religious awe or reverence and is applied to God's name (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:49">Luke 1:49</span>), God's temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:15">Matthew 24:15</span>), God's people as set apart for God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:70">Luke 1:70</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:23">Luke 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span>, etc.). Ananias in his ignorance saw in Saul only the man with an evil reputation while Jesus saw in Saul the man transformed by grace to be a messenger of mercy. </p>
