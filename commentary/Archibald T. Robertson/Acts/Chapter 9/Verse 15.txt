<p><b> A chosen vessel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκευος εκλογης</span></span>). A vessel of choice or selection. The genitive of quality is common in the Hebrew, as in the vernacular <i>Koine</i>. Jesus chose Saul before Saul chose Jesus. He felt of himself that he was an earthen vessel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:7">2 Corinthians 4:7</span>) unworthy of so great a treasure. It was a great message that Ananias had to bear to Saul. He told it in his own way (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span>) and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:16">Acts 26:16</span> Paul blends the message of Jesus to Ananias with that to him as one.</p>
<p><b>Before the Gentiles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωπιον των εθνων</span></span>). This was the chief element in the call of Saul. He was to be an apostle to the Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:6-12">Ephesians 3:6-12</span>). </p>
