<p><b> I will shew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποδειξω</span></span>). Beforehand as a warning as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:7">Luke 3:7</span> and from time to time.</p>
<p><b>He must suffer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε αυτον παθειν</span></span>). Constative aorist active infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παθειν</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασχω</span></span>) covering the whole career of Saul. Suffering is one element in the call that Saul receives. He will learn "how many things" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσα</span></span>) are included in this list by degrees and by experience. A glance at <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:2">Acts 9:2</span> will show one the fulfilment of this prophecy. But it was the "gift" of Christ to Paul to go on suffering (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασχειν</span></span>, present infinitive, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:39">Philippians 1:39</span>). </p>
