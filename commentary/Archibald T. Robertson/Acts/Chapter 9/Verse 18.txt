<p><b> Fell off </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεπεσαν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative (note--an ending like first aorist) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποπιπτω</span></span>, old verb, but here alone in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>As if it were scales </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως λεπιδες</span></span>). Chiefly late word (LXX) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεπω</span></span>, to peel, and only here in the N.T. See Tobit 11:13, "The white film peeled from his eyes" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεπισθη</span></span>). Luke does not say that actual "scales" fell from the eyes of Saul, but that it felt that way to him as his sight returned, "as if" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span>). Medical writers use the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεπις</span></span> for pieces of the skin that fall off (Hobart, <i>Medical Language of St. Luke</i>, p. 39). Luke may have heard Paul tell of this vivid experience.</p>
<p><b>Was baptized </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβαπτισθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative. Apparently by Ananias (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:16">Acts 22:16</span>) as a symbol of the new life in Christ already begun, possibly in the pool in the house of Judas as today water is plentiful in Damascus or in Abana or Pharpar (Furneaux), better than all the waters of Israel according to Naaman (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:12">2 Kings 5:12</span>). </p>
