<p><b>Proving </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνβιβαζων</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνβιβαζω</span></span>, old verb to make go together, to coalesce, to knit together. It is the very word that Luke will use in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:10">Acts 16:10</span> of the conclusion reached at Troas concerning the vision of Paul. Here Saul took the various items in the life of Jesus of Nazareth and found in them the proof that he was in reality "the Messiah" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Χριστος</span></span>). This method of argument Paul continued to use with the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:3">Acts 17:3</span>). It was irresistible argument and spread consternation among the Jews. It was the most powerful piece of artillery in the Jewish camp that was suddenly turned round upon them. It is probable that at this juncture Saul went into Arabia for several years (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:12-24">Galatians 1:12-24</span>). Luke makes no mention of this important event, but he leaves ample room for it at this point. </p>
