<p><b> Plot </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιβουλη</span></span>). Old word for a plan (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλη</span></span>) against (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>) one. In the N.T. only in Acts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:24">Acts 9:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:3">Acts 20:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:19">Acts 20:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:30">Acts 23:30</span>).</p>
<p><b>They watched </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρετηρουντο</span></span>). Imperfect middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρατηρεω</span></span>, common verb in late Greek for watching beside (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>) or insidiously or on the sly as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:7">Luke 6:7</span>, they kept on watching by day and night to kill him. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:32">2 Corinthians 11:32</span> Paul says that the Ethnarch of Aretas "kept guard" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφρουρε</span></span>, imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρουρεω</span></span>) to seize him. Probably the Jews obtained the consent of the Ethnarch and had him appoint some of them as guards or watchers at the gate of the city. </p>
