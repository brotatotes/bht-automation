 Through the wall  (δια του τειχους). Paul in 2 Corinthians 11:33 explains δια του τειχους as being δια θυριδος (through a window) which opened into the house on the inside of the wall as is true today in Damascus as Hackett saw there. See Joshua 2:15 (cf. 1 Samuel 19:12) for the way that Rahab let out the spies "by a cord through the window."Lowering him  (αυτον χαλασαντες). First aorist active participle of χαλαω, old and common verb in a nautical sense (Acts 27:17; Acts 27:30) as well as otherwise as here. Same verb used by Paul of this experience (2 Corinthians 11:33).In a basket  (εν σφυριδ). The word used when the four thousand were fed (Mark 8:8; Matthew 15:37). A large basket plaited of reeds and distinguished in Mark 8:19 (Matthew 16:9) from the smaller κοφινος. Paul uses σαργανη, a basket made of ropes. This escape by night by the help of the men whom he had come to destroy was a shameful memory to Paul (2 Corinthians 11:33). Wendt thinks that the coincidences in language here prove that Luke had read II Corinthians. That, of course, is quite possible.
