<p><b> Through the wall </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του τειχους</span></span>). Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:33">2 Corinthians 11:33</span> explains <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του τειχους</span></span> as being <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια θυριδος</span></span> (through a window) which opened into the house on the inside of the wall as is true today in Damascus as Hackett saw there. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jos+2:15">Joshua 2:15</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+19:12">1 Samuel 19:12</span>) for the way that Rahab let out the spies "by a cord through the window."</p>
<p><b>Lowering him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον χαλασαντες</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλαω</span></span>, old and common verb in a nautical sense (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:17">Acts 27:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:30">Acts 27:30</span>) as well as otherwise as here. Same verb used by Paul of this experience (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:33">2 Corinthians 11:33</span>).</p>
<p><b>In a basket </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν σφυριδ</span></span>). The word used when the four thousand were fed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:8">Mark 8:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:37">Matthew 15:37</span>). A large basket plaited of reeds and distinguished in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:19">Mark 8:19</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:9">Matthew 16:9</span>) from the smaller <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοφινος</span></span>. Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαργανη</span></span>, a basket made of ropes. This escape by night by the help of the men whom he had come to destroy was a shameful memory to Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:33">2 Corinthians 11:33</span>). Wendt thinks that the coincidences in language here prove that Luke had read II Corinthians. That, of course, is quite possible. </p>
