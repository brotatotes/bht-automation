<p><b> Preaching boldly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησιαζομενος</span></span>). For a while. Evidently Saul did not extend his preaching outside of Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:22">Galatians 1:22</span>) and in the city preached mainly in the synagogues of the Hellenists (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τους Hελλενιστας</span></span>) as Stephen had done (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:9">Acts 8:9</span>). As a Cilician Jew he knew how to speak to the Hellenists.</p>
<p><b>Disputed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεζητε</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνζητεω</span></span>, the very verb used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:9">Acts 6:9</span> of the disputes with Stephen in these very synagogues in one of which (Cilicia) Saul had probably joined issue with Stephen to his own discomfort. It was intolerable to these Hellenistic Jews now to hear Saul taking the place of Stephen and using the very arguments that Stephen had employed.</p>
<p><b>But they went about to kill him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hο δε επεχειρουν ανελειν αυτον</span></span>). Demonstrative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> and the conative imperfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιχειρεω</span></span>, to put the hand to, to try, an old verb used in the N.T. only three times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:1">Luke 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:29">Acts 9:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:3">Acts 19:3</span>). They offer to Saul the same conclusive answer that he gave to Stephen, death. Paul tells how the Lord Jesus appeared to him at this juncture in a vision in the temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17-21">Acts 22:17-21</span>) with the distinct command to leave Jerusalem and how Paul protested that he was willing to meet the fate of Stephen in whose death he had a shameful part. That is to Saul's credit, but the Lord did not want Saul to be put to death yet. His crown of martyrdom will come later. </p>
