<p><b> Aenias </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αινεαν</span></span>). Old Greek name and so probably a Hellenistic Jew. He was apparently a disciple already (the saint, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:32">Acts 9:32</span>). Luke the physician notes that he had been bed ridden for eight years. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:15">Acts 5:15</span> for "bed" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραβαττου</span></span>) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:7">Acts 8:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:18">Luke 5:18</span> for "paralyzed" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλελυμενος</span></span>, perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλυω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span>, periphrastic past perfect passive). </p>
