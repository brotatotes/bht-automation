<p><b> At Joppa </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εν Ιοππη</span></span>). The modern Jaffa, the port of Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+2:16">2 Chronicles 2:16</span>).</p>
<p><b>Disciple </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαθητρια</span></span>). Feminine form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαθητης</span></span>, a learner from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μανθανω</span></span>, to learn, a late word and only here in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Tabitha </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ταβειθα</span></span>). Aramaic form of the Hebrew <i>Tsebi</i> and, like the Greek word</p>
<p><b>Dorcas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δορκας</span></span>), means Gazelle, "the creature with the beautiful look" (or eyes), from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δερκομα</span></span>. The gazelle was a favourite type for beauty in the orient (Song of Solomon <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9">Acts 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:5">Acts 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:3">Acts 7:3</span>). She may have had both the Aramaic and the Greek name, Tabitha Dorcas like John Mark. There is nothing said about a husband and so she was probably unmarried. She is the second woman mentioned by name after Pentecost (Sapphira the other). She did her beautiful deeds by herself. She did not have a Dorcas society.</p>
<p><b>Did </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποιε</span></span>). Imperfect active, her habit. </p>
