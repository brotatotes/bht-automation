<p><b> Delay not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη οκνησηις</span></span>). Ingressive aorist active subjunctive in prohibition. Direct discourse and not indirect as late MSS. have (aorist active infinitive, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οκνησα</span></span>). Possibly the two messengers started before Dorcas was quite dead, though we do not know. Peter had recently healed Aeneas and the disciples may have had faith enough to believe that he could raise the dead by the power of Christ. W. M. Ramsay doubts if Dorcas was really dead, but why see legends in these supernatural events? </p>
