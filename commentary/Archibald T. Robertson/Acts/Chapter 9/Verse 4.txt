<p><b> He fell upon the earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεσων επ την γην</span></span>). Second aorist active participle. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:7">Acts 22:7</span> Paul says: "I fell unto the ground" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεσα εις το εδαφος</span></span>) using an old word rather than the common <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γην</span></span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</span> Paul states that "we were all fallen to the earth" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντων καταπεσοντων ημων εις την γην</span></span>, genitive absolute construction). But here in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</span> "the men that journeyed with him stood speechless" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστηκεισαν ενεο</span></span>). But surely the points of time are different. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</span> Paul refers to the first appearance of the vision when all fell to the earth. Here in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</span> Luke refers to what occurred after the vision when both Saul and the men had risen from the ground.</p>
<p><b>Saul, Saul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σαουλ, Σαουλ</span></span>). The Hebrew form occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:7">Acts 22:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</span> where it is expressly stated that the voice was in the Hebrew (Aramaic) tongue as also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span> (Ananias). Deissmann (<i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 316) terms this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σαουλ</span></span> "the historian's sense of liturgical rhythm." For the repetition of names by Jesus note <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:41">Luke 10:41</span> (Martha, Martha), <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:31">Luke 22:31</span> (Simon, Simon).</p>
<p><b>Me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span>). In persecuting the disciples, Saul was persecuting Jesus, as the words of Jesus in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:5">Acts 9:5</span> made plain. Christ had already spoken of the mystic union between himself and his followers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:40">Matthew 10:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:40">Matthew 25:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:45">Matthew 25:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:1-5">John 15:1-5</span>). The proverb (Pindar) that Jesus quotes to Saul about kicking against the goad is genuine in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</span>, but not here. </p>
