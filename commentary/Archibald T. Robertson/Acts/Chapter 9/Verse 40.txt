<p><b> Put them all forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλων εξω παντας</span></span>). Second aorist (effective) active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλλω</span></span>, a rather strong word, perhaps with some difficulty. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:40">Mark 5:40</span> which incident Peter may have recalled. The words are not genuine in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:54">Luke 8:54</span>. Peter's praying alone reminds one of Elijah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:20">1 Kings 17:20</span>) and the widow's son and Elisha for the Shunammite's son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+4:33">2 Kings 4:33</span>).</p>
<p><b>Tabitha, arise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ταβειθα, αναστηθ</span></span>). With sublime faith like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ταλειθα κουμ</span></span> of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:41">Mark 5:41</span>.</p>
<p><b>She sat up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεκαθισεν</span></span>). Effective aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακαθιζω</span></span>. Often in medical writers, only here in the N.T. and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:15">Luke 7:15</span> where Westcott and Hort have in the margin the uncompounded form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθισεν</span></span>. Vivid picture. </p>
