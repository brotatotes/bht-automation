<p><b> Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριε</span></span>). It is open to question if <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριε</span></span> should not here be translated "Sir" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:30">Acts 16:30</span> and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:29">Matthew 21:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:30">Matthew 21:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:7">John 5:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:21">John 12:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:15">John 20:15</span>; and should be so in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:36">John 9:36</span>. It is hardly likely that at this stage Saul recognized Jesus as Lord, though he does so greet him in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:10">Acts 22:10</span> "What shall I do, Lord?" Saul may have recognized the vision as from God as Cornelius says "Lord" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:4">Acts 10:4</span>. Saul surrendered instantly as Thomas did (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:28">John 20:28</span>) and as little Samuel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+3:9">1 Samuel 3:9</span>). This surrender of the will to Christ was the conversion of Saul. He saw a real Person, the Risen Christ, to whom he surrendered his life. On this point he never wavered for a moment to the end. </p>
