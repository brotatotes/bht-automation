<p>The best MSS. do not have "trembling and astonished," and "What wilt thou have me to do, Lord?" The Textus Receptus put these words in here without the authority of a Greek codex. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:10">Acts 22:10</span> above for the genuine text.</p>
<p><b>It shall be told thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαληθησετα</span></span>). Future passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span>. It is hardly likely that Luke records all that Jesus said to Saul, but more was to come on his arrival in Damascus. Saul had received all that he could bear just now (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:12">John 16:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>What </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). Rare in <i>Koine</i> use of this indefinite neuter relative in an indirect question, the only example in the N.T. (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 731). Human agents like Ananias can finish what Jesus by supernatural manifestation has here begun in Saul. </p>
