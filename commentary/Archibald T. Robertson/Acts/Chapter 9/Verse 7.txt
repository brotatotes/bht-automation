<p><b> That journeyed with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο συνοδευοντες αυτω</span></span>). Not in the older Greek, but in the <i>Koine</i>, with the associative instrumental.</p>
<p><b>Speechless </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεο</span></span>). Mute. Only here in N.T., though old word.</p>
<p><b>Hearing the voice, but beholding no man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουοντες μεν της φωνησ, μηδενα δε θεωρουντες</span></span>). Two present active participles in contrast (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν, δε</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:9">Acts 22:9</span> Paul says that the men "beheld the light" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μεν φως εθεασαντο</span></span>), but evidently did not discern the person. Paul also says there, "but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την δε φωνην ουκ ηκουσαν του λαλουντος μο</span></span>). Instead of this being a flat contradiction of what Luke says in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</span> it is natural to take it as being likewise (as with the "light" and "no one") a distinction between the "sound" (original sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνη</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:8">John 3:8</span>) and the separate words spoken. It so happens that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span> is used either with the accusative (the extent of the hearing) or the genitive (the specifying). It is possible that such a distinction here coincides with the two senses of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνη</span></span>. They heard the sound (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</span>), but did not understand the words (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:9">Acts 22:9</span>). However, this distinction in case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span>, though possible and even probable here, is by no means a necessary one for in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:8">John 3:8</span> where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνην</span></span> undoubtedly means "sound" the accusative occurs as Luke uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσεν φωνην</span></span> about Saul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:4">Acts 9:4</span>. Besides in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:7">Acts 22:7</span> Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσα φωνης</span></span> about himself, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσα φωνην</span></span> about himself in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+76:14">Acts 76:14</span>, interchangeably. </p>
