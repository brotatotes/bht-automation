<p><b> He saw nothing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν εβλεπεν</span></span>). Imperfect active indicative, was seeing nothing. "The glory of that light" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:11">Acts 22:11</span>) when he saw Jesus had blinded his eyes now wide open (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεωιγμενων</span></span>, perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιγω</span></span> with double reduplication). The blindness was proof that something had happened to him and that it was no hallucination that he had seen the Risen Christ. Saul arose after the others were on their feet.</p>
<p><b>They led him by the hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειραγωγουντες</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειραγωγος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρ</span></span>, hand and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγω</span></span>, to lead). Only here in the N.T., but in LXX and late writers though not in the old Greek. It was a pathetic picture to see the masterful Saul, victorious persecutor and conqueror of the disciples, now helpless as a child. </p>
