<p><b> Of Christ Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστου Ιησου</span></span>). This order in the later epistles shows that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος</span></span> is now regarded as a proper name and not just a verbal adjective (Anointed One, Messiah). Paul describes himself because he is unknown to the Colossians, not because of attack as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Timothy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τιμοθεος</span></span>). Mentioned as in I and II Thess. when in Corinth, II Cor. when in Macedonia, Phil. and Philemon when in Rome as here. </p>
