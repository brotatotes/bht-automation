 Of Christ Jesus  (Χριστου Ιησου). This order in the later epistles shows that Χριστος is now regarded as a proper name and not just a verbal adjective (Anointed One, Messiah). Paul describes himself because he is unknown to the Colossians, not because of attack as in Galatians 1:1.Timothy  (Τιμοθεος). Mentioned as in I and II Thess. when in Corinth, II Cor. when in Macedonia, Phil. and Philemon when in Rome as here.
