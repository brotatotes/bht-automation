<p><b> Delivered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερυσατο</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυομα</span></span>, old verb, to rescue. This appositional relative clause further describes God the Father's redemptive work and marks the transition to the wonderful picture of the person and work of Christ in nature and grace in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:14-20">Colossians 1:14-20</span>, a full and final answer to the Gnostic depreciation of Jesus Christ by speculative philosophy and to all modern efforts after a "reduced" picture of Christ. God rescued us out from (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>) the power (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσιας</span></span>) of the kingdom of darkness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκοτους</span></span>) in which we were held as slaves.</p>
<p><b>Translated </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετεστησεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθιστημ</span></span> and transitive (not intransitive like second aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετεστη</span></span>). Old word. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:2">1 Corinthians 13:2</span>. Changed us from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light.</p>
<p><b>Of the Son of his love </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του υιου της αγαπης αυτου</span></span>). Probably objective genitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπης</span></span>), the Son who is the object of the Father's love like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπητος</span></span> (beloved) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>. Others would take it as describing love as the origin of the Son which is true, but hardly pertinent here. But Paul here rules out the whole system of aeons and angels that the Gnostics placed above Christ. It is Christ's Kingdom in which he is King. He has moral and spiritual sovereignty. </p>
