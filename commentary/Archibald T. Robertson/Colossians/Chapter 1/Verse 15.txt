<p><b> The image </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εικων</span></span>). In predicate and no article. On <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εικων</span></span>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>. Jesus is the very stamp of God the Father as he was before the Incarnation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>) and is now (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:5-11">Philippians 2:5-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>).</p>
<p><b>Of the invisible God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θεου του αορατου</span></span>). But the one who sees Jesus has seen God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9">John 14:9</span>). See this verbal adjective (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>The first born </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτοτοκος</span></span>). Predicate adjective again and anarthrous. This passage is parallel to the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογος</span></span> passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1-18">John 1:1-18</span> and to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1-4">Hebrews 1:1-4</span> as well as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:5-11">Philippians 2:5-11</span> in which these three writers (John, author of Hebrews, Paul) give the high conception of the Person of Christ (both Son of God and Son of Man) found also in the Synoptic Gospels and even in Q (the Father, the Son). This word (LXX and N.T.) can no longer be considered purely "Biblical" (Thayer), since it is found In inscriptions (Deissmann, <i>Light, etc.</i>, p. 91) and in the papyri (Moulton and Milligan, <i>Vocabulary, etc.</i>). See it already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:7">Luke 2:7</span> and Aleph for <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:25">Matthew 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>. The use of this word does not show what Arius argued that Paul regarded Christ as a creature like "all creation" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασης κτισεως</span></span>, by metonomy the <i>act</i> regarded as <i>result</i>). It is rather the comparative (superlative) force of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτος</span></span> that is used (first-born of all creation) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6">Hebrews 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:23">Hebrews 12:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>. Paul is here refuting the Gnostics who pictured Christ as one of the aeons by placing him before "all creation" (angels and men). Like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εικων</span></span> we find <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτοτοκος</span></span> in the Alexandrian vocabulary of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογος</span></span> teaching (Philo) as well as in the LXX. Paul takes both words to help express the deity of Jesus Christ in his relation to the Father as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εικων</span></span> (Image) and to the universe as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτοτοκος</span></span> (First-born). </p>
