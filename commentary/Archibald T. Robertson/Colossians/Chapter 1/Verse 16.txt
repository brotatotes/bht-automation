 All things  (τα παντα). The universe as in Romans 11:35, a well-known philosophical phrase. It is repeated at the end of the verse.In him were created  (εν αυτω εκτισθη). Paul now gives the reason (οτ, for) for the primacy of Christ in the work of creation (Colossians 1:16). It is the constative aorist passive indicative εκτισθη (from κτιζω, old verb, to found, to create (Romans 1:25). This central activity of Christ in the work of creation is presented also in John 1:3; Hebrews 1:2 and is a complete denial of the Gnostic philosophy. The whole of creative activity is summed up in Christ including the angels in heaven and everything on earth. God wrought through "the Son of his love." All earthly dignities are included.Have been created  (εκτιστα). Perfect passive indicative of κτιζω, "stand created," "remain created." The permanence of the universe rests, then, on Christ far more than on gravity. It is a Christo-centric universe.Through him  (δι' αυτου). As the intermediate and sustaining agent. He had already used εν αυτω (in him) as the sphere of activity.And unto him  (κα εις αυτον). This is the only remaining step to take and Paul takes it (1 Corinthians 15:28) See Ephesians 1:10 for similar use of εν αυτω of Christ and in Colossians 1:19; Colossians 1:20 again we have εν αυτωι, δι' αυτου, εις αυτον used of Christ. See Hebrews 2:10 for δι' ον (because of whom) and δι' ου (by means of whom) applied to God concerning the universe (τα παντα). In Romans 11:35 we find εξ αυτου κα δι' αυτου κα εις αυτον τα παντα referring to God. But Paul does not use εξ in this connection of Christ, but only εν, δια, and εις. See the same distinction preserved in 1 Corinthians 8:6 (εξ of God, δια, of Christ).
