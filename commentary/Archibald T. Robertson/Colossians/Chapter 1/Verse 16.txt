<p><b> All things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα παντα</span></span>). The universe as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:35">Romans 11:35</span>, a well-known philosophical phrase. It is repeated at the end of the verse.</p>
<p><b>In him were created </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτω εκτισθη</span></span>). Paul now gives the reason (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>, for) for the primacy of Christ in the work of creation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>). It is the constative aorist passive indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτισθη</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτιζω</span></span>, old verb, to found, to create (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:25">Romans 1:25</span>). This central activity of Christ in the work of creation is presented also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span> and is a complete denial of the Gnostic philosophy. The whole of creative activity is summed up in Christ including the angels in heaven and everything on earth. God wrought through "the Son of his love." All earthly dignities are included.</p>
<p><b>Have been created </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτιστα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτιζω</span></span>, "stand created," "remain created." The permanence of the universe rests, then, on Christ far more than on gravity. It is a Christo-centric universe.</p>
<p><b>Through him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' αυτου</span></span>). As the intermediate and sustaining agent. He had already used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτω</span></span> (in him) as the sphere of activity.</p>
<p><b>And unto him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εις αυτον</span></span>). This is the only remaining step to take and Paul takes it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:28">1 Corinthians 15:28</span>) See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span> for similar use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτω</span></span> of Christ and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:19">Colossians 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span> again we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτωι, δι' αυτου, εις αυτον</span></span> used of Christ. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ον</span></span> (because of whom) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ου</span></span> (by means of whom) applied to God concerning the universe (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα παντα</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:35">Romans 11:35</span> we find <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ αυτου κα δι' αυτου κα εις αυτον τα παντα</span></span> referring to God. But Paul does not use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span> in this connection of Christ, but only <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>. See the same distinction preserved in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:6">1 Corinthians 8:6</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span> of God, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>, of Christ). </p>
