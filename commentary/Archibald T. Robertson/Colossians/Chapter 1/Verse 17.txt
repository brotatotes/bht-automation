<p><b> Before all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ παντων</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προ</span></span> with the ablative case. This phrase makes Paul's meaning plain. The precedence of Christ in time and the preeminence as Creator are both stated sharply. See the claim of Jesus to eternal timeless existence in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:58">John 8:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+23:13">Revelation 23:13</span> where Christ calls himself the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχη</span></span>) and the End (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελος</span></span>). Paul states it also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>Consist </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεστηκεν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative (intransitive) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιστημ</span></span>, old verb, to place together and here to cohere, to hold together. The word repeats the statements in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>, especially that in the form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτιστα</span></span>. Christ is the controlling and unifying force in nature. The Gnostic philosophy that matter is evil and was created by a remote aeon is thus swept away. The Son of God's love is the Creator and the Sustainer of the universe which is not evil. </p>
