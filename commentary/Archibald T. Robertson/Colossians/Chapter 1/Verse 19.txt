<p><b> For it was the good pleasure of the Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ευδοκησεν</span></span>). No word in the Greek for "the Father," though the verb calls for either <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πατηρ</span></span> as the subject. This verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδοκεω</span></span> is common in the N.T. for God's will and pleasure (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:5">1 Corinthians 10:5</span>).</p>
<p><b>All the fulness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν το πληρωμα</span></span>). The same idea as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9">Colossians 2:9</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν το πληρωμα της θεοτητος</span></span> (all the fulness of the Godhead). "A recognized technical term in theology, denoting the totality of the Divine powers and attributes" (Lightfoot). It is an old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span>, to fill full, used in various senses as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:20">Mark 8:20</span> of the baskets, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:10">Galatians 4:10</span> of time, etc. The Gnostics distributed the divine powers among various aeons. Paul gathers them all up in Christ, a full and flat statement of the deity of Christ.</p>
<p><b>Should dwell </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατοικησα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατοικεω</span></span>, to make abode or home. All the divine attributes are at home in Christ (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτω</span></span>). </p>
