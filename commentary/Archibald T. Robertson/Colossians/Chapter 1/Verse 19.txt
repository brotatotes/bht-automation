 For it was the good pleasure of the Father  (οτ ευδοκησεν). No word in the Greek for "the Father," though the verb calls for either ο θεος or ο πατηρ as the subject. This verb ευδοκεω is common in the N.T. for God's will and pleasure (Matthew 3:17; 1 Corinthians 10:5).All the fulness  (παν το πληρωμα). The same idea as in Colossians 2:9 παν το πληρωμα της θεοτητος (all the fulness of the Godhead). "A recognized technical term in theology, denoting the totality of the Divine powers and attributes" (Lightfoot). It is an old word from πληροω, to fill full, used in various senses as in Mark 8:20 of the baskets, Galatians 4:10 of time, etc. The Gnostics distributed the divine powers among various aeons. Paul gathers them all up in Christ, a full and flat statement of the deity of Christ.Should dwell  (κατοικησα). First aorist active infinitive of κατοικεω, to make abode or home. All the divine attributes are at home in Christ (εν αυτω).
