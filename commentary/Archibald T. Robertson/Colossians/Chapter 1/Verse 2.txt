<p><b> At Colossae </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Κολοσσαις</span></span>). The spelling is uncertain, the MSS. differing in the title (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κολασσαεις</span></span>) and here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κολοσσαις</span></span>). Colossae was a city of Phrygia on the Lycus, the tributaries of which brought a calcareous deposit of a peculiar kind that choked up the streams and made arches and fantastic grottoes. In spite of this there was much fertility in the valley with two other prosperous cities some ten or twelve miles away (Hierapolis and Laodicea). "The church at Colossae was the least important of any to which Paul's epistles were addressed" (Vincent). But he had no greater message for any church than he here gives concerning the Person of Christ. There is no more important message today for modern men. </p>
