<p><b> Through him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' αυτου</span></span>). As the sufficient and chosen agent in the work of reconciliation (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαταλλαξα</span></span>, first aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαταλλασσω</span></span>, further addition to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδοκησεν</span></span>, was pleased). This double compound (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο, κατα</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλασσω</span></span>) occurs only here, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:22">Colossians 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:16">Ephesians 2:16</span>, and nowhere else so far as known. Paul's usual word for "reconcile" is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλλασσω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:18-20">2 Corinthians 5:18-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:10">Romans 5:10</span>), though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαλλασσω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:24">Matthew 5:24</span>) is more common in Attic. The addition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> here is clearly for the idea of complete reconciliation. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:18-20">2 Corinthians 5:18-20</span> for discussion of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλλασσω</span></span>, Paul's great word. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα παντα</span></span> (the all things, the universe) as if the universe were somehow out of harmony reminds us of the mystical passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19-23">Romans 8:19-23</span> which see for discussion. Sin somehow has put the universe out of joint. Christ will set it right.</p>
<p><b>Unto himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις αυτον</span></span>). Unto God, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον</span></span> is not reflexive unless written <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Having made peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρηνοποιησας</span></span>). Late and rare compound (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+10:10">Proverbs 10:10</span> and here only in N.T.) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρηνοποιος</span></span>, peacemaker (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:9">Matthew 5:9</span>; here only in N.T.). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιων ειρηνην</span></span> (separate words)</p>
<p><b>making peace </b>. Not the masculine gender, though agreeing with the idea of Christ involved even if <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρωμα</span></span> be taken as the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδοκησεν</span></span>, a participial anacoluthon (construction according to sense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:19">Colossians 2:19</span>). If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span> be taken as the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδοκησεν</span></span> the participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρηνοποιησας</span></span> refers to Christ, not to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span> (God).</p>
<p><b>Through the blood of his cross </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του αιματος του σταυρου αυτου</span></span>). This for the benefit of the Docetic Gnostics who denied the real humanity of Jesus and as clearly stating the <i>causa medians</i> (Ellicott) of the work of reconciliation to be the Cross of Christ, a doctrine needed today.</p>
<p><b>Or things in the heavens </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειτε τα εν τοις ουρανοις</span></span>). Much needless trouble has been made over this phrase as if things in heaven were not exactly right. It is rather a hypothetical statement like verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span> not put in categorical form (Abbott), <i>universitas rerum</i> (Ellicott). </p>
