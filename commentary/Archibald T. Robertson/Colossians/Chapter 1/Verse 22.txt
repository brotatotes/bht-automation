<p><b> Yet now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν δε</span></span>). Sharpened contrast with emphatic form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν</span></span>, "now" being not at the present moment, but in the present order of things in the new dispensation of grace in Christ.</p>
<p><b>Hath he reconciled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκατηλλαξεν</span></span>). First aorist (effective, timeless) active indicative (a sort of parenthetical anacoluthon). Here B reads <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαταλλαγητε</span></span>, be ye reconciled like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλλαγητε</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:20">2 Corinthians 5:20</span> while D has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαταλλαγεντες</span></span>. Lightfoot prefers to follow B here (the hard reading), though Westcott and Hort only put it in the margin. On the word see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>In the body of his flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω σωματ της σαρκος αυτου</span></span>). See the same combination in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:11">Colossians 2:11</span> though in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:14">Ephesians 2:14</span> only <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκ</span></span> (flesh). Apparently Paul combines both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωμα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρξ</span></span> to make plain the actual humanity of Jesus against incipient Docetic Gnostics who denied it.</p>
<p><b>Through death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του θανατου</span></span>). The reconciliation was accomplished by means of Christ's death on the cross (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span>) and not just by the Incarnation (the body of his flesh) in which the death took place.</p>
<p><b>To present </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραστησα</span></span>). First aorist active (transitive) infinitive (of purpose) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παριστημ</span></span>, old verb, to place beside in many connections. See it used of presenting Paul and the letter from Lysias to Felix (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:33">Acts 23:33</span>). Repeated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:28">Colossians 2:28</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:14">2 Corinthians 4:14</span>. Paul has the same idea of his responsibility in rendering an account for those under his influence seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:17">Hebrews 13:17</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span> for use of living sacrifice.</p>
<p><b>Holy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιους</span></span>). Positively consecrated, separated unto God. Common in N.T. for believers. Haupt holds that all these terms have a religious and forensic sense here.</p>
<p><b>Without blemish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμωμους</span></span>). Without spot (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:15">Philippians 2:15</span>). Old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωμος</span></span> (blemish). Common in the LXX for ceremonial purifications.</p>
<p><b>Unreproveable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεγκλητους</span></span>). Old verbal adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγκαλεω</span></span>, to call to account, to pick flaws in. These three adjectives give a marvellous picture of complete purity (positive and negative, internal and external). This is Paul's ideal when he presents the Colossians "before him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατενωπιον αυτου</span></span>), right down in the eye of Christ the Judge of all. </p>
