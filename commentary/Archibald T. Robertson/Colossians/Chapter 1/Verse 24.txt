<p><b> Now I rejoice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν χαιρομεν</span></span>). This is not a new note for Paul. See him in jail in Philippi (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:25">Acts 16:25</span>) and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:16-33">2 Corinthians 11:16-33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:3">Romans 5:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:18">Philippians 2:18</span>.</p>
<p><b>Fill up on my part </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανταναπληρω</span></span>). Very rare double compound verb (here only in N.T.) to fill (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span>) up (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα</span></span>), in turn (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span>). It is now Paul's "turn" at the bat, to use a baseball figure. Christ had his "turn," the grandest of all and suffered for us all in a sense not true of any one else. It is the idea of balance or correspondence in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span> as seen in Demosthenes's use of this verb (<i>De Symm</i>., p. 282), "the poor balancing the rich." And yet Christ did not cause suffering to cease. There is plenty left for Paul and for each of us in his time.</p>
<p><b>That which is lacking </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα υστερηματα</span></span>). "The left-overs," so to speak. Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υστερεω</span></span>, to come behind, to be left, to fail. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:4">Luke 21:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:10">1 Thessalonians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:14">2 Corinthians 8:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:12">2 Corinthians 9:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>For his body's sake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ του σωματος αυτου</span></span>). As Paul showed in his exultation in suffering in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:16-33">2 Corinthians 11:16-33</span>, though not in the same sense in which Christ suffered and died for us as Redeemer. Paul attaches no atoning value whatever to his own sufferings for the church (see also verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>). </p>
