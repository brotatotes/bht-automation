 According to the dispensation of God  (κατα την οικονομιαν του θεου). "According to the economy of God." An old word from οικονομεω, to be a house steward (οικοσ, νεμω) as in Luke 16:2-4; 1 Corinthians 9:17; Ephesians 1:9; Ephesians 3:9. It was by God's stewardship that Paul was made a minister of Christ.To fulfil the word of God  (πληρωσα τον λογον του θεου). First aorist active infinitive of purpose (πληροω), a fine phrase for a God-called preacher, to fill full or to give full scope to the Word of God. The preacher is an expert on the word of God by profession. See Paul's ideal about preaching in 2 Thessalonians 3:1.
