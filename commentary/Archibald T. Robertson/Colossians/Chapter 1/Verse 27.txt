<p><b> God was pleased </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηθελησεν ο θεος</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω</span></span>, to will, to wish. "God willed" this change from hidden mystery to manifestation.</p>
<p><b>To make known </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωρισα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωριζω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>). Among the Gentiles (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις εθνεσιν</span></span>). This is the crowning wonder to Paul that God had included the Gentiles in his redemptive grace, "the riches of the glory of this mystery" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πλουτος της δοξης του μυστηριου τουτου</span></span>) and that Paul himself has been made the minister of this grace among the Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1-2">Ephesians 3:1-2</span>). He feels the high honour keenly and meets the responsibility humbly.</p>
<p><b>Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span>). Grammatical gender (neuter) agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυστηριου</span></span> (mystery), supported by A B P Vulg., though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span> (who) agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος</span></span> in the predicate is read by Aleph C D L. At any rate the idea is simply that the personal aspect of "this mystery" is "Christ in you the hope of glory" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος εν υμιν η ελπις της δοξης</span></span>). He is addressing Gentiles, but the idea of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> here is in, not among. It is the personal experience and presence of Christ in the individual life of all believers that Paul has in mind, the indwelling Christ in the heart as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:17">Ephesians 3:17</span>. He constitutes also the hope of glory for he is the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σεκινα</span></span> of God. Christ is our hope now (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:1">1 Timothy 1:1</span>) and the consummation will come (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18">Romans 8:18</span>). </p>
