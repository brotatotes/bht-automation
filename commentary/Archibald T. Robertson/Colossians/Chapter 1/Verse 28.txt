 Whom  (ον). That is, "Christ in you, the hope of glory."We proclaim  (καταγγελλομεν). Paul, Timothy and all like-minded preachers against the Gnostic depreciation of Christ. This verb originally (Xenophon) meant to denounce, but in N.T. it means to announce (αγγελλω) throughout (κατα), to proclaim far and wide (Acts 13:5).Admonishing  (νουθετουντες). Old verb from νουθετης, admonisher (from νουσ, τιθημ). See already Acts 20:31; 1 Thessalonians 5:12; 1 Thessalonians 5:14; 2 Thessalonians 3:15, etc. Warning about practice and teaching (διδασκοντες) about doctrine. Such teaching calls for "all wisdom"Every man  (παντα ανθρωπον). Repeated three times. "In opposition to the doctrine of an intellectual exclusiveness taught by the false teachers" (Abbott).That we may present  (ινα παραστησωμεν). Final use of ινα and first aorist active subjunctive of παριστημ, for which see Colossians 1:22, the final presentation to Christ.Perfect  (τελειον). Spiritual adults in Christ, no longer babes in Christ (Hebrews 5:14), mature and ripened Christians (Colossians 4:22), the full-grown man in Christ (Ephesians 4:13). The relatively perfect (Philippians 3:15) will on that day of the presentation be fully developed as here (Colossians 4:12; Ephesians 4:13). The Gnostics used τελειος of the one fully initiated into their mysteries and it is quite possible that Paul here has also a sidewise reference to their use of the term.
