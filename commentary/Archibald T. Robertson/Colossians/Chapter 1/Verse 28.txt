<p><b> Whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον</span></span>). That is, "Christ in you, the hope of glory."</p>
<p><b>We proclaim </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταγγελλομεν</span></span>). Paul, Timothy and all like-minded preachers against the Gnostic depreciation of Christ. This verb originally (Xenophon) meant to denounce, but in N.T. it means to announce (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελλω</span></span>) throughout (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>), to proclaim far and wide (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:5">Acts 13:5</span>).</p>
<p><b>Admonishing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουθετουντες</span></span>). Old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουθετης</span></span>, admonisher (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουσ, τιθημ</span></span>). See already <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:31">Acts 20:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:12">1 Thessalonians 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:14">1 Thessalonians 5:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:15">2 Thessalonians 3:15</span>, etc. Warning about practice and teaching (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκοντες</span></span>) about doctrine. Such teaching calls for "all wisdom"</p>
<p><b>Every man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα ανθρωπον</span></span>). Repeated three times. "In opposition to the doctrine of an intellectual exclusiveness taught by the false teachers" (Abbott).</p>
<p><b>That we may present </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα παραστησωμεν</span></span>). Final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παριστημ</span></span>, for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:22">Colossians 1:22</span>, the final presentation to Christ.</p>
<p><b>Perfect </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειον</span></span>). Spiritual adults in Christ, no longer babes in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:14">Hebrews 5:14</span>), mature and ripened Christians (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:22">Colossians 4:22</span>), the full-grown man in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span>). The relatively perfect (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:15">Philippians 3:15</span>) will on that day of the presentation be fully developed as here (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:12">Colossians 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span>). The Gnostics used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειος</span></span> of the one fully initiated into their mysteries and it is quite possible that Paul here has also a sidewise reference to their use of the term. </p>
