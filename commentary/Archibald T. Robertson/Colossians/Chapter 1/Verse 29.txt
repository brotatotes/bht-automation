 Whereunto  (εις ο). That is "to present every man perfect in Christ."I labour also  (κα κοπιω). Late verb κοπιαω, from κοπος (toil), to grow weary from toil (Matthew 11:28), to toil on (Philippians 2:16), sometimes for athletic training. In papyri.Striving  (αγωνιζομενος). Present middle participle of common verb αγωνιζομα (from αγων, contest, as in Colossians 2:1), to contend in athletic games, to agonize, a favourite metaphor with Paul who is now a prisoner.Working  (ενεργειαν). Our word "energy." Late word from ενεργης (εν, εργον), efficiency (at work). Play on the word here with the present passive participle of ενεργεω, ενεργουμενην (energy energized) as in Ephesians 1:19. Paul was conscious of God's "energy" at work in him "mightily" (εν δυναμε), "in power" like dynamite.
