 God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ  (τω θεω πατρ του κυριου ημων Ιησου Χριστου). Correct text without κα (and) as in Colossians 3:17, though usually "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (2 Corinthians 1:3; 2 Corinthians 11:31; Romans 15:6; 1 Peter 1:3; Revelation 1:6). In verse Colossians 1:2 we have the only instance in the opening benediction of an epistle when the name of "Jesus Christ" is not joined with "God our Father."Always  (παντοτε). Amphibolous position between ευχαριστουμεν (we give thanks) and προσευχομενο (praying). Can go with either.
