<p><b> Having heard of </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουσαντες</span></span>). Literary plural unless Timothy is included. Aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span> of antecedent action to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστουμεν</span></span>. Epaphras (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:8">Colossians 1:8</span>) had told Paul.</p>
<p><b>Your faith in Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την πιστιν υμων εν Ιησου Χριστω</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:15">Ephesians 1:15</span> for similar phrase. No article is needed before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> as it is a closely knit phrase and bears the same sense as the objective genitive in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:16">Galatians 2:16</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια πιστεως Χριστου Ιησου</span></span>, by faith in Christ Jesus).</p>
<p><b>Which ye have </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην εχετε</span></span>). Probably genuine (Aleph A C D), though B omits it and others have the article (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την</span></span>). There is a real distinction here between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> (sphere or basis) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> (direction towards), though they are often identical in idea. </p>
