<p><b> Because of the hope </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια την ελπιδα</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:24">Romans 8:24</span>. It is not clear whether this phrase is to be linked with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχα ιστουμεν</span></span> at the beginning of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:3">Colossians 1:3</span> or (more likely) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αγαπην</span></span> just before. Note also here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span> (faith), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπη</span></span> (love), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελπις</span></span> (hope), though not grouped together so sharply as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:13">1 Corinthians 13:13</span>. Here hope is objective, the goal ahead.</p>
<p><b>Laid up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκειμεινην</span></span>). Literally, "laid away or by." Old word used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:20">Luke 19:20</span> of the pound laid away in a napkin. See also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποθησαυριζω</span></span>, to store away for future use (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:19">1 Timothy 6:19</span>). The same idea occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:20">Matthew 6:20</span> (treasure in heaven) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:4">1 Peter 1:4</span> and it is involved in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+3:20">Philemon 3:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>Ye heard before </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προηκουσατε</span></span>). First aorist indicative active of this old compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προακουω</span></span>, though only here in the N.T. Before what? Before Paul wrote? Before the realization? Before the error of the Gnostics crept in? Each view is possible and has advocates. Lightfoot argues for the last and it is probably correct as is indicated by the next clause.</p>
<p><b>In the word of the truth of the gospel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω λογω της αληθειας του ευαγγελιου</span></span>). "In the preaching of the truth of the gospel" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:5">Galatians 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:14">Galatians 2:14</span>) which is come (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροντος</span></span>, present active participle agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιου</span></span>, being present, a classical use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρειμ</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:20">Acts 12:20</span>). They heard the pure gospel from Epaphras before the Gnostics came. </p>
