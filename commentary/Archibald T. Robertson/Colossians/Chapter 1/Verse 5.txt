 Because of the hope  (δια την ελπιδα). See Romans 8:24. It is not clear whether this phrase is to be linked with ευχα ιστουμεν at the beginning of verse Colossians 1:3 or (more likely) with την αγαπην just before. Note also here πιστις (faith), αγαπη (love), ελπις (hope), though not grouped together so sharply as in 1 Corinthians 13:13. Here hope is objective, the goal ahead.Laid up  (αποκειμεινην). Literally, "laid away or by." Old word used in Luke 19:20 of the pound laid away in a napkin. See also αποθησαυριζω, to store away for future use (1 Timothy 6:19). The same idea occurs in Matthew 6:20 (treasure in heaven) and 1 Peter 1:4 and it is involved in Philemon 3:20.Ye heard before  (προηκουσατε). First aorist indicative active of this old compound προακουω, though only here in the N.T. Before what? Before Paul wrote? Before the realization? Before the error of the Gnostics crept in? Each view is possible and has advocates. Lightfoot argues for the last and it is probably correct as is indicated by the next clause.In the word of the truth of the gospel  (εν τω λογω της αληθειας του ευαγγελιου). "In the preaching of the truth of the gospel" (Galatians 2:5; Galatians 2:14) which is come (παροντος, present active participle agreeing with ευαγγελιου, being present, a classical use of παρειμ as in Acts 12:20). They heard the pure gospel from Epaphras before the Gnostics came.
