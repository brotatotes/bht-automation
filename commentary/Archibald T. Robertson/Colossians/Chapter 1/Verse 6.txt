<p><b> In all the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν παντ τω κοσμω</span></span>). A legitimate hyperbole, for the gospel was spreading all over the Roman Empire.</p>
<p><b>Is bearing fruit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν καρποφορουμενον</span></span>). Periphrastic present middle indicative of the old compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρποφορεω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρποφορος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:17">Acts 14:17</span>) and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρπος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερω</span></span>. The periphrastic present emphasizes the continuity of the process. See the active participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρποφορουντες</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:10">Colossians 1:10</span>.</p>
<p><b>Increasing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυξανομενον</span></span>). Periphrastic present middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυξανω</span></span>. Repeated in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:10">Colossians 1:10</span>. The growing and the fruit-bearing go on simultaneously as always with Christians (inward growth and outward expression).</p>
<p><b>Ye heard and knew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσατε κα επεγνωτε</span></span>). Definite aorist indicative. They heard the gospel from Epaphras and at once recognized and accepted (ingressive second aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγινωσκω</span></span>, to know fully or in addition). They fully apprehended the grace of God and should be immune to the shallow vagaries of the Gnostics. </p>
