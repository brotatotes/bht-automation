 In all the world  (εν παντ τω κοσμω). A legitimate hyperbole, for the gospel was spreading all over the Roman Empire.Is bearing fruit  (εστιν καρποφορουμενον). Periphrastic present middle indicative of the old compound καρποφορεω, from καρποφορος (Acts 14:17) and that from καρπος and φερω. The periphrastic present emphasizes the continuity of the process. See the active participle καρποφορουντες in verse Colossians 1:10.Increasing  (αυξανομενον). Periphrastic present middle of αυξανω. Repeated in verse Colossians 1:10. The growing and the fruit-bearing go on simultaneously as always with Christians (inward growth and outward expression).Ye heard and knew  (ηκουσατε κα επεγνωτε). Definite aorist indicative. They heard the gospel from Epaphras and at once recognized and accepted (ingressive second aorist active of επιγινωσκω, to know fully or in addition). They fully apprehended the grace of God and should be immune to the shallow vagaries of the Gnostics.
