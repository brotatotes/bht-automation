<p><b> Of Epaphras </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο Επαφρα</span></span>). "From Epaphras" who is the source of their knowledge of Christ.</p>
<p><b>On our behalf </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ ημων</span></span>). Clearly correct (Aleph A B D) and not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ υμων</span></span> (on your behalf). In a true sense Epaphras was Paul's messenger to Colossae. </p>
