<p><b> That ye may be filled with </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα πληρωθητε</span></span>). First aorist (effective) passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span>, to fill full.</p>
<p><b>The knowledge of his will </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την επιγνωσιν του θεληματος αυτου</span></span>). The accusative case is retained with this passive verb. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Επιγνωσις</span></span> is a <i>Koine</i> word (Polybius, Plutarch, etc.) for additional (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>) or full knowledge. The word is the keynote of Paul's reply to the conceit of Gnosticism. The cure for these intellectual upstarts is not ignorance, not obscurantism, but more knowledge of the will of God.</p>
<p><b>In all spiritual wisdom and understanding </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν παση σοφια κα συνεσε πνευματικη</span></span>). Both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασε</span></span> (all) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικη</span></span> (spiritual) are to be taken with both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφια</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεσε</span></span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:8">Ephesians 1:8</span> Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρονησε</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρην</span></span>, intellect) rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεσε</span></span> (grasp, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιημ</span></span>, to send together). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συνεσις</span></span> is the faculty of deciding in particular cases while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφια</span></span> gives the general principles (Abbott). Paul faces Gnosticism with full front and wishes the freest use of all one's intellectual powers in interpreting Christianity. The preacher ought to be the greatest man in the world for he has to deal with the greatest problems of life and death. </p>
