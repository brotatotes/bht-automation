<p><b> How greatly I strive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλικον αγωνα εχω</span></span>). Literally, "how great a contest I am having." The old adjectival relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλικος</span></span> (like Latin <i>quantus</i>) is used for age or size in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:5">James 3:5</span> (twice, how great, how small). It is an inward contest of anxiety like the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεριμνα</span></span> for all the churches (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:28">2 Corinthians 11:28</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αγωνα</span></span> carries on the metaphor of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγωνιζομενος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:29">Colossians 1:29</span>.</p>
<p><b>For them at Laodicea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των εν Λαοδικια</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Supply </b> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> as with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ υμων</span></span>. Paul's concern extended beyond Colossae to Laodicea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:16">Colossians 4:16</span>) and to Hierapolis (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:13">Colossians 4:13</span>), the three great cities in the Lycus Valley where Gnosticism was beginning to do harm. Laodicea is the church described as lukewarm in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>For as many as have not seen my face </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσο ουχ εορακαν το προσωπον μου</span></span>). The phrase undoubtedly includes Hierapolis (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:13">Colossians 4:13</span>), and a few late MSS. actually insert it here. Lightfoot suggests that Hierapolis had not yet been harmed by the Gnostics as much as Colossae and Laodicea. Perhaps so, but the language includes all in that whole region who have not seen Paul's face in the flesh (that is, in person, and not in picture). How precious a real picture of Paul would be to us today. The antecedent to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσο</span></span> is not expressed and it would be <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span>. The form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εορακαν</span></span> (perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span> instead of the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εωρακασιν</span></span> has two peculiarities <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> in Paul's Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span>) instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω</span></span> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εωρακεν</span></span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-αν</span></span> by analogy in place of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ασιν</span></span>, which short form is common in the papyri. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:36">Luke 9:36</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εωρακαν</span></span>. </p>
