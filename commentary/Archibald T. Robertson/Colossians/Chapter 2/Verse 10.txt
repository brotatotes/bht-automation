<p><b> Ye are made full </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστε πεπληρωμενο</span></span>). Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span>, but only one predicate, not two. Christ is our fulness of which we all partake (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span>) and our goal is to be made full of God in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span>). "In Christ they find the satisfaction of every spiritual want" (Peake).</p>
<p><b>The head </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η καφαλη</span></span>). There is no other place for Christ. He is first (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>) in time and in rank. All rule and authority comes after Christ whether angels, aeons, kings, what not. </p>
