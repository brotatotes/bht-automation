<p><b> Ye were also circumcised </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα περιετμηθητε</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιτεμνω</span></span>, to circumcise. But used here as a metaphor in a spiritual sense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span> "the circumcision of the heart."</p>
<p><b>Not made with hands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχειροποιητω</span></span>). This late and rare negative compound verbal occurs only in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:58">Mark 14:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:11">Colossians 2:11</span>) by merely adding <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative to the old verbal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειροποιητος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:48">Acts 7:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:11">Ephesians 2:11</span>), possibly first in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:58">Mark 14:58</span> where both words occur concerning the temple. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span> the reference is to the resurrection body. The feminine form of this compound adjective is the same as the masculine.</p>
<p><b>In the putting off </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη απεκδυσε</span></span>). As if an old garment (the fleshly body). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκδυομα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>, possibly also coined by Paul) and occurring nowhere else so far as known. The word is made in a perfectly normal way by the perfective use of the two Greek prepositions (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο, εκ</span></span>), "a resource available for and generally used by any real thinker writing Greek" (Moulton and Milligan, <i>Vocabulary</i>). Paul had as much right to mint a Greek compound as any one and surely no one ever had more ideas to express and more power in doing it.</p>
<p><b>Of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του Χριστου</span></span>). Specifying genitive, the kind of circumcision that belongs to Christ, that of the heart. </p>
