<p><b> Having been buried with him in baptism </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνταφεντες αυτω εν τω βαπτισματ</span></span>). Second aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνθαπτω</span></span>, old word, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>, followed by associative instrumental case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span>). Thayer's Lexicon says: "For all who in the rite of baptism are plunged under the water, thereby declare that they put faith in the expiatory death of Christ for the pardon of their past sins." Yes, and for all future sins also. This word gives Paul's vivid picture of baptism as a symbolic burial with Christ and resurrection also to newness of life in him as Paul shows by the addition "wherein ye were also raised with him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ω κα συνηγερθητε</span></span>). "In which baptism" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισματ</span></span>, he means). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεγειρω</span></span>, late and rare verb (Plutarch for waking up together), in LXX, in N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:1">Colossians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:6">Ephesians 2:6</span>. In the symbol of baptism the resurrection to new life in Christ is pictured with an allusion to Christ's own resurrection and to our final resurrection. Paul does not mean to say that the new life in Christ is caused or created by the act of baptism. That is grossly to misunderstand him. The Gnostics and the Judaizers were sacramentalists, but not so Paul the champion of spiritual Christianity. He has just given the spiritual interpretation to circumcision which itself followed Abraham's faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:10-12">Romans 4:10-12</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:27">Galatians 3:27</span>. Baptism gives a picture of the change already wrought in the heart "through faith" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια της πιστεως</span></span>).</p>

See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:29">Colossians 1:29</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργεια</span></span>. God had power to raise Christ from the dead (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του εγειραντος</span></span>, first aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγειρω</span></span>, the fact here stated) and he has power (energy) to give us new life in Christ by faith. </p>
