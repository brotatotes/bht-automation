 And you  (κα υμας). Emphatic position, object of the verb συνεζωοποιησεν (did he quicken) and repeated (second υμας). You Gentiles as he explains.Being dead through your trespasses  (νεκρους οντας τοις παραπτωμασιν). Moral death, of course, as in Romans 6:11; Ephesians 2:1; Ephesians 2:5. Correct text does not have εν, but even so παραπτωμασιν (from παραπιπτω, to fall beside or to lapse, Hebrews 6:6), a lapse or misstep as in Matthew 6:14; Romans 5:15-18; Galatians 6:1, can be still in the locative, though the instrumental makes good sense also.And the uncircumcision of your flesh  (κα τη ακροβουστια της σαρκος υμων). "Dead in your trespasses and your alienation from God, of which the uncircumcision of your flesh was a symbol" (Abbott). Clearly so, "the uncircumcision" used merely in a metaphorical sense.Did he quicken together with him  (συνεζωοποιησεν συν αυτω). First aorist active indicative of the double compound verb συνζωοποιεω, to make alive (ζωοσ, ποιεω) with (συν, repeated also with αυτω, associative instrumental), found only here and in Ephesians 2:5, apparently coined by Paul for this passage. Probably θεος (God) is the subject because expressly so stated in Ephesians 2:4 and because demanded by συν αυτω here referring to Christ. This can be true even if Christ be the subject of ηρκεν in verse Colossians 2:14.Having forgiven us  (χαρισαμενος ημιν). First aorist middle participle of χαριζομα, common verb from χαρις (favour, grace). Dative of the person common as in Colossians 3:13. The act of forgiving is simultaneous with the quickening, though logically antecedent.
