<p><b> And you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υμας</span></span>). Emphatic position, object of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεζωοποιησεν</span></span> (did he quicken) and repeated (second <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμας</span></span>). You Gentiles as he explains.</p>
<p><b>Being dead through your trespasses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεκρους οντας τοις παραπτωμασιν</span></span>). Moral death, of course, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:11">Romans 6:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span>. Correct text does not have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>, but even so <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραπτωμασιν</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραπιπτω</span></span>, to fall beside or to lapse, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:6">Hebrews 6:6</span>), a lapse or misstep as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:14">Matthew 6:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15-18">Romans 5:15-18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:1">Galatians 6:1</span>, can be still in the locative, though the instrumental makes good sense also.</p>
<p><b>And the uncircumcision of your flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τη ακροβουστια της σαρκος υμων</span></span>). "Dead in your trespasses and your alienation from God, of which the uncircumcision of your flesh was a symbol" (Abbott). Clearly so, "the uncircumcision" used merely in a metaphorical sense.</p>
<p><b>Did he quicken together with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεζωοποιησεν συν αυτω</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of the double compound verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνζωοποιεω</span></span>, to make alive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωοσ, ποιεω</span></span>) with (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span>, repeated also with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span>, associative instrumental), found only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span>, apparently coined by Paul for this passage. Probably <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span> (God) is the subject because expressly so stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:4">Ephesians 2:4</span> and because demanded by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν αυτω</span></span> here referring to Christ. This can be true even if Christ be the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρκεν</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:14">Colossians 2:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Having forgiven us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρισαμενος ημιν</span></span>). First aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριζομα</span></span>, common verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις</span></span> (favour, grace). Dative of the person common as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:13">Colossians 3:13</span>. The act of forgiving is simultaneous with the quickening, though logically antecedent. </p>
