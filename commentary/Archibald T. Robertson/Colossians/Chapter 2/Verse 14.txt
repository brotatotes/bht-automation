<p><b> Having blotted out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαλειψας</span></span>). And so "cancelled." First aorist active participle of old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαλειφω</span></span>, to rub out, wipe off, erase. In N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:19">Acts 3:19</span> (LXX); <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:14">Colossians 2:14</span>. Here the word explains <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρισαμενος</span></span> and is simultaneous with it. Plato used it of blotting out a writing. Often MSS. were rubbed or scraped and written over again (palimpsests, like Codex C).</p>
<p><b>The bond written in ordinances that was against us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το καθ' ημων χειρογραφον τοις δογμασιν</span></span>). The late compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρογραφον</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρ</span></span>, hand, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span>) is very common in the papyri for a certificate of debt or bond, many of the original <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρογραφα</span></span> (handwriting, "chirography"). See Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 247. The signature made a legal debt or bond as Paul says in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:18">Philemon 1:18</span>: "I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it." Many of the papyri examples have been "crossed out" thus X as we do today and so cancelled. One decree is described as "neither washed out nor written over" (Milligan, N. T. <i>Documents</i>, p. 16). Undoubtedly "the handwriting in decrees" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δογμασιν</span></span>, the Mosaic law, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span>) was against the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:3">Exodus 24:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+27:14-26">Deuteronomy 27:14-26</span>) for they accepted it, but the Gentiles also gave moral assent to God's law written in their hearts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14">Romans 2:14</span>). So Paul says "against us" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθ' ημων</span></span>) and adds "which was contrary to us" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ην υπεναντιον ημιν</span></span>) because we (neither Jew nor Gentile) could not keep it. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυπεναντιος</span></span> is an old double compound adjective (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο, εν, αντιος</span></span>) set over against, only here in N.T. except <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:27">Hebrews 10:27</span> when it is used as a substantive. It is striking that Paul has connected the common word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρογραφον</span></span> for bond or debt with the Cross of Christ (Deissmann, <i>Light, etc.</i>, p. 332).</p>
<p><b>And he hath taken it out of the way </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ηρκεν εκ του μεσου</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρω</span></span>, old and common verb, to lift up, to bear, to take away. The word used by the Baptist of Jesus as "the Lamb of God that bears away (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρων</span></span>) the sin of the world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>). The perfect tense emphasizes the permanence of the removal of the bond which has been paid and cancelled and cannot be presented again. Lightfoot argues for Christ as the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρκεν</span></span>, but that is not necessary, though Paul does use sudden anacolutha. God has taken the bond against us "out of the midst" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του μεσου</span></span>). Nailing it to the cross (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσηλωσας αυτο τω σταυρω</span></span>). First aorist active participle of old and common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσηλοω</span></span>, to fasten with nails to a thing (with dative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταυρω</span></span>). Here alone in N.T., but in III Macc. 4:9 with the very word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταυρω</span></span>. The victim was nailed to the cross as was Christ. "When Christ was crucified, God nailed the Law to His cross" (Peake). Hence the "bond" is cancelled for us. Business men today sometimes file cancelled accounts. No evidence exists that Paul alluded to such a custom here. </p>
