<p><b> Having put off from himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκδυσαμενος</span></span>). Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:9">Colossians 3:9</span> and one MS. of Josephus (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκδυς</span></span>). Both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδυω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκδυω</span></span> occur in ancient writers. Paul simply combines the two for expression of complete removal. But two serious problems arise here. Is God or Christ referred to by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκδυσαμενος</span></span>? What is meant by "the principalities and the powers" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας αρχας κα τας εξουσιας</span></span>)? Modern scholars differ radically and no full discussion can be attempted here as one finds in Lightfoot, Haupt, Abbott, Peake. On the whole I am inclined to look on God as still the subject and the powers to be angels such as the Gnostics worshipped and the verb to mean "despoil" (American Standard Version) rather than "having put off from himself." In the Cross of Christ God showed his power openly without aid or help of angels.</p>
<p><b>He made a show of them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδειγματισεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειγματιζω</span></span>, late and rare verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειγμα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:7">Jude 1:7</span>), an example, and so to make an example of. Frequent in the papyri though later than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδειγματιζω</span></span> and in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:19">Matthew 1:19</span> of Joseph's conduct toward Mary. No idea of disgrace is necessarily involved in the word. The publicity is made plain by "openly" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν παρρησια</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Triumphing over them on it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θριαμβευσας αυτους εν αυτω</span></span>). On the Cross the triumph was won. This late, though common verb in <i>Koine</i> writers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκθριαμβευω</span></span> in the papyri) occurs only twice in the N.T., once "to lead in triumph" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:14">2 Corinthians 2:14</span>), here to celebrate a triumph (the usual sense). It is derived from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θριαμβος</span></span>, a hymn sung in festal procession and is kin to the Latin <i>triumphus</i> (our triumph), a triumphal procession of victorious Roman generals. God won a complete triumph over all the angelic agencies (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτους</span></span>, masculine regarded as personal agencies). Lightfoot adds, applying <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θριαμβευσας</span></span> to Christ: "The convict's gibbet is the victor's car." It is possible, of course, to take <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span> as referring to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρογραφον</span></span> (bond) or even to Christ. </p>
