<p><b> Rob you of your prize </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβραβευετω</span></span>). Late and rare compound (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα, βραβευω</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:15">Colossians 3:15</span>) to act as umpire against one, perhaps because of bribery in Demosthenes and Eustathius (two other examples in Preisigke's <i>Worterbuch</i>), here only in the N.T. So here it means to decide or give judgment against. The judge at the games is called <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βραβευς</span></span> and the prize <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βραβειον</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24">1 Corinthians 9:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:14">Philippians 3:14</span>). It is thus parallel to, but stronger than, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινετω</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:16">Colossians 2:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>By a voluntary humility </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελων εν ταπεινοφροσυνη</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω</span></span>, to wish, to will, but a difficult idiom. Some take it as like an adverb for "wilfully" somewhat like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελοντας</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:5">2 Peter 3:5</span>. Others make it a Hebraism from the LXX usage, "finding pleasure in humility." The Revised Version margin has "of his own mere will, by humility." Hort suggested <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εθελοταπεινοφροσυνη</span></span> (in gratuitous humility), a word that occurs in Basil and made like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθελοθρησκια</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:23">Colossians 2:23</span>.</p>
<p><b>And worshipping of the angels </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα θρησκεια των αγγελων</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12">Colossians 3:12</span> humility (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταπεινοφροσυνην</span></span>) is a virtue, but it is linked with worship of the angels which is idolatry and so is probably false humility as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:23">Colossians 2:23</span>. They may have argued for angel worship on the plea that God is high and far removed and so took angels as mediators as some men do today with angels and saints in place of Christ.</p>
<p><b>Dwelling in the things which he hath seen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α εορακεν εμβατευων</span></span>). Some MSS. have "not," but not genuine. This verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμβατευω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμβατης</span></span>, stepping in, going in) has given much trouble. Lightfoot has actually proposed <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κενεμβατευων</span></span> (a verb that does not exist, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κενεμβατεω</span></span> does occur) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιωρα</span></span>, to tread on empty air, an ingenious suggestion, but now unnecessary. It is an old word for going in to take possession (papyri examples also). W. M. Ramsay (<i>Teaching of Paul</i>, pp. 287ff.) shows from inscriptions in Klaros that the word is used of an initiate in the mysteries who "set foot in" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεβατευσεν</span></span>) and performed the rest of the rites. Paul is here quoting the very work used of these initiates who "take their stand on" these imagined revelations in the mysteries.</p>
<p><b>Vainly puffed up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εικη φυσιουμενος</span></span>). Present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσιοω</span></span>, late and vivid verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσα</span></span>, pair of bellows, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:6">1 Corinthians 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:18">1 Corinthians 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>. Powerful picture of the self-conceit of these bombastic Gnostics. </p>
