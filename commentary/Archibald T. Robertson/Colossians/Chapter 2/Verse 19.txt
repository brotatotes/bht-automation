<p><b> Not holding fast the Head </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου κρατων την κεφαλην</span></span>). Note negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>, actual case of deserting Christ as the Head. The Gnostics dethroned Christ from his primacy (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>) and placed him below a long line of aeons or angels. They did it with words of praise for Christ as those do now who teach Christ as only the noblest of men. The headship of Christ is the keynote of this Epistle to the Colossians and the heart of Paul's Christology.</p>
<p><b>From whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ ου</span></span>). Masculine ablative rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ ης</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφαλης</span></span>) because Christ is the Head. He develops the figure of the body of which Christ is Head (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>).</p>
<p><b>Being supplied </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιχορηγουμενον</span></span>). Present passive participle (continuous action) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιχορηγεω</span></span>, for which interesting verb see already <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:10">2 Corinthians 9:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:5">Galatians 3:5</span> and further <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5">2 Peter 1:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>Knit together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνβιβαζομενον</span></span>). Present passive participle also (continuous action) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνβιβαζω</span></span>, for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>Through the joints </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια των αφων</span></span>). Late word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφη</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απτω</span></span>, to fasten together), connections (<i>junctura</i> and <i>nexus</i> in the Vulgate).</p>
<p><b>And bonds </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα συνδεσμων</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνδεω</span></span>, to bind together. Aristotle and Galen use it of the human body. Both words picture well the wonderful unity in the body by cells, muscles, arteries, veins, nerves, skin, glands, etc. It is a marvellous machine working together under the direction of the head.</p>
<p><b>Increaseth with the increase of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυξε την αυξησιν του θεου</span></span>). Cognate accusative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυξησιν</span></span>) with the old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυξε</span></span>. </p>
