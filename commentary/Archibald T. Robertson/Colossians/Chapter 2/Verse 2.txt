 May be comforted  (παρακληθωσιν). First aorist passive subjunctive of παρακαλεω (for which see 2 Corinthians 1:3-7) in final clause with ινα.Being knit together  (συνβιβασθεντες). First aorist passive participle of συνβιβαζω, old verb, causal of βαινω, to make go together, to coalesce in argument (Acts 16:10), in spiritual growth (Colossians 2:19), in love as here. Love is the συνδεσμος (Colossians 3:14) that binds all together.Unto all riches  (εις παν πλουτος). Probably some distinction intended between εν (in love as the sphere) and εις (unto as the goal).Of the full assurance of understanding  (της πληροφοριας της συνεσεως). On πληροφορια, see 1 Thessalonians 1:5. From πληροφορεω (see Luke 1:1) and only in N.T. (1 Thessalonians 1:5; Colossians 2:2; Hebrews 6:11; Hebrews 10:22), Clement of Rome (Cor. 42) and one papyrus example. Paul desires the full use of the intellect in grasping the great mystery of Christ and it calls for the full and balanced exercise of all one's mental powers.That they may know  (εις επιγνωσιν). "Unto full knowledge." This use of επιγνωσις (full, additional knowledge) is Paul's reply to the Gnostics with the limited and perverted γνωσις (knowledge).The mystery of God, even Christ  (του μυστηριου του θεου, Χριστου). The MSS. differ widely here, but this is Westcott and Hort's reading. Genitive (objective) with επιγνωσιν and Χριστου in apposition. Christ is "the mystery of God," but no longer hidden, but manifested (Colossians 1:26) and meant for us to know to the fulness of our capacity.
