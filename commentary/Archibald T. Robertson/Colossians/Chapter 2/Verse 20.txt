<p><b> If ye died </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε απεθανετε</span></span>). Condition of the first class, assumed as true, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποθνησκω</span></span>, to die. He is alluding to the picture of burial in baptism (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>From the rudiments of the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο των στοιχειων του κοσμου</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:8">Colossians 2:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>As though living in the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ζωντες εν κοσμω</span></span>). Concessive use of the participle with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span>. The picture is that of baptism, having come out (F. B. Meyer) on the other side of the grave, we are not to act as though we had not done so. We are in the Land of Beulah.</p>
<p><b>Why do ye subject yourselves to ordinances? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ δογματιζεσθε?</span></span>). Late and rare verb (three examples in inscriptions and often in LXX) made from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δογμα</span></span>, decree or ordinance. Here it makes good sense either as middle or passive. In either case they are to blame since the bond of decrees (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:14">Colossians 2:14</span>) was removed on the Cross of Christ. Paul still has in mind the rules of the ascetic wing of the Gnostics (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:16">Colossians 2:16</span>). </p>
