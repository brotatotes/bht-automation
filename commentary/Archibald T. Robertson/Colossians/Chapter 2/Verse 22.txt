<p><b> Are to perish with the using </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν εις φθοραν τη αποχρησε</span></span>). Literally, "are for perishing in the using." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φθορα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθειρω</span></span>) is old word for decay, decomposition. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αποχρησις</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποχραομα</span></span>, to use to the full, to use up), late and rare word (in Plutarch), here only in N.T. Either locative case here or instrumental. These material things all perish in the use of them. </p>
