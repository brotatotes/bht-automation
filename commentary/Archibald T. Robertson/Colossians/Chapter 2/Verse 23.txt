<p><b> Which things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατινα</span></span>). "Which very things," these ascetic regulations.</p>
<p><b>Have indeed a show of wisdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν λογον μεν εχοντα σοφιας</span></span>). Periphrastic present indicative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> in the singular, but present indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχοντα</span></span> in the plural (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατινα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογον σοφιας</span></span> is probably "the repute of wisdom" (Abbott) like Plato and Herodotus. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μεν</span></span> (in deed) has no corresponding <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>In will-worship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εθελοθρησκια</span></span>). This word occurs nowhere else and was probably coined by Paul after the pattern of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθελοδουλεια</span></span>, to describe the voluntary worship of angels (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>And humility </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ταπεινοφροσυνη</span></span>). Clearly here the bad sense, "in mock humility."</p>
<p><b>And severity to the body </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αφειδια σωματος</span></span>). Old word (Plato) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφειδης</span></span>, unsparing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φειδομα</span></span>, to spare). Here alone in N.T. Ascetics often practice flagellations and other hardnesses to the body.</p>
<p><b>Not of any value </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εν τιμη τιν</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τιμη</span></span> usually means honour or price.</p>
<p><b>Against the indulgence of the flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς πλησμονην της σαρκος</span></span>). These words are sharply debated along with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμη</span></span> just before. It is not unusual for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> to be found in the sense of "against" rather than "with" or "for." See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> in sense of</p>
<p><b>against </b> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:13">Colossians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11">Ephesians 6:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:12">2 Corinthians 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:1">1 Corinthians 6:1</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πλησμονη</span></span> is an old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιμπλημ</span></span>, to fill and means satiety. It occurs here only in the N.T. Peake is inclined to agree with Hort and Haupt that there is a primitive corruption here. But the translation in the Revised Version is possible and it is true that mere rules do not carry us very far in human conduct as every father or mother knows, though we must have some regulations in family and state and church. But they are not enough of themselves. </p>
