<p><b> In whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ω</span></span>). This locative form can refer to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυστηριου</span></span> or to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστου</span></span>. It really makes no difference in sense since Christ is the mystery of God.</p>
<p><b>All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντες ο θησαυρο της σοφιας κα γνωσεως</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:11">Matthew 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19-21">Matthew 6:19-21</span> for this old word, our thesaurus, for coffer, storehouse, treasure. Paul confronts these pretentious intellectuals (Gnostics) with the bold claim that Christ sums up all wisdom and knowledge. These treasures are hidden (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκρυφο</span></span>, old adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκρυπτω</span></span>, to hide away, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:22">Mark 4:22</span>) whether the Gnostics have discovered them or not. They are there (in Christ) as every believer knows by fresh and repeated discovery. </p>
