<p><b> This I say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο λεγω</span></span>). Paul explains why he has made this great claim for Christ at this point in his discussion.</p>
<p><b>May delude </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλογιζητα</span></span>). Present middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλογιζομα</span></span>, old verb, only here in N.T., from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογιζομα</span></span>, to count aside and so wrong, to cheat by false reckoning, to deceive by false reasoning (Epictetus).</p>
<p><b>With persuasiveness of speech </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πιθανολογια</span></span>). Rare word (Plato) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιθανος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span>, speech, adapted to persuade, then speciously leading astray. Only here in N.T. One papyrus example. The art of persuasion is the height of oratory, but it easily degenerates into trickery and momentary and flashy deceit such as Paul disclaimed in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:4">1 Corinthians 2:4</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εν πιθοις σοφιας λογοις</span></span>) where he uses the very adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιθος</span></span> (persuasive) of which <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιθανος</span></span> (both from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθω</span></span>) is another form. It is curious how winning champions of error, like the Gnostics and modern faddists, can be with plausibility that catches the gullible. </p>
