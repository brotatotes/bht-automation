<p><b> Though </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε κα</span></span>). Not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ε</span></span> (even if).</p>
<p><b>Yet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span>). Common use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span> in the apodosis (conclusion) of a conditional or concessive sentence.</p>
<p><b>Your order </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ταξιν</span></span>). The military line (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τασσω</span></span>), unbroken, intact. A few stragglers had gone over to the Gnostics, but there had been no panic, no breach in the line.</p>
<p><b>Steadfastness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στερεωμα</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στερεοω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στερεος</span></span>) to make steady, and probably the same military metaphor as in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταξιν</span></span> just before. The solid part of the line which can and does stand the attack of the Gnostics. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:5">Acts 16:5</span> where the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στερεοω</span></span> is used with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:9">1 Peter 5:9</span> where the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στερεος</span></span> is so used.
