 As therefore ye received  (ως ουν παρελαβετε). Second aorist active indicative of παραλαμβανω in same sense as in 1 Thessalonians 4:1; Philippians 4:9 (both μανθανω and παραλαμβανω) that is like μανθανω, to learn (Colossians 1:7), from Epaphras and others.Christ Jesus the Lord  (τον Χριστον Ιησουν τον Κυριον). This peculiar phrase occurs nowhere else by Paul. We have often ο Χριστος (the Christ or Messiah) as in Philippians 1:15, Ιησους Χριστος (Jesus Christ), Χριστος Ιησους (Christ Jesus), ο Κυριος Ιησους (the Lord Jesus, very often), but nowhere else ο Χριστος Ιησους and Ιησους ο Κυριος. Hence it is plain that Paul here meets the two forms of Gnostic heresy about the Person of Christ (the recognition of the historical Jesus in his actual humanity against the Docetic Gnostics, the identity of the Christ or Messiah with this historical Jesus against the Cerinthian Gnostics, and the acknowledgment of him as Lord). "As therefore ye received the Christ (the Messiah), Jesus the Lord." Ye were taught right.Walk in him  (εν αυτω περιπατειτε). "Go on walking in him" (present active indicative of περιπατεω). Stick to your first lessons in Christ.
