<p><b> As therefore ye received </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ουν παρελαβετε</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαμβανω</span></span> in same sense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:1">1 Thessalonians 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:9">Philippians 4:9</span> (both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μανθανω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαμβανω</span></span>) that is like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μανθανω</span></span>, to learn (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:7">Colossians 1:7</span>), from Epaphras and others.</p>
<p><b>Christ Jesus the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον Χριστον Ιησουν τον Κυριον</span></span>). This peculiar phrase occurs nowhere else by Paul. We have often <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Χριστος</span></span> (the Christ or Messiah) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:15">Philippians 1:15</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησους Χριστος</span></span> (Jesus Christ), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος Ιησους</span></span> (Christ Jesus), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Κυριος Ιησους</span></span> (the Lord Jesus, very often), but nowhere else <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Χριστος Ιησους</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησους ο Κυριος</span></span>. Hence it is plain that Paul here meets the two forms of Gnostic heresy about the Person of Christ (the recognition of the historical Jesus in his actual humanity against the Docetic Gnostics, the identity of the Christ or Messiah with this historical Jesus against the Cerinthian Gnostics, and the acknowledgment of him as Lord). "As therefore ye received the Christ (the Messiah), Jesus the Lord." Ye were taught right.</p>
<p><b>Walk in him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτω περιπατειτε</span></span>). "Go on walking in him" (present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιπατεω</span></span>). Stick to your first lessons in Christ. </p>
