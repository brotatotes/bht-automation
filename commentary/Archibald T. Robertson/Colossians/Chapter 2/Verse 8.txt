<p><b> Take heed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπετε</span></span>). Present active imperative second person plural of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπω</span></span>, common verb for warning like our "look out," "beware," "see to it."</p>
<p><b>Lest there shall be any one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη τις εστα</span></span>). Negative purpose with the future indicative, though the aorist subjunctive also occurs as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:6">2 Corinthians 12:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>That maketh spoil of you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο συλαγωγων</span></span>). Articular present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συλαγωγεω</span></span>, late and rare (found here first) verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συλη</span></span>, booty, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγω</span></span>, to lead, to carry), to carry off as booty a captive, slave, maiden.

<p><b>Through his philosophy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια της φιλοσοφιας</span></span>). The only use of the word in the N.T. and employed by Paul because the Gnostics were fond of it. Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλοσοφος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλοσ, σοφος</span></span>, one devoted to the pursuit of wisdom) and in N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span>. Paul does not condemn knowledge and wisdom (see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>), but only this false philosophy, "knowledge falsely named" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψευδωνυμος γνωσις</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:20">1 Timothy 6:20</span>), and explained here by the next words.</p>

<p><b>Tradition </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδοσιν</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδωμ</span></span>, a giving over, a passing on. The word is colourless in itself. The tradition may be good (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:15">2 Thessalonians 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:6">2 Thessalonians 3:6</span>) or bad (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:3">Mark 7:3</span>). Here it is worthless and harmful, merely the foolish theories of the Gnostics.</p>
<p><b>Rudiments </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοιχεια</span></span>). Old word for anything in a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοιχος</span></span> (row, series) like the letters of the alphabet, the materials of the universe (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:10">2 Peter 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:12">2 Peter 3:12</span>), elementary teaching (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span>), elements of Jewish ceremonial training (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:10">Acts 15:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:3">Galatians 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:9">Galatians 4:9</span>), the specious arguments of the Gnostic philosophers as here with all their aeons and rules of life.</p>
<p><b>And not after Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ου κατα Χριστον</span></span>). Christ is the yardstick by which to measure philosophy and all phases of human knowledge. The Gnostics were measuring Christ by their philosophy as many men are doing today. They have it backwards. Christ is the measure for all human knowledge since he is the Creator and the Sustainer of the universe. </p>
