<p><b> For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ εν αυτω κατοικε παν το πληρωμα της θεοτητος σωματικως</span></span>). In this sentence, given as the reason (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>, because) for the preceding claim for Christ as the measure of human knowledge Paul states the heart of his message about the Person of Christ. There dwells (at home) in Christ not one or more aspects of the Godhead (the very <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσσενχε</span></span> of God, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεοσ, δειτας</span></span>) and not to be confused with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θειοτες</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θειος</span></span>, the</p>
<p><b>quality </b> of God, <i>divinitas</i>), here only in N.T. as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θειοτης</span></span> only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>. The distinction is observed in Lucian and Plutarch. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θειοτης</span></span> occurs in the papyri and inscriptions. Paul here asserts that "all the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρωμα</span></span> of the Godhead," not just certain aspects, dwells in Christ and in bodily form (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωματικως</span></span>, late and rare adverb, in Plutarch, inscription, here only in N.T.), dwells now in Christ in his glorified humanity (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9-11">Philippians 2:9-11</span>), "the body of his glory" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω σωματ της δοξης</span></span>). The fulness of the God-head was in Christ before the Incarnation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span>), during the Incarnation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1-3">1 John 1:1-3</span>). It was the Son of God who came in the likeness of men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>). Paul here disposes of the Docetic theory that Jesus had no human body as well as the Cerinthian separation between the man Jesus and the aeon Christ. He asserts plainly the deity and the humanity of Jesus Christ in corporeal form. </p>
