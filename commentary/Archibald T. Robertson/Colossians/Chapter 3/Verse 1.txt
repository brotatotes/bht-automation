<p><b> If then ye were raised together with Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε ουν συνηγερθητε τω Χριστω</span></span>). Condition of the first class, assumed as true, like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:20">Colossians 2:20</span> and the other half of the picture of baptism in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span> and using the same form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνηγερθητε</span></span> as then which see for the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεγειρω</span></span>. Associative instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>The things that are above </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα ανω</span></span>). "The upward things" (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:14">Philippians 3:14</span>), the treasure in heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:20">Matthew 6:20</span>). Paul gives this ideal and goal in place of merely ascetic rules.</p>
<p><b>Seated on the right hand of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν δεξια του θεου καθημενος</span></span>). Not periphrastic verb, but additional statement. Christ is up there and at God's right hand. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:3">Colossians 2:3</span>. </p>
