<p><b> Where </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου</span></span>). In this "new man" in Christ. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:28">Galatians 3:28</span>.</p>
<p><b>There cannot be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εν</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εν</span></span> is the long (original) form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> is to be understood. "There does not exist." This is the ideal which is still a long way ahead of modern Christians as the Great War proved. Race distinctions (Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hελλην</span></span> and Jew <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιουδαιος</span></span>) disappear in Christ and in the new man in Christ. The Jews looked on all others as Greeks (Gentiles). Circumcision (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιτομη</span></span>) and uncircumcision (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακροβυστια</span></span>) put the Jewish picture with the cleavage made plainer (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:2">Colossians 3:2</span>). The Greeks and Romans regarded all others as barbarians (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρβαρο</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:14">Romans 1:14</span>), users of outlandish jargon or gibberish, onomatopoetic repetition (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρ-βαρ</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>A Scythian </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σκυθης</span></span>) was simply the climax of barbarity, <i>bar-baris barbariores</i> (Bengel), used for any rough person like our "Goths and Vandals."</p>
<p><b>Bondman </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεω</span></span>, to bind),</p>
<p><b>freeman </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελευθερος</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, to go). Class distinctions vanish in Christ. In the Christian churches were found slaves, freedmen, freemen, masters. Perhaps Paul has Philemon and Onesimus in mind. But labour and capital still furnish a problem for modern Christianity.</p>
<p><b>But Christ is all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα παντα Χριστος</span></span>). Demosthenes and Lucian use the neuter plural to describe persons as Paul does here of Christ. The plural <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα</span></span> is more inclusive than the singular <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν</span></span> would be.</p>
<p><b>And in all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εν πασιν</span></span>). Locative plural and neuter also. "Christ occupies the whole sphere of human life and permeates all its developments" (Lightfoot). Christ has obliterated the words barbarian, master, slave, all of them and has substituted the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδελφος</span></span> (brother). </p>
