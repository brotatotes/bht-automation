 And above all these things  (επ πασιν δε τουτοις). "And upon all these things."Put on love  (την αγαπην). See Luke 3:20. The verb has to be supplied (ενδυσασθε) from verse Colossians 3:12 as the accusative case αγαπην shows.Which is  (ο εστιν). Neuter singular of the relative and not feminine like αγαπη (the antecedent) nor masculine like συνδεσμος in the predicate. However, there are similar examples of ο εστιν in the sense of quod est (id est), "that is," in Mark 14:42; Mark 15:42, without agreement in gender and number. So also Ephesians 5:5 where ο εστιν = "which thing."The bond of perfectness  (συνδεσμος της τελειοτητος). See Colossians 2:19 for συνδεσμος. Here it is apparently the girdle that holds the various garments together. The genitive (τελειοτητος) is probably that of apposition with the girdle of love. In a succinct way Paul has here put the idea about love set forth so wonderfully in Colossians 3:1.
