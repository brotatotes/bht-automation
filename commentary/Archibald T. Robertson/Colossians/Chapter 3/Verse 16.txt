<p><b> The word of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λογος του Χριστου</span></span>). This precise phrase only here, though "the word of the Lord" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:8">1 Thessalonians 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:1">2 Thessalonians 3:1</span>. Elsewhere "the word of God." Paul is exalting Christ in this Epistle. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστου</span></span> can be either the subjective genitive (the word delivered by Christ) or the objective genitive (the word about Christ). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:14">1 John 2:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Dwell </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενοικειτω</span></span>). Present active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενοικεω</span></span>, to make one's home, to be at home.</p>
<p><b>In you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υμιν</span></span>). Not "among you."</p>
<p><b>Richly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλουσιως</span></span>). Old adverb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλουσιος</span></span> (rich). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:17">1 Timothy 6:17</span>. The following words explain <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλουσιως</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>In all wisdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν παση σοφια</span></span>). It is not clear whether this phrase goes with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλουσιως</span></span> (richly) or with the participles following (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκοντες κα νουθετουντες</span></span>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:28">Colossians 1:28</span>). Either punctuation makes good sense. The older Greek MSS. had no punctuation. There is an anacoluthon here. The participles may be used as imperatives as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:11">Romans 12:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:16">Romans 12:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>With psalms </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψαλμοις</span></span>, the Psalms in the Old Testament originally with musical accompaniment),</p>
<p><b>hymns </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμνοις</span></span>, praises to God composed by the Christians like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>),</p>
<p><b>spiritual songs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωιδαις πνευματικαις</span></span>, general description of all whether with or without instrumental accompaniment). The same song can have all three words applied to it.</p>
<p><b>Singing with grace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν χαριτ αιδοντες</span></span>). In God's grace (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>). The phrase can be taken with the preceding words. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιδω</span></span> is an old one (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:19">Ephesians 5:19</span>) for lyrical emotion in a devout soul.</p>
<p><b>In your hearts </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ταις καρδιαις υμων</span></span>). Without this there is no real worship "to God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω θεω</span></span>). How can a Jew or Unitarian in the choir lead in the worship of Christ as Saviour? Whether with instrument or with voice or with both it is all for naught if the adoration is not in the heart. </p>
