<p><b> Whatsoever ye do </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν οτ εαν ποιητε</span></span>). Indefinite relative (everything whatever) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and the present active subjunctive, a common idiom in such clauses.</p>
<p><b>Do all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα</span></span>). The imperative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιειτε</span></span> has to be supplied from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιητε</span></span> in the relative clause. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παντα</span></span> is repeated from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν</span></span> (singular), but in the plural (all things). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παν</span></span> is left as a nominative absolute as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:32">Matthew 10:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:10">Luke 12:10</span>. This is a sort of Golden Rule for Christians "in the name of the Lord Jesus" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ονοματ Κυριου Ιησου</span></span>), in the spirit of the Lord Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:20">Ephesians 5:20</span>). What follows (directions to the various groups) is in this same vein. Sociological problems have always existed. Paul puts his finger on the sore spot in each group with unerring skill like a true diagnostician. </p>
