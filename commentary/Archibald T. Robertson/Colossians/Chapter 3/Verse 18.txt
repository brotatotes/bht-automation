<p><b> Wives </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα γυναικες</span></span>). The article here distinguishes class from class and with the vocative case can be best rendered "Ye wives." So with each group.</p>
<p><b>Be in subjection to your husbands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσεσθε τοις ανδρασιν</span></span>). "Own" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιοις</span></span>) is genuine in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:22">Ephesians 5:22</span>, but not here. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσομα</span></span> has a military air, common in the <i>Koine</i> for such obedience. Obedience in government is essential as the same word shows in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:1">Romans 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:5">Romans 13:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>As is fitting in the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ανηκεν εν Κυριω</span></span>). This is an idiomatic use of the imperfect indicative with verbs of propriety in present time (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 919). Wives have rights and privileges, but recognition of the husband's leadership is essential to a well-ordered home, only the assumption is that the husband has a head and a wise one. </p>
