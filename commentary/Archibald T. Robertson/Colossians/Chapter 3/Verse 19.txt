<p><b> Love your wives </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπατε τας γυναικας</span></span>). Present active imperative, "keep on loving." That is precisely the point.</p>
<p><b>Be not bitter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πικραινεσθε</span></span>). Present middle imperative in prohibition: "Stop being bitter" or "do not have the habit of being bitter." This is the sin of husbands. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πικραινω</span></span> is an old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πικρος</span></span> (bitter). In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:11">Revelation 8:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:9">Revelation 10:9</span>. The bitter word rankles in the soul. </p>
