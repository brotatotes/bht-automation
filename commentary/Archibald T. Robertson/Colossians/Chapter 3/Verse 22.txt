<p><b> Your masters according to the flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις κατα σαρκα κυριοις</span></span>). "Lords" really, but these Christian slaves (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλο</span></span>) had Christ as lord, but even so they were to obey their lords in the flesh.</p>
<p><b>Not with eye-service </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη εν οφθαλμοδουλιαις</span></span>). Another Pauline word (here only and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:6">Ephesians 6:6</span>), elsewhere only in Christian writers after Paul, an easy and expressive compound, service while the master's eye was on the slave and no longer.</p>
<p><b>Men-pleasers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπαρεσκο</span></span>). Late compound only in LXX and Paul (here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:6">Ephesians 6:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>In singleness of heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν απλοτητ καρδιας</span></span>). So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5">Ephesians 6:5</span>. Old and expressive word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απλους</span></span> (simple, without folds). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:3">2 Corinthians 11:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Fearing the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβουμενο τον Κυριον</span></span>). Rather than the lords according to the flesh. </p>
