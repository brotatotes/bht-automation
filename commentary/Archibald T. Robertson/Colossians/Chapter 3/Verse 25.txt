 Shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done  (κομισετα ο ηδικησεν). It is not clear whether ο αδικων (he that doeth wrong) is the master or the slave. It is true of either and Lightfoot interprets it of both, "shall receive back the wrong which he did." This is a general law of life and of God and it is fair and square.There is no respect of persons  (ουκ εστιν προσωπολημψια). There is with men, but not with God. For this word patterned after the Hebrew see Romans 2:11; Ephesians 6:9; James 2:1 The next verse should be in this chapter also.
