<p><b> Shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κομισετα ο ηδικησεν</span></span>). It is not clear whether <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αδικων</span></span> (he that doeth wrong) is the master or the slave. It is true of either and Lightfoot interprets it of both, "shall receive back the wrong which he did." This is a general law of life and of God and it is fair and square.</p>
<p><b>There is no respect of persons </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν προσωπολημψια</span></span>). There is with men, but not with God. For this word patterned after the Hebrew see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:11">Romans 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:9">Ephesians 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1">James 2:1</span> The next verse should be in this chapter also. </p>
