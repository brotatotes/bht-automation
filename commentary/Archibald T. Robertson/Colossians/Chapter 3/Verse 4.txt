<p><b> When Christ shall be manifested </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν ο Χριστος φανερωθη</span></span>). Indefinite temporal clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανεροω</span></span>, "whenever Christ is manifested," a reference to the second coming of Christ as looked for and longed for, but wholly uncertain as to time. See this same verb used of the second coming in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>Ye also together with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υμεις συν αυτω</span></span>). That is the joy of this blessed hope. He repeats the verb about us <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανερωθησεσθε</span></span> (future passive indicative) and adds <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν δοξη</span></span> (in glory). Not to respond to this high appeal is to be like Bunyan's man with the muck-rake. </p>
