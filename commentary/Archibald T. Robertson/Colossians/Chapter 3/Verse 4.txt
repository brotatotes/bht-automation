 When Christ shall be manifested  (οταν ο Χριστος φανερωθη). Indefinite temporal clause with οταν and the first aorist passive subjunctive of φανεροω, "whenever Christ is manifested," a reference to the second coming of Christ as looked for and longed for, but wholly uncertain as to time. See this same verb used of the second coming in 1 John 3:2.Ye also together with him  (κα υμεις συν αυτω). That is the joy of this blessed hope. He repeats the verb about us φανερωθησεσθε (future passive indicative) and adds εν δοξη (in glory). Not to respond to this high appeal is to be like Bunyan's man with the muck-rake.
