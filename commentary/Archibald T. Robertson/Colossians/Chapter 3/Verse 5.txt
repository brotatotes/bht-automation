<p><b> Mortify </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεκρωσατε</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεκροω</span></span>, late verb, to put to death, to treat as dead. Latin Vulgate <i>mortifico</i>, but "mortify" is coming with us to mean putrify. Paul boldly applies the metaphor of death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:20">Colossians 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:3">Colossians 3:3</span>) pictured in baptism (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>) to the actual life of the Christian. He is not to go to the other Gnostic extreme of license on the plea that the soul is not affected by the deeds of the body. Paul's idea is that the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:19">1 Corinthians 6:19</span>). He mentions some of these "members upon the earth" like fornication (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορνειαν</span></span>), uncleanness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακαθαρσιαν</span></span>), passion (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παθος</span></span>), evil desire (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιθυμιαν κακην</span></span>), covetousness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεονεξιαν</span></span>) "the which is idolatry" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητις εστιν ειδωλολατρια</span></span>). See the longer list of the works of the flesh in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:19-21">Galatians 5:19-21</span>, though covetousness is not there named, but it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:19">Ephesians 4:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>. </p>
