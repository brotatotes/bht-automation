 But now  (νυν δε). Emphatic form of νυν in decided contrast (to ποτε in verse Colossians 3:7) in the resurrection life of Colossians 2:12; Colossians 3:1.Put ye also away  (αποθεσθε κα υμεις). Second aorist middle imperative of old verb αποτιθημ, to put away, lay aside like old clothes. This metaphor of clothing Paul now uses with several verbs (αποθεσθε here, απεκδυσαμενο in verse Colossians 3:9, ενδυσαμενο in verse Colossians 3:10, ενδυσασθε in verse Colossians 3:12).All these  (τα παντα). The whole bunch of filthy rags (anger οργην, wrath θυμον, malice κακιαν, railing βλασφημιαν, shameful speaking αισχρολογιαν). See somewhat similar lists of vices in Colossians 3:5; Galatians 5:20; Ephesians 4:29-31. These words have all been discussed except αισχρολογιαν, an old word for low and obscene speech which occurs here only in the N.T. It is made from αισχρολογος (αισχρος as in 1 Corinthians 11:6 and that from αισχος, disgrace). Note also the addition of "out of your mouth" (εκ του στοματος υμων). The word was used for both abusive and filthy talk and Lightfoot combines both ideas as often happens. Such language should never come out of the mouth of a Christian living the new life in Christ.
