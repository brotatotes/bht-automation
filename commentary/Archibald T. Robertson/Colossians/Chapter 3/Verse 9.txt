<p><b> Lie not to another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ψευδεσθε εις αλληλους</span></span>). Lying (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψευδος</span></span>) could have been included in the preceding list where it belongs in reality. But it is put more pointedly thus in the prohibition (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the present middle imperative). It means either "stop lying" or "do not have the habit of lying."</p>
<p><b>Seeing that ye have put off </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκδυσαμενο</span></span>). First aorist middle participle (causal sense of the circumstantial participle) of the double compound verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκδυομα</span></span>, for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> has the perfective sense (wholly), "having stripped clean off." The same metaphor as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποθεσθε</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:8">Colossians 3:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>The old man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον παλαιον ανθρωπον</span></span>). Here Paul brings in another metaphor (mixes his metaphors as he often does), that of the old life of sin regarded as "the ancient man" of sin already crucified (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>) and dropped now once and for all as a mode of life (aorist tense). See same figure in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παλαιος</span></span> is ancient in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεος</span></span> (young, new) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:17">Matthew 9:17</span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινος</span></span> (fresh, unused) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:52">Matthew 13:52</span>.</p>
<p><b>With his doings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν ταις πραξεσιν αυτου</span></span>). Practice must square with profession. </p>
