 Lie not to another  (μη ψευδεσθε εις αλληλους). Lying (ψευδος) could have been included in the preceding list where it belongs in reality. But it is put more pointedly thus in the prohibition (μη and the present middle imperative). It means either "stop lying" or "do not have the habit of lying."Seeing that ye have put off  (απεκδυσαμενο). First aorist middle participle (causal sense of the circumstantial participle) of the double compound verb απεκδυομα, for which see Colossians 2:15. The απο has the perfective sense (wholly), "having stripped clean off." The same metaphor as αποθεσθε in verse Colossians 3:8.The old man  (τον παλαιον ανθρωπον). Here Paul brings in another metaphor (mixes his metaphors as he often does), that of the old life of sin regarded as "the ancient man" of sin already crucified (Romans 6:6) and dropped now once and for all as a mode of life (aorist tense). See same figure in Ephesians 4:22. Παλαιος is ancient in contrast with νεος (young, new) as in Matthew 9:17 or καινος (fresh, unused) as in Matthew 13:52.With his doings  (συν ταις πραξεσιν αυτου). Practice must square with profession.
