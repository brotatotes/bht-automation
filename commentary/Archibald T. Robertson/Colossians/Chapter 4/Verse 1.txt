<p><b> That which is just and equal </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το δικαιον κα την ισοτητα</span></span>). Paul changes from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ισον</span></span> (like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το δικαιον</span></span>, neuter singular adjective with article for abstract idea) to the abstract substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισοτης</span></span>, old word, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:13">2 Corinthians 8:13</span>. If employers always did this, there would be no labour problem.</p>
<p><b>A Master in heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριον εν ουρανω</span></span>). A wholesome reminder to the effect that he keeps his eye on the conduct of masters of men here towards their employees. </p>
