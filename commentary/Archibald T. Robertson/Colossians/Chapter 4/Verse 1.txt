 That which is just and equal  (το δικαιον κα την ισοτητα). Paul changes from το ισον (like το δικαιον, neuter singular adjective with article for abstract idea) to the abstract substantive ισοτης, old word, in N.T. only here and 2 Corinthians 8:13. If employers always did this, there would be no labour problem.A Master in heaven  (Κυριον εν ουρανω). A wholesome reminder to the effect that he keeps his eye on the conduct of masters of men here towards their employees.
