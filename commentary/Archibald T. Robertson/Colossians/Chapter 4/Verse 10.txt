<p><b> Aristarchus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αρισταρχος</span></span>). He was from Thessalonica and accompanied Paul to Jerusalem with the collection (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>) and started with Paul to Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:2">Acts 27:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:24">Philemon 1:24</span>). Whether he has been with Paul all the time in Rome we do not know, but he is here now.</p>
<p><b>My fellow-prisoner </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο συναιχμαλωτος μου</span></span>). One of Paul's compounds, found elsewhere only in Lucian. Paul uses it of Epaphras in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:23">Philemon 1:23</span>, but whether of actual voluntary imprisonment or of spiritual imprisonment like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνστρατιωτες</span></span> (fellow-soldier) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:2">Philemon 1:2</span> we do not know. Abbott argues for a literal imprisonment and it is possible that some of Paul's co-workers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν-εργο</span></span>) voluntarily shared imprisonment with him by turns.</p>
<p><b>Mark </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μαρκος</span></span>). Once rejected by Paul for his defection in the work (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:36-39">Acts 15:36-39</span>), but now cordially commended because he had made good again.</p>
<p><b>The cousin of Barnabas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ανεψιος Βαρναβα</span></span>). It was used for "nephew" very late, clearly "cousin" here and common so in the papyri. This kinship explains the interest of Barnabas in Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:25">Acts 12:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:5">Acts 13:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:36-39">Acts 15:36-39</span>).</p>
<p><b>If he come unto you, receive him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ελθη προς υμας δεξασθε αυτον</span></span>). This third class conditional sentence (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>) gives the substance of the commands (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντολας</span></span>) about Mark already sent, how we do not know. But Paul's commendation of Mark is hearty and unreserved as he does later in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:11">2 Timothy 4:11</span>. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεχομα</span></span> is the usual one for hospitable reception (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:14">Matthew 10:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:45">John 4:45</span>) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσδεχομα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:29">Philippians 2:29</span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποδεχομα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:38">Luke 10:38</span>). </p>
