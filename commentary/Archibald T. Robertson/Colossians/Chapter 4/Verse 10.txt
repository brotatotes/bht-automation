 Aristarchus  (Αρισταρχος). He was from Thessalonica and accompanied Paul to Jerusalem with the collection (Acts 19:29; Acts 20:4) and started with Paul to Rome (Acts 27:2; Philemon 1:24). Whether he has been with Paul all the time in Rome we do not know, but he is here now.My fellow-prisoner  (ο συναιχμαλωτος μου). One of Paul's compounds, found elsewhere only in Lucian. Paul uses it of Epaphras in Philemon 1:23, but whether of actual voluntary imprisonment or of spiritual imprisonment like συνστρατιωτες (fellow-soldier) in Philippians 2:25; Philemon 1:2 we do not know. Abbott argues for a literal imprisonment and it is possible that some of Paul's co-workers (συν-εργο) voluntarily shared imprisonment with him by turns.Mark  (Μαρκος). Once rejected by Paul for his defection in the work (Acts 15:36-39), but now cordially commended because he had made good again.The cousin of Barnabas  (ο ανεψιος Βαρναβα). It was used for "nephew" very late, clearly "cousin" here and common so in the papyri. This kinship explains the interest of Barnabas in Mark (Acts 12:25; Acts 13:5; Acts 15:36-39).If he come unto you, receive him  (εαν ελθη προς υμας δεξασθε αυτον). This third class conditional sentence (εαν and second aorist active subjunctive of ερχομα) gives the substance of the commands (εντολας) about Mark already sent, how we do not know. But Paul's commendation of Mark is hearty and unreserved as he does later in 2 Timothy 4:11. The verb δεχομα is the usual one for hospitable reception (Matthew 10:14; John 4:45) like προσδεχομα (Philippians 2:29) and υποδεχομα (Luke 10:38).
