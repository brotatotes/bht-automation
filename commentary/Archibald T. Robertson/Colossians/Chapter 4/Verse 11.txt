 Jesus which is called Justus  (Ιησους ο λεγομενος Ιουστος). Another illustration of the frequency of the name Jesus (Joshua). The surname Justus is the Latin Justus for the Greek Δικαιος and the Hebrew Zadok and very common as a surname among the Jews. The name appears for two others in the N.T. (Acts 1:23; Acts 18:7).Who are of the circumcision  (ο οντες εκ περιτομης). Jewish Christians certainly, but not necessarily Judaizers like those so termed in Acts 11:3 (ο εκ περιτομης. Cf. Acts 35:1; Acts 35:5).These only  (ουτο μονο). "Of the circumcision" (Jews) he means.A comfort unto me  (μο παρηγορια). Ethical dative of personal interest. Παρηγορια is an old word (here only in N.T.) from παρηγορεω, to make an address) and means solace, relief. A medical term. Curiously enough our word paregoric comes from it (παρηγορικος).
