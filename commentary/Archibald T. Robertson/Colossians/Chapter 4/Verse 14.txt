<p><b> Luke, the beloved physician </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λουκας ο ιατρος ο αγαπητος</span></span>). Mentioned also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:24">Philemon 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:11">2 Timothy 4:11</span>. The author of the Gospel and the Acts. Both Mark and Luke are with Paul at this time, possibly also with copies of their Gospels with them. The article here (repeated) may mean "my beloved physician." It would seem certain that Luke looked after Paul's health and that Paul loved him. Paul was Luke's hero, but it was not a one-sided affection. It is beautiful to see preacher and physician warm friends in the community.</p>
<p><b>Demas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δημας</span></span>). Just his name here (a contraction of Demetrius), but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:10">2 Timothy 4:10</span> he is mentioned as one who deserted Paul. </p>
