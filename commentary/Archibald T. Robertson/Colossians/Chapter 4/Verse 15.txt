<p><b> Nymphas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Νυμφαν</span></span>). That is masculine, if <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> (his) is genuine (D E K L) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ' οικον</span></span>, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Νυμφα</span></span> (feminine) if <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτης</span></span> (her) is read (B 67). Aleph A C P read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτων</span></span> (their), perhaps including <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδελφους</span></span> (brethren) and so locating this church (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησια</span></span>) in Laodicea. It was not till the third century that separate buildings were used for church worship. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span> for Prisca and Aquila. It is not possible to tell whether it is "her" or "his" house here. </p>
