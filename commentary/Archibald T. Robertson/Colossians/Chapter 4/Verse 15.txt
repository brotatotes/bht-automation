 Nymphas  (Νυμφαν). That is masculine, if αυτου (his) is genuine (D E K L) after κατ' οικον, but Νυμφα (feminine) if αυτης (her) is read (B 67). Aleph A C P read αυτων (their), perhaps including αδελφους (brethren) and so locating this church (εκκλησια) in Laodicea. It was not till the third century that separate buildings were used for church worship. See Romans 16:5 for Prisca and Aquila. It is not possible to tell whether it is "her" or "his" house here.
