<p><b> When this epistle hath been read among you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν αναγνωσθη παρ' υμιν η επιστολη</span></span>). Indefinite temporal clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε αν</span></span>) and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγινωσκω</span></span>. The epistle was read in public to the church (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>).</p>
<p><b>Cause that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησατε ινα</span></span>). Same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:37">John 11:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:15">Revelation 13:15</span>. Old Greek preferred <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως</span></span> for this idiom. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:27">1 Thessalonians 5:27</span> for injunction for public reading of the Epistle.</p>
<p><b>That ye also read </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υμεις αναγνωτε</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγινωσκω</span></span>, to read.</p>
<p><b>And the epistle from Laodicea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα την εκ Λαοδικιας</span></span>). The most likely meaning is that the so-called Epistle to the Ephesians was a circular letter to various churches in the province of Asia, one copy going to Laodicea and to be passed on to Colossae as the Colossian letter was to be sent on to Laodicea. This was done usually by copying and keeping the original. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:1">Ephesians 1:1</span> for further discussion of this matter. </p>
