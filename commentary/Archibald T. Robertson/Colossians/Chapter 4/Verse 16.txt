 When this epistle hath been read among you  (οταν αναγνωσθη παρ' υμιν η επιστολη). Indefinite temporal clause with οταν (οτε αν) and the first aorist passive subjunctive of αναγινωσκω. The epistle was read in public to the church (Revelation 1:3).Cause that  (ποιησατε ινα). Same idiom in John 11:37; Revelation 13:15. Old Greek preferred οπως for this idiom. See 1 Thessalonians 5:27 for injunction for public reading of the Epistle.That ye also read  (κα υμεις αναγνωτε). Second aorist active subjunctive of αναγινωσκω, to read.And the epistle from Laodicea  (κα την εκ Λαοδικιας). The most likely meaning is that the so-called Epistle to the Ephesians was a circular letter to various churches in the province of Asia, one copy going to Laodicea and to be passed on to Colossae as the Colossian letter was to be sent on to Laodicea. This was done usually by copying and keeping the original. See Ephesians 1:1 for further discussion of this matter.
