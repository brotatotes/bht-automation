<p><b> Take heed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπε</span></span>). Keep an eye on.</p>
<p><b>Thou hast received in the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρελαβες εν Κυριω</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαμβανω</span></span>, the verb used by Paul of getting his message from the Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span>). Clearly Archippus had a call "in the Lord" as every preacher should have.</p>
<p><b>That thou fulfil it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα αυτην πληροις</span></span>). Present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span>, "that thou keep on filling it full." It is a life-time job. </p>
