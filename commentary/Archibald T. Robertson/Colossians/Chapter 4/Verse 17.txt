Second aorist active indicative of παραλαμβανω, the verb used by Paul of getting his message from the Lord (1 Corinthians 15:3). Clearly Archippus had a call "in the Lord" as every preacher should have.That thou fulfil it  (ινα αυτην πληροις). Present active subjunctive of πληροω, "that thou keep on filling it full." It is a life-time job.
