<p><b> Of me Paul with mine own hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εμη χειρ Παυλου</span></span>). More precisely, "with the hand of me Paul." The genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παυλου</span></span> is in apposition with the idea in the possessive pronoun <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμη</span></span>, which is itself in the instrumental case agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρ</span></span>. So also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:21">1 Corinthians 16:21</span>.</p>
<p><b>My bonds </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μου των δεσμων</span></span>). Genitive case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνεμονευετε</span></span> (remember). The chain (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αλυσε</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:20">Ephesians 6:20</span>) clanked afresh as Paul took the pen to sign the salutation. He was not likely to forget it himself </p>
