<p><b> Withal </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμα</span></span>). At the same time.</p>
<p><b>That God may open </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ο θεος ανοιξη</span></span>). Common use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the subjunctive (aorist), the sub-final use so common in the N.T. as in the <i>Koine</i>.</p>
<p><b>A door for the word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυραν του λογου</span></span>). Objective genitive, a door for preaching. It is comforting to other preachers to see the greatest of all preachers here asking prayer that he may be set free again to preach. He uses this figure elsewhere, once of a great and open door with many adversaries in Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:9">1 Corinthians 16:9</span>), once of an open door that he could not enter in Troas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>The mystery of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μυστηριον του Χριστου</span></span>). The genitive of apposition, the mystery which is Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>), one that puts out of comparison the foolish "mysteries" of the Gnostics.</p>
<p><b>For which I am also in bonds </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ο κα δεδεμα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεω</span></span>. Paul is always conscious of this limitation, this chain. At bottom he is a prisoner because of his preaching to the Gentiles. </p>
