<p><b> Toward them that are without </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τους εξω</span></span>). A Pauline phrase for those outside the churches (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:12">1 Thessalonians 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:12">1 Corinthians 5:12</span>). It takes wise walking to win them to Christ.</p>
<p><b>Redeeming the time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον καιρον εξαγοραζομενο</span></span>). We all have the same time. Paul goes into the open market and buys it up by using it rightly. See the same metaphor in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:16">Ephesians 5:16</span>. </p>
