<p><b> Seasoned with salt </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλατ ηρτυμενος</span></span>). The same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτυω</span></span> (old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρω</span></span>, to fit, to arrange) about salt in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:50">Mark 9:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:34">Luke 14:34</span>. Nowhere else in the N.T. Not too much salt, not too little. Plutarch uses salt of speech, the wit which flavours speech (cf. Attic salt). Our word salacious is this same word degenerated into vulgarity. Grace and salt (wit, sense) make an ideal combination. Every teacher will sympathize with Paul's desire "that ye know how ye must answer each one" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδενα πως δε υμας εν εκαστω αποκρινεσθα</span></span>). Who does know? </p>
