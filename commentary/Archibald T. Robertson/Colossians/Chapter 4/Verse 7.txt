<p><b> All my affairs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα κατ' εμε παντα</span></span>). "All the things relating to me." The accusative case the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωρισε</span></span>. The same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:14">Acts 25:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:2">Philippians 1:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>Tychicus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τυχικος</span></span>). Mentioned also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:21">Ephesians 6:21</span> as the bearer of that Epistle and with the same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωρισε</span></span> (future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωριζω</span></span>) and with the same descriptive epithet as here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αγαπητος αδελφος κα πιστος διακονος εν Κυριω</span></span>, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord) except that here we have also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα συνδουλος</span></span> (and fellow-servant). Abbott suggests that Paul adds <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνδουλος</span></span> because he had used it of Epaphras in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:7">Colossians 1:7</span>. Perhaps <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστος</span></span> goes with both substantives and means faithful to Paul as well as to Christ. </p>
