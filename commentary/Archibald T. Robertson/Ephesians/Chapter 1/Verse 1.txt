<p><b> Of Christ Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστου Ιησου</span></span>). So B D, though Aleph A L have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>. Paul is named as the author and so he is. Otherwise the Epistle is pseudepigraphic.</p>
<p><b>By the will of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια θεληματος θεου</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:1">2 Corinthians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>At Ephesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Εφεσω</span></span>). In Aleph and B these words are inserted by later hands, though both MSS. give the title <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προς Εφεσιους</span></span>. Origen explains the words <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις αγιοις τοις ουσιν</span></span> as meaning "the saints that are" (genuine saints), showing that his MSS. did not have the words <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Εφεσω</span></span>. The explanation of the insertion of these words has already been given in the remarks on "The Destination" as one copy of the general letter that was preserved in Ephesus. It is perfectly proper to call it the Epistle to the Ephesians if we understand the facts. </p>
