 To the end that we should be  (εις το εινα ημας). Final clause with εις to and the infinitive εινα (see the mere infinitive εινα in verse Ephesians 1:4) and the accusative of general reference.Who had before hoped in Christ  (τους προηλπικοτας εν τω Χριστω). Articular perfect active participle of προελπιζω, late and rare compound (here only in N.T.) and the reference of προ not clear. Probably the reference is to those who like Paul had once been Jews and had now found the Messiah in Jesus, some of whom like Simeon and Anna had even looked for the spiritual Messiah before his coming.
