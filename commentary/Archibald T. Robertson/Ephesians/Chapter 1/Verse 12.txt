<p><b> To the end that we should be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το εινα ημας</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> to and the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα</span></span> (see the mere infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>) and the accusative of general reference.</p>
<p><b>Who had before hoped in Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους προηλπικοτας εν τω Χριστω</span></span>). Articular perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προελπιζω</span></span>, late and rare compound (here only in N.T.) and the reference of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ</span></span> not clear. Probably the reference is to those who like Paul had once been Jews and had now found the Messiah in Jesus, some of whom like Simeon and Anna had even looked for the spiritual Messiah before his coming. </p>
