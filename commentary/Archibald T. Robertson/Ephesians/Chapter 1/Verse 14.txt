<p><b> An earnest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρραβων</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:22">2 Corinthians 1:22</span> for discussion of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρραβων</span></span>. Here "of promise" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της επαγγελιας</span></span>) is added to the Holy Spirit to show that Gentiles are also included in God's promise of salvation.</p>
<p><b>Of our inheritance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της κληρονομιας ημων</span></span>). God's gift of the Holy Spirit is the pledge and first payment for the final inheritance in Christ.</p>
<p><b>Of God's own possession </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της περιποιησεως</span></span>). The word</p>
<p><b>God's </b> is not in the Greek, but is implied. Late and rare word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιποιεω</span></span>, to make a survival) with the notion of obtaining (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:9">1 Thessalonians 5:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:14">2 Thessalonians 3:14</span>) and then of preserving (so in the papyri). So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:39">Hebrews 10:39</span>, and here. God has purchased us back to himself. The sealing extends (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>) to the redemption and to the glory of God. </p>
