<p><b> And which ye shew toward all the saints </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα την εις παντας τους αγιους</span></span>). The words "ye show" do not occur in the Greek. The Textus Receptus has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεν αγαπην</span></span> (the love) before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την</span></span> supported by D G K L Syr., Lat., Copt., but Aleph A B P Origen do not have the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπην</span></span>. It could have been omitted, but is probably not genuine. The use of the article referring to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστιν</span></span> and the change from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> probably justifies the translation "which ye shew toward." </p>
