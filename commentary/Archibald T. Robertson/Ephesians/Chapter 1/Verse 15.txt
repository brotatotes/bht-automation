 And which ye shew toward all the saints  (κα την εις παντας τους αγιους). The words "ye show" do not occur in the Greek. The Textus Receptus has τεν αγαπην (the love) before την supported by D G K L Syr., Lat., Copt., but Aleph A B P Origen do not have the word αγαπην. It could have been omitted, but is probably not genuine. The use of the article referring to πιστιν and the change from εν to εις probably justifies the translation "which ye shew toward."
