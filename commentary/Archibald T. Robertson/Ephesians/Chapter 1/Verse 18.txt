<p><b> Having the eyes of your heart enlightened </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεφωτισμενους τους οφθαλμους της καρδιας υμων</span></span>). A beautiful figure, the heart regarded as having eyes looking out toward Christ. But the grammar is difficult. There are three possible interpretations. One is an anacoluthon, the case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεφωτισμενους</span></span> being changed from the dative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν</span></span> (to you) to the accusative because of the following infinitive like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεξαμενους</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span>) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολοις</span></span>. Another way of explaining it is to regard it as a tertiary predicate of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωιη</span></span>, a loose expansion of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span>. The third way is to regard the construction as the accusative absolute, a rare idiom possible in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:3">Acts 26:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:3">1 Corinthians 16:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:6">1 Timothy 2:6</span>. In this case, the participle merely agrees with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους οφθαλμους</span></span>, not with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν</span></span>, "the eyes of your heart having been enlightened." Otherwise <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους οφθαλμους</span></span> is the accusative retained after the passive participle.</p>
<p><b>That ye may know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ειδενα</span></span>). Final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το</span></span> and the infinitive (second perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span>) as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:12">Ephesians 1:12</span>. Note three indirect questions after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδενα</span></span> (what the hope <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις η ελπις</span></span>, what the riches <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις ο πλουτος</span></span>, and what the surpassing greatness <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τ το υπερβαλλον μεγεθος</span></span>). When the Holy Spirit opens the eyes of the heart, one will be able to see all these great truths.</p>
<p><b>In the saints </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις αγιοις</span></span>). Our riches is in God, God's is in his saints. </p>
