 Which he wrought  (ενηργηκεν). Reading of A B rather than aorist ενηργησεν. Perfect active indicative, "which he has wrought." Hην is cognate accusative of the relative referring to ενεργειαν (energy) with ενηργηκεν and note also κρατους (strength) and ισχυος (might), three words trying to express what surpasses (υπερβαλλον) expression or comprehension.Made him to sit  (καθισας). First aorist active participle of καθιζω in causative sense as in 1 Corinthians 6:4. Metaphorical local expression like δεξια and εν τοις επουρ ανιοις.
