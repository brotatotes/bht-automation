<p><b> Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητις</span></span>). "Which in fact is," explanatory use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητις</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>The fulness of him that filleth all in all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πληρωμα του τα παντα εν πασιν πληρουμενου</span></span>). This is probably the correct translation of a much disputed phrase. This view takes <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρωμα</span></span> in the passive sense (that which is filled, as is usual, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:19">Colossians 1:19</span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρουμενου</span></span> as present middle participle, not passive. All things are summed up in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>), who is the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρωμα</span></span> of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:19">Colossians 1:19</span>), and in particular does Christ fill the church universal as his body. Hence we see in Ephesians the Dignity of the Body of Christ which is ultimately to be filled with the fulness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρωμα</span></span>) of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span>) when it grows up into the fulness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρωμα</span></span>) of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:16">Ephesians 4:16</span>). </p>
