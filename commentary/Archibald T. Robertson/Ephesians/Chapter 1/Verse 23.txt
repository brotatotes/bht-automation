 Which  (ητις). "Which in fact is," explanatory use of ητις rather than η.The fulness of him that filleth all in all  (το πληρωμα του τα παντα εν πασιν πληρουμενου). This is probably the correct translation of a much disputed phrase. This view takes πληρωμα in the passive sense (that which is filled, as is usual, Colossians 1:19) and πληρουμενου as present middle participle, not passive. All things are summed up in Christ (Ephesians 1:10), who is the πληρωμα of God (Colossians 1:19), and in particular does Christ fill the church universal as his body. Hence we see in Ephesians the Dignity of the Body of Christ which is ultimately to be filled with the fulness (πληρωμα) of God (Ephesians 3:19) when it grows up into the fulness (πληρωμα) of Christ (Ephesians 4:13; Ephesians 4:16).
