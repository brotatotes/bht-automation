<p><b> Even as he chose us in him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως εξελεξατο ημας εν αυτω</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεγω</span></span>, to pick out, to choose. Definitive statement of God's elective grace concerning believers in Christ.</p>
<p><b>Before the foundation of the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ καταβολης κοσμου</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβαλλω</span></span>, to fling down, used of the deposit of seed, the laying of a foundation. This very phrase with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ</span></span> in the Prayer of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span>) of love of the Father toward the Son. It occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span>. Elsewhere we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> (from) used with it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34">Matthew 25:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:50">Luke 11:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:3">Hebrews 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>). But Paul uses neither phrase elsewhere, though he has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο των αιωνων</span></span> (from the ages) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:9">Ephesians 3:9</span>. Here in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3-14">Ephesians 1:3-14</span>. Paul in summary fashion gives an outline of his view of God's redemptive plans for the race.</p>
<p><b>That we should be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα ημας</span></span>). Infinitive of purpose with the accusative of general reference (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημας</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:22">Colossians 1:22</span> for the same two adjectives and also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατενωπιον αυτου</span></span>. </p>
