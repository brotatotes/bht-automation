 Having foreordained us  (Προορισας ημας). First aorist active participle of προοριζω, late and rare compound to define or decide beforehand. Already in Acts 4:28; 1 Corinthians 2:7; Romans 8:29. See also verse Ephesians 1:11. Only other N.T. example in verse Ephesians 1:11. To be taken with εξελεξατο either simultaneous or antecedent (causal).Unto adoption as sons  (εις υιοθεσιαν). For this interesting word see Galatians 4:5; Romans 8:15; Romans 9:4.Unto himself  (εις αυτον). Unto God.According to the good pleasure of his will  (κατα την ευδοκιαν του θεληματος αυτου). Here ευδοκιαν meanspurpose  like βουλην in verse Ephesians 1:11 rather thanbenevolence  (good pleasure). Note the preposition κατα here for standard.
