 In whom  (εν ω). Just like Colossians 1:14 with παραπτωματων (trespasses) in place of αμαρτιων (sins) and with the addition of δια του αιματος αυτου (through his blood) as in Colossians 1:20. Clearly Paul makes the blood of Christ the cost of redemption, the ransom money (λυτρον, Matthew 20:28; Mark 10:45; αντιλυτρον, 1 Timothy 2:6). See Colossians 1:9.
