 Separate from Christ  (χωρις Χριστου). Ablative case with adverbial preposition χωρις, describing their former condition as heathen.Alienated from the commonwealth of Israel  (απηλλοτριωμενο της πολιτειας του Ισραηλ). Perfect passive participle of απαλλοτριοω, for which see Colossians 1:21. Here followed by ablative case πολιτειας, old word from πολιτευω, to be a citizen (Philippians 1:27) from πολιτης and that from πολις (city). Only twice in N.T., here as commonwealth (the spiritual Israel or Kingdom of God) and Acts 22:28 as citizenship.Strangers from the covenants of the promise  (ξενο των διαθηκων της επαγγελιας). For ξενος (Latin hospes), as stranger see Matthew 25:35; Matthew 25:38; Matthew 25:43, as guest-friend see Romans 16:23. Here it is followed by the ablative case διαθηκων.Having no hope  (ελπιδα μη εχοντες). No hope of any kind. In Galatians 4:8 ουκ (strong negative) occurs with ειδοτες θεον, but here μη gives a more subjective picture (1 Thessalonians 4:5).Without God  (αθεο). Old Greek word, not in LXX, only here in N.T. Atheists in the original sense of being without God and also in the sense of hostility to God from failure to worship him. See Paul's words in Romans 1:18-32. "In the world" (εν τω κοσμω) goes with both phrases. It is a terrible picture that Paul gives, but a true one.
