<p><b> But now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν δε</span></span>). Strong contrast, as opposed to "at that time."</p>
<p><b>Afar off </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακραν</span></span>). Adverb (accusative feminine adjective with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδον</span></span> understood). From the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολιτεια</span></span> and its hope in God.</p>
<p><b>Are made nigh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενηθητε εγγυς</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>, a sort of timeless aorist. Nigh to the commonwealth of Israel in Christ.</p>
<p><b>In the blood of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω αιματ του Χριστου</span></span>). Not a perfunctory addition, but essential (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7">Ephesians 1:7</span>), particularly in view of the Gnostic denial of Christ's real humanity. </p>
