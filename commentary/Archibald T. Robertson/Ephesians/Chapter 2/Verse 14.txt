 For he is our peace  (αυτος γαρ εστιν η ειρηνη ημων). He himself, not just what he did (necessary as that was and is). He is our peace with God and so with each other (Jews and Gentiles).Both one  (τα αμφοτερα εν). "The both" (Jew and Gentile). Jesus had said "other sheep I have which are not of this fold" (John 10:16).One  (εν) is neuter singular (oneness, unity, identity) as in Galatians 3:28. Race and national distinctions vanish in Christ. If all men were really in Christ, war would disappear.Brake down the middle wall of partition  (το μεσοτοιχον του φραγμου λυσας). "Having loosened (first aorist active participle of λυω, see John 2:19) the middle-wall (late word, only here in N.T., and very rare anywhere, one in papyri, and one inscription) of partition (φραγμου, old word, fence, from φρασσω, to fence or hedge, as in Matthew 21:33)." In the temple courts a partition wall divided the court of the Gentiles from the court of Israel with an inscription forbidding a Gentile from going further (Josephus, Ant. VIII. 3, 2). See the uproar when Paul was accused of taking Trophimus beyond this wall (Acts 21:28).
