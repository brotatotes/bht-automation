<p><b> For he is our peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος γαρ εστιν η ειρηνη ημων</span></span>). He himself, not just what he did (necessary as that was and is). He is our peace with God and so with each other (Jews and Gentiles).</p>
<p><b>Both one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα αμφοτερα εν</span></span>). "The both" (Jew and Gentile). Jesus had said "other sheep I have which are not of this fold" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:16">John 10:16</span>).</p>
<p><b>One </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>) is neuter singular (oneness, unity, identity) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:28">Galatians 3:28</span>. Race and national distinctions vanish in Christ. If all men were really in Christ, war would disappear.</p>
<p><b>Brake down the middle wall of partition </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μεσοτοιχον του φραγμου λυσας</span></span>). "Having loosened (first aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυω</span></span>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span>) the middle-wall (late word, only here in N.T., and very rare anywhere, one in papyri, and one inscription) of partition (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φραγμου</span></span>, old word, fence, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρασσω</span></span>, to fence or hedge, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:33">Matthew 21:33</span>)." In the temple courts a partition wall divided the court of the Gentiles from the court of Israel with an inscription forbidding a Gentile from going further (Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. VIII. 3, 2). See the uproar when Paul was accused of taking Trophimus beyond this wall (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:28">Acts 21:28</span>). </p>
