<p><b> Having abolished </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταργησας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταργεω</span></span>, to make null and void.</p>
<p><b>The enmity </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την εχθραν</span></span>). But it is very doubtful if <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την εχθραν</span></span> (old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχθρος</span></span>, hostile, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:12">Luke 23:12</span>) is the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταργησας</span></span>. It looks as if it is in apposition with to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεσοτοιχον</span></span> and so the further object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυσας</span></span>. The enmity between Jew and Gentile was the middle wall of partition. And then it must be decided whether "in his flesh" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη σαρκ αυτου</span></span>) should be taken with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυσας</span></span> and refer especially to the Cross (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:22">Colossians 1:22</span>) or be taken with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταργησας</span></span>. Either makes sense, but better sense with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυσας</span></span>. Certainly "the law of commandments in ordinances (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον νομον των εντολων εν δογμασιν</span></span>) is governed by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταργησας</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>That he might create </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα κτιση</span></span>). Final clause with first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτιζω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>The twain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους δυο</span></span>). The two men (masculine here, neuter in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:14">Ephesians 2:14</span>), Jew and Gentile.</p>
<p><b>One new man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ενα καινον ανθρωπον</span></span>). Into one fresh man (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:9-11">Colossians 3:9-11</span>) "in himself" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτω</span></span>). Thus alone is it possible.</p>
<p><b>Making peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιων ειρηνην</span></span>). Thus alone can it be done. Christ is the peace-maker between men, nations, races, classes. </p>
