If one is surprised that Paul should refer so to the apostles, he being one himself, Peter does the same thing (2 Peter 3:2).

The compound ακρογωνιαιος occurs only in the LXX (first in Isaiah 28:16) and in the N.T. (here, 1 Peter 2:6). Λιθος (stone) is understood. Jesus had spoken of himself as the stone, rejected by the Jewish builders (experts), but chosen of God as the head of the corner (Matthew 21:42), εις κεφαλην γωνιας. "The ακρογωνιαιος here is the primary foundation-stone at the angle of the structure by which the architect fixes a standard for the bearings of the walls and cross-walls throughout" (W. W. Lloyd).
