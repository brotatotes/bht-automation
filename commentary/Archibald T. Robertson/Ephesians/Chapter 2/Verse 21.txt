<p><b> Each several building </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασα οικοδομη</span></span>). So without article Aleph B D G K L. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Οικοδομη</span></span> is a late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεμω</span></span>, to build for building up (edification) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:29">Ephesians 4:29</span>, then for the building itself as here (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:1">Mark 13:1</span>). Ordinary Greek idiom here calls for "every building," not for "all the building" (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 772), though it is not perfectly clear what that means. Each believer is called a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναος θεου</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>). One may note the plural in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:1">Mark 13:1</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδομα</span></span>) of the various parts of the temple. Perhaps that is the idea here without precise definition of each <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδομη</span></span>. But there are examples of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πας</span></span> without the article where "all" is the idea as in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασης κτισεως</span></span> (all creation) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>.</p>
<p><b>Fitly framed together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναρμολογουμενη</span></span>). Double compound from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρμολογος</span></span> (binding, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρμος</span></span>, joint and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span>), apparently made by Paul and in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:16">Ephesians 4:16</span>. Architectural metaphor.</p>
<p><b>Into a holy temple </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ναον αγιον</span></span>). The whole structure with all the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδομα</span></span>. Another metaphor for the Kingdom of God with which compare Peter's "spiritual house" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικος πνευματικος</span></span>) in which each is a living stone being built in (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>). </p>
