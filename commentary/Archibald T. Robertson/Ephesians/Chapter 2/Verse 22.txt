<p><b> Ye also are builded together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υμεις συνοικοδομεισθε</span></span>). Ye Gentiles also. Present passive indicative (continuous process) of common old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνοικοδομεω</span></span>, to build together with others or out of varied materials as here. Only here in N.T. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span> Peter uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδομεισθε</span></span> for the same process.</p>
<p><b>For a habitation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις κατοικητηριον</span></span>). Late word (LXX), in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:2">Revelation 18:2</span>. From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατοικεω</span></span>, to dwell, as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:17">Ephesians 3:17</span>. Possibly each of us is meant here to be the "habitation of God in the Spirit" and all together growing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυξε</span></span>) "into a holy temple in the Lord," a noble conception of the brotherhood in Christ. </p>
