<p><b> We also all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ημεις παντες</span></span>). We Jews.</p>
<p><b>Once lived </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεστραφημεν ποτε</span></span>). Second aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστρεφω</span></span>, old verb, to turn back and forth, to live (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>). Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποτε περιεπατησατε</span></span>, of the Gentiles in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>The desires </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα θεληματα</span></span>). Late and rare word except in LXX and N.T., from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω</span></span>, to will, to wish. Plural here "the wishes," "the wills" of the flesh like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταις επιθυμιαις της σαρκος</span></span> just before. Gentiles had no monopoly of such sinful impulses.</p>
<p><b>Of the mind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των διανοιων</span></span>). Plural again, "of the thoughts or purposes."</p>
<p><b>Were by nature children of wrath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεθα τεκνα φυσε οργης</span></span>). This is the proper order of these words which have been the occasion of much controversy. There is no article with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνα</span></span>. Paul is insisting that Jews as well as Gentiles ("even as the rest") are the objects of God's wrath (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οργης</span></span>) because of their lives of sin. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:1-3">Romans 2:1-3</span> for the full discussion of this to Jews unpalatable truth. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσε</span></span> (associative instrumental case of manner) is but the application of Paul's use of "all" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντες</span></span>) as shown also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span>. See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσε</span></span> of Gentiles in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14">Romans 2:14</span>. The implication of original sin is here, but not in the form that God's wrath rests upon little children before they have committed acts of sin. The salvation of children dying before the age of responsibility is clearly involved in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:13">Romans 5:13</span>. </p>
