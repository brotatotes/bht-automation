<p><b> For by grace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη γαρ χαριτ</span></span>). Explanatory reason. "By the grace" already mentioned in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span> and so with the article.</p>
<p><b>Through faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια πιστεως</span></span>). This phrase he adds in repeating what he said in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span> to make it plainer. "Grace" is God's part, "faith" ours.</p>
<p><b>And that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τουτο</span></span>). Neuter, not feminine <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτη</span></span>, and so refers not to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span> (feminine) or to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις</span></span> (feminine also), but to the act of being saved by grace conditioned on faith on our part. Paul shows that salvation does not have its source (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ υμων</span></span>, out of you) in men, but from God. Besides, it is God's gift (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωρον</span></span>) and not the result of our work. </p>
