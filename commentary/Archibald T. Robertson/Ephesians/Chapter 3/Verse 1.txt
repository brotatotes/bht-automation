<p><b> For this cause </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτου χαριν</span></span>). Use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριν</span></span> (accusative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις</span></span>) as a preposition with the genitive and referring to the preceding argument about God's elective grace. It is possible that Paul started to make the prayer that comes in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:14-21">Ephesians 3:14-21</span> when he repeats <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτου χαριν</span></span>. If so, he is diverted by his own words "the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δεσμιος του Χριστου Ιησου υπερ υμων των εθνων</span></span>) to set forth in a rich paragraph (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1-13">Ephesians 3:1-13</span>) God's use of him for the Gentiles. </p>
