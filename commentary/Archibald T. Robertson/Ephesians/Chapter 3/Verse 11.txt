<p><b> According to the eternal purpose </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα προθεσιν των αιωνων</span></span>). "According to the purpose (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span>) of the ages." God's purpose runs on through the ages. "Through the ages one eternal purpose runs." </p>
