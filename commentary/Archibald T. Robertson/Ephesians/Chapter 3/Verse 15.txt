<p><b> Every family </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασα πατρια</span></span>). Old word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατρα</span></span> is the usual form) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατηρ</span></span>, descent from a common ancestor as a tribe or race. Some take it here as = <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατροτης</span></span>, fatherhood, but that is most unlikely. Paul seems to mean that all the various classes of men on earth and of angels in heaven get the name of family from God the Father of all. </p>
