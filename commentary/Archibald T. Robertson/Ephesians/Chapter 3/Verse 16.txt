 That he would grant you  (ινα δω υμιν). Sub-final clause with ινα and the second aorist active subjunctive of διδωμ, to give. There are really five petitions in this greatest of all Paul's prayers (one already in Ephesians 1:16-23), two by the infinitives after ινα δω (κραταιωθηναι, κατοικησα), two infinitives after ινα εξισχυσητε (καταλαβεσθαι, γνωνα), and the last clause ινα πληρωθητε. Nowhere does Paul sound such depths of spiritual emotion or rise to such heights of spiritual passion as here. The whole seems to be coloured with "the riches of His glory."That ye may be strengthened  (κραταιωθηνα). First aorist passive infinitive of κραταιοω, late and rare (LXX, N.T.) from κραταιος, late form from κρατος (strength). See Luke 1:80. Paul adds δυναμε (with the Spirit). Instrumental case.In the inward man  (εις τον εσω ανθρωπον). Same expression in 2 Corinthians 4:16 (in contrast with the outward εξω, man) and in Romans 7:22.
