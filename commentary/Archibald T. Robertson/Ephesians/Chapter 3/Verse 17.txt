<p><b> That Christ may dwell </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατοικησα τον Χριστον</span></span>). Another infinitive (first aorist active) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα δω</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κατοικεω</span></span> is an old verb to make one's home, to be at home. Christ (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστον</span></span> accusative of general reference) is asked to make his home in our hearts. This is the ideal, but a deal of fixing would have to be done in our hearts for Christ.</p>
<p><b>Being rooted and grounded in love </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αγαπη ερριζωμενο κα τεθεμελιωμενο</span></span>). But it is not certain whether <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αγαπη</span></span> should go with these participles or with the preceding infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατοικησα</span></span> (dwell). Besides, these two perfect passive participles (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ριζοω</span></span>, old verb, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:7">Colossians 2:7</span>, and from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμελιοω</span></span>, see also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>) are in the nominative case and are to be taken with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα εξισχυσητε</span></span> and are proleptically placed before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>. Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:18">Ephesians 3:18</span> should really begin with these participles. Paul piles up metaphors (dwelling, rooted, grounded). </p>
