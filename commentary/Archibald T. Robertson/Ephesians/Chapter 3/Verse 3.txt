<p><b> By revelation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα αποκαλυψιν</span></span>). Not essentially different from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' αποκαλυψεως</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:12">Galatians 1:12</span>). This was Paul's qualification for preaching "the mystery" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μυστηριον</span></span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:9">Ephesians 1:9</span>).</p>
<p><b>As I wrote afore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως προεγραψα</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προγραφω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:4">Romans 15:4</span>, not picture forth as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:1">Galatians 3:1</span>. But when and where? Epistolary aorist for this Epistle? That is possible. A previous and lost Epistle as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:9">1 Corinthians 5:9</span>? That also is abstractly possible. To the preceding discussion of the Gentiles? Possible and also probable.</p>
<p><b>In few words </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ολιγω</span></span>). Not = <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ ολιγου</span></span>, shortly before, but as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:28">Acts 26:28</span> "in brief space or time" = <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συντονως</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:4">Acts 24:4</span>), "briefly." </p>
