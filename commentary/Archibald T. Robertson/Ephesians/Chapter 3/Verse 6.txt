<p><b> To wit </b>. Not in the Greek. But the infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα</span></span>) clause is epexegetical and gives the content of the revelation, a common idiom in the N.T. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τα εθνη</span></span> is in the accusative of general reference. Paul is fond of compounds with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span> and here uses three of them.</p>
<p><b>Fellow-heirs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνκληρονομα</span></span>). Late and rare (Philo, inscriptions and papyri). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>.</p>
<p><b>Fellow-members of the body </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνσωμα</span></span>). First found here and only here save in later ecclesiastical writers. Preuschen argues that it is equivalent to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνδουλος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:7">Colossians 1:7</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωμα</span></span> in sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Fellow-partakers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνμετοχα</span></span>). Another late and rare word (Josephus). Only here in N.T. In one papyrus in sense of joint possessor of a house. </p>
