 And he gave  (κα αυτος εδωκεν). First aorist active indicative of διδωμ. In 1 Corinthians 12:28 Paul uses εθετο (more common verb, appointed), but here repeats εδωκεν from the quotation in verse Ephesians 4:8. There are four groups (τους μεν, τους δε three times, as the direct object of εδωκεν). The titles are in the predicate accusative (αποστολουσ, προφητασ, ποιμενας κα διδασκαλους). Each of these words occurs in 1 Corinthians 12:28 (which see for discussion) except ποιμενας (shepherds). This word ποιμην is from a root meaning to protect. Jesus said the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep (John 10:11) and called himself the Good Shepherd. In Hebrews 13:20 Christ is the Great Shepherd (cf. 1 Peter 2:25). Only here are preachers termed shepherds (Latin pastores) in the N.T. But the verb ποιμαινω, to shepherd, is employed by Jesus to Peter (John 21:16), by Peter to other ministers (1 Peter 5:2), by Paul to the elders (bishops) of Ephesus (Acts 20:28). Here Paul groups "shepherds and teachers" together. All these gifts can be found in one man, though not always. Some have only one.
