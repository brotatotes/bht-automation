<p><b> And he gave </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αυτος εδωκεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span> Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθετο</span></span> (more common verb, appointed), but here repeats <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκεν</span></span> from the quotation in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:8">Ephesians 4:8</span>. There are four groups (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους μεν</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους δε</span></span> three times, as the direct object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκεν</span></span>). The titles are in the predicate accusative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολουσ, προφητασ, ποιμενας κα διδασκαλους</span></span>). Each of these words occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span> (which see for discussion) except <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμενας</span></span> (shepherds). This word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμην</span></span> is from a root meaning to protect. Jesus said the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>) and called himself the Good Shepherd. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:20">Hebrews 13:20</span> Christ is the Great Shepherd (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:25">1 Peter 2:25</span>). Only here are preachers termed shepherds (Latin <i>pastores</i>) in the N.T. But the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμαινω</span></span>, to shepherd, is employed by Jesus to Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:16">John 21:16</span>), by Peter to other ministers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:2">1 Peter 5:2</span>), by Paul to the elders (bishops) of Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>). Here Paul groups "shepherds and teachers" together. All these gifts can be found in one man, though not always. Some have only one. </p>
