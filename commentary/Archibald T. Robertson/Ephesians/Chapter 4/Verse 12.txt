 For the perfecting  (προς τον καταρτισμον). Late and rare word (in Galen in medical sense, in papyri for house-furnishing), only here in N.T., though καταρτισις in 2 Corinthians 13:9, both from καταρτιζω, to mend (Matthew 4:21; Galatians 6:1). "For the mending (repair) of the saints."Unto the building up  (εις οικοδομην). See Ephesians 2:21. This is the ultimate goal in all these varied gifts, "building up."
