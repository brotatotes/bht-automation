<p><b> Till we all attain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεχρ καταντησωμεν ο παντες</span></span>). Temporal clause with purpose idea with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεχρ</span></span> and the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατανταω</span></span>, late verb, to come down to the goal (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:11">Philippians 3:11</span>). "The whole" including every individual. Hence the need of so many gifts.</p>
<p><b>Unto the unity of the faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την ενοτητα της πιστεως</span></span>). "Unto oneness of faith" (of trust) in Christ (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:3">Ephesians 4:3</span>) which the Gnostics were disturbing.</p>
<p><b>And of the knowledge of the Son of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα της επιγνωσεως του υιου του θεου</span></span>). Three genitives in a chain dependent also on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ενοτητα</span></span>, "the oneness of full (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι-</span></span>) knowledge of the Son of God," in opposition to the Gnostic vagaries.</p>
<p><b>Unto a full-grown man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ανδρα τελειον</span></span>). Same figure as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειος</span></span> in sense of adult as opposed to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηπιο</span></span> (infants) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Unto the measure of the stature </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις μετρον ηλικιας</span></span>). So apparently <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλικια</span></span> here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:52">Luke 2:52</span>, not age (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:21">John 9:21</span>). Boys rejoice in gaining the height of a man. But Paul adds to this idea "the fulness of Christ" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του πληρωματος του Χριστου</span></span>), like "the fulness of God" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span>. And yet some actually profess to be "perfect" with a standard like this to measure by! No pastor has finished his work when the sheep fall so far short of the goal. </p>
