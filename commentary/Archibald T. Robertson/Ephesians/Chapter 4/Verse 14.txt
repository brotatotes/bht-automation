 That we may be no longer children  (ινα μηκετ ωμεν νηπιο). Negative final clause with present subjunctive. Some Christians are quite content to remain "babes" in Christ and never cut their eye-teeth (Hebrews 5:11-14), the victims of every charlatan who comes along.Tossed to and fro  (κλυδωνιζομενο). Present passive participle of κλυδωνιζομα, late verb from κλυδων (wave, James 1:6), to be agitated by the waves, in LXX, only here in N.T. One example in Vettius Valens.Carried about  (περιφερομενο). Present passive participle of περιφερω, old verb, to carry round, whirled round "by every wind (ανεμω, instrumental case) of teaching." In some it is all wind, even like a hurricane or a tornado. If not anchored by full knowledge of Christ, folks are at the mercy of these squalls.By the sleight  (εν τη κυβια). "In the deceit," "in the throw of the dice" (κυβια, from κυβος, cube), sometimes cheating.In craftiness  (εν πανουργια). Old word from πανουργος (παν, εργον, any deed, every deed), cleverness, trickiness.After the wiles of error  (προς την μεθοδιαν της πλανης). Μεθοδια is from μεθοδευω (μετα, οδος) to follow after or up, to practise deceit, and occurs nowhere else (Ephesians 4:13; Ephesians 6:11) save in late papyri in the sense of method. The word πλανης (wandering like our "planet") adds to the evil idea in the word. Paul has covered the whole ground in this picture of Gnostic error.
