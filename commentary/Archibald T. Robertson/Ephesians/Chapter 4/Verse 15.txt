<p><b> In love </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αγαπη</span></span>). If truth were always spoken only in love!</p>
<p><b>May grow into him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυξησωμεν εις αυτον</span></span>). Supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and then note the final use of the first aorist active subjunctive. It is the metaphor of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span> (the full-grown man). We are the body and Christ is the Head. We are to grow up to his stature. </p>
