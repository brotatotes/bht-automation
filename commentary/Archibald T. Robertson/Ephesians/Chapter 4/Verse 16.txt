<p><b> From which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ ου</span></span>). Out of which as the source of energy and direction.</p>
<p><b>Fitly framed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναρμολογουμενον</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:21">Ephesians 2:21</span> for this verb.</p>
<p><b>Through that which every joint supplieth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια πασης αφης της επιχορηγιας</span></span>). Literally, "through every joint of the supply." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:19">Colossians 2:19</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφη</span></span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:19">Philippians 1:19</span> for the late word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιχορηγια</span></span> (only two examples in N.T.) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιχορηγεω</span></span>, to supply (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:19">Colossians 2:19</span>).</p>
<p><b>In due measure </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν μετρω</span></span>). Just "in measure" in the Greek, but the assumption is that each part of the body functions properly in its own sphere.</p>
<p><b>Unto the building up of itself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις οικοδομην εαυτου</span></span>). Modern knowledge of cell life in the human body greatly strengthens the force of Paul's metaphor. This is the way the body grows by cooperation under the control of the head and all "in love" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αγαπη</span></span>). </p>
