<p><b> If so be that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε γε</span></span>). "If indeed." Condition of first class with aorist indicatives here, assumed to be true (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσατε κα εδιδαχθητε</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Even as truth is in Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως εστιν αληθεια εν τω Ιησου</span></span>). It is not clear what Paul's precise idea is here. The Cerinthian Gnostics did distinguish between the man Jesus and the aeon Christ. Paul here identifies Christ (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:20">Ephesians 4:20</span>) and Jesus (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:21">Ephesians 4:21</span>). At any rate he flatly affirms that there is "truth in Jesus" which is in direct opposition to the heathen manner of life and which is further explained by the epexegetical infinitives that follow (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποθεσθαι, ανανεουσθα δε, κα ενδυσασθα</span></span>). </p>
