 That ye be renewed  (ανανεουσθα). Present passive infinitive (epexegetical, like αποθεσθα, of αληθεια εν τω Ιησου) and to be compared with ανακαινουμενον in Colossians 3:10. It is an old verb, ανανεοω, to make new (young) again; though only here in N.T.The spirit  (τω πνευματ). Not the Holy Spirit, but the human spirit.
