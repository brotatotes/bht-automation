 Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God  (μη λυπειτε το πνευμα το αγιον του θεου). "Cease grieving" or "do not have the habit of grieving." Who of us has not sometimes grieved the Holy Spirit?In whom  (εν ω). Not "in which."Ye were sealed  (εσφραγισθητε). See Ephesians 1:13 for this verb, and Ephesians 1:14 for απολυτρωσεως, the day when final redemption is realized.
