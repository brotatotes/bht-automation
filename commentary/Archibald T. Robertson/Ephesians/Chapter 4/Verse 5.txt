<p><b> One Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Κυριος</span></span>). The Lord Jesus Christ and he alone (no series of aeons).</p>
<p><b>One faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μια πιστις</span></span>). One act of trust in Christ, the same for all (Jew or Gentile), one way of being saved.</p>
<p><b>One baptism </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν βαπτισμα</span></span>). The result of baptizing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισμα</span></span>), while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισμος</span></span> is the act. Only in the N.T. (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισμος</span></span> in Josephus) and ecclesiastical writers naturally. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:38">Mark 10:38</span>. There is only one act of baptism for all (Jews and Gentiles) who confess Christ by means of this symbol, not that they are made disciples by this one act, but merely so profess him, put Christ on publicly by this ordinance. </p>
