<p><b> One God and Father of all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις θεος κα πατηρ παντων</span></span>). Not a separate God for each nation or religion. One God for all men. See here the Trinity again (Father, Jesus, Holy Spirit).</p>
<p><b>Who is over all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο επ παντων</span></span>),</p>
<p><b>and through all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα δια παντων</span></span>),</p>
<p><b>and in all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εν πασιν</span></span>). Thus by three prepositions (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι, δια, εν</span></span>) Paul has endeavoured to express the universal sweep and power of God in men's lives. The pronouns (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντων, παντων, πασιν</span></span>) can be all masculine, all neuter, or part one or the other. The last "in all" is certainly masculine and probably all are. </p>
