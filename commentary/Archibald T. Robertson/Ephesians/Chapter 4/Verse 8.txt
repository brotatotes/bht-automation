<p><b> Wherefore he saith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διο λεγε</span></span>). As a confirmation of what Paul has said. No subject is expressed in the Greek and commentators argue whether it should be <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος</span></span> (God) or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η γραφη</span></span> (Scripture). But it comes to God after all. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span>. The quotation is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:18">Psalms 68:18</span>, a Messianic Psalm of victory which Paul adapts and interprets for Christ's triumph over death.</p>
<p><b>He led captivity captive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηιχμαλωτευσεν αιχμαλωσιαν</span></span>). Cognate accusative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιχμαλωσιαν</span></span>, late word, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:10">Revelation 13:10</span>. The verb also (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιχμαλωτευω</span></span>) is from the old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιχμαλωτος</span></span>, captive in war (in N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:18">Luke 4:18</span>), in LXX and only here in N.T. </p>
