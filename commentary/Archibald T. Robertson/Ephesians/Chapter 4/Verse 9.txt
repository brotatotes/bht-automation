<p><b> Now this </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το δε</span></span>). Paul picks out the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβας</span></span> (second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινω</span></span>, to go up), changes its form to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεβη</span></span> (second aorist indicative), and points the article (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το</span></span>) at it. Then he concludes that it implied a previous <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβας</span></span> (coming down).</p>
<p><b>Into the lower parts of the earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τα κατωτερα της γης</span></span>). If the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβας</span></span> is the Ascension of Christ, then the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβας</span></span> would be the Descent (Incarnation) to earth and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της γης</span></span> would be the genitive of apposition. What follows in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:10">Ephesians 4:10</span> argues for this view. Otherwise one must think of the death of Christ (the descent into Hades of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:31">Acts 2:31</span>). </p>
