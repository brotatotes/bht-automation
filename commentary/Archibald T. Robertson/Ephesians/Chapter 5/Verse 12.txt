<p><b> In secret </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρυφη</span></span>). Old adverb, only here in N.T. Sin loves the dark.</p>
<p><b>Even to speak of </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα λεγειν</span></span>). And yet one must sometimes speak out, turn on the light, even if to do so is disgraceful (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αισχρον</span></span>, like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:6">1 Corinthians 11:6</span>). </p>
