 Wherefore he saith  (διο λεγε). Apparently a free adaptation of Isaiah 26:19; Isaiah 60:1. The form αναστα for αναστηθ (second person singular imperative second aorist active of ανιστημ) occurs in Acts 12:7.Shall shine  (επιφαυσε). Future active of επιφαυσκω, a form occurring in Job (Job 25:5; Job 31:26), a variation of επιφωσκω. The last line suggests the possibility that we have here the fragment of an early Christian hymn like 1 Timothy 3:16.
