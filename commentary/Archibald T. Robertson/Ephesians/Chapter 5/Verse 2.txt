<p><b> An offering and a sacrifice to God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσφοραν κα θυσιαν τω θεω</span></span>). Accusative in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτον</span></span> (himself). Christ's death was an offering to God "in our behalf" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ ημων</span></span>) not an offering to the devil (Anselm), a ransom (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυτρον</span></span>) as Christ himself said (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>), Christ's own view of his atoning death.</p>
<p><b>For an odour of a sweet smell </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις οσμην ευωδιας</span></span>). Same words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:18">Philippians 4:18</span> from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+4:31">Leviticus 4:31</span> (of the expiatory offering). Paul often presents Christ's death as a propitiation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span>. </p>
