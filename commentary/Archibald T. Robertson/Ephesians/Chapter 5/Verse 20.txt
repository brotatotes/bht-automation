<p><b> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ονοματ του Κυριου ημων Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). Jesus had told the disciples to use his name in prayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:23">John 16:23</span>).</p>
<p><b>To God, even the Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω θεω κα πατρ</span></span>). Rather, "the God and Father." </p>
