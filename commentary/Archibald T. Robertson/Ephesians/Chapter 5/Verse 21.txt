 Subjecting yourselves to one another  (υποτασσομενο αλληλοις). Present middle participle of υποτασσω, old military figure to line up under (Colossians 3:18). The construction here is rather loose, coordinate with the preceding participles of praise and prayer. It is possible to start a new paragraph here and regard υποτασσομενο as an independent participle like an imperative.
