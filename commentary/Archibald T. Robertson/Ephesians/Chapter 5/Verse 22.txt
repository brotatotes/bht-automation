<p><b> Be in subjection </b>. Not in the Greek text of B and Jerome knew of no MS. with it. K L and most MSS. have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσεσθε</span></span> like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:18">Colossians 3:18</span>, while Aleph A P have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσεσθωσαν</span></span> (let them be subject to). But the case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανδρασιν</span></span> (dative) shows that the verb is understood from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:21">Ephesians 5:21</span> if not written originally. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιδιοις</span></span> (own) is genuine here, though not in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:18">Colossians 3:18</span>.</p>
<p><b>As unto the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως τω Κυριω</span></span>). So here instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ανηκεν εν Κυριω</span></span> of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:18">Colossians 3:18</span>. </p>
