<p><b> For the husband is the head of the wife </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ανηρ εστιν κεφαλη της γυναικος</span></span>). "For a husband is head of the (his) wife." No article with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηρ</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφαλη</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>As Christ also is the head of the church </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως κα ο Χριστος κεφαλη της εκκλησιας</span></span>). No article with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφαλη</span></span>, "as also Christ is head of the church." This is the comparison, but with a tremendous difference which Paul hastens to add either in an appositional clause or as a separate sentence.</p>
<p><b>Himself the saviour of the body </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος σωτηρ του σωματος</span></span>). He means the church as the body of which Christ is head and Saviour. </p>
