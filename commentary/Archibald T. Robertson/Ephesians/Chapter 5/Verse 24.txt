<p><b> But </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span>). Perhaps, "nevertheless," in spite of the difference just noted. Once again the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσω</span></span> has to be supplied in the principal clause before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις ανδρασιν</span></span> either as indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσοντα</span></span>) or as imperative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσεσθωσαν</span></span>). </p>
