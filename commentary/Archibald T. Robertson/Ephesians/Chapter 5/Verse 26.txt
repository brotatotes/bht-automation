<p><b> That he might sanctify it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα αυτην αγιαση</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιαζω</span></span>. Jesus stated this as his longing and his prayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:17-19">John 17:17-19</span>). This was the purpose of Christ's death (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25">Ephesians 5:25</span>).</p>
<p><b>Having cleansed it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαρισας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαριζω</span></span>, to cleanse, either simultaneous action or antecedent.</p>
<p><b>By the washing of water </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω λουτρω του υδατος</span></span>). If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λουτρον</span></span> only means bath or bathing-place ( = <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λουτρον</span></span>), then <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λουτρω</span></span> is in the locative. If it can mean bathing or washing, it is in the instrumental case. The usual meaning from Homer to the papyri is the bath or bathing-place, though some examples seem to mean bathing or washing. Salmond doubts if there are any clear instances. The only other N.T. example of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λουτρον</span></span> is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5">Titus 3:5</span>. The reference here seems to be to the baptismal bath (immersion) of water, "in the bath of water." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span> for the bringing together of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απελουσασθε</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγιασθητε</span></span>. Neither there nor here does Paul mean that the cleansing or sanctification took place in the bath save in a symbolic fashion as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4-6">Romans 6:4-6</span>. Some think that Paul has also a reference to the bath of the bride before marriage. Still more difficult is the phrase "with the word" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ρηματ</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:17">John 17:17</span> Jesus connected "truth" with "sanctify." That is possible here, though it may also be connected with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαρισας</span></span> (having cleansed). Some take it to mean the baptismal formula. </p>
