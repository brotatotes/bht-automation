<p><b> Of his flesh and of his bones </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ της σαρκος αυτου κα εκ των οστεων αυτου</span></span>). These words are in the Textus Receptus (Authorized Version) supported by D G L P cursives Syriac, etc., though wanting in Aleph A B 17 Bohairic. Certainly not genuine. </p>
