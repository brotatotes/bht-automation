<p><b> For this cause </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ τουτου</span></span>). "Answering to this" = <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεκεν τουτου</span></span> of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24">Genesis 2:24</span>, in the sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span> seen in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθ' ων</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:3">Luke 12:3</span>). This whole verse is a practical quotation and application of the language to Paul's argument here. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:5">Matthew 19:5</span> Jesus quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24">Genesis 2:24</span>. It seems absurd to make Paul mean Christ here by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπος</span></span> (man) as some commentators do. </p>
