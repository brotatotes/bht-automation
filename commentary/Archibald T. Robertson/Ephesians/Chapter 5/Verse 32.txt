<p><b> This mystery is great </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μυστηριον τουτο μεγα εστιν</span></span>). For the word "mystery" see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:9">Ephesians 1:9</span>. Clearly Paul means to say that the comparison of marriage to the union of Christ and the church is the mystery. He makes that plain by the next words.</p>
<p><b>But I speak </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω δε λεγω</span></span>). "Now I mean." Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:29">1 Corinthians 7:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:50">1 Corinthians 15:50</span>.</p>
<p><b>In regard of Christ and of the church </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Χριστον κα [εισ] την εκκλησιαν</span></span>). "With reference to Christ and the church." That is all that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> here means. </p>
