 Ye know of a surety  (ιστε γινωσκοντες). The correct text has ιστε, not εστε. It is the same form for present indicative (second person plural) and imperative, probably indicative here, "ye know." But why γινωσκοντες added? Probably, "ye know recognizing by your own experience."No  (πασ--ου). Common idiom in the N.T. like the Hebrew= oudeis (Robertson, Grammar, p. 732).Covetous man  (πλεονεκτησ, πλεον εχω). Old word, in N.T. only here and 1 Corinthians 5:10; 1 Corinthians 6:10.Which is  (ο εστιν). So Aleph B. A D K L have ος (who), but ο is right. See Colossians 3:14 for this use of ο (which thing is). On ειδωλολατρης (idolater) see 1 Corinthians 5:10.In the Kingdom of Christ and God  (εν τη βασιλεια του Χριστου κα θεου). Certainly the same kingdom and Paul may here mean to affirm the deity of Christ by the use of the one article with Χριστου κα θεου. But Sharp's rule cannot be insisted on here because θεος is often definite without the article like a proper name. Paul did teach the deity of Christ and may do it here.
