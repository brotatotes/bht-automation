<p><b> Put on </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδυσασθε</span></span>). Like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:12">Ephesians 3:12</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span>.</p>
<p><b>The whole armour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την πανοπλιαν</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πανοπλος</span></span> (wholly armed, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν, οπλον</span></span>). In N.T. only <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:22">Luke 11:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11">Ephesians 6:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span>. Complete armour in this period included "shield, sword, lance, helmet, greaves, and breastplate" (Thayer). Our "panoply." Polybius gives this list of Thayer. Paul omits the lance (spear). Our museums preserve specimens of this armour as well as the medieval coat-of-mail. Paul adds girdle and shoes to the list of Polybius, not armour but necessary for the soldier. Certainly Paul could claim knowledge of the Roman soldier's armour, being chained to one for some three years.</p>
<p><b>That ye may be able to stand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς το δυνασθα υμας στηνα</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς το</span></span> and the infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνασθα</span></span>) with the accusative of general reference (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμας</span></span>) and the second aorist active infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηνα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>) dependent on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνασθα</span></span>. Against (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span>). Facing. Another instance of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> meaning "against" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:23">Colossians 2:23</span>).</p>
<p><b>The wiles of the devil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας μεθοδιας του διαβολου</span></span>). See already <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span> for this word. He is a crafty foe and knows the weak spots in the Christian's armour. </p>
