 Our wrestling is not  (ουκ εστιν ημιν η παλη). "To us the wrestling is not." Παλη is an old word from παλλω, to throw, to swing (from Homer to the papyri, though here only in N.T.), a contest between two till one hurls the other down and holds him down (κατεχω). Note προς again (five times) in sense of "against," face to face conflict to the finish.The world-rulers of this darkness  (τους κοσμοκρατορας του σκοτους τουτου). This phrase occurs here alone. In John 14:30 Satan is called "the ruler of this world" (ο αρχων του κοσμου τουτου). In 2 Corinthians 4:4 he is termed "the god of this age" (ο θεος του αιωνος τουτου). The word κοσμοκρατωρ is found in the Orphic Hymns of Satan, in Gnostic writings of the devil, in rabbinical writings (transliterated) of the angel of death, in inscriptions of the Emperor Caracalla. These "world-rulers" are limited to "this darkness" here on earth.The spiritual hosts of wickedness  (τα πνευματικα της πονηριας). No word for "hosts" in the Greek. Probably simply, "the spiritual things (or elements) of wickedness." Πονηρια (from πονηρος) is depravity (Matthew 22:18; 1 Corinthians 5:8).In the heavenly places  (εν τοις επουρανιοις). Clearly so here. Our "wrestling" is with foes of evil natural and supernatural. We sorely need "the panoply of God" (furnished by God).
