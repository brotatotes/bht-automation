<p><b> Our wrestling is not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν ημιν η παλη</span></span>). "To us the wrestling is not." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παλη</span></span> is an old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλλω</span></span>, to throw, to swing (from Homer to the papyri, though here only in N.T.), a contest between two till one hurls the other down and holds him down (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεχω</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> again (five times) in sense of "against," face to face conflict to the finish.</p>
<p><b>The world-rulers of this darkness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους κοσμοκρατορας του σκοτους τουτου</span></span>). This phrase occurs here alone. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:30">John 14:30</span> Satan is called "the ruler of this world" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αρχων του κοσμου τουτου</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span> he is termed "the god of this age" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος του αιωνος τουτου</span></span>). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοσμοκρατωρ</span></span> is found in the Orphic Hymns of Satan, in Gnostic writings of the devil, in rabbinical writings (transliterated) of the angel of death, in inscriptions of the Emperor Caracalla. These "world-rulers" are limited to "this darkness" here on earth.</p>
<p><b>The spiritual hosts of wickedness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα πνευματικα της πονηριας</span></span>). No word for "hosts" in the Greek. Probably simply, "the spiritual things (or elements) of wickedness." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πονηρια</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονηρος</span></span>) is depravity (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:18">Matthew 22:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:8">1 Corinthians 5:8</span>).</p>
<p><b>In the heavenly places </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις επουρανιοις</span></span>). Clearly so here. Our "wrestling" is with foes of evil natural and supernatural. We sorely need "the panoply of God" (furnished by God). </p>
