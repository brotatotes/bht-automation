 Stand therefore  (στητε ουν). Second aorist active imperative of ιστημ (intransitive like the others). Ingressive aorist here, "Take your stand therefore" (in view of the arguments made).Having girded your loins with truth  (περιζωσαμενο την οσφυν υμων εν αληθεια). First aorist middle participle (antecedent action) of περιζωννυω, old verb, to gird around, direct middle (gird yourselves) in Luke 12:37; but indirect here with accusative of the thing, "having girded your own loins." So ενδυσαμενο (having put on) is indirect middle participle.The breast-plate of righteousness  (τον θωρακα της δικαιοσυνης). Old word for breast and then for breastplate. Same metaphor of righteousness as breastplate in 1 Thessalonians 5:8.
