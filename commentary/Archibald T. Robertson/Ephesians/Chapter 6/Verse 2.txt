<p><b> Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητις</span></span>). "Which very" = "for such is."</p>
<p><b>The first commandment with promise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντολη πρωτη εν επαγγελια</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εν</span></span> here means "accompanied by" (Alford). But why "with a promise"? The second has a general promise, but the fifth alone (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:12">Exodus 20:12</span>) has a specific promise. Perhaps that is the idea. Some take it to be first because in the order of time it was taught first to children, but the addition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν επαγγελια</span></span> here to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτη</span></span> points to the other view. </p>
