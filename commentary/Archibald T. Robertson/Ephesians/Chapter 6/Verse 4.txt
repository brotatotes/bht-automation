<p><b> Provoke not to anger </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη παροργιζετε</span></span>). Rare compound, both N.T. examples (here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:19">Romans 10:19</span>) are quotations from the LXX. The active, as here, has a causative sense. Parallel in sense with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ερεθιζετε</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:21">Colossians 3:21</span>. Paul here touches the common sin of fathers.</p>
<p><b>In the chastening and admonition of the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν παιδεια κα νουθεσια του κυριου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εν</span></span> is the sphere in which it all takes place. There are only three examples in the N.T. of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδεια</span></span>, old Greek for training a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παις</span></span> (boy or girl) and so for the general education and culture of the child. Both papyri and inscriptions give examples of this original and wider sense (Moulton and Milligan, <i>Vocabulary</i>). It is possible, as Thayer gives it, that this is the meaning here in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:4">Ephesians 6:4</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:16">2 Timothy 3:16</span> adults are included also in the use. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:5">Hebrews 12:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:7">Hebrews 12:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:11">Hebrews 12:11</span> the narrower sense of "chastening" appears which some argue for here. At any rate <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουθεσια</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουσ, τιθημ</span></span>), common from Aristophanes on, does have the idea of correction. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:11">1 Corinthians 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:10">Titus 3:10</span>. </p>
