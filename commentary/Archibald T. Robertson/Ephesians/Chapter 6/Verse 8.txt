 Whatsoever good thing each one doeth  (εκαστος εαν τ ποιηση αγαθον). Literally, "each one if he do anything good." Condition of third class, undetermined, but with prospect. Note use here of αγαθον rather than αδικον (one doing wrong) in Colossians 3:25. So it is a reward (κομισετα) for good, not a penalty for wrong, though both are true, "whether he be bond or free" (ειτε δουλος ειτε ελευθερος).
