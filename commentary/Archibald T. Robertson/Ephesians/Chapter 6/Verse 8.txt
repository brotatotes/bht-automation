<p><b> Whatsoever good thing each one doeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαστος εαν τ ποιηση αγαθον</span></span>). Literally, "each one if he do anything good." Condition of third class, undetermined, but with prospect. Note use here of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθον</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικον</span></span> (one doing wrong) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:25">Colossians 3:25</span>. So it is a reward (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κομισετα</span></span>) for good, not a penalty for wrong, though both are true, "whether he be bond or free" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειτε δουλος ειτε ελευθερος</span></span>). </p>
