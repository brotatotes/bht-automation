<p><b> Not from men, neither through men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ απ' ανθρωπων ουδε δι' ανθρωπου</span></span>). The bluntness of Paul's denial is due to the charge made by the Judaizers that Paul was not a genuine apostle because not one of the twelve. This charge had been made in Corinth and called forth the keenest irony of Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:2">Galatians 1:2</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:2">Galatians 1:2</span> Paul proves his independence of the twelve and his equality with them as recognized by them. Paul denies that his apostleship had a human source (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ απ' ανθρωπων</span></span>) and that it had come to him through (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ανθρωπου</span></span>) a human channel (Burton).</p>
<p><b>But through Jesus Christ and God the Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα δια Ιησου Χριστου κα θεου πατρος</span></span>). The call to be an apostle came to Paul through Jesus Christ as he claimed in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span> and as told in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:4-6">Acts 9:4-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:7">Acts 22:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:16">Acts 26:16</span>. He is apostle also by the will of God.</p>
<p><b>Who raised him from the dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του εγειραντος αυτον εκ νεκρων</span></span>). And therefore Paul was qualified to be an apostle since he had seen the Risen Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:8">1 Corinthians 15:8</span>). This verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγειρω</span></span> is often used in N.T. for raising from the sleep of death, to wake up the dead. </p>
