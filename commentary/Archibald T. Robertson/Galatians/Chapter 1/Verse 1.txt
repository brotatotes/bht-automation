 Not from men, neither through men  (ουκ απ' ανθρωπων ουδε δι' ανθρωπου). The bluntness of Paul's denial is due to the charge made by the Judaizers that Paul was not a genuine apostle because not one of the twelve. This charge had been made in Corinth and called forth the keenest irony of Paul (Galatians 1:2). In Galatians 1:1; Galatians 1:2 Paul proves his independence of the twelve and his equality with them as recognized by them. Paul denies that his apostleship had a human source (ουκ απ' ανθρωπων) and that it had come to him through (δι' ανθρωπου) a human channel (Burton).But through Jesus Christ and God the Father  (αλλα δια Ιησου Χριστου κα θεου πατρος). The call to be an apostle came to Paul through Jesus Christ as he claimed in 1 Corinthians 9:1 and as told in Acts 9:4-6; Acts 22:7; Acts 26:16. He is apostle also by the will of God.Who raised him from the dead  (του εγειραντος αυτον εκ νεκρων). And therefore Paul was qualified to be an apostle since he had seen the Risen Christ (1 Corinthians 9:1; 1 Corinthians 15:8). This verb εγειρω is often used in N.T. for raising from the sleep of death, to wake up the dead.
