<p><b> Which was preached </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ευαγγελισθεν</span></span>). Play on the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιον</span></span> by first aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιζω</span></span>, "the gospel which was gospelized by me."</p>
<p><b>It is not after man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν κατα ανθρωπον</span></span>). Not after a human standard and so he does not try to conform to the human ideal. Paul alone (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:3">1 Corinthians 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:8">1 Corinthians 9:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:32">1 Corinthians 15:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:15">Romans 3:15</span>) in the N.T. uses this old and common idiom. </p>
