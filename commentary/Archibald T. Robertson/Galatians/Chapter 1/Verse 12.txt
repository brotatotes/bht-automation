<p><b> Nor was I taught it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτε εδιδαχθην</span></span>). He did not receive it "from man" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα ανθρωπων</span></span>, which shuts out both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span>), whether Peter or any other apostle, nor was he taught it in the school of Gamaliel in Jerusalem or at the University of Tarsus. He "received" his gospel in one way, "through revelation of Jesus Christ" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' αποκαλυψεως Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). He used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρελαβον</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span> about the reception of his message from Christ. It is not necessary to say that he had only one (because of the aorist active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρελαβον</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαμβανω</span></span>, for it can very well be constative aorist) revelation (unveiling) from Christ. In fact, we know that he had numerous visions of Christ and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23">1 Corinthians 11:23</span> he expressly says concerning the origin of the Lord's Supper: "I received (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρελαβον</span></span>, again) from the Lord." The Lord Jesus revealed his will to Paul. </p>
