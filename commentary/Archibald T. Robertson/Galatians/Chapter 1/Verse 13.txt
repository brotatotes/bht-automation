<p><b> My manner of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την εμην αναστροφην</span></span>). Late word in this sense from Polybius on from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστρεφομα</span></span>. In the older writers it meant literally "return" or "turning back." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:15">1 Peter 1:15</span>. It is absent in this sense in the papyri though the verb is common.</p>
<p><b>In the Jews' religion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω Ιουδαισμω</span></span>). "In Judaism." The word in N.T. only here and next verse, already in II Macc. 2:21; 8:1; 14:38; IV Macc. 4:26. In these passages it means the Jewish religion as opposed to the Hellenism that the Syrian Kings were imposing upon the Jews. So later Justin Martyr (386 D) will use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστιανισμος</span></span> for Christianity. Both words are made from verbs in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ιζω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Beyond measure </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθ' υπερβολην</span></span>). "According to excess" (throwing beyond, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερβολη</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>I persecuted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιωκον</span></span>). Imperfect active, "I used to persecute" (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7-9">Galatians 1:7-9</span> for the facts).</p>
<p><b>Made havock of it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επορθουν αυτην</span></span>). Customary action again, imperfect of old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορθεω</span></span>, to lay waste, to sack. In N.T. only here, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:23">Galatians 1:23</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:31">Acts 9:31</span> (used by Christians in Damascus of Saul after his conversion of his former conduct, the very word of Paul here). Paul heard them use it of him and it stuck in his mind. </p>
