<p><b> It was the good pleasure of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδοκησεν ο θεος</span></span>). Paul had no doubt about God's purpose in him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:8">1 Thessalonians 2:8</span>).</p>
<p><b>Who separated me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αφορισας με</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αφοριζω</span></span> is old word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορος</span></span>) to mark off from a boundary or line. The Pharisees were the separatists who held themselves off from others. Paul conceives himself as a spiritual Pharisee "separated unto the gospel of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>, the same word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφωρισμενος</span></span>). Before his birth God had his plans for him and called him. </p>
