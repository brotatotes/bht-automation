<p><b> To reveal his Son in me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαλυψα τον υιον αυτου εν εμο</span></span>). By "in me" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εμο</span></span>) Paul can mean to lay emphasis on his inward experience of grace or he may refer objectively to the vision of Christ on the way to Damascus, "in my case." Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εμο</span></span> in this sense (in my case) several times (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:24">Galatians 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:3">2 Corinthians 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:30">Philippians 1:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:16">1 Timothy 1:16</span>). Once (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:11">1 Corinthians 14:11</span>) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εμο</span></span> is almost equivalent to the dative (to me). On the whole Lightfoot seems correct here in taking it to mean "in my case," though the following words suit either idea. Certainly Paul could not preach Christ among the Gentiles without the rich inward experience and in the objective vision he was called to that task.</p>
<p><b>I conferred not with flesh and blood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου προσανεθεμην σαρκ κα αιματ</span></span>). Second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσανατιθημ</span></span>, old verb, double compound (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσ, ανα</span></span>), to lay upon oneself in addition, to betake oneself to another, to confer with, dative case as here. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:6">Galatians 2:6</span>. </p>
