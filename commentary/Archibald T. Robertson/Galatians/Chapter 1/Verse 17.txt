 Before me  (προ εμου). The Jerusalem apostles were genuine apostles, but so is Paul. His call did not come from them nor did he receive confirmation by them.Into Arabia  (εις Αραβιαν). This visit to Arabia has to come between the two visits to Damascus which are not distinguished in Acts 9:22. In verse Galatians 1:23 Luke does speak of "considerable days" and so we must place the visit to Arabia between verses Galatians 1:22; Galatians 1:23.
