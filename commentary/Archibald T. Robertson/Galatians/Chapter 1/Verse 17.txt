<p><b> Before me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ εμου</span></span>). The Jerusalem apostles were genuine apostles, but so is Paul. His call did not come from them nor did he receive confirmation by them.</p>
<p><b>Into Arabia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Αραβιαν</span></span>). This visit to Arabia has to come between the two visits to Damascus which are not distinguished in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:22">Acts 9:22</span>. In verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:23">Galatians 1:23</span> Luke does speak of "considerable days" and so we must place the visit to Arabia between verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:22">Galatians 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:23">Galatians 1:23</span>. </p>
