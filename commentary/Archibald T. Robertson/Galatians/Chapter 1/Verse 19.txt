<p><b> Except James the brother of the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη Ιακωβον τον αδελφον του Κυριου</span></span>). James the son of Zebedee was still living at that time. The rest of the twelve were probably away preaching and James, brother of the Lord, is here termed an apostle, though not one of the twelve as Barnabas is later so called. Paul is showing his independence of and equality with the twelve in answer to the attacks of the Judaizers. </p>
