<p><b> All the brethren which are with me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο συν εμο παντες αδελφο</span></span>). The same phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:21">Philippians 4:21</span> in distinction from the saints in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:22">Galatians 1:22</span>. Probably the small company of travelling companions.</p>
<p><b>Unto the churches of Galatia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταις εκκλησιαις της Γαλατιας</span></span>). A circular letter therefore to all the churches in the province (both South Galatia and North Galatia if he really laboured there). </p>
