<p><b> Grace to you and peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις υμιν κα ειρηνη</span></span>). As in I Thess., II Thess., I Cor., II Cor. (already written) and in all the later Epistles save that in I and II Timothy "mercy" is added. But this customary salutation (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span>) is not a perfunctory thing with Paul. He uses it here even when he has so much fault to find just as he did in I and II Corinthians. </p>
