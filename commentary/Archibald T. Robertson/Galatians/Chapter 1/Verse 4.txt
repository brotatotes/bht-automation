 For our sins  (υπερ των αμαρτιων). Some MSS. have περ (concerning). In the Koine this use of υπερ as like περ has come to be common. He refers to the death of Christ (cf. 1 Corinthians 15:3; Galatians 2:20; Romans 5:6). As a rule περ occurs of things, υπερ of persons.Deliver  (εξελητα). Second aorist middle subjunctive (final clause with οπως) of εξαιρεω, old verb to pluck out, to rescue (Acts 23:27). "Strikes the keynote of the epistle. The gospel is a rescue, an emancipation from a state of bondage" (Lightfoot).Out of this present evil world  (εκ του αιωνος του ενεστωτος πονηρου). Literally, "out of the age the existing one being evil." The predicate position of πονηρου calls emphatic attention to it. Each word here is of interest and has been already discussed. See on Matthew 13:22 for αιων, Matthew 6:23 for πονηρος. Ενεστωτος is genitive masculine singular of ενεστως second perfect (intransitive) participle of ενιστημ for which see on 2 Thessalonians 2:12; 1 Corinthians 3:22; 1 Corinthians 7:26. It is present as related to future (Romans 8:38; Hebrews 9:9).According to the will of God  (κατα το θελημα του θεου). Not according to any merit in us.
