<p><b> Ye are so quickly removing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως ταχεως μετατιθεσθε</span></span>). The present middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετατιθημ</span></span>, to change places, to transfer. "You are transferring yourselves" and doing it "so quickly" either from the time of their conversion or most likely from the time when the Judaizers came and tempted them. So easily some of them are falling victims to these perverters of the gospel. That is a continuous amazement (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαυμαζω</span></span>) to Paul and to men today that so many are so silly and so gullible to modern as to ancient charlatans.</p>
<p><b>Unto a different gospel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ετερον ευαγγελιον</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:4">2 Corinthians 11:4</span> for distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλο</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερον</span></span> as here. It is not here or there a mere difference in emphasis or spirit as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:18">Philippians 1:18</span> so long as Christ is preached. These men as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:4">2 Corinthians 11:4</span> preach "another Jesus" and a "different gospel" and so have fallen away from grace and have done away with Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:4">Galatians 5:4</span>). Hence the vehemence of Paul's words. </p>
