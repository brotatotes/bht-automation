<p><b> Which is not another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ουκ εστιν αλλο</span></span>). It is no "gospel" (good news) at all, but a yoke of bondage to the law and the abolition of grace. There is but one gospel and that is of grace, not works. The relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> (which) refers to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερον ευαγγελιον</span></span> (a different gospel) "taken as a single term and designating the erroneous teachings of the Judaizers" (Burton).</p>
<p><b>Only </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη</span></span>). Literally, "except," that is, "Except in this sense," "in that it is an attempt to pervert the one true gospel" (Lightfoot).</p>
<p><b>Who disturb you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ταρασσοντες</span></span>). The disturbers. This very verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταρασσω</span></span> is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:8">Acts 17:8</span> of the Jews in Thessalonica who "disturbed" the politarchs and the people about Paul.</p>
<p><b>Would pervert </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελοντες μεταστρεψα</span></span>). "Wish to turn about," change completely as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:20">Acts 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:9">James 4:9</span>. The very existence of the gospel of Christ was at stake. </p>
