<p><b> So say I now again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αρτ παλιν λεγω</span></span>). Paul knows that he has just made what some will consider an extreme statement. But it is a deliberate one and not mere excitement. He will stand by it to the end. He calls down a curse on any one who proclaims a gospel to them contrary to that which they had received from him. </p>
