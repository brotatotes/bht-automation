<p><b> Only </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονον</span></span>). One item was emphasized.</p>
<p><b>We should remember </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνημονευωμεν</span></span>). Present active subjunctive, "that we should keep on remembering."</p>
<p><b>Which very thing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο--αυτο τουτο</span></span>). Repetition of relative and demonstrative, tautology, "which this very thing." In fact Barnabas and Saul had done it before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>). It was complete victory for Paul and Barnabas. Paul passes by the second public meeting and the letters to Antioch (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:6-29">Acts 15:6-29</span>) and passes on to Peter's conduct in Antioch. </p>
