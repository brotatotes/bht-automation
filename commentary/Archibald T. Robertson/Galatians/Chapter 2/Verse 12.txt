<p><b> For before that certain came from James </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ του γαρ ελθειν τινας απο Ιακωβου</span></span>). The reason (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>) for Paul's condemnation of Peter. Articular infinitive in the genitive after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ</span></span> with the accusative of general reference (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινας</span></span>), "for before the coming as to some from James." Does Paul mean to say that these "certain" ones had been sent by James to Antioch to inspect the conduct of Peter and the other Jewish brethren? Some scholars think so. No doubt these brethren let the idea get out that they were emissaries "from James." But that idea is inconsistent with the position of James as president of the conference and the author of the resolution securing liberty to the Gentile Christians. No doubt these brethren threatened Peter to tell James and the church about his conduct and they reminded Peter of his previous arraignment before the Jerusalem Church on this very charge (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1-18">Acts 11:1-18</span>). As a matter of fact the Jerusalem Conference did not discuss the matter of social relations between Jews and Gentiles though that was the charge made against Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1">Acts 11:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>He did eat with the Gentiles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα των εθνων συνησθιεν</span></span>). It was his habit (imperfect tense).</p>
<p><b>He drew back </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεστελλεν</span></span>). Imperfect tense, inchoative action, "he began to draw himself (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτον</span></span>) back." Old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποστελλω</span></span>. See middle voice to dissemble (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:20">Acts 20:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:27">Acts 20:27</span>), to shrink (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:38">Hebrews 10:38</span>).</p>
<p><b>Separated himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφωριζεν εαυτον</span></span>). Inchoative imperfect again, "began to separate himself" just like a Pharisee (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:15">Galatians 1:15</span>) and as if afraid of the Judaizers in the Jerusalem Church, perhaps half afraid that James might not endorse what he had been doing.</p>
<p><b>Fearing them that were of the circumcision </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβουμενος τους εκ περιτομης</span></span>). This was the real reason for Peter's cowardice. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:2">Acts 11:2</span> for "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εκ περιτομης</span></span>" (they of the circumcision), the very phrase here. It was not that Peter had changed his views from the Jerusalem resolutions. It was pure fear of trouble to himself as in the denials at the trial of Christ. </p>
