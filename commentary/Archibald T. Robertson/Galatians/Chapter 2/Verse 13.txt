<p><b> Dissembled likewise with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνυπεκριθησαν αυτω κα</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of the double compound verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνυποκρινομα</span></span>, a late word often in Polybius, only here in N.T. One example in Polybius means to pretend to act a part with. That idea here would help the case of the rest of the Jews, but does not accord with Paul's presentation.</p>
<p><b>Insomuch that even Barnabas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε κα Βαρναβας</span></span>). Actual result expressed by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span> and the indicative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> clearly means "even."</p>
<p><b>Was carried away with their dissimulation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναπηχθη αυτων τη υποκρισε</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναπαγω</span></span>, old verb, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:17">2 Peter 3:17</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυποκρισε</span></span> is in the instrumental case and can only mean hypocrisy in the bad sense (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:28">Matthew 23:28</span>), not merely acting a part. It was a solemn moment when Paul saw the Jerusalem victory vanish and even Barnabas desert him as they followed the timid cowardice of Peter. It was <i>Paulus contra mundum</i> in the cause of spiritual freedom in Christ. </p>
