 But when I saw  (Αλλ' οτε ειδον). Paul did see and saw it in time to speak.That they walked not uprightly  (οτ ορθοποδουσιν). Present active indicative retained in indirect discourse, "they are not walking straight." Ορθοποδεω (ορθος, straight, πους, foot). Found only here and in later ecclesiastical writers, though ορθοποδες βαινοντες does occur.According to the truth of the gospel  (προς την αληθειαν του ευαγγελιου). Just as in Galatians 2:5. Paul brought them to face (προς) that.I said unto Cephas before them all  (ειπον τω Κηφα εμπροσθεν παντων).Being a Jew  (Ιουδαιος υπαρχων, though being a Jew). Condition of first class, assumed as true. It was not a private quarrel, but a matter of public policy. One is a bit curious to know what those who consider Peter the first pope will do with this open rebuke by Paul, who was in no sense afraid of Peter or of all the rest.As do the Gentiles  (εθνικως). Late adverb, here only in N.T. Like Gentiles.As do the Jews  (Ιουδαικως). Only here in N.T., but in Josephus.To live as do the Jews  (Ιουδαιζειν). Late verb, only here in the N.T. From Ιουδαιος, Jew. Really Paul charges Peter with trying to compel (conative present, αναγκαζεις) the Gentiles to live all like Jews, to Judaize the Gentile Christians, the very point at issue in the Jerusalem Conference when Peter so loyally supported Paul. It was a bold thrust that allowed no reply. But Paul won Peter back and Barnabas also. If II Peter is genuine, as is still possible, he shows it in 2 Peter 3:15. Paul and Barnabas remained friends (Acts 15:39; 1 Corinthians 9:6), though they soon separated over John Mark.
