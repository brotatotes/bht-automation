<p><b> But when I saw </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αλλ' οτε ειδον</span></span>). Paul did see and saw it in time to speak.</p>
<p><b>That they walked not uprightly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ορθοποδουσιν</span></span>). Present active indicative retained in indirect discourse, "they are not walking straight." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ορθοποδεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορθος</span></span>, straight, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πους</span></span>, foot). Found only here and in later ecclesiastical writers, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορθοποδες βαινοντες</span></span> does occur.</p>
<p><b>According to the truth of the gospel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς την αληθειαν του ευαγγελιου</span></span>). Just as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:5">Galatians 2:5</span>. Paul brought them to face (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span>) that.</p>
<p><b>I said unto Cephas before them all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον τω Κηφα εμπροσθεν παντων</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Being a Jew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιουδαιος υπαρχων</span></span>, though being a Jew). Condition of first class, assumed as true. It was not a private quarrel, but a matter of public policy. One is a bit curious to know what those who consider Peter the first pope will do with this open rebuke by Paul, who was in no sense afraid of Peter or of all the rest.</p>
<p><b>As do the Gentiles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνικως</span></span>). Late adverb, here only in N.T. Like Gentiles.</p>
<p><b>As do the Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιουδαικως</span></span>). Only here in N.T., but in Josephus.</p>
<p><b>To live as do the Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιουδαιζειν</span></span>). Late verb, only here in the N.T. From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιουδαιος</span></span>, Jew. Really Paul charges Peter with trying to compel (conative present, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγκαζεις</span></span>) the Gentiles to live all like Jews, to Judaize the Gentile Christians, the very point at issue in the Jerusalem Conference when Peter so loyally supported Paul. It was a bold thrust that allowed no reply. But Paul won Peter back and Barnabas also. If II Peter is genuine, as is still possible, he shows it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:15">2 Peter 3:15</span>. Paul and Barnabas remained friends (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:39">Acts 15:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:6">1 Corinthians 9:6</span>), though they soon separated over John Mark. </p>
