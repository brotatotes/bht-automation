<p><b> Not sinners of the Gentiles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εξ εθνων αμαρτωλο</span></span>). The Jews regarded all Gentiles as "sinners" in contrast with themselves (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:45">Matthew 26:45</span> "sinners" and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:32">Luke 18:32</span> "Gentiles"). It is not clear whether verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:15-21">Galatians 2:15-21</span> were spoken by Paul to Peter or whether Paul is now simply addressing the Galatians in the light of the controversy with Peter. Burton thinks that he is "mentally addressing Peter, if not quoting from what he said to him." </p>
