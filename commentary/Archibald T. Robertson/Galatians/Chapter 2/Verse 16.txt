 Is not justified  (ου δικαιουτα). Present passive indicative of δικαιοω, an old causative verb from δικαιος, righteous (from δικε, right), to make righteous, to declare righteous. It is made like αξιοω, to deem worthy, and κοινοω, to consider common. It is one of the great Pauline words along with δικαιοσυνη, righteousness. The two ways of getting right with God are here set forth: by faith in Christ Jesus (objective genitive), by the works of the law (by keeping all the law in the most minute fashion, the way of the Pharisees). Paul knew them both (see Galatians 2:7). In his first recorded sermon the same contrast is made that we have here (Acts 13:39) with the same word δικαιοω, employed. It is the heart of his message in all his Epistles. The terms faith (πιστις), righteousness (δικαιοσυνη), law (νομος), works (εργα) occur more frequently in Galatians and Romans because Paul is dealing directly with the problem in opposition to the Judaizers who contended that Gentiles had to become Jews to be saved. The whole issue is here in an acute form.Save  (εαν μη). Except.Even we  (κα ημεις). We Jews believed, had to believe, were not saved or justified till we did believe. This very point Peter had made at the Jerusalem Conference (Acts 15:10). He quotes Psalms 143:2. Paul uses δικαιοσυνη in two senses (1) Justification, on the basis of what Christ has done and obtained by faith. Thus we are set right with God. Galatians 2:1-5. (2) Sanctification. Actual goodness as the result of living with and for Christ. Galatians 2:6-8. The same plan exists for Jew and Gentile.
