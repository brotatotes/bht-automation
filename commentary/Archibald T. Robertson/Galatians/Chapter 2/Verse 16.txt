<p><b> Is not justified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου δικαιουτα</span></span>). Present passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοω</span></span>, an old causative verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιος</span></span>, righteous (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικε</span></span>, right), to make righteous, to declare righteous. It is made like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιοω</span></span>, to deem worthy, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινοω</span></span>, to consider common. It is one of the great Pauline words along with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη</span></span>, righteousness. The two ways of getting right with God are here set forth: by faith in Christ Jesus (objective genitive), by the works of the law (by keeping all the law in the most minute fashion, the way of the Pharisees). Paul knew them both (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:7">Galatians 2:7</span>). In his first recorded sermon the same contrast is made that we have here (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:39">Acts 13:39</span>) with the same word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοω</span></span>, employed. It is the heart of his message in all his Epistles. The terms faith (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span>), righteousness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη</span></span>), law (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομος</span></span>), works (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργα</span></span>) occur more frequently in Galatians and Romans because Paul is dealing directly with the problem in opposition to the Judaizers who contended that Gentiles had to become Jews to be saved. The whole issue is here in an acute form.</p>
<p><b>Save </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη</span></span>). Except.</p>
<p><b>Even we </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ημεις</span></span>). We Jews believed, had to believe, were not saved or justified till we did believe. This very point Peter had made at the Jerusalem Conference (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:10">Acts 15:10</span>). He quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+143:2">Psalms 143:2</span>. Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη</span></span> in two senses (1) Justification, on the basis of what Christ has done and obtained by faith. Thus we are set right with God. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1-5">Galatians 2:1-5</span>. (2) Sanctification. Actual goodness as the result of living with and for Christ. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:6-8">Galatians 2:6-8</span>. The same plan exists for Jew and Gentile. </p>
