<p><b> We ourselves were found sinners </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρεθημεν κα αυτο αμαρτωλο</span></span>). Like the Gentiles, Jews who thought they were not sinners, when brought close to Christ, found that they were. Paul felt like the chief of sinners.</p>
<p><b>A minister of sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιας διακονος</span></span>). Objective genitive, a minister to sin. An illogical inference. We were sinners already in spite of being Jews. Christ simply revealed to us our sin.</p>
<p><b>God forbid </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη γενοιτο</span></span>). Literally, "May it not happen." Wish about the future (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the optative). </p>
