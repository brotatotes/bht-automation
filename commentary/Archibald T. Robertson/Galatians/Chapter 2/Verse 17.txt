Paul felt like the chief of sinners.A minister of sin  (αμαρτιας διακονος). Objective genitive, a minister to sin. An illogical inference. We were sinners already in spite of being Jews. Christ simply revealed to us our sin.God forbid  (μη γενοιτο). Literally, "May it not happen." Wish about the future (μη and the optative).
