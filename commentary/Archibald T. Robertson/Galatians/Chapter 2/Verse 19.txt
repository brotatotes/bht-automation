<p><b> I through the law died to the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω δια νομου νομω απεθανον</span></span>). Paradoxical, but true. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:4">Romans 7:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:6">Romans 7:6</span> for picture of how the law waked Paul up to his real death to the law through Christ. </p>
