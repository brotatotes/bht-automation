<p><b> I have been crucified with Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστω συνεσταυρωμα</span></span>). One of Paul's greatest mystical sayings. Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συσταυροω</span></span> with the associative instrumental case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστω</span></span>). Paul uses the same word in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span> for the same idea. In the Gospels it occurs of literal crucifixion about the robbers and Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:44">Matthew 27:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:32">Mark 15:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:32">John 19:32</span>). Paul died to the law and was crucified with Christ. He uses often the idea of dying with Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:24">Galatians 5:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:14">Galatians 6:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:8">Romans 6:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:20">Colossians 2:20</span>) and burial with Christ also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>No longer I </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκετ εγω</span></span>). So complete has become Paul's identification with Christ that his separate personality is merged into that of Christ. This language helps one to understand the victorious cry in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:25">Romans 7:25</span>. It is the union of the vine and the branch (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:1-6">John 15:1-6</span>).</p>
<p><b>Which is in the Son of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη του υιου του θεου</span></span>). The objective genitive, not the faith of the Son of God.</p>
<p><b>For me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ εμου</span></span>). Paul has the closest personal feeling toward Christ. "He appropriates to himself, as Chrysostom observes, the love which belongs equally to the whole world. For Christ is indeed the personal friend of each man individually" (Lightfoot). </p>
