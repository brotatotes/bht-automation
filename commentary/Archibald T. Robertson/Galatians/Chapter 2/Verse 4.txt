<p><b> But because of the false brethren privately brought in </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια δε τους παρεισακτους ψευδαδελφους</span></span>). Late verbal adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεισακτος</span></span> from the double compound verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεισαγω</span></span>, found in papyri in the sense of brought in by the side or on the sly as here. Evidently some of the Judaizers or sympathizers whom Paul had not invited had come in as often happens. Paul terms them "false brethren" like "the false apostles" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:13">2 Corinthians 11:13</span> of the Judaizers in Corinth.</p>
<p><b>Who came in privily </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιτινες παρεισηλθον</span></span>). Repetition of the charge of their slipping in unwanted (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεισερχομα</span></span>, late double compound, in Plutarch, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:20">Romans 5:20</span>).</p>
<p><b>To spy out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατασκοπησα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατασκοπεω</span></span>, old Greek verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατασκοπος</span></span>, a spy, to reconnoitre, to make a treacherous investigation.</p>
<p><b>That they might bring us into bondage </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ημας καταδουλωσουσιν</span></span>). Future active indicative of this old compound, to enslave completely (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα-</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:20">2 Corinthians 11:20</span>. Nowhere else in N.T. This was their purpose (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and future active indicative of this causative verb). It was as serious a conflict as this. Spiritual liberty or spiritual bondage, which? </p>
