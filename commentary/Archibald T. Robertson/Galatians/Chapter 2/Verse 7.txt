<p><b> But contrariwise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα τουναντιον</span></span>). But on the contrary (accusative of general reference, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το εναντιον</span></span>). So far from the three championing the cause of the Judaizers as some hoped or even the position of the compromisers in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:4">Galatians 2:4</span>, they came boldly to Paul's side after hearing the case argued in the private conference. This is the obvious interpretation rather than the view that Peter, James, and John first proposed the circumcision of Titus and afterwards surrendered to Paul's bold stand.</p>
<p><b>When they saw </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδοντες</span></span>). After seeing, after they heard our side of the matter.</p>
<p><b>That I had been intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ πεπιστευμα το ευαγγελιον της ακροβυστιας</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>, to intrust, which retains the accusative of the thing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ευαγγελιον</span></span>) in the passive voice. This clear-cut agreement between the leaders "denotes a distinction of sphere, and not a difference of type" (Lightfoot). Both divisions in the work preach the same "gospel" (not like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>, the Judaizers). It seems hardly fair to the Three to suggest that they at first championed the cause of the Judaizers in the face of Paul's strong language in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:5">Galatians 2:5</span>. </p>
