<p><b> He that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο γαρ ενεργησας Πετρω εις αποστολην της περιτομης</span></span>). Paul here definitely recognizes Peter's leadership (apostleship, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολην</span></span>, late word, already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:25">Acts 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:2">1 Corinthians 9:2</span>) to the Jews and asserts that Peter acknowledges his apostleship to the Gentiles. This is a complete answer to the Judaizers who denied the genuineness of Paul's apostleship because he was not one of the twelve. </p>
