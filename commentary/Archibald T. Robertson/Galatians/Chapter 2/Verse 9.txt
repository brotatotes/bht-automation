<p><b> They who were reputed to be pillars </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δοκουντες στυλο εινα</span></span>). They had that reputation (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκουντες</span></span>) and Paul accepts them as such. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Στυλο</span></span>, old word for pillars, columns, as of fire (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:1">Revelation 10:1</span>). So of the church (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span>). These were the Pillar Apostles.</p>
<p><b>Gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεξιας εδωκαν εμο κα Βαρναβα κοινωνιας</span></span>). Dramatic and concluding act of the pact for cooperation and coordinate, independent spheres of activity. The compromisers and the Judaizers were brushed to one side when these five men shook hands as equals in the work of Christ's Kingdom. </p>
