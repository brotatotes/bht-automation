<p><b> Who did bewitch you? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις υμας εβασκανεν?</span></span>). Somebody "fascinated" you. Some aggressive Judaizer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:7">Galatians 5:7</span>), some one man (or woman). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασκαινω</span></span>, old word kin to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φασκω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασκω</span></span>), to speak, then to bring evil on one by feigned praise or the evil eye (hoodoo), to lead astray by evil arts. Only here in the N.T. This popular belief in the evil eye is old (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+28:54">Deuteronomy 28:54</span>) and persistent. The papyri give several examples of the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αβασκαντα</span></span>, the adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αβασκαντως</span></span> (unharmed by the evil eye), the substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασκανια</span></span> (witchcraft).</p>
<p><b>Before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οις κατ' οφθαλμους Ιησους Χριστος προεγραφη εσταυρωμενος</span></span>). Literally, "to whom before your very eyes Jesus Christ was portrayed as crucified." Second aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προγραφω</span></span>, old verb to write beforehand, to set forth by public proclamation, to placard, to post up. This last idea is found in several papyri (Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>) as in the case of a father who posted a proclamation that he would no longer be responsible for his son's debts. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γραφω</span></span> was sometimes used in the sense of painting, but no example of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προγραφω</span></span> with this meaning has been found unless this is one. With that idea it would be to portray, to picture forth, a rendering not very different from placarding. The foolish Galatians were without excuse when they fell under the spell of the Judaizer. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εσταυρωμενος</span></span> is perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταυροω</span></span>, the common verb to crucify (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταυρος</span></span>, stake, cross), to put on the cross (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:19">Matthew 20:19</span>), same form as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:2">1 Corinthians 2:2</span>. </p>
