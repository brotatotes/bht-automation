<p><b> Redeemed us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημας εξηγορασεν</span></span>). First aorist active of the compound verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαγοραζω</span></span> (Polybius, Plutarch, Diodorus), to buy from, to buy back, to ransom. The simple verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγοραζω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:20">1 Corinthians 6:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:23">1 Corinthians 7:23</span>) is used in an inscription for the purchase of slaves in a will (Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 324). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:5">Galatians 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:5">Colossians 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:16">Ephesians 5:16</span>. Christ purchased us</p>
<p><b>from the curse of the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ της καταρας του νομου</span></span>). "Out from (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> repeated) under (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:10">Galatians 3:10</span>) the curse of the law."</p>
<p><b>Having become a curse for us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενος υπερ ημων καταρα</span></span>). Here the graphic picture is completed. We were under (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο</span></span>) a curse, Christ became a curse</p>
<p><b>over </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span>) us and so between us and the overhanging curse which fell on him instead of on us. Thus he bought us out (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>) and we are free from the curse which he took on himself. This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> for substitution is common in the papyri and in ancient Greek as in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:50">John 11:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:14">2 Corinthians 5:14</span>).</p>
<p><b>That hangeth on a tree </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κρεμαμενος επ ξυλου</span></span>). Quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+21:23">Deuteronomy 21:23</span> with the omission of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο θεου</span></span> (by God). Since Christ was not cursed by God. The allusion was to exposure of dead bodies on stakes or crosses (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jos+10:26">Joshua 10:26</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ξυλον</span></span> means wood, not usually tree, though so in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:31">Luke 23:31</span> and in later Greek. It was used of gallows, crosses, etc. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:30">Acts 5:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:39">Acts 10:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:24">1 Peter 2:24</span>. On the present middle participle from the old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρεμαννυμ</span></span>, to hang, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:6">Matthew 18:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:30">Acts 5:30</span>. </p>
