 Redeemed us  (ημας εξηγορασεν). First aorist active of the compound verb εξαγοραζω (Polybius, Plutarch, Diodorus), to buy from, to buy back, to ransom. The simple verb αγοραζω (1 Corinthians 6:20; 1 Corinthians 7:23) is used in an inscription for the purchase of slaves in a will (Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East, p. 324). See also Galatians 4:5; Colossians 4:5; Ephesians 5:16. Christ purchased usfrom the curse of the law  (εκ της καταρας του νομου). "Out from (εκ repeated) under (υπο in verse Galatians 3:10) the curse of the law."Having become a curse for us  (γενομενος υπερ ημων καταρα). Here the graphic picture is completed. We were under (υπο) a curse, Christ became a curseover  (υπερ) us and so between us and the overhanging curse which fell on him instead of on us. Thus he bought us out (εκ) and we are free from the curse which he took on himself. This use of υπερ for substitution is common in the papyri and in ancient Greek as in the N.T. (John 11:50; 2 Corinthians 5:14).That hangeth on a tree  (ο κρεμαμενος επ ξυλου). Quotation from Deuteronomy 21:23 with the omission of υπο θεου (by God). Since Christ was not cursed by God. The allusion was to exposure of dead bodies on stakes or crosses (Joshua 10:26). Ξυλον means wood, not usually tree, though so in Luke 23:31 and in later Greek. It was used of gallows, crosses, etc. See Acts 5:30; Acts 10:39; 1 Peter 2:24. On the present middle participle from the old verb κρεμαννυμ, to hang, see on Matthew 18:6; Acts 5:30.
