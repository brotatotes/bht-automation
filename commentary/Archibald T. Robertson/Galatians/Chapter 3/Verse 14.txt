<p><b> That upon the Gentiles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα εις τα εθνη</span></span>). Final clause (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενητα</span></span>, aorist middle subjunctive).</p>
<p><b>That we might receive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα λαβωμεν</span></span>). Second final clause coordinate with the first as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:3">2 Corinthians 9:3</span>. So in Christ we all (Gentile and Jew) obtain the promise of blessing made to Abraham, through faith. </p>
