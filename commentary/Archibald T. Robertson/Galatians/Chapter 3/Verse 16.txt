<p><b> But as of one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ως εφ' ενος</span></span>). But as in the case of one.</p>
<p><b>Which is Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος εστιν Χριστος</span></span>). Masculine relative agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος</span></span> though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπερμα</span></span> is neuter. But the promise to Abraham uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπερμα</span></span> as a collective substantive and applies to all believers (both Jews and Gentiles) as Paul has shown in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7-14">Galatians 3:7-14</span>, and as of course he knew full well Here Paul uses a rabbinical refinement which is yet intelligible. The people of Israel were a type of the Messiah and he gathers up the promise in its special application to Christ. He does not say that Christ is specifically referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+13:15">Genesis 13:15</span> or <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+17:7">Galatians 17:7</span>. </p>
