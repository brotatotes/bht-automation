<p><b> Now this I say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο δε λεγω</span></span>). Now I mean this. He comes back to his main point and is not carried afield by the special application of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπερμα</span></span> to Christ.</p>
<p><b>Confirmed beforehand by God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκεκυρωμενην υπο του θεου</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκυροω</span></span>, in Byzantine writers and earliest use here. Nowhere else in N.T. The point is in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο του θεου</span></span> (by God) and in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα</span></span> (after) as Burton shows.</p>
<p><b>Four hundred and thirty years after </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα τετρακοσια κα τριακοντα ετη</span></span>). Literally, "after four hundred and thirty years." This is the date in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:40">Exodus 12:40</span> for the sojourn in Egypt (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:13">Genesis 15:13</span>). But the LXX adds words to include the time of the patriarchs in Canaan in this number of years which would cut the time in Egypt in two. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:6">Acts 7:6</span>. It is immaterial to Paul's argument which chronology is adopted except that "the longer the covenant had been in force the more impressive is his statement" (Burton).</p>
<p><b>Doth not disannul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ακυρο</span></span>). Late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακυροω</span></span>, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:6">Matthew 15:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:13">Mark 7:13</span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυρος</span></span>, authority). On <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταργησα</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:28">1 Corinthians 1:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:24">1 Corinthians 15:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:26">1 Corinthians 15:26</span>. </p>
