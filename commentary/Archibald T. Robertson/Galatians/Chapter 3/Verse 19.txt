<p><b> What then is the law? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ουν ο νομοσ?</span></span>). Or, why then the law? A pertinent question if the Abrahamic promise antedates it and holds on afterwards.</p>
<p><b>It was added because of transgressions </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των παραβασεων χαριν προσετεθη</span></span>). First aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προστιθημ</span></span>, old verb to add to. It is only in apparent contradiction to verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:15">Galatians 3:15</span>, because in Paul's mind the law is no part of the covenant, but a thing apart "in no way modifying its provisions" (Burton). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χαριν</span></span> is the adverbial accusative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις</span></span> which was used as a preposition with the genitive as early as Homer, in favour of, for the sake of. Except in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:12">1 John 3:12</span> it is post-positive in the N.T. as in ancient Greek. It may be causal (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:47">Luke 7:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:12">1 John 3:12</span>) or telic (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:11">Titus 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:16">Judges 1:16</span>). It is probably also telic here, not in order to create transgressions, but rather "to make transgressions palpable" (Ellicott), "thereby pronouncing them to be from that time forward transgressions of the law" (Rendall). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παραβασις</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβαινω</span></span>, is in this sense a late word (Plutarch on), originally a slight deviation, then a wilful disregarding of known regulations or prohibitions as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:23">Romans 2:23</span>.</p>
<p><b>Till the seed should come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρις αν ελθη το σπερμα</span></span>). Future time with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρις αν</span></span> and aorist subjunctive (usual construction). Christ he means by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το σπερμα</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16">Galatians 3:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>The promise hath been made </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επηγγελτα</span></span>). Probably impersonal perfect passive rather than middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαγγελλομα</span></span> as in II Macc. 4:27.</p>
<p><b>Ordained through angels </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαταγεις δι' αγγελων</span></span>). Second aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διατασσω</span></span> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:1">Matthew 11:1</span>). About angels and the giving of the law see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+33:2">Deuteronomy 33:2</span> (LXX); <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:38">Acts 7:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:52">Acts 7:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span>; Josephus (<i>Ant</i>.

<p><b>By the hand of a mediator </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν χειρ μεσιτου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εν χειρ</span></span> is a manifest Aramaism or Hebraism and only here in the N.T. It is common in the LXX. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μεσιτης</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεσος</span></span> is middle or midst, is a late word (Polybius, Diodorus, Philo, Josephus) and common in the papyri in legal transactions for arbiter, surety, etc. Here of Moses, but also of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:5">1 Timothy 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:6">Hebrews 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:24">Hebrews 12:24</span>). </p>
