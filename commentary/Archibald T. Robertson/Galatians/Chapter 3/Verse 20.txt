<p><b> Is not a mediator of one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενος ουκ εστιν</span></span>). That is, a middleman comes in between two. The law is in the nature of a contract between God and the Jewish people with Moses as the mediator or middleman.</p>
<p><b>But God is one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε θεος εις εστιν</span></span>). There was no middleman between God and Abraham. He made the promise directly to Abraham. Over 400 interpretations of this verse have been made! </p>
