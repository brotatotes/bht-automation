 For ye are all sons of God  (παντες γαρ υιο θεου εστε). Both Jews and Gentiles (Galatians 3:14) and in the same way "through faith in Christ Jesus" (δια της πιστεως εν Χριστω Ιησου). There is no other way to become "sons of God" in the full ethical and spiritual sense that Paul means, not mere physical descendants of Abraham, but "sons of Abraham," "those by faith" (verse Galatians 3:7). The Jews are called by Jesus "the sons of the Kingdom" (Matthew 8:12) in privilege, but not in fact. God is the Father of all men as Creator, but the spiritual Father only of those who by faith in Christ Jesus receive "adoption" (υιοθεσια) into his family (verse Galatians 3:5; Romans 8:15; Romans 8:23). Those led by the Spirit are sons of God (Romans 8:14).
