<p><b> For ye are all sons of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντες γαρ υιο θεου εστε</span></span>). Both Jews and Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:14">Galatians 3:14</span>) and in the same way "through faith in Christ Jesus" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια της πιστεως εν Χριστω Ιησου</span></span>). There is no other way to become "sons of God" in the full ethical and spiritual sense that Paul means, not mere physical descendants of Abraham, but "sons of Abraham," "those by faith" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7">Galatians 3:7</span>). The Jews are called by Jesus "the sons of the Kingdom" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:12">Matthew 8:12</span>) in privilege, but not in fact. God is the Father of all men as Creator, but the spiritual Father only of those who by faith in Christ Jesus receive "adoption" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιοθεσια</span></span>) into his family (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:5">Galatians 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>). Those led by the Spirit are sons of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:14">Romans 8:14</span>). </p>
