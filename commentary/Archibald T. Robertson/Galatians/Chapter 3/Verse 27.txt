 Were baptized into Christ  (εις Χριστον εβαπτισθητε). First aorist passive indicative of βαπτιζω. Better, "were baptized unto Christ" in reference to Christ.Did put on Christ  (Χριστον ενεδυσασθε). First aorist middle indicative of ενδυω (-νω). As a badge or uniform of service like that of the soldier. This verb is common in the sense of putting on garments (literally and metaphorically as here). See further in Paul (Romans 13:14; Colossians 3:9; Ephesians 4:22-24; Ephesians 6:11; Ephesians 6:14). In 1 Thessalonians 5:8 Paul speaks of "putting on the breastplate of righteousness." He does not here mean that one enters into Christ and so is saved by means of baptism after the teaching of the mystery religions, but just the opposite. We are justified by faith in Christ, not by circumcision or by baptism. But baptism was the public profession and pledge, the soldier's sacramentum, oath of fealty to Christ, taking one's stand with Christ, the symbolic picture of the change wrought by faith already (Romans 6:4-6).
