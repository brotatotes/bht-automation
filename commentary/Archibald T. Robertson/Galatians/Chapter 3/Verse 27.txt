<p><b> Were baptized into Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Χριστον εβαπτισθητε</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτιζω</span></span>. Better, "were baptized unto Christ" in reference to Christ.</p>
<p><b>Did put on Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστον ενεδυσασθε</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδυω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-νω</span></span>). As a badge or uniform of service like that of the soldier. This verb is common in the sense of putting on garments (literally and metaphorically as here). See further in Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:14">Romans 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:9">Colossians 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22-24">Ephesians 4:22-24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11">Ephesians 6:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:14">Ephesians 6:14</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:8">1 Thessalonians 5:8</span> Paul speaks of "putting on the breastplate of righteousness." He does not here mean that one enters into Christ and so is saved by means of baptism after the teaching of the mystery religions, but just the opposite. We are justified by faith in Christ, not by circumcision or by baptism. But baptism was the public profession and pledge, the soldier's <i>sacramentum</i>, oath of fealty to Christ, taking one's stand with Christ, the symbolic picture of the change wrought by faith already (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4-6">Romans 6:4-6</span>). </p>
