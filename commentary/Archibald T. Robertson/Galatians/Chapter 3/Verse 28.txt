<p><b> There can be neither </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εν</span></span>). Not a shortened form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεστ</span></span>, but the old lengthened form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> with recessive accent. So <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εν</span></span> means "there is not" rather than "there cannot be," a statement of a fact rather than a possibility, as Burton rightly shows against Lightfoot.</p>
<p><b>One man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>). No word for "man" in the Greek, and yet <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> is masculine, not neuter <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>. "One moral personality" (Vincent). The point is that "in Christ Jesus" race or national distinctions ("neither Jew nor Greek") do not exist, class differences ("neither bond nor free," no proletarianism and no capitalism) vanish, sex rivalry ("no male and female") disappears. This radical statement marks out the path along which Christianity was to come in the sphere (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>) and spirit and power of Christ. Candour compels one to confess that this goal has not yet been fully attained. But we are on the road and there is no hope on any way than on "the Jesus Road." </p>
