<p><b> If ye are Christ's </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δε υμεις Χριστου</span></span>). This is the test, not the accident of blood, pride of race or nation, habiliments or environment of dress or family, whether man or woman. Thus one comes to belong to the seed of Abraham and to be an heir according to promise. </p>
