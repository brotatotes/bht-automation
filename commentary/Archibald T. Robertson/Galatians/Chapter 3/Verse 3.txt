<p><b> Are ye now perfected in the flesh? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν σαρκ επιτελεισθε?</span></span>). Rather middle voice as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:9">1 Peter 5:9</span>, finishing of yourselves. There is a double contrast, between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εναρξαμενο</span></span> (having begun) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτελεισθε</span></span> (finishing) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:6">Philippians 1:6</span>, and also between "Spirit" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματ</span></span>) and flesh (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκ</span></span>). There is keen irony in this thrust. </p>
