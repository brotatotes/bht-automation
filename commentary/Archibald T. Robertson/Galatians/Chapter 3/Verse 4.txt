<p><b> Did ye suffer? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαθετε?</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασχω</span></span>, to experience good or ill. But alone, as here, it often means to suffer ill (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοσαυτα</span></span>, so many things).

<p><b>If it be indeed in vain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε γε κα εικη</span></span>). On <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εικη</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:2">1 Corinthians 15:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:11">Galatians 4:11</span>. Paul clings to hope about them with alternative fears. </p>
