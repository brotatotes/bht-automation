 Supplieth  (επιχορηγων). It is God. See on 2 Corinthians 9:10 for this present active participle. Cf. Philippians 1:19; 2 Peter 1:5.Worketh miracles  (ενεργων δυναμεις). On the word ενεργεω see 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Corinthians 12:6. It is a great word for God's activities (Philippians 2:13). "In you" (Lightfoot) is preferable to "among you" for εν υμιν (1 Corinthians 13:10; Matthew 14:2). The principal verb for "doeth he it" (ποιε) is not expressed. Paul repeats the contrast in verse Galatians 3:2 about "works of the law" and "the hearing of faith."
