<p><b> It was reckoned unto him for righteousness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελογισθη εις δικαιοσυνην</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογιζομα</span></span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:5">1 Corinthians 13:5</span> for this old word. He quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:6">Genesis 15:6</span> and uses it at length in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3">Romans 4:3</span> to prove that the faith of Abraham was reckoned "for" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>, good <i>Koine</i> idiom though more common in LXX because of the Hebrew) righteousness before he was circumcised. James (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:23">James 2:23</span>) quotes the same passage as proof of Abraham's obedience to God in offering up Isaac (beginning to offer him). Paul and James are discussing different episodes in the life of Abraham. Both are correct. </p>
