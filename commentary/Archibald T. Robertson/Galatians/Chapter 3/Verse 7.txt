<p><b> The same are sons of Abraham </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτο υιο εισιν Αβρααμ</span></span>). "These are." This is Paul's astounding doctrine to Jews that the real sons of Abraham are those who believe as he did, "they which be of faith" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εκ πιστεως</span></span>), a common idiom with Paul for this idea (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:9">Galatians 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:26">Romans 3:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:16">Romans 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span>), those whose spiritual sonship springs out of (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>) faith, not out of blood. John the Baptist denounced the Pharisees and Sadducees as vipers though descendants of Abraham (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:7">Luke 3:7</span>) and Jesus termed the Pharisees children of the devil and not spiritual children of Abraham (not children of God) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:37-44">John 8:37-44</span>. </p>
