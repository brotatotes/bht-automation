 Foreseeing  (προιδουσα). Second aorist active participle of προοραω. The Scripture is here personified. Alone in this sense of "sight," but common with λεγε or ειπεν (says, said) and really in verse Galatians 3:22 "hath shut up" (συνεκλεισεν).Would justify  (δικαιο). Present active indicative, "does justify."Preached the gospel beforehand  (προευηγγελισατο). First aorist middle indicative of προευαγγελιζομα with augment on α though both προ and ευ before it in composition. Only instance in N.T. It occurs in Philo. and Schol. Soph. This Scripture announced beforehand the gospel on this point of justification by faith. He quotes the promise to Abraham in Genesis 12:3; Genesis 18:18, putting παντα τα εθνη (all the nations) in Galatians 18:18 for πασα α φυλα (all the tribes) of the earth. It is a crucial passage for Paul's point, showing that the promise to Abraham included all the nations of the earth. The verb ενευλογεω (future passive here) occurs in the LXX and here only in N.T. (not Acts 3:25 in correct text).In thee  (εν σο). "As their spiritual progenitor" (Lightfoot).
