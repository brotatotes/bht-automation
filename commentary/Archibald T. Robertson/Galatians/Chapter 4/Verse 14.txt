<p><b> A temptation to you in my flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον πειρασμον υμων εν τη σαρκ μου</span></span>). "Your temptation (or trial) in my flesh." Peirasmon can be either as we see in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span>. If trial here, it was a severe one.</p>
<p><b>Nor rejected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε εξεπτυσατε</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπτυω</span></span>, old word to spit out (Homer), to spurn, to loathe. Here only in N.T. Clemen (<i>Primitive Christianity</i>, p. 342) thinks it should be taken literally here since people spat out as a prophylactic custom at the sight of invalids especially epileptics. But Plutarch uses it of mere rejection.</p>
<p><b>As an angel of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως αγγελον θεου</span></span>),</p>
<p><b>as Christ Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως Χριστον Ιησουν</span></span>). In spite of his illness and repulsive appearance, whatever it was. Not a mere "messenger" of God, but a very angel, even as Christ Jesus. We know that at Lystra Paul was at first welcomed as Hermes the god of oratory (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:12">Acts 14:12</span>). But that narrative hardly applies to these words, for they turned against Paul and Barnabas then and there at the instigation of Jews from Antioch in Pisidia and Iconium. </p>
