 That gratulation of yourselves  (ο μακαρισμος υμων). "Your felicitation." Rare word from μακαριζω, to pronounce happy, in Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch. See also Romans 4:6; Romans 4:9. You no longer felicitate yourselves on my presence with you.Ye would have plucked out your eves and given them to me  (τους οφθαλμους υμων εξορυξαντες εδωκατε μο). This is the conclusion of a condition of the second class without αν expressed which would have made it clearer. But see John 16:22; John 16:24; Romans 7:7 for similar examples where the context makes it plain without αν. It is strong language and is saved from hyperbole by "if possible" (ε δυνατον). Did Paul not have at this time serious eye trouble?
