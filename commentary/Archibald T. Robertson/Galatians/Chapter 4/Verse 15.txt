<p><b> That gratulation of yourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μακαρισμος υμων</span></span>). "Your felicitation." Rare word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακαριζω</span></span>, to pronounce happy, in Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:6">Romans 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:9">Romans 4:9</span>. You no longer felicitate yourselves on my presence with you.</p>
<p><b>Ye would have plucked out your eves and given them to me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους οφθαλμους υμων εξορυξαντες εδωκατε μο</span></span>). This is the conclusion of a condition of the second class without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> expressed which would have made it clearer. But see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:22">John 16:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:24">John 16:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span> for similar examples where the context makes it plain without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span>. It is strong language and is saved from hyperbole by "if possible" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δυνατον</span></span>). Did Paul not have at this time serious eye trouble? </p>
