<p><b> Under guardians </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο επιτροπους</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτρεπω</span></span>, to commit, to intrust. So either an overseer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:8">Matthew 20:8</span>) or one in charge of children as here. It is common as the guardian of an orphan minor. Frequent in the papyri as guardian of minors.</p>
<p><b>Stewards </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικονομους</span></span>). Old word for manager of a household whether freeborn or slave. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42">Luke 12:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:2">1 Corinthians 4:2</span>. Papyri show it as manager of an estate and also as treasurer like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span>. No example is known where this word is used of one in charge of a minor and no other where both occur together.</p>
<p><b>Until the time appointed of the father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ της προθεσμιας του πατρος</span></span>). Supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερας</span></span> (day), for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προθεσμιος</span></span> is an old adjective "appointed beforehand" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ, θεσμος</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>). Under Roman law the <i>tutor</i> had charge of the child till he was fourteen when the curator took charge of him till he was twenty-five. Ramsay notes that in Graeco-Phrygia cities the same law existed except that the father in Syria appointed both tutor and curator whereas the Roman father appointed only the tutor. Burton argues plausibly that no such legal distinction is meant by Paul, but that the terms here designate two functions of one person. The point does not disturb Paul's illustration at all. </p>
