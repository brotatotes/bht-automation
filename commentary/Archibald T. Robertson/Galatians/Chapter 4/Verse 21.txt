<p><b> That desire to be under the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο υπο νομον θελοντες εινα</span></span>). "Under law" (no article), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23">Galatians 3:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span>, legalistic system. Paul views them as on the point of surrender to legalism, as "wanting" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελοντες</span></span>) to do it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:3">Galatians 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:11">Galatians 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:17">Galatians 4:17</span>). Paul makes direct reference to these so disposed to "hear the law." He makes a surprising turn, but a legitimate one for the legalists by an allegorical use of Scripture. </p>
