 That desire to be under the law  (ο υπο νομον θελοντες εινα). "Under law" (no article), as in Galatians 3:23; Galatians 4:4, legalistic system. Paul views them as on the point of surrender to legalism, as "wanting" (θελοντες) to do it (Galatians 1:6; Galatians 3:3; Galatians 4:11; Galatians 4:17). Paul makes direct reference to these so disposed to "hear the law." He makes a surprising turn, but a legitimate one for the legalists by an allegorical use of Scripture.
