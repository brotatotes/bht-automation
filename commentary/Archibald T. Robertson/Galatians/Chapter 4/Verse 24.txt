<p><b> Which things contain an allegory </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατινα εστιν αλληγορουμενα</span></span>). Literally, "Which things are allegorized" (periphrastic present passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλληγορεω</span></span>). Late word (Strabo, Plutarch, Philo, Josephus, ecclesiastical writers), only here in N.T. The ancient writers used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αινιττομα</span></span> to speak in riddles. It is compounded of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλο</span></span>, another, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγορευω</span></span>, to speak, and so means speaking something else than what the language means, what Philo, the past-master in the use of allegory, calls the deeper spiritual sense. Paul does not deny the actual historical narrative, but he simply uses it in an allegorical sense to illustrate his point for the benefit of his readers who are tempted to go under the burden of the law. He puts a secondary meaning on the narrative just as he uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπικως</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:11">1 Corinthians 10:11</span> of the narrative. We need not press unduly the difference between allegory and type, for each is used in a variety of ways. The allegory in one sense is a speaking parable like Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, the Prodigal Son in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:15">Galatians 4:15</span>, the Good Shepherd in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:10">Galatians 4:10</span>. But allegory was also used by Philo and by Paul here for a secret meaning not obvious at first, one not in the mind of the writer, like our illustration which throws light on the point. Paul was familiar with this rabbinical method of exegesis (Rabbi Akiba, for instance, who found a mystical sense in every hook and crook of the Hebrew letters) and makes skilful use of that knowledge here. Christian preachers in Alexandria early fell victims to Philo's allegorical method and carried it to excess without regard to the plain sense of the narrative. That startling style of preaching survives yet to the discredit of sound preaching. Please observe that Paul says here that he is using allegory, not ordinary interpretation. It is not necessary to say that Paul intended his readers to believe that this allegory was designed by the narrative. He illustrates his point by it.</p>
<p><b>For these are </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτα γαρ εισιν</span></span>). Allegorically interpreted, he means.</p>

<p><b>Bearing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεννωσα</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενναω</span></span>, to beget of the male (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1-16">Matthew 1:1-16</span>), more rarely as here to bear of the female (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:13">Luke 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:57">Luke 1:57</span>).</p>
<p><b>Which is Hagar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητις εστιν Hαγαρ</span></span>). Allegorically interpreted. </p>
