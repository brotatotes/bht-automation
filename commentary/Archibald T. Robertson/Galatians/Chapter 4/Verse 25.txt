<p><b> This Hagar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το Hαγαρ</span></span>). Neuter article and so referring to the word Hagar (not to the woman, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span> Hagar) as applied to the mountain. There is great variety in the MSS. here. The Arabians are descendants of Abraham and Hagar (her name meaning wanderer or fugitive).</p>
<p><b>Answereth to </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συντοιχε</span></span>). Late word in Polybius for keeping step in line (military term) and in papyri in figurative sense as here. Lightfoot refers to the Pythagorean parallels of opposing principles (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνστοιχια</span></span>) as shown here by Paul (Hagar and Sarah, Ishmael and Isaac, the old covenant and the new covenant, the earthly Jerusalem and the heavenly Jerusalem). That is true, and there is a correlative correspondence as the line is carried on. </p>
