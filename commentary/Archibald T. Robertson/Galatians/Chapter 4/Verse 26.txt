<p><b> The Jerusalem that is above </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ανω Ιερουσαλημ</span></span>). Paul uses the rabbinical idea that the heavenly Jerusalem corresponds to the one here to illustrate his point without endorsing their ideas. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>. He uses the city of Jerusalem to represent the whole Jewish race (Vincent). </p>
