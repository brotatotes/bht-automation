<p><b> Which is our mother </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητις εστιν μητηρ ημων</span></span>). The mother of us Christians, apply the allegory of Hagar and Sarah to us. The Jerusalem above is the picture of the Kingdom of God. Paul illustrates the allegory by quoting <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:1">Isaiah 54:1</span>, a song of triumph looking for deliverance from a foreign yoke.</p>
<p><b>Rejoice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευφρανθητ</span></span>). First aorist passive imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευφραινω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Break forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρηξον</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρηγνυμ</span></span>, to rend, to burst asunder. Supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευφροσυνην</span></span> (joy) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:13">Isaiah 49:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>The desolate </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της ερημου</span></span>). The prophet refers to Sarah's prolonged barrenness and Paul uses this fact as a figure for the progress and glory of Christianity (the new Jerusalem of freedom) in contrast with the old Jerusalem of bondage (the current Judaism). His thought has moved rapidly, but he does not lose his line. </p>
