<p><b> When we were children </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε ημεν νηπιο</span></span>). Before the epoch of faith came and we (Jews and Gentiles) were under the law as paedagogue, guardian, steward, to use all of Paul's metaphors.</p>
<p><b>We were held in bondage </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις ημεθα δεδουλωμενο</span></span>). Periphrastic past perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλοω</span></span>, to enslave, in a permanent state of bondage.</p>
<p><b>Under the rudiments of the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο τα στοιχεια του κοσμου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Στοιχος</span></span> is row or rank, a series. So <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοιχειον</span></span> is any first thing in a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοιχος</span></span> like the letters of the alphabet, the material elements in the universe (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:10">2 Peter 3:10</span>), the heavenly bodies (some argue for that here), the rudiments of any act (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:10">Acts 15:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:3">Galatians 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:9">Galatians 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:8">Colossians 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:20">Colossians 2:20</span>). The papyri illustrate all the varieties in meaning of this word. Burton has a valuable excursus on the word in his commentary. Probably here (Lightfoot) Paul has in mind the rudimentary character of the law as it applies to both Jews and Gentiles, to all the knowledge of the world (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοσμος</span></span> as the orderly material universe as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:8">Colossians 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:20">Colossians 2:20</span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:38">Matthew 13:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:24">Acts 17:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:22">1 Corinthians 3:22</span>. All were in the elementary stage before Christ came. </p>
