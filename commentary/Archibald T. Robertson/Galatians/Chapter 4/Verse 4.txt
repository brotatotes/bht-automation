<p><b> The fulness of the time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πληρωμα του χρονου</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span>, to fill. Here the complement of the preceding time as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>. Some examples in the papyri in the sense of complement, to accompany. God sent forth his preexisting Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span>) when the time for his purpose had come like the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προθεσμια</span></span> of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:2">Galatians 4:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>Born of a woman </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενον εκ γυναικος</span></span>). As all men are and so true humanity, "coming from a woman." There is, of course, no direct reference here to the Virgin Birth of Jesus, but his deity had just been affirmed by the words "his Son" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον υιον αυτου</span></span>), so that both his deity and humanity are here stated as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:3">Romans 1:3</span>. Whatever view one holds about Paul's knowledge of the Virgin Birth of Christ one must admit that Paul believed in his actual personal preexistence with God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:5-11">Philippians 2:5-11</span>), not a mere existence in idea. The fact of the Virgin Birth agrees perfectly with the language here.</p>
<p><b>Born under the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενον υπο νομον</span></span>). He not only became a man, but a Jew. The purpose (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>) of God thus was plainly to redeem (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαγοραση</span></span>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span>) those under the law, and so under the curse. The further purpose (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>) was that we (Jew and Gentile) might receive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολαβωμεν</span></span>, second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολαμβανω</span></span>), not get back (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:27">Luke 15:27</span>), but get from (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>) God the adoption (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την υιοθεσιαν</span></span>). Late word common in the inscriptions (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 239) and occurs in the papyri also and in Diogenes Laertes, though not in LXX. Paul adopts this current term to express his idea (he alone in the N.T.) as to how God takes into his spiritual family both Jews and Gentiles who believe. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:4">Romans 9:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5">Ephesians 1:5</span>. The Vulgate uses <i>adoptio filiorum</i>. It is a metaphor like the others above, but a very expressive one. </p>
