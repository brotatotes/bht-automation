<p><b> Because ye are sons </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ εστε υιο</span></span>). This is the reason for sending forth the Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span> and here). We were "sons" in God's elective purpose and love. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hοτ</span></span> is causal (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:15">1 Corinthians 12:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:7">Romans 9:7</span>).</p>
<p><b>The Spirit of his Son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πνευμα του υιο αυτου</span></span>). The Holy Spirit, called the Spirit of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span>), the Spirit of Jesus Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:19">Philippians 1:19</span>). The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and from the Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span>).</p>
<p><b>Crying, Abba, Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραζον Αββα ο πατηρ</span></span>). The participle agrees with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span> neuter (grammatical gender), not neuter in fact. An old, though rare in present as here, onomatopoetic word to croak as a raven (Theophrastus, like Poe's <i>The Raven</i>), any inarticulate cry like "the unuttered groanings" of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span> which God understands. This cry comes from the Spirit of Christ in our hearts. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αββα</span></span> is the Aramaic word for father with the article and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πατηρ</span></span> translates it. The articular form occurs in the vocative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:28">John 20:28</span>. It is possible that the repetition here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span> may be "a sort of affectionate fondness for the very term that Jesus himself used" (Burton) in the Garden of Gethsemane (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:36">Mark 14:36</span>). The rabbis preserve similar parallels. Most of the Jews knew both Greek and Aramaic. But there remains the question why Jesus used both in his prayer. Was it not natural for both words to come to him in his hour of agony as in his childhood? The same thing may be true here in Paul's case. </p>
