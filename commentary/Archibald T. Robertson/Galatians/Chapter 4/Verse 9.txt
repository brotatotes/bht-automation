<p><b> Now that ye have come to know God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν δε γνοντες</span></span>). Fine example of the ingressive second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, come to know by experience through faith in Christ.</p>
<p><b>Rather to be known of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλλον δε γνωσθεντες υπο θεου</span></span>). First aorist passive participle of the same verb. He quickly turns it round to the standpoint of God's elective grace reaching them (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:6">Galatians 4:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>How </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πως</span></span>). "A question full of wonder" (Bengel). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>Turn ye back again? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστρεφετε παλιν?</span></span>). Present active indicative, "Are ye turning again?" See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετατιθεσθε</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>The weak and beggarly rudiments </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα ασθενη κα πτωχα στοιχεια</span></span>). The same <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοιχεια</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:3">Galatians 4:3</span> from which they had been delivered, "weak and beggarly," still in their utter impotence from the Pharisaic legalism and the philosophical and religious legalism and the philosophical and religious quests of the heathen as shown by Angus's <i>The Religious Quests of the Graeco-Roman World</i>. These were eagerly pursued by many, but they were shadows when caught. It is pitiful today to see some men and women leave Christ for will o' the wisps of false philosophy.</p>
<p><b>Over again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν ανωθεν</span></span>). Old word, from above (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανω</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:51">Matthew 27:51</span>, from the first (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:3">Luke 1:3</span>), then "over again" as here, back to where they were before (in slavery to rites and rules). </p>
