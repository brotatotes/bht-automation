<p><b> With freedom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη ελευθερια</span></span>). Rather dative case instead of instrumental, "for freedom," "for the (article) freedom that belongs to us children of the freewoman" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:31">Galatians 4:31</span>).</p>
<p><b>Did Christ set us free </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημας Χριστος ηλευθερωσεν</span></span>). Effective aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελευθεροω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, to go, go free).</p>
<p><b>Stand fast therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηκετε ουν</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:31">Mark 3:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:13">1 Corinthians 16:13</span> for this late word from perfect stem of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>, "keep on standing therefore," "stay free since Christ set you free."</p>
<p><b>Be not entangled again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη παλιν ενεχεσθε</span></span>). "Stop being held in by a yoke of bondage." Common word for ensnare by trap. The Judaizers were trying to lasso the Galatians for the old yoke of Judaism. </p>
