 With freedom  (τη ελευθερια). Rather dative case instead of instrumental, "for freedom," "for the (article) freedom that belongs to us children of the freewoman" (Galatians 4:31).Did Christ set us free  (ημας Χριστος ηλευθερωσεν). Effective aorist active indicative of ελευθεροω (from ερχομα, to go, go free).Stand fast therefore  (στηκετε ουν). See on Mark 3:31; 1 Corinthians 16:13 for this late word from perfect stem of ιστημ, "keep on standing therefore," "stay free since Christ set you free."Be not entangled again  (μη παλιν ενεχεσθε). "Stop being held in by a yoke of bondage." Common word for ensnare by trap. The Judaizers were trying to lasso the Galatians for the old yoke of Judaism.
