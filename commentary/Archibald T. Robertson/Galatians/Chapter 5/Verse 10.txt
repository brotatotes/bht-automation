<p><b> Whosoever he be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οστις εαν η</span></span>). Indefinite relative clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and subjunctive. It seems unlikely that Paul knew precisely who the leader was. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span> he uses the plural of the same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταρασσω</span></span> and see also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστατουντες</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:12">Galatians 5:12</span>. </p>
