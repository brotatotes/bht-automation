<p><b> Ye were called for freedom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ' ελευθερια εκληθητε</span></span>). The same point as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span> made plainer by the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ'</span></span> (on the basis of, for the purpose of). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:7">1 Thessalonians 4:7</span> for this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Only use not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονον μη</span></span>). No word for "use" in the Greek. Probably supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρεπετε</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρεφετε</span></span>, "turn not your liberty into an occasion for the flesh" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις αφορμην τη σαρκ</span></span>), as a spring board for license. On <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφορμη</span></span>, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:12">2 Corinthians 5:12</span>. Liberty so easily turns to license. </p>
