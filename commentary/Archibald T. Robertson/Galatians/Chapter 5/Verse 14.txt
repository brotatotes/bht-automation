<p><b> Even in this </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω</span></span>). Just the article with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>, "in the," but it points at the quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+19:18">Leviticus 19:18</span>. Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:29">Luke 10:29</span>) confined "neighbour" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλησιον</span></span>) to Jews. Paul uses here a striking paradox by urging obedience to the law against which he has been arguing, but this is the moral law as proof of the new love and life. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:8">Romans 13:8</span>, precisely as Jesus did (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:40">Matthew 22:40</span>). </p>
