Are lined up in conflict, face to face (αντι-), a spiritual duel (cf. Christ's temptations), with dative case of personal interest (αλληλοις).That ye may not do  (ινα μη ποιητε). "That ye may not keep on doing" (present active subjunctive of ποιεω).That ye would  (α εαν θελητε). "Whatever ye wish" (indefinite relative with εαν and present subjunctive).
