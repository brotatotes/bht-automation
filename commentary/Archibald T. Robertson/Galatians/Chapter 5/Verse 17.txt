<p><b> Lusteth against </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιθυμε κατα</span></span>). Like a tug of war. This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρξ</span></span> as opposed to the Spirit (Holy Spirit) personifies <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρξ</span></span>. Lightfoot argues that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιθυμε</span></span> cannot be used with the Spirit and so some other verb must be supplied for it. But that is wholly needless, for the verb, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιθυμια</span></span>, does not mean evil desire, but simply to long for. Christ and Satan long for the possession of the city of Man Soul as Bunyan shows.</p>
<p><b>Are contrary the one to the other </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλληλοις αντικειτα</span></span>). Are lined up in conflict, face to face (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντι-</span></span>), a spiritual duel (cf. Christ's temptations), with dative case of personal interest (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλληλοις</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>That ye may not do </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη ποιητε</span></span>). "That ye may not keep on doing" (present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>That ye would </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α εαν θελητε</span></span>). "Whatever ye wish" (indefinite relative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and present subjunctive). </p>
