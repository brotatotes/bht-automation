<p><b> Under the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο νομον</span></span>). Instead of "under the flesh" as one might expect. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:2-6">Galatians 3:2-6</span> for contrast between law and spirit. The flesh made the law weak (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:10">Hebrews 9:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13">Hebrews 9:13</span>). They are one and the same in result. See same idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:14">Romans 8:14</span>. Note present tense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγεσθε</span></span> (if you are continually led by the Spirit). See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:23">Galatians 5:23</span>. </p>
