<p><b> Manifest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανερα</span></span>). Opposed to "hidden" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρυπτα</span></span>). Ancient writers were fond of lists of vices and virtues. Cf. Stalker's sermons on <i>The Seven Cardinal Virtues</i> and <i>The Seven Deadly Sins</i>. There are more than seven in this deadly list in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:19-21">Galatians 5:19-21</span>. He makes the two lists in explanation of the conflict in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:17">Galatians 5:17</span> to emphasize the command in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:13">Galatians 5:13</span>. There are four groups in Paul's list of manifest vices: (I) Sensual sins like fornication (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορνεια</span></span>, prostitution, harlotry), uncleanness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακαθαρσια</span></span>, moral impurity), lasciviousness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασελγεια</span></span>, wantonness), sexual vice of all kinds prevailed in heathenism. (2) Idolatry (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδωλατρεια</span></span>, worship of idols) and witchcraft (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαρμακεια</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαρμακον</span></span>, a drug, the ministering of drugs), but the sorcerers monopolized the word for a while in their magical arts and used it in connection with idolatry. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:23">Revelation 18:23</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:19">Acts 19:19</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεργα</span></span>, curious arts. (3) Personal relations expressed by eight words, all old words, sins of the spirit, like enmities (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξθρα</span></span>, personal animosities), strife (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερις</span></span>, rivalry, discord), jealousies (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλος</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλο</span></span>, MSS. vary, our very word), wraths (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυμο</span></span>, stirring emotions, then explosions), factions (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εριθεια</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εριθος</span></span>, day labourer for hire, worker in wool, party spirit), divisions (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διχοστασια</span></span>, splits in two, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διχα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στασις</span></span>), heresies (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρεσεις</span></span>, the very word, but really choosings from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρεομα</span></span>, preferences), envyings (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθονο</span></span>, feelings of ill-will). Surely a lively list. (4)</p>
<p><b>Drunkenness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθα</span></span>, old word and plural, drunken excesses, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:34">Luke 21:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>), revellings (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωμο</span></span>, old word also for drinking parties like those in honour of Bacchus, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:3">1 Peter 4:3</span>).</p>
<p><b>And such like </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τα ομοια τουτοις</span></span>). And the things like these (associative instrumental <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτοις</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοια</span></span>, like). It is not meant to be exhaustive, but it is representative. </p>
