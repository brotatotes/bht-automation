 I Paul  (εγω Παυλος). Asserts all his personal and apostolic authority. For both words see also 1 Thessalonians 2:16; 2 Corinthians 10:1; Colossians 1:23; Ephesians 3:1.If ye receive circumcision  (εαν περιτεμνησθε). Condition of third class and present passive subjunctive, a supposable case, but with terrible consequences, for they will make circumcision a condition of salvation. In that case Christ will help them not at all.
