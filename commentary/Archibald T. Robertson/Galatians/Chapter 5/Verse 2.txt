<p><b> I Paul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω Παυλος</span></span>). Asserts all his personal and apostolic authority. For both words see also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:16">1 Thessalonians 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:1">2 Corinthians 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>If ye receive circumcision </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν περιτεμνησθε</span></span>). Condition of third class and present passive subjunctive, a supposable case, but with terrible consequences, for they will make circumcision a condition of salvation. In that case Christ will help them not at all. </p>
