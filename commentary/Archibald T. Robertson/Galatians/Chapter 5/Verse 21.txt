<p><b> Forewarn </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προλεγω</span></span>)</p>
<p><b>--did forewarn </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προειπον</span></span>). Paul repeats his warning given while with them. He did his duty then. Gentile churches were peculiarly subject to these sins. But who is not in danger from them?</p>
<p><b>Practise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρασσοντες</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πρασσω</span></span> is the verb for habitual practice (our very word, in fact), not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span> for occasional doing. The</p>
<p><b>habit </b> of these sins is proof that one is not in the Kingdom of God and will not inherit it. </p>
