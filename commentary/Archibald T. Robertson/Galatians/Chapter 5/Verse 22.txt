 The fruit of the Spirit  (ο καρπος του πνευματος). Paul changes the figure fromworks  (εργα) in verse Galatians 5:19 to fruit as the normal out-cropping of the Holy Spirit in us. It is a beautiful tree of fruit that Paul pictures here with nine luscious fruits on it:Love  (αγαπη). Late, almost Biblical word. First as in Galatians 5:1, which see for discussion as superior to φιλια and ερως.Joy  (χαρα). Old word. See on 1 Thessalonians 1:6.Peace  (ειρηνη). See on 1 Thessalonians 1:1.Long-suffering  (μακροθυμια). See on 2 Corinthians 6:6.Kindness  (χρηστοτης). See on 2 Corinthians 6:6.Goodness  (αγαθωσυνη). See on 2 Thessalonians 1:11.Faithfulness  (πιστις). Same word as "faith." See on Matthew 23:33; 1 Corinthians 13:7; 1 Corinthians 13:13.Meekness  (πραυτης). See on 1 Corinthians 4:21; 2 Corinthians 10:1.Temperance  (εγκρατεια). See on Acts 24:25. Old word from εγκρατης, one holding control or holding in. In N.T. only in these passages and 2 Peter 1:6. Paul has a better list than the four cardinal virtues of the Stoics (temperance, prudence, fortitude, justice), though they are included with better notes struck. Temperance is alike, but kindness is better than justice, long-suffering than fortitude, love than prudence.
