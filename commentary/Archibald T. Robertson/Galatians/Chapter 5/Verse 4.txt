<p><b> Ye are severed from Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηργηθητε απο Χριστου</span></span>). First aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταργεω</span></span>, to make null and void as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:2">Romans 7:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:6">Romans 7:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>Who would be justified by the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιτινες εν νομω δικαιουσθε</span></span>). Present passive conative indicative, "ye who are trying to be justified in the law."</p>
<p><b>Ye are fallen away from grace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της χαριτος εξεπεσατε</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπιπτω</span></span> (with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> variable vowel of the first aorist) and followed by the ablative case. "Ye did fall out of grace," "ye left the sphere of grace in Christ and took your stand in the sphere of law" as your hope of salvation. Paul does not mince words and carries the logic to the end of the course. He is not, of course, speaking of occasional sins, but he has in mind a far more serious matter, that of substituting law for Christ as the agent in salvation. </p>
