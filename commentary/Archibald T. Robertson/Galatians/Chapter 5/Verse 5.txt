<p><b> For we </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις γαρ</span></span>). We Christians as opposed to the legalists.</p>
<p><b>Through the Spirit by faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματ εκ πιστεως</span></span>). By the Spirit (Holy Spirit) out of faith (not law). Clear-cut repetition to make it plain. </p>
