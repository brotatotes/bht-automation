 With how large letters  (πηλικοις γραμμασιν). Paul now takes the pen from the amanuensis (cf. Romans 16:22) and writes the rest of the Epistle (verses Galatians 6:11-18) himself instead of the mere farewell greeting (2 Thessalonians 3:17; 1 Corinthians 16:21; Colossians 4:18). But what does he mean by "with how large letters"? Certainly not "how large a letter." It has been suggested that he employed large letters because of defective eyesight or because he could only write ill-formed letters because of his poor handwriting (like the print letters of children) or because he wished to call particular attention to this closing paragraph by placarding it in big letters (Ramsay). This latter is the most likely reason. Deissmann, (St. Paul, p. 51) argues that artisans write clumsy letters, yes, and scholars also. Milligan (Documents, p. 24; Vocabulary, etc.) suggests the contrast seen in papyri often between the neat hand of the scribe and the big sprawling hand of the signature.I have written  (εγραψα). Epistolary aorist.With mine own hand  (τη εμη χειρ). Instrumental case as in 1 Corinthians 16:21.
