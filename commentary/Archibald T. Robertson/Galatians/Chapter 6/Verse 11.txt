<p><b> With how large letters </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πηλικοις γραμμασιν</span></span>). Paul now takes the pen from the amanuensis (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:22">Romans 16:22</span>) and writes the rest of the Epistle (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:11-18">Galatians 6:11-18</span>) himself instead of the mere farewell greeting (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:21">1 Corinthians 16:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:18">Colossians 4:18</span>). But what does he mean by "with how large letters"? Certainly not "how large a letter." It has been suggested that he employed large letters because of defective eyesight or because he could only write ill-formed letters because of his poor handwriting (like the print letters of children) or because he wished to call particular attention to this closing paragraph by placarding it in big letters (Ramsay). This latter is the most likely reason. Deissmann, (<i>St. Paul</i>, p. 51) argues that artisans write clumsy letters, yes, and scholars also. Milligan (<i>Documents</i>, p. 24; <i>Vocabulary</i>, etc.) suggests the contrast seen in papyri often between the neat hand of the scribe and the big sprawling hand of the signature.</p>
<p><b>I have written </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγραψα</span></span>). Epistolary aorist.</p>
<p><b>With mine own hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εμη χειρ</span></span>). Instrumental case as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:21">1 Corinthians 16:21</span>. </p>
