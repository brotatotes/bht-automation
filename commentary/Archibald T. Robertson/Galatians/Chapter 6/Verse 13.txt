 They who receive circumcision  (ο περιτεμνομενο). Present causative middle of περιτεμνω, those who are having themselves circumcised. Some MSS. read ο περιτετμημενο), "they who have been circumcised" (perfect passive participle). Probably the present (περιτεμνομενο) is correct as the harder reading.
