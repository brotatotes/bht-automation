<p><b> They who receive circumcision </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο περιτεμνομενο</span></span>). Present causative middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιτεμνω</span></span>, those who are having themselves circumcised. Some MSS. read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο περιτετμημενο</span></span>), "they who have been circumcised" (perfect passive participle). Probably the present (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιτεμνομενο</span></span>) is correct as the harder reading. </p>
