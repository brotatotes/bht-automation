<p><b> From henceforth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του λοιπου</span></span>). Usually <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το λοιπον</span></span>, the accusative of general reference, "as for the rest" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:1">Philippians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:8">Philippians 4:8</span>). The genitive case (as here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:10">Ephesians 6:10</span>) means "in respect of the remaining time."</p>
<p><b>The marks of Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα στιγματα του Ιησου</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στιζω</span></span>, to prick, to stick, to sting. Slaves had the names or stamp of their owners on their bodies. It was sometimes done for soldiers also. There were devotees also who stamped upon their bodies the names of the gods whom they worshipped. Today in a round-up cattle are given the owner's mark. Paul gloried in being the slave of Jesus Christ. This is probably the image in Paul's mind since he bore in his body brandmarks of suffering for Christ received in many places (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:4-6">2 Corinthians 6:4-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span>), probably actual scars from the scourgings (thirty-nine lashes at a time). If for no other reason, listen to me by reason of these scars for Christ and "let no one keep on furnishing trouble to me." </p>
