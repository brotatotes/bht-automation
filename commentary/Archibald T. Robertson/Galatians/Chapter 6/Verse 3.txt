<p><b> Something when he is nothing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ μηδεν ων</span></span>). Thinks he is a big number being nothing at all (neuter singular pronouns). He is really zero.</p>
<p><b>He deceiveth himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρεναπατα εαυτον</span></span>). Late compound word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρην</span></span>, mind, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαταω</span></span>, lead astray), leads his own mind astray. Here for first time. Afterwards in Galen, ecclesiastical and Byzantine writers. He deceives no one else. </p>
