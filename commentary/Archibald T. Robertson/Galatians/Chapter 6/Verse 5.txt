<p><b> Each shall bear his own burden </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ιδιον φορτιον βαστασε</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φορτιον</span></span> is old word for ship's cargo (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:10">Acts 27:10</span>). Christ calls his <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορτιον</span></span> light, though he terms those of the Pharisees heavy (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:4">Matthew 23:4</span>), meant for other people. The terms are thus not always kept distinct, though Paul does make a distinction here from the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρη</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:2">Galatians 6:2</span>. </p>
