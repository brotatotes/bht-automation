 Each shall bear his own burden  (το ιδιον φορτιον βαστασε). Φορτιον is old word for ship's cargo (Acts 27:10). Christ calls his φορτιον light, though he terms those of the Pharisees heavy (Matthew 23:4), meant for other people. The terms are thus not always kept distinct, though Paul does make a distinction here from the βαρη in verse Galatians 6:2.
