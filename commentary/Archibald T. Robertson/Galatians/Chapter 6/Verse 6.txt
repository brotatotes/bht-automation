<p><b> That is taught </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κατηχουμενος</span></span>). For this late and rare verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηχεω</span></span>, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:4">Luke 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:25">Acts 18:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:19">1 Corinthians 14:19</span>. It occurs in the papyri for legal instruction. Here the present passive participle retains the accusative of the thing. The active (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω κατηχουντ</span></span>) joined with the passive is interesting as showing how early we find paid teachers in the churches. Those who receive instruction are called on to "contribute" (better than "communicate" for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνειτω</span></span>) for the time of the teacher (Burton). There was a teaching class thus early (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:12">1 Thessalonians 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:17">1 Thessalonians 5:17</span>). </p>
