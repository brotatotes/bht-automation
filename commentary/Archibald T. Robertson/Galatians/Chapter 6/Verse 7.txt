<p><b> Be not deceived </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πλανασθε</span></span>). Present passive imperative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>, "stop being led astray" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλαναω</span></span>, common verb to wander, to lead astray as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:4">Matthew 24:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>God is not mocked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μυκτηριζετα</span></span>). This rare verb (common in LXX) occurs in Lysias. It comes from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυκτηρ</span></span> (nose) and means to turn the nose up at one. That is done towards God, but never without punishment, Paul means to say. In particular, he means "an evasion of his laws which men think to accomplish, but, in fact, cannot" (Burton).</p>
<p><b>Whatsoever a man soweth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εαν σπειρη ανθρωπος</span></span>). Indefinite relative clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and the active subjunctive (either aorist or present, form same here). One of the most frequent of ancient proverbs (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+4:8">Job 4:8</span>; Arist., <i>Rhet</i>. iii. 3). Already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:6">2 Corinthians 9:6</span>. Same point in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:16">Matthew 7:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:26">Mark 4:26</span>.</p>
<p><b>That </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο</span></span>). That very thing, not something different.</p>
<p><b>Reap </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θερισε</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:26">Matthew 6:26</span> for this old verb. </p>
