 Be not deceived  (μη πλανασθε). Present passive imperative with μη, "stop being led astray" (πλαναω, common verb to wander, to lead astray as in Matthew 24:4).God is not mocked  (ου μυκτηριζετα). This rare verb (common in LXX) occurs in Lysias. It comes from μυκτηρ (nose) and means to turn the nose up at one. That is done towards God, but never without punishment, Paul means to say. In particular, he means "an evasion of his laws which men think to accomplish, but, in fact, cannot" (Burton).Whatsoever a man soweth  (ο εαν σπειρη ανθρωπος). Indefinite relative clause with εαν and the active subjunctive (either aorist or present, form same here). One of the most frequent of ancient proverbs (Job 4:8; Arist., Rhet. iii. 3). Already in 2 Corinthians 9:6. Same point in Matthew 7:16; Mark 4:26.That  (τουτο). That very thing, not something different.Reap  (θερισε). See on Matthew 6:26 for this old verb.
