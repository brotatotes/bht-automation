<p><b> Corruption </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθοραν</span></span>). For this old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθειρω</span></span>, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:42">1 Corinthians 15:42</span>. The precise meaning turns on the context, here plainly the physical and moral decay or rottenness that follows sins of the flesh as all men know. Nature writes in one's body the penalty of sin as every doctor knows.</p>
<p><b>Eternal life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωην αιωνιον</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46">Matthew 25:46</span> for this interesting phrase so common in the Johannine writings. Plato used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιωνιος</span></span> for perpetual. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:9">2 Thessalonians 1:9</span>. It comes as nearly meaning "eternal" as the Greek can express that idea. </p>
