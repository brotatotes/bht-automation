 Let us not be weary in well-doing  (το καλον ποιουντες μη ενκακωμεν). Volitive present active subjunctive of ενκακεω on which see Luke 18:1; 2 Thessalonians 3:13; 2 Corinthians 4:1; 2 Corinthians 4:16 (εν, κακος, evil). Literally, "Let us not keep on giving in to evil while doing the good." It is curious how prone we are to give in and to give out in doing the good which somehow becomes prosy or insipid to us.In due season  (καιρω ιδιω). Locative case, "at its proper season" (harvest time). Cf. 1 Timothy 2:6; 1 Timothy 6:15 (plural).If we faint not  (μη εκλυομενο). Present passive participle (conditional) with μη. Cf. εκλυω, old verb to loosen out. Literally, "not loosened out," relaxed, exhausted as a result of giving in to evil (ενκακωμεν).
