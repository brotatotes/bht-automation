<p><b> God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος</span></span>). This Epistle begins like Genesis and the Fourth Gospel with God, who is the Author of the old revelation in the prophets and of the new in his Son. Verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1-3">Hebrews 1:1-3</span> are a <i>proemium</i> (Delitzsch) or introduction to the whole Epistle. The periodic structure of the sentence (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1-4">Hebrews 1:1-4</span>) reminds one of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:1-4">Luke 1:1-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1-7">Romans 1:1-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1-4">1 John 1:1-4</span>. The sentence could have concluded with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υιω</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>, but by means of three relatives (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον, δι' ου, ος</span></span>) the author presents the Son as "the exact counterpart of God" (Moffatt).</p>
<p><b>Of old time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλα</span></span>). "Long ago" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:21">Matthew 11:21</span>.</p>
<p><b>Having spoken </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλησας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span>, originally chattering of birds, then used of the highest form of speech as here.</p>
<p><b>Unto the fathers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις πατρασιν</span></span>). Dative case. The Old Testament worthies in general without "our" or "your" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:58">John 6:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:22">John 7:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>In the prophets </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις προφηταις</span></span>). As the quickening power of their life (Westcott). So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:7">Hebrews 4:7</span>.</p>
<p><b>By divers portions </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολυμερως</span></span>). "In many portions." Adverb from late adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολυμερης</span></span> (in papyri), both in <i>Vettius Valens</i>, here only in N.T., but in Wisdom 7:22 and Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. VIII, 3, 9). The Old Testament revelation came at different times and in various stages, a progressive revelation of God to men.</p>
<p><b>In divers manners </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολυτροπως</span></span>). "In many ways." Adverb from old adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολυτροπος</span></span>, in Philo, only here in N.T. The two adverbs together are "a sonorous hendiadys for 'variously'" (Moffatt) as Chrysostom (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαφορως</span></span>). God spoke by dream, by direct voice, by signs, in different ways to different men (Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Elijah, Isaiah, etc.). </p>
