<p><b> Ministering spirits </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λειτουργικα πνευματα</span></span>). Thayer says that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λειτουργικος</span></span> was not found in profane authors, but it occurs in the papyri for "work tax" (money in place of service) and for religious service also. The word is made from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λειτουργια</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:23">Luke 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:6">Hebrews 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:21">Hebrews 9:21</span>).</p>
<p><b>Sent forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστελλομενα</span></span>). Present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστελλω</span></span>, sent forth repeatedly, from time to time as occasion requires.</p>
<p><b>For the sake of </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>). With the accusative, the usual causal meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>That shall inherit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους μελλοντας κληρονομειν</span></span>). "That are going to inherit," common idiom of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλω</span></span> (present active participle) with the infinitive (present active here), "destined to inherit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:14">Matthew 11:14</span>).</p>
<p><b>Salvation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωτηριαν</span></span>). Here used of the final salvation in its consummation. Only here in the N.T. do we have "inherent salvation," but see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:12">Hebrews 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:17">Hebrews 12:17</span>. We do not have here the doctrine of special guardian angels for each of us, but simply the fact that angels are used for our good. "And if so, may we not be aided, inspired, guided by a cloud of witnesses--not witnesses only, but helpers, agents like ourselves of the immanent God?" (Sir Oliver Lodge, <i>The Hibbert Journal</i>, Jan., 1903, p. 223). </p>
