<p><b> At the end of these days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ' εσχατου των ημερων τουτων</span></span>). In contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλα</span></span> above.</p>
<p><b>Hath spoken </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλησεν</span></span>). First aorist indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span>, the same verb as above, "did speak" in a final and full revelation.</p>
<p><b>In his Son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υιω</span></span>). In sharp contrast to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις προφηταις</span></span>. "The Old Testament slopes upward to Christ" (J. R. Sampey). No article or pronoun here with the preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>, giving the absolute sense of "Son." Here the idea is not merely what Jesus said, but what he is (Dods), God's Son who reveals the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>). "The revelation was a <i>son-revelation</i>" (Vincent).</p>
<p><b>Hath appointed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθηκεν</span></span>). First aorist (kappa aorist) active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>, a timeless aorist.</p>
<p><b>Heir of all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κληρονομον παντων</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:6">Mark 12:6</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κληρονομος</span></span> in Christ's parable, perhaps an allusion here to this parable (Moffatt). The idea of sonship easily passes into that of heirship (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:7">Galatians 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>). See the claim of Christ in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span> even before the Ascension.</p>
<p><b>Through whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ου</span></span>). The Son as Heir is also the Intermediate Agent (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) in the work of creation as we have it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>The worlds </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους αιωνας</span></span>). "The ages" (<i>secula</i>, Vulgate). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:3">Hebrews 11:3</span> also where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους αιωνασ=τον κοσμον</span></span> (the world) or the universe like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα παντα</span></span> (the all things) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>. The original sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιων</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αε</span></span>, always) occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:20">Hebrews 5:20</span>, but here "by metonomy of the container for the contained" (Thayer) for "the worlds" (the universe) as in LXX, Philo, Josephus. </p>
