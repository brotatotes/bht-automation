<p><b> Being </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span>). Absolute and timeless existence (present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span>) in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενος</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span> (in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>) and like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαρχων</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>The effulgence of his glory </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαυγασμα της δοξης</span></span>). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαυγασμα</span></span>, late substantive from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαυγαζω</span></span>, to emit brightness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυγη, αυγαζω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>), here only in the N.T., but in Wisdom 7:26 and in Philo. It can mean either reflected brightness, refulgence (Calvin, Thayer) or effulgence (ray from an original light body) as the Greek fathers hold. Both senses are true of Christ in his relation to God as Jesus shows in plain language in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:45">John 12:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9">John 14:9</span>. "The writer is using metaphors which had already been applied to Wisdom and the Logos" (Moffatt). The meaning "effulgence" suits the context better, though it gives the idea of eternal generation of the Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>), the term Father applied to God necessarily involving Son. See this same metaphor in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>The very image of his substance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρακτηρ της υποστασεως</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χαρακτηρ</span></span> is an old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρασσω</span></span>, to cut, to scratch, to mark. It first was the agent (note ending <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">=τηρ</span></span>) or tool that did the marking, then the mark or impress made, the exact reproduction, a meaning clearly expressed by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαραγμα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:29">Acts 17:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:16">Revelation 13:16</span>). Menander had already used (Moffatt) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρακτηρ</span></span> in the sense of our "character." The word occurs in the inscriptions for "person" as well as for "exact reproduction" of a person. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποστασις</span></span> for the being or essence of God "is a philosophical rather than a religious term" (Moffatt). Etymologically it is the sediment or foundation under a building (for instance). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψποστασις</span></span> is like the "title-deed" idea found in the papyri. Athanasius rightly used <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1-4">Hebrews 1:1-4</span> in his controversy with Arius. Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:5-11">Philippians 2:5-11</span> pictures the real and eternal deity of Christ free from the philosophical language here employed. But even Paul's simpler phrase <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μορφη θεου</span></span> (the form of God) has difficulties of its own. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1-18">John 1:1-18</span> is parallel to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1-4">Hebrews 1:1-4</span>.</p>
<p><b>And upholding </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερων τε</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερω</span></span> closely connected with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span> (being) by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε</span></span> and like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:17">Colossians 1:17</span> in idea. The newer science as expounded by Eddington and Jeans is in harmony with the spiritual and personal conception of creation here presented.</p>
<p><b>By the word of his power </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω ρηματ της δυναμεως αυτου</span></span>). Instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρημα</span></span> (word). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:3">Hebrews 11:3</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρηματ θεου</span></span> (by the word of God) as the explanation of creation like Genesis, but here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> refers to God's Son as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>Purification of sins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαρισμον των αμαρτιων</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Καθαρισμος</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαριζω</span></span>, to cleanse (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:3">Matthew 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>), here only in Hebrews, but in same sense of cleansing from sins, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:9">2 Peter 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+7:21">Job 7:21</span>. Note middle participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησαμενος</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευραμενος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span>. This is the first mention of the priestly work of Christ, the keynote of this Epistle.</p>
<p><b>Sat down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθισεν</span></span>). First aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθιζω</span></span>, "took his seat," a formal and dignified act.</p>
<p><b>Of the Majesty on high </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της μεγαλοσυνης εν υψηλοις</span></span>). Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγας</span></span>, only in LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+32:3">Deuteronomy 32:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:23">2 Samuel 7:23</span>, etc.), Aristeas, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1">Hebrews 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:25">Judges 1:25</span>. Christ resumed his original dignity and glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>). The phrase <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υψηλοις</span></span> occurs in the Psalms (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+93:4">Psalms 93:4</span>), here only in N.T., elsewhere <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υψιστοις</span></span> in the highest (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:9">Matthew 21:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:14">Luke 2:14</span>) or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις επουρανιοις</span></span> in the heavenlies (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span>). Jesus is here pictured as King (Prophet and Priest also) Messiah seated at the right hand of God. </p>
