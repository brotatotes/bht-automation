<p><b> Unto which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τιν</span></span>). "To which individual angel." As a class angels are called sons of God (Elohim) (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+29:1">Psalms 29:1</span>), but no single angel is called God's Son like the Messiah in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span>. Dods takes "have I begotten thee" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγεννηκα σε</span></span>, perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενναω</span></span>) to refer to the resurrection and ascension while others refer it to the incarnation.</p>
<p><b>And again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα παλιν</span></span>). This quotation is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:14">2 Samuel 7:14</span>. Note the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> in the predicate with the sense of "as" like the Hebrew (LXX idiom), not preserved in the English. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:5">Matthew 19:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34">Luke 2:34</span>. Like Old English "to" or "for." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:18">2 Corinthians 6:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:7">Revelation 21:7</span> for the same passage applied to relation between God and Christians while here it is treated as Messianic. </p>
