<p><b> And when he again bringeth in </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν δε παλιν εισαγαγη</span></span>). Indefinite temporal clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> and second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισαγω</span></span>. If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν</span></span> is taken with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισαγαγη</span></span>, the reference is to the Second Coming as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:28">Hebrews 9:28</span>. If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν</span></span> merely introduces another quotation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+97:7">Psalms 97:7</span>) parallel to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα παλιν</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5">Hebrews 1:5</span>, the reference is to the incarnation when the angels did worship the Child Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:13">Luke 2:13</span>). There is no way to decide certainly about it.</p>
<p><b>The first-born </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον πρωτοτοκον</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:28">Psalms 89:28</span>. For this compound adjective applied to Christ in relation to the universe see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>, to other men, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>, to the other children of Mary, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:7">Luke 2:7</span>; here it is used absolutely.</p>
<p><b>The world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την οικουμενην</span></span>). "The inhabited earth." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:6">Acts 17:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>Let worship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνησατωσαν</span></span>). Imperative first aorist active third plural of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνεω</span></span>, here in the full sense of worship, not mere reverence or courtesy. This quotation is from the LXX of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+32:43">Deuteronomy 32:43</span>, but is not in the Hebrew, though most of the LXX MSS. (except F) have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιο θεου</span></span>, but the substance does occur also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+97:7">Psalms 97:7</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αγγελο αυτου</span></span>. </p>
