 Of the angels  (προς τους αγγελους). "With reference to" (προς) as in Luke 20:9. So "of the Son" in verse Hebrews 1:8. Note μεν here and δε in verse Hebrews 1:8 in carefully balanced contrast. The quotation is from Psalms 104:4.Winds  (πνευματα). "Spirits" the word also means. The meaning (note article with αγγελους, not with πνευματα) apparently is one that can reduce angels to the elemental forces of wind and fire (Moffatt).A flame of fire  (πυρος φλογα). Predicate accusative of φλοξ, old word, in N.T. only here and Luke 16:24. Lunemann holds that the Hebrew here is wrongly rendered and means that God makes the wind his messengers (not angels) and flaming fire his servants. That is all true, but that is not the point of this passage. Preachers also are sometimes like a wind-storm or a fire.
