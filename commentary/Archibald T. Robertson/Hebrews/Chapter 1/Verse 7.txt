<p><b> Of the angels </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τους αγγελους</span></span>). "With reference to" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:9">Luke 20:9</span>. So "of the Son" in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:8">Hebrews 1:8</span>. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν</span></span> here and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:8">Hebrews 1:8</span> in carefully balanced contrast. The quotation is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+104:4">Psalms 104:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>Winds </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματα</span></span>). "Spirits" the word also means. The meaning (note article with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελους</span></span>, not with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματα</span></span>) apparently is one that can reduce angels to the elemental forces of wind and fire (Moffatt).</p>
<p><b>A flame of fire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρος φλογα</span></span>). Predicate accusative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φλοξ</span></span>, old word, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:24">Luke 16:24</span>. Lunemann holds that the Hebrew here is wrongly rendered and means that God makes the wind his messengers (not angels) and flaming fire his servants. That is all true, but that is not the point of this passage. Preachers also are sometimes like a wind-storm or a fire. </p>
