<p><b> O God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος</span></span>). This quotation (the fifth) is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:7">Psalms 45:7</span>. A Hebrew nuptial ode (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιθαλαμιυμ</span></span>) for a king treated here as Messianic. It is not certain whether <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος</span></span> is here the vocative (address with the nominative form as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:28">John 20:28</span> with the Messiah termed <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span> as is possible, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>) or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος</span></span> is nominative (subject or predicate) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> (is) understood: "God is thy throne" or "Thy throne is God." Either makes good sense.</p>
<p><b>Sceptre </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραβδος</span></span>). Old word for walking-stick, staff (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:21">Hebrews 11:21</span>). </p>
