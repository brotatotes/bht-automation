 O God  (ο θεος). This quotation (the fifth) is from Psalms 45:7. A Hebrew nuptial ode (επιθαλαμιυμ) for a king treated here as Messianic. It is not certain whether ο θεος is here the vocative (address with the nominative form as in John 20:28 with the Messiah termed θεος as is possible, John 1:18) or ο θεος is nominative (subject or predicate) with εστιν (is) understood: "God is thy throne" or "Thy throne is God." Either makes good sense.Sceptre  (ραβδος). Old word for walking-stick, staff (Hebrews 11:21).
