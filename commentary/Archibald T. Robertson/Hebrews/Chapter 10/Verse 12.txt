 When he had offered  (προσενεγκας). Second aorist active participle (with first aorist ending -ας in place of -ον) of προσφερω, single act in contrast to present participle προσφερων above.One sacrifice  (μιαν θυσιαν). This the main point. The one sacrifice does the work that the many failed to do. One wonders how priests who claim that the "mass" is the sacrifice of Christ's body repeated explain this verse.For ever  (εις το διηνεκες). Can be construed either with μιαν θυσιαν or with εκαθισεν (sat down). See Hebrews 1:3 for εκαθισεν.
