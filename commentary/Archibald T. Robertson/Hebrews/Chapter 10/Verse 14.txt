 He hath perfected  (τετελειωκεν). Perfect active indicative of τελειοω. He has done what the old sacrifices failed to do (verse Hebrews 10:1).Them that are sanctified  (τους αγιαζομενους). Articular participle (accusative case) present passive of αγιαζω (note perfect in verse Hebrews 10:10) either because of the process still going on or because of the repetition in so many persons as in Hebrews 2:11.
