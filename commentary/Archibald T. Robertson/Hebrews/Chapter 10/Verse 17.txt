<p>Here again the writer adds "their iniquities" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των ανομιων</span></span>) to "sins" of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:12">Hebrews 8:12</span> and reads <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνησθησομα</span></span> (first future passive) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνησθω</span></span> (first aorist passive subjunctive) of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:12">Hebrews 8:12</span> (the more common idiom). It is uncertain also whether the writer means verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:17">Hebrews 10:17</span> to be the principal clause with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:15">Hebrews 10:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:16">Hebrews 10:16</span> as subordinate or the whole quotation to be subordinate to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα το ειρηκενα</span></span> of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:15">Hebrews 10:15</span> with anacoluthon in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:18">Hebrews 10:18</span>. At any rate verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:17">Hebrews 10:17</span> in the quotation does not follow immediately after verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:16">Hebrews 10:16</span> as one can see in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:10-12">Hebrews 8:10-12</span> (skipping part of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:10">Hebrews 8:10</span> and all of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:11">Hebrews 8:11</span>). </p>
