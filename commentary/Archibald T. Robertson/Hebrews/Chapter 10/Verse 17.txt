Here again the writer adds "their iniquities" (των ανομιων) to "sins" of Hebrews 8:12 and reads μνησθησομα (first future passive) with ου μη rather than μνησθω (first aorist passive subjunctive) of Hebrews 8:12 (the more common idiom). It is uncertain also whether the writer means verse Hebrews 10:17 to be the principal clause with Hebrews 10:15; Hebrews 10:16 as subordinate or the whole quotation to be subordinate to μετα το ειρηκενα of verse Hebrews 10:15 with anacoluthon in verse Hebrews 10:18. At any rate verse Hebrews 10:17 in the quotation does not follow immediately after verse Hebrews 10:16 as one can see in Hebrews 8:10-12 (skipping part of Hebrews 8:10 and all of Hebrews 8:11).
