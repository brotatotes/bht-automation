<p><b> There is no more offering for sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκετ προσφορα περ αμαρτιας</span></span>). This is the logical and triumphant conclusion concerning the better sacrifice offered by Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13-10">Hebrews 9:13-10</span>). As Jeremiah had prophesied, there is actually remission (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεσις</span></span>, removal) of sins. Repetition of the sacrifice is needless. </p>
