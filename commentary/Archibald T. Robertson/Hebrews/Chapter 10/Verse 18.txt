 There is no more offering for sin  (ουκετ προσφορα περ αμαρτιας). This is the logical and triumphant conclusion concerning the better sacrifice offered by Christ (Hebrews 9:13-10). As Jeremiah had prophesied, there is actually remission (αφεσις, removal) of sins. Repetition of the sacrifice is needless.
