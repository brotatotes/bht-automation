<p><b> Having therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχοντες ουν</span></span>). The author now gives a second (the first in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1-6">Hebrews 8:1-6</span>) resume of the five arguments concerning the superior priestly work of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19-25">Hebrews 10:19-25</span>) coupled with an earnest exhortation like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14-16">Hebrews 4:14-16</span>, with which he began the discussion, before he proceeds to treat at length the fifth and last one, the better promises in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26-12">Hebrews 10:26-12</span>).</p>
<p><b>Boldness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησιαν</span></span>). This is the dominant note all through the Epistle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19">Hebrews 10:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:35">Hebrews 10:35</span>). They were tempted to give up Christ, to be quitters. Boldness (courage) is the need of the hour.</p>
<p><b>Into the holy place </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των αγιων</span></span>). That is, the heavenly sanctuary where Jesus is (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:18-20">Hebrews 6:18-20</span>). This is the better sanctuary (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:1-12">Hebrews 9:1-12</span>).</p>
<p><b>By the blood of Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω αιματ Ιησου</span></span>). This is the better sacrifice just discussed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13-10">Hebrews 9:13-10</span>). </p>
