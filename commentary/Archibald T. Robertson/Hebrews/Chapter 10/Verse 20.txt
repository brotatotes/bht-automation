 By the way which he dedicated for us  (ην ενεκαινισεν ημιν οδον). This "new" (προσφατον, freshly killed, newly made, from προς and the root of φατος, in the papyri, only here in N.T.) and "living" (ζωσαν) Jesus opened ("dedicated") for us by his Incarnation and Death for us. Thus he fulfilled God's promise of the "New Covenant" (Hebrews 8:7-13) in Jeremiah. The language is highly symbolic here and "through the veil" here is explained as meaning the flesh of Christ, his humanity, not the veil opening into heaven (Hebrews 6:20). Some do take "veil" here as obscuring the deity of Christ rather than the revelation of God in the human body of Christ (John 1:18; John 14:9). At any rate because of the coming of Christ in the flesh we have the new way opened for access to God (Hebrews 2:17; Hebrews 4:16).
