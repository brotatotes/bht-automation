<p><b> By the way which he dedicated for us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην ενεκαινισεν ημιν οδον</span></span>). This "new" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσφατον</span></span>, freshly killed, newly made, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> and the root of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φατος</span></span>, in the papyri, only here in N.T.) and "living" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωσαν</span></span>) Jesus opened ("dedicated") for us by his Incarnation and Death for us. Thus he fulfilled God's promise of the "New Covenant" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:7-13">Hebrews 8:7-13</span>) in Jeremiah. The language is highly symbolic here and "through the veil" here is explained as meaning the flesh of Christ, his humanity, not the veil opening into heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:20">Hebrews 6:20</span>). Some do take "veil" here as obscuring the deity of Christ rather than the revelation of God in the human body of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9">John 14:9</span>). At any rate because of the coming of Christ in the flesh we have the new way opened for access to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span>). </p>
