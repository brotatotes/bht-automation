 Cast not away therefore your boldness  (μη αποβαλητε ουν την παρρησιαν υμων). Prohibition with μη and the second aorist active subjunctive of αποβαλλω. Old verb to throw away from one as worthless, only twice in the N.T., here in a figurative sense and Mark 10:50 in a literal sense (garment by Bartimaeus). The Jewish Christians in question were in peril of a panic and of stampeding away from Christ. Recall κατεχωμεν in verse Hebrews 10:23.
