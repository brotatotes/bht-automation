Prohibition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποβαλλω</span></span>. Old verb to throw away from one as worthless, only twice in the N.T., here in a figurative sense and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:50">Mark 10:50</span> in a literal sense (garment by Bartimaeus). The Jewish Christians in question were in peril of a panic and of stampeding away from Christ. Recall <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεχωμεν</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:23">Hebrews 10:23</span>. </p>
