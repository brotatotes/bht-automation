<p><b> Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητις</span></span>). Your boldness of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:35">Hebrews 10:35</span>.</p>
<p><b>Recompense of reward </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθαποδοσιαν</span></span>). Late double compound, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθαποδοτης</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:6">Hebrews 11:6</span>), from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθος</span></span> (reward, wages) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδιδωμ</span></span>, to give back, to pay (repay). In N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:26">Hebrews 11:26</span>.</p>
<p><b>Of patience </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπομονης</span></span>). Old word for remaining under trial (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:15">Luke 8:15</span>). This was the call of the hour then as now.</p>
<p><b>Having done the will of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το θελημα του θεου</span></span>). This is an essential prerequisite to the exercise of patience and to obtain the promised blessing. There is no promise to those who patiently keep on doing wrong.</p>
<p><b>That ye may receive the promise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα κομισησθε την επαγγελιαν</span></span>) Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κομιζω</span></span>, old verb to carry (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:37">Luke 7:37</span>), in the middle to get back one's own (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:27">Matthew 25:27</span>), to receive. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:39">Hebrews 11:39</span>. Now the author is ready to develop this great idea of receiving the promise in Christ. </p>
