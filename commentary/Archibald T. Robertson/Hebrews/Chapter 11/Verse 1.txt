<p><b> Now faith is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν δε πιστις</span></span>). He has just said that "we are of faith" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:39">Hebrews 10:39</span>), not of apostasy. Now he proceeds in a chapter of great eloquence and passion to illustrate his point by a recital of the heroes of faith whose example should spur them to like loyalty now.</p>
<p><b>The assurance of things hoped for </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελπιζομενων υποστασις</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Hupostasis </b> is a very common word from Aristotle on and comes from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υφιστημ</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο</span></span>, under, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>, intransitive), what stands under anything (a building, a contract, a promise). See the philosophical use of it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>, the sense of assurance (une assurance certaine, Menegoz) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:14">Hebrews 3:14</span>, that steadiness of mind which holds one firm (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:4">2 Corinthians 9:4</span>). It is common in the papyri in business documents as the basis or guarantee of transactions. "And as this is the essential meaning in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span> we venture to suggest the translation 'Faith is the <i>title-deed</i> of things hoped for'" (Moulton and Milligan, <i>Vocabulary</i>, etc.).</p>
<p><b>The proving of things not seen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πραγματων ελεγχος ου βλεπομενων</span></span>). The only N.T. example of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγχος</span></span> (except Textus Receptus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:16">2 Timothy 3:16</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγμον</span></span>). Old and common word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγχω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:15">Matthew 18:15</span>) for "proof" and then for "conviction." Both uses occur in the papyri and either makes sense here, perhaps "conviction" suiting better though not in the older Greek. </p>
