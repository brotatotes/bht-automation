<p><b> Leaning upon the top of his staff </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ το ακρον της ραβδου αυτου</span></span>). From <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:31">Genesis 47:31</span>, but no word for "leaning." The quotation is from the LXX, the Hebrew having "the head of the bed," but the Hebrew word allows either meaning with different vowel points. </p>
