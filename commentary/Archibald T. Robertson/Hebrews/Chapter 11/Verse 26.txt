<p><b> The reproach of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον ονειδισμον του Χριστου</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:51">Psalms 89:51</span> for the language where "the Messiah" ("The Anointed One") is what is meant by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του Χριστου</span></span>, here rightly applied by the writer to Jesus as the Messiah who had his own shame to bear (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:12">Hebrews 13:12</span>). There is today as then (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:13">Hebrews 13:13</span>) a special reproach (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονειδισμος</span></span>, already, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:33">Hebrews 10:33</span>) in being a follower of Jesus Christ. Moses took this obloquy as "greater riches" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζονα πλουτον</span></span>) than "the treasures of Egypt" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των Αιγυπτου θησαυρων</span></span>, ablative case after comparative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζονα</span></span>, for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19">Matthew 6:19</span>). Moses was laying up treasure in heaven.</p>
<p><b>For he looked unto the recompense of reward </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεβλεπεν γαρ εις την μισθαποδοσιαν</span></span>). In perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποβλεπω</span></span>, "for he was looking away (kept on looking away)." For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθαποδοσια</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:35">Hebrews 10:35</span>. </p>
