 The reproach of Christ  (τον ονειδισμον του Χριστου). See Psalms 89:51 for the language where "the Messiah" ("The Anointed One") is what is meant by του Χριστου, here rightly applied by the writer to Jesus as the Messiah who had his own shame to bear (Hebrews 12:2; Hebrews 13:12). There is today as then (Hebrews 13:13) a special reproach (ονειδισμος, already, Hebrews 10:33) in being a follower of Jesus Christ. Moses took this obloquy as "greater riches" (μειζονα πλουτον) than "the treasures of Egypt" (των Αιγυπτου θησαυρων, ablative case after comparative μειζονα, for which see Matthew 6:19). Moses was laying up treasure in heaven.For he looked unto the recompense of reward  (απεβλεπεν γαρ εις την μισθαποδοσιαν). In perfect active of αποβλεπω, "for he was looking away (kept on looking away)." For μισθαποδοσια see Hebrews 10:35.
