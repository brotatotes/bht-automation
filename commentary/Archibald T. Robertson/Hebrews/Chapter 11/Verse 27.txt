<p><b> Not fearing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη φοβηθεις</span></span>). Negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> with first aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβεω</span></span> here used transitively with the accusative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:26">Matthew 10:26</span>. Moses did flee from Egypt after slaying the Egyptian (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:15">Exodus 2:15</span>), but the author omits that slaughter and ignores it as the dominant motive in the flight of Moses. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θυμον</span></span> (wrath) is common in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:28">Luke 4:28</span>), though here only in Hebrews.</p>
<p><b>He endured </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαρτερησεν</span></span>). First aorist (constative) active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρτερεω</span></span>, old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρτερος</span></span>, strong, here only in N.T. Moses had made his choice before slaying the Egyptian. He stuck to its resolutely.</p>
<p><b>As seeing him who is invisible </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αορατον ως ορων</span></span>). This is the secret of his choice and of his loyalty to God and to God's people. This is the secret of loyalty in any minister today who is the interpreter of God to man (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16-18">2 Corinthians 4:16-18</span>). </p>
