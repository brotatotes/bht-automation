<p><b> By faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστε</span></span>). Instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span> which he now illustrates in a marvellous way. Each example as far as verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:31">Hebrews 11:31</span> is formally and with rhetorical skill introduced by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστε</span></span>. After that only a summary is given.</p>
<p><b>We understand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νοουμεν</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νοεω</span></span>, old verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νους</span></span>, intellect) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:17">Matthew 15:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>. The author appeals to our knowledge of the world in which these heroes lived as an illustration of faith. Recent books by great scientists like Eddington and Jeans confirm the position here taken that a Supreme Mind is behind and before the universe. Science can only stand still in God's presence and believe like a little child.</p>
<p><b>The worlds </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους αιωνας</span></span>). "The ages" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span> (cf. Einstein's fourth dimension, time). Accusative case of general reference.</p>
<p><b>Have been framed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηρτισθα</span></span>). Perfect passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταρτιζω</span></span>, to mend, to equip, to perfect (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:40">Luke 6:40</span>), in indirect discourse after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νοουμεν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>So that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το</span></span>). As a rule <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το</span></span> with the infinitive is final, but sometimes as here it expresses result as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:3">Romans 12:3</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1003).</p>
<p><b>Hath been made </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγονενα</span></span>). Perfect active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>What is seen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το βλεπομενον</span></span>). Present passive articular participle (accusative case of general reference) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Of things which do appear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ φαινομενων</span></span>). Ablative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> (out of) of the present passive participle. The author denies the eternity of matter, a common theory then and now, and places God before the visible universe as many modern scientists now gladly do. </p>
