<p><b>Some better thing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρειττον τ</span></span>). "Something better," "the better promises" of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:6">Hebrews 8:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>That apart from us they should not be made perfect </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη χωρις ημων τελειωθωσιν</span></span>). Negative purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη</span></span> and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειοω</span></span>. But this glorious and gracious purpose (foresight) of God is not due to any special merit in us. It is simply the fulness of the time in God's dispensation of grace of which we are the beneficiaries. But all the same and all the more (<i>noblesse oblige</i>), we should prove worthy of our heritage and of God's goodness to us and be loyal to Christ. </p>
