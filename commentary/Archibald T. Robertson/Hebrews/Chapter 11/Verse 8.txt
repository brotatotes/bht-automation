 Not knowing whither he went  (μη επισταμενος που ερχετα). Usual negative μη with a participle (present middle from επισταμα, old and common verb to put the mind on). Present middle indicative (ερχετα) preserved in the indirect question after the secondary tense εξηλθεν (went out) from which επισταμενος gets its time. Abraham is a sublime and graphic example of faith. He did not even know where the land was that he was going to receive "as an inheritance" (εις κληρονομιαν).
