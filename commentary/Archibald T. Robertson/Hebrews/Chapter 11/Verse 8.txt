<p><b> Not knowing whither he went </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη επισταμενος που ερχετα</span></span>). Usual negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> with a participle (present middle from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισταμα</span></span>, old and common verb to put the mind on). Present middle indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχετα</span></span>) preserved in the indirect question after the secondary tense <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηλθεν</span></span> (went out) from which <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισταμενος</span></span> gets its time. Abraham is a sublime and graphic example of faith. He did not even know where the land was that he was going to receive "as an inheritance" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις κληρονομιαν</span></span>). </p>
