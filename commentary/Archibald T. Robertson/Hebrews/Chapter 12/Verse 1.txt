<p><b> Therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοιγαρουν</span></span>). Triple compound inferential participle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοι, γαρ, ουν</span></span>) like the German <i>doch denn nun</i>, a conclusion of emphasis, old particle, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:8">1 Thessalonians 4:8</span>. There should be no chapter division here, since <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1-3">Hebrews 12:1-3</span> really is the climax in the whole argument about the better promises (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19-12">Hebrews 10:19-12</span>) with a passionate appeal for loyalty to Christ.</p>
<p><b>Us also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ημεις</span></span>). We as well as "these all" of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:39">Hebrews 11:39</span> and all the more because of the "something better" given us in the actual coming of Christ.</p>
<p><b>Compassed about </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχοντες περικειμενον</span></span>). Literally, "having (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχοντες</span></span>, present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>) lying around us" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περικειμενον</span></span>, present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περικειμα</span></span>, old verb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:2">Luke 17:2</span>).</p>
<p><b>Cloud of witnesses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεφος μαρτυρων</span></span>). Old word (Latin <i>nubes</i>), here only in the N.T., for vast mass of clouds. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Νεφελη</span></span> is a single cloud. The metaphor refers to the great amphitheatre with the arena for the runners and the tiers upon tiers of seats rising up like a cloud. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρες</span></span> here are not mere spectators (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεατα</span></span>), but testifiers (witnesses) who testify from their own experience (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:2">Hebrews 11:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:4">Hebrews 11:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:5">Hebrews 11:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:33">Hebrews 11:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:39">Hebrews 11:39</span>) to God's fulfilling his promises as shown in chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:11">Hebrews 12:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>Laying aside </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποθεμενο</span></span>). Second aorist-middle (indirect, from ourselves) participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποτιθημ</span></span>, old verb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:8">Colossians 3:8</span> (laying off old clothes). The runners ran in the stadium nearly naked.</p>
<p><b>Every weight </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ογκον παντα</span></span>). Old word (kin to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεγκειν, φερω</span></span>) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορτοσ, βαρος</span></span>. Here every encumbrance that handicaps like doubt, pride, sloth, anything. No trailing garment to hinder or trip one.</p>
<p><b>The sin which doth so easily beset us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ευπεριστατον αμαρτιαν</span></span>). "The easily besetting sin." There are a dozen possible renderings of this double compound verbal from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ</span></span>, well, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιιστημ</span></span>, to place around or to stand around (intransitive). The Vulgate has <i>circumstans nos peccatum</i> (the sin standing around us). Probably this is the true idea here, "the easily encompassing (or surrounding) sin." In this case apostasy from Christ was that sin. In our cases it may be some other sin. The verbal adjective reminds one of the ring of wild beasts in the jungle that encircle the camp-fire at night each ready to pounce upon a careless victim.</p>
<p><b>Let us run </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρεχωμεν</span></span>). Present active volitive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρεχω</span></span>, "let us keep on running."</p>
<p><b>With patience </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' υπομονης</span></span>). Not with impatience, doubt, or despair.</p>
<p><b>The race that is set before us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον προκειμενον ημιν αγωνα</span></span>). Note the article and the present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκειμα</span></span>, old compound (already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:18">Hebrews 6:18</span>, and also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>). Dative case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημιν</span></span>) of personal interest. </p>
