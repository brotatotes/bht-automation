<p><b> Ye know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστε</span></span>). Regular form for the second person of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span> rather than the <i>Koine</i> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδατε</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>He was rejected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεδοκιμασθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδοκιμαζω</span></span>, old verb to disapprove (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>).</p>
<p><b>Place of repentance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοιας τοπον</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μετανοια</span></span> is change of mind and purpose, not sorrow though he had tears (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα δακρυων</span></span>) afterwards as told in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:38">Genesis 27:38</span>. He sought it (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτην</span></span>, the blessing <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευλογιαν</span></span>) with tears, but in vain. There was no change of mind in Isaac. The choice was irrevocable as Isaac shows (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+27:33">Genesis 27:33</span>). Esau is a tragic example of one who does a wilful sin which allows no second chance (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:6">Hebrews 6:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26">Hebrews 10:26</span>). The author presses the case of Esau as a warning to the Christians who were tempted to give up Christ. </p>
