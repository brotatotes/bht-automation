 To the general assembly  (πανηγυρε). Old word (from πας and αγυρισ, αγειρω). Here only in N.T. Πανηγυριζω occurs in Isaiah 66:10 for keeping a festal holiday. Possibly to be connected with αγγελων, though not certain.Church of the firstborn  (εκκλησια πρωτοτοκων). Probably an additional item besides the angelic host as the people of Israel are called firstborn (Exodus 4:22). The word εκκλησια here has the general sense of all the redeemed, as in Matthew 16:18; Colossians 1:18; Ephesians 5:24-32, and equivalent to the kingdom of God.Who are enrolled in heaven  (απογεγραμμενων εν ουρανοις). Perfect passive participle of απογραφω, old verb to write off, to copy, to enroll as in Luke 2:1; Luke 2:3; Luke 2:5 (only N.T. examples). Enrolled as citizens of heaven even while on earth (Luke 10:20; Philippians 1:27; Philippians 3:20; Philippians 4:3; Revelation 13:8, etc.).To God the Judge of all  (κριτη θεω παντων). All these chief substantives in the dative case. People should not forget that God is the Judge of all men.Made perfect  (τετελειωμενων). Perfect passive participle of τελειοω, perfected at last (Hebrews 11:40).
