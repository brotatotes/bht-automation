 To Jesus  (Ιησου). This great fact is not to be overlooked (Philippians 2:10). He is there as Lord and Saviour and still "Jesus."The mediator of a new covenant  (διαθηκης νεας μεσιτη). As already shown (Hebrews 7:22; Hebrews 8:6; Hebrews 8:8; Hebrews 8:9; Hebrews 8:10; Hebrews 9:15) and now gloriously consummated.To the blood of sprinkling  (αιματ ραντισμου). As in Hebrews 9:19-28.Than Abel  (παρα τον Αβελ). Accusative as in Hebrews 1:4.Better  (κρειττον). Comparative of καλος. Abel's blood still speaks (Hebrews 11:4), but it is as nothing compared to that of Jesus.
