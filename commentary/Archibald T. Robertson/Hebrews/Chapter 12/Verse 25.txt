<p><b> See </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπετε</span></span>). Earnest word as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span>. Driving home the whole argument of the Epistle by this powerful contrast between Mount Zion and Mount Sinai. The consequences are dreadful to apostates now, for Zion has greater terrors than Sinai, great as those were.</p>
<p><b>That ye refuse not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη παραιτησησθε</span></span>). Negative purpose with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the first aorist middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραιτεομα</span></span>, the same verb used in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:19">Hebrews 12:19</span> about the conduct of the Israelites at Sinai and also below.</p>
<p><b>Him that speaketh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον λαλουντα</span></span>). Present active articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:24">Hebrews 12:24</span> (Jesus speaking by his blood).</p>
<p><b>For if they did not escape </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε γαρ εκεινο ουκ εξεφυγον</span></span>). Condition of first class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκφευγω</span></span>, to escape. Direct reference to Sinai with use of the same verb again (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραιτησαμενο</span></span>, when they refused).</p>
<p><b>Him that warned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον χρηματιζοντα</span></span>). That is Moses. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρηματιζω</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:7">Hebrews 11:7</span>.</p>
<p><b>Much more we </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολυ μαλλον ημεις</span></span>). Argument from the less to the greater, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολυ</span></span>, adverbial accusative case. The verb has to be supplied from the condition, "We shall not escape." Our chance to escape is far less, "we who turn away (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστρεφομενο</span></span>, middle participle, turn ourselves away from) the one from heaven (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον απ' ουρανων</span></span>)," God speaking through his Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>). </p>
