 Then shook  (εσαλευσεν τοτε). Old verb as in Matthew 11:7.He hath promised  (επηγγελτα). Perfect middle indicative of επαγγελλω and it still holds. He quotes Haggai 2:6.Will I make to tremble  (σεισω). Old and strong verb (here future active) σειω, to agitate, to cause to tremble as in Matthew 21:10. The author applies this "yet once more" (ετ απαξ) and the reference to heaven (τον ουρανον) to the second and final "shaking" at the Second Coming of Jesus Christ for judgement (Hebrews 9:28).
