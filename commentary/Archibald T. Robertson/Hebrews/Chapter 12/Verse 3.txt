 Consider  (αναλογισασθε). First aorist middle imperative of αναλογιζομα, old word to reckon up, to compare, to weigh, only here in the N.T. See κατανοησατε in Hebrews 3:1. Understanding Jesus is the key to the whole problem, the cure for doubt and hesitation.Endured  (υπομεμενηκοτα). Perfect active participle of the same verb υπομενω used in verse Hebrews 12:2.Gainsaying  (αντιλογιαν). Old word from αντιλογος (from αντιλεγω), already in Hebrews 6:16; Hebrews 7:7.Of sinners  (υπο των αμαρτωλων). "By sinners."Against themselves  (εις εαυτους). Against their better selves if a genuine reading. But εις εαυτον (against himself), against Christ, is far more likely correct.That ye wax not weary  (ινα μη καμητε). Negative final clause with ινα μη and the second aorist active subjunctive of καμνω, old verb to be weary as here or sick as in James 5:15.Fainting in your souls  (ταις ψυχαις υμων εκλυομενο). Present passive participle of εκλυω, old verb to loosen out, to set free, and in passive to be enfeebled, to be tired out (here in soul with locative case), as in verse Hebrews 12:5. The rest of the Epistle drives home the argument.
