Predicate accusative after ειχομεν, "as chasteners." Old word from παιδευω, as agent (-της). Only once in LXX (Hosea 5:2) and twice in N.T. (here and Romans 2:20).We gave them reverence  (ενετρεπομεθα). Imperfect middle of old word εντρεπω, to turn in or at. Here "we turned ourselves to" as in Matthew 21:37, habitual attitude of reverence.Shall we be in subjection  (υποταγησομεθα). Second future passive of υποτασσω. There is no δε here to correspond to μεν in the first part of the verse.Unto the father of spirits  (τω πατρ των πνευματων). Rather, "Unto the Father of our spirits" (note article τον). As God is.
