 Of those beasts whose blood  (ων ζωων το αιμα τουτων). The antecedent (ζωων) of ων is here incorporated and attracted into the case of the relative, "the blood of which beasts" and then τουτων (genitive demonstrative) is added, "of these." Cf. Leviticus 4:12; Leviticus 4:21; Leviticus 16:27 for the Old Testament ritual in such cases. This is the only example in the LXX or N.T. where ζωων (animal) is used of a sacrificial victim. See also Exodus 29:14; Exodus 32:26 for burning without the camp.
