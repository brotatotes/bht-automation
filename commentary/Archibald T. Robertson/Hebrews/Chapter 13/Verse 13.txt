<p><b> Let us therefore go forth to him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοινυν εξερχωμεθα προς αυτον</span></span>). Inferential particle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοι, νυν</span></span>), usually post-positive (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:25">Luke 20:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:26">1 Corinthians 9:26</span>) only N.T. examples. Present middle volitive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξερχομα</span></span>. "Let us keep on going out there to him." If a separation has to come between Judaism and Christianity, let us give up Judaism, and go out to Christ "outside the camp" and take our stand with him there on Golgotha, "bearing his reproach (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον ονειδισμον αυτου φεροντες</span></span>) as Jesus himself endured the Cross despising the shame (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>) and as Moses accepted "the reproach of the Messiah" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:26">Hebrews 11:26</span>) in his day. The only decent place for the follower of Christ is beside the Cross of Christ with the reproach and the power (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1">Romans 8:1</span>) in it. This is the great passionate plea of the whole Epistle. </p>
