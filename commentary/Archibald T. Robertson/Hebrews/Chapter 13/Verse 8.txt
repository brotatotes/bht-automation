<p><b> Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, yea and forever </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησους Χριστος εχθες κα σημερον ο αυτος κα εις τους αιωνας</span></span>). There is no copula in the Greek. Vincent insists that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> be supplied between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησους</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος</span></span>, "Jesus is Christ," but it more naturally comes after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος</span></span> as the Revised Version has it. The old adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχθες</span></span> is rare in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:52">John 4:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:28">Acts 7:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:8">Hebrews 13:8</span>). Here it refers to the days of Christ's flesh (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:3">Hebrews 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span>) and to the recent work of the leaders (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7">Hebrews 13:7</span>). "Today" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημερον</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:15">Hebrews 3:15</span>) is the crisis which confronts them. "Forever" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τους αιωνας</span></span>) is eternity as well as the Greek can say it. Jesus Christ is eternally "the same" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:12">Hebrews 1:12</span>) and the revelation of God in him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1">Hebrews 1:1</span>) is final and never to be superseded or supplemented (Moffatt). Hence the peril of apostasy from the only hope of man. </p>
