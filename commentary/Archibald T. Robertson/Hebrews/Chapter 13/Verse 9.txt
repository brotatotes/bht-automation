<p><b> Be not carried away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη παραφερεσθε</span></span>). Prohibition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and present passive imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραφερω</span></span>, old verb to lead along (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:12">Jude 1:12</span>), to carry past (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:36">Mark 14:36</span>), to lead astray as here.</p>
<p><b>By divers and strange teachings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδαχαις ποικιλαις κα ξεναις</span></span>). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποικιλος</span></span> (many coloured) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ξενος</span></span> for guest we have had in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>, but here as adjective meaning unheard of (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:12">1 Peter 4:12</span>) as in older Greek also. The new is not always wrong any more than the old is always right (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:52">Matthew 13:52</span>). But the air was already full of new and strange teachings that fascinated many by their very novelty. The warning here is always needed. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6-9">Galatians 1:6-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:16">2 Timothy 3:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>That the heart be established by grace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριτ βεβαιουσθα την καρδιαν</span></span>). Present passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεβαιοω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαινω</span></span>) to make stable with the instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριτ</span></span> (by grace) and the accusative of general reference (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την καρδιαν</span></span>). How true it is that in the atmosphere of so many windy theories only the heart is stable that has an experience of God's grace in Christ.</p>
<p><b>That occupied themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο περιπατουντες</span></span>). "That walked" in the ritualistic Jewish rules about meats.</p>
<p><b>Were not profited </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ωφεληθησαν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφελεω</span></span>, to help. Mere Jewish ceremonialism and ritualism failed to build up the spiritual life. It was sheer folly to give up Christ for Pharisaism or for Moses. </p>
