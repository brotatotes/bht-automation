<p><b> Therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τουτο</span></span>). Because Jesus is superior to prophets and angels and because the new revelation is superior to the old. The author often pauses in his argument, as here, to drive home a pungent exhortation.</p>

Present active infinitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουν</span></span> (accusative singular of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νους</span></span>) understood as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:6">Acts 8:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>More earnest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσοτερως</span></span>). Comparative adverb, "more earnestly," "more abundantly" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:7">1 Thessalonians 2:7</span> <b> To the things that were heard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις ακουσθεισιν</span></span>).

Negative clause of purpose with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ποτε</span></span> and the second aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραρρεω</span></span>, old verb to flow by or past, to glide by, only here in N.T. (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:21">Proverbs 3:21</span>). Xenophon (Cyrop. IV. 52) uses it of the river flowing by. Here the metaphor is that "of being swept along past the sure anchorage which is within reach" (Westcott), a vivid picture of peril for all ("we," <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημας</span></span>). </p>
