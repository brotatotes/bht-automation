<p><b> It became him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επρεπεν αυτω</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεπω</span></span>, old verb to stand out, to be becoming or seemly. Here it is impersonal with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειωσα</span></span> as subject, though personal in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26">Hebrews 7:26</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αυτω</span></span> (him) is in the dative case and refers to God, not to Christ as is made plain by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αρχηγον</span></span> (author). One has only to recall <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span> to get the idea here. The voluntary humiliation or incarnation of Christ the Son a little lower than the angels was a seemly thing to God the Father as the writer now shows in a great passage (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10-18">Hebrews 2:10-18</span>) worthy to go beside <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:5-11">Philippians 2:5-11</span>.</p>
<p><b>For whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ον</span></span>). Referring to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span> (God) as the reason (cause) for the universe (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα παντα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Through whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ου</span></span>). With the genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> expresses the agent by whom the universe came into existence, a direct repudiation of the Gnostic view of intermediate agencies (aeons) between God and the creation of the universe. Paul puts it succinctly in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span> by his <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ αυτου κα δι' αυτου κα εις αυτον τα παντα</span></span>. The universe comes out of God, by means of God, for God. This writer has already said that God used his Son as the Agent (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ου</span></span>) in creation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>), a doctrine in harmony with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτωι, δι' αυτου εις αυτον</span></span>) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>In bringing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαγοντα</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγω</span></span> in the accusative case in spite of the dative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span> just before to which it refers.</p>
<p><b>The author </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αρχηγον</span></span>). Old compound word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχη</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγω</span></span>) one leading off, leader or prince as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:31">Acts 5:31</span>, one blazing the way, a pioneer (Dods) in faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>), author (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:15">Acts 3:15</span>). Either sense suits here, though author best (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>). Jesus is the author of salvation, the leader of the sons of God, the Elder Brother of us all (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>).</p>
<p><b>To make perfect </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειωσα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειοω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειος</span></span>). If one recoils at the idea of God making Christ perfect, he should bear in mind that it is the humanity of Jesus that is under discussion. The writer does not say that Jesus was sinful (see the opposite in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>), but simply that "by means of sufferings" God perfected his Son in his human life and death for his task as Redeemer and Saviour. One cannot know human life without living it. There was no moral imperfection in Jesus, but he lived his human life in order to be able to be a sympathizing and effective leader in the work of salvation. </p>
