<p><b> Unto my brethren </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις αδελφοις μου</span></span>). To prove his point the writer quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:22">Psalms 22:22</span> when the Messiah is presented as speaking "unto my brethren."</p>
<p><b>Congregation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησιας</span></span>). The word came to mean the local church and also the general church or kingdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:23">Hebrews 12:23</span>). Here we have the picture of public worship and the Messiah sharing it with others as we know Jesus often did. </p>
