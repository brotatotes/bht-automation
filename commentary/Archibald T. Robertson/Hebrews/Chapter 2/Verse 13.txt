 I will put my trust in him  (Εγω εσομα πεποιθως επ' αυτω). A rare periphrastic (intransitive) future perfect of πειθω, a quotation from Isaiah 8:17. The author represents the Messiah as putting his trust in God as other men do (cf. Hebrews 12:2). Certainly Jesus did this constantly. The third quotation (κα παλιν, And again) is from Isaiah 8:18 (the next verse), but the Messiah shows himself closely linked with the children (παιδια) of God, the sons (υιο) of verse Hebrews 2:10.
