<p><b> I will put my trust in him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω εσομα πεποιθως επ' αυτω</span></span>). A rare periphrastic (intransitive) future perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθω</span></span>, a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:17">Isaiah 8:17</span>. The author represents the Messiah as putting his trust in God as other men do (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>). Certainly Jesus did this constantly. The third quotation (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα παλιν</span></span>, And again) is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:18">Isaiah 8:18</span> (the next verse), but the Messiah shows himself closely linked with the children (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδια</span></span>) of God, the sons (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιο</span></span>) of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>. </p>
