<p><b> Are sharers in flesh and blood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεκοινωνηκεν αιματος κα σαρκος</span></span>). The best MSS. read "blood and flesh." The verb is perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνεω</span></span>, old verb with the regular genitive, elsewhere in the N.T. with the locative (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:13">Romans 12:13</span>) or with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>. "The children have become partners (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνο</span></span>) in blood and flesh."</p>
<p><b>Partook </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετεσχε</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετεχω</span></span>, to have with, a practical synonym for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνεω</span></span> and with the genitive also (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των αυτων</span></span>). That he might bring to nought (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα καταργηση</span></span>). Purpose of the incarnation clearly stated with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταργεω</span></span>, old word to render idle or ineffective (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα, αργος</span></span>), causative verb (25 times in Paul), once in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:7">Luke 13:7</span>), once in Hebrews (here). "By means of death" (his own death) Christ broke the power (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατος</span></span>) of the devil over death (paradoxical as it seems), certainly in men's fear of death and in some unexplained way Satan had sway over the realm of death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:5">Zechariah 3:5</span>). Note the explanatory <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτ' εστιν</span></span> (that is) with the accusative after it as before it. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:7">Revelation 12:7</span> Satan is identified with the serpent in Eden, though it is not done in the Old Testament. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:30">John 14:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:11">John 16:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:12">1 John 3:12</span>. Death is the devil's realm, for he is the author of sin. "Death as death is no part of the divine order" (Westcott). </p>
