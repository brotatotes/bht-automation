 Are sharers in flesh and blood  (κεκοινωνηκεν αιματος κα σαρκος). The best MSS. read "blood and flesh." The verb is perfect active indicative of κοινωνεω, old verb with the regular genitive, elsewhere in the N.T. with the locative (Romans 12:13) or with εν or εις. "The children have become partners (κοινωνο) in blood and flesh."Partook  (μετεσχε). Second aorist active indicative of μετεχω, to have with, a practical synonym for κοινωνεω and with the genitive also (των αυτων). That he might bring to nought (ινα καταργηση). Purpose of the incarnation clearly stated with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of καταργεω, old word to render idle or ineffective (from κατα, αργος), causative verb (25 times in Paul), once in Luke (Luke 13:7), once in Hebrews (here). "By means of death" (his own death) Christ broke the power (κρατος) of the devil over death (paradoxical as it seems), certainly in men's fear of death and in some unexplained way Satan had sway over the realm of death (Zechariah 3:5). Note the explanatory τουτ' εστιν (that is) with the accusative after it as before it. In Revelation 12:7 Satan is identified with the serpent in Eden, though it is not done in the Old Testament. See Romans 5:12; John 8:44; John 14:30; John 16:11; 1 John 3:12. Death is the devil's realm, for he is the author of sin. "Death as death is no part of the divine order" (Westcott).
