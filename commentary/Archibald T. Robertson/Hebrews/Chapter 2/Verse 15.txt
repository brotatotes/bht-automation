<p><b> And might deliver </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα απαλλαξη</span></span>). Further purpose with the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αππαλλασσω</span></span>, old verb to change from, to set free from, in N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:58">Luke 12:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:12">Acts 19:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>Through fear of death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβω θανατου</span></span>). Instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβος</span></span>. The ancients had great fear of death though the philosophers like Seneca argued against it. There is today a flippant attitude towards death with denial of the future life and rejection of God. But the author of Hebrews saw judgement after death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:27">Hebrews 9:27</span>). Hence our need of Christ to break the power of sin and Satan in death.</p>
<p><b>All their lifetime </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια παντος του ζηιν</span></span>). Present active infinitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πας</span></span> and the article in the genitive case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>, "through all the living."</p>
<p><b>Subject to bondage </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενοχο δουλειας</span></span>). Old adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεχω</span></span>, "held in," "bound to," with genitive, bond-slaves of fear, a graphic picture. Jesus has the keys of life and death and said: "I am the life." Thank God for that. </p>
