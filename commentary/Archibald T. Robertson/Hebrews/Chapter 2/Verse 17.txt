<p><b> Wherefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οθεν</span></span>). Old relative adverb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> and enclitic <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεν</span></span>, whence of place (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:44">Matthew 12:44</span>), of source (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span>), of cause as here and often in Hebrews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:3">Hebrews 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:18">Hebrews 9:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:19">Hebrews 11:19</span>).</p>
<p><b>It behoved him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφειλεν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειλω</span></span>, old verb to owe, money (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:28">Matthew 18:28</span>), service and love (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:8">Romans 13:8</span>), duty or obligation as here and often in N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:10">Luke 17:10</span>). Jesus is here the subject and the reference is to the incarnation. Having undertaken the work of redemption (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>), voluntarily (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:17">John 10:17</span>), Jesus was under obligation to be properly equipped for that priestly service and sacrifice.</p>
<p><b>In all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα παντα</span></span>). Except yielding to sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>) and yet he knew what temptation was, difficult as it may be for us to comprehend that in the Son of God who is also the Son of man (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:13">Mark 1:13</span>). Jesus fought through to victory over Satan.</p>
<p><b>To be made like unto his brethren </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις αδελφοις ομοιωθηνα</span></span>). First aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιοω</span></span>, old and common verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιος</span></span> (like), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:8">Matthew 6:8</span>, with the associative instrumental case as here. Christ, our Elder Brother, resembles us in reality (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span> "in the likeness of men") as we shall resemble him in the end (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span> "first-born among many brethren"; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span> "like him"), where the same root is used as here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιωμα, ομοιος</span></span>). That he might be (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα γενητα</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the second aorist middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>, to become, "that he might become." That was only possible by being like his brethren in actual human nature.</p>
<p><b>Merciful and faithful high priest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεημων κα πιστος αρχιερευς</span></span>). The sudden use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχιερευς</span></span> here for Jesus has been anticipated by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span> and see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>. Jesus as the priest-victim is the chief topic of the Epistle. These two adjectives (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεημων</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστος</span></span>) touch the chief points in the function of the high priest (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:1-10">Hebrews 5:1-10</span>), sympathy and fidelity to God. The Sadducean high priests (Annas and Caiaphas) were political and ecclesiastical tools and puppets out of sympathy with the people and chosen by Rome.</p>
<p><b>In things pertaining to God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα προς τον θεον</span></span>). The adverbial accusative of the article is a common idiom. See the very idiom <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα προς τον θεον</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+18:19">Exodus 18:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:17">Romans 15:17</span>. This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> we had already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:7">Hebrews 1:7</span>. On the day of atonement the high priest entered the holy of holies and officiated in behalf of the people.</p>
<p><b>To make propitiation for </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ιλασκεσθα</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το</span></span> and the infinitive (common Greek idiom), here present indirect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλασκομα</span></span>, to render propitious to oneself (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλαος</span></span>, Attic <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλεως</span></span>, gracious). This idea occurs in the LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+65:3">Psalms 65:3</span>), but only here in N.T., though in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:13">Luke 18:13</span> the passive form (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλασθητ</span></span>) occurs as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:18">2 Kings 5:18</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλασμος</span></span> used of Christ (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span>). The inscriptions illustrate the meaning in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span> as well as the LXX. </p>
