Instrumental case used with all four items. See Acts 2:22 for the three words for miracles in inverse order (powers, wonders, signs). Each word adds an idea about the εργα (works) of Christ.

For μερισμος for distribution (old word, in N.T. only here and Hebrews 4:12) see 1 Corinthians 12:4-30.According to his own will  (κατα την αυτου θελησιν).
