Neuter, not masculine τις (who). The insignificance of man is implied.The son of man  (υιος ανθρωπου). Not ο υιος του ανθρωπου which Jesus used so often about himself, but literally here "son of man" like the same words so often in Ezekiel, without Messianic meaning here.Visited  (επισκεπτη). Second person singular present indicative middle of επισκεπτομα, old verb to look upon, to look after, to go to see (Matthew 25:36), from which verb επισχοπος, overseer, bishop, comes.
