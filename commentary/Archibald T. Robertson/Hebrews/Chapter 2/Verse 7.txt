<p><b>Than the angels </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ' αγγελους</span></span>). "Beside angels" like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> with the accusative of comparison in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:9">Hebrews 1:9</span>. The Hebrew here has <i>Elohim</i> which word is applied to judges in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+82:1">Psalms 82:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+82:6">Psalms 82:6</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:34">John 10:34</span>). Here it is certainly not "God" in our sense. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+29:1">Psalms 29:1</span> the LXX translates <i>Elohim</i> by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υο θεου</span></span> (sons of God).</p>
