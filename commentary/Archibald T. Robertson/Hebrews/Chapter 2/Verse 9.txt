<p><b> Even Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησουν</span></span>). We do not see man triumphant, but we do see Jesus, for the author is not ashamed of his human name, realizing man's destiny, "the very one who has been made a little lower than the angels" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον βραχυ τ παρ' αγγελους ηλαττωμενον</span></span>), quoting and applying the language of the Psalm in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:7">Hebrews 2:7</span> to Jesus (with article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον</span></span> and the perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελατταω</span></span>). But this is not all. Death has defeated man, but Jesus has conquered death.</p>
<p><b>Because of the suffering of death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το παθημα του θανατου</span></span>). The causal sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> with the accusative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>. Jesus in his humanity was put lower than the angels "for a little while" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βραχυ τ</span></span>). Because of the suffering of death we see (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπομεν</span></span>) Jesus crowned (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστεφανωμενον</span></span>, perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στεφανοω</span></span> from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:7">Hebrews 2:7</span>), crowned already "with glory and honour" as Paul shows in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9-11">Philippians 2:9-11</span> (more highly exalted, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερυψωσεν</span></span>) "that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow." There is more glory to come to Jesus surely, but he is already at God's right hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>).</p>
<p><b>That by the grace of God he should taste death for every man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως χαριτ θεου υπερ παντος γευσητα θανατου</span></span>). This purpose clause (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως</span></span> instead of the more usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>) is pregnant with meaning. The author interprets and applies the language of the Psalm to Jesus and here puts Christ's death in behalf of (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span>), and so instead of, every man as the motive for his incarnation and death on the Cross. The phrase to taste death (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γευομα θανατου</span></span>) occurs in the Gospels (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:28">Matthew 16:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:1">Mark 9:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:27">Luke 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:52">John 8:52</span>), though not in the ancient Greek. It means to see death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:5">Hebrews 11:5</span>), "a bitter experience, not a rapid sip" (Moffatt). His death was in behalf of every one (not everything as the early Greek theologians took it). The death of Christ (Andrew Fuller) was sufficient for all, efficient for some. It is all "by the grace (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριτ</span></span>, instrumental case) of God," a thoroughly Pauline idea. Curiously enough some MSS. read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρις θεου</span></span> (apart from God) in place of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριτ θεου</span></span>, Nestorian doctrine whatever the origin. </p>
