<p><b> Holy brethren </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδελφο αγιο</span></span>). Only here in N.T., for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιοις</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:27">1 Thessalonians 5:27</span> only in late MSS. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:11">Hebrews 2:11</span> for same idea. First time the author makes direct appeal to the readers, though first person in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:1">Hebrews 2:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Partakers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετοχο</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:7">Luke 5:7</span> for "partners" in the fishing, elsewhere in N.T. only in Hebrews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:9">Hebrews 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:4">Hebrews 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:8">Hebrews 12:8</span>) in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Of a heavenly calling </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλησεως επουρανιου</span></span>). Only here in the N.T., though same idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span>. See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ανω κλησις</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:14">Philippians 3:14</span> (the upward calling). The call comes from heaven and is to heaven in its appeal.</p>
<p><b>Consider </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατανοησατε</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατανοεω</span></span>, old compound verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα, νους</span></span>), to put the mind down on a thing, to fix the mind on as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:3">Matthew 7:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:24">Luke 12:24</span>.</p>
<p><b>Even Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησουν</span></span>). No "even" in the Greek, just like the idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>, the human name held up with pride.</p>
<p><b>The Apostle and High Priest of our confession </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αποστολον κα αρχιερεα της ομολογιας ημων</span></span>). In descriptive apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησουν</span></span> and note the single article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον</span></span>. This is the only time in the N.T. that Jesus is called <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολος</span></span>, though he often used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστελλω</span></span> of God's sending him forth as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστειλας</span></span>). This verb is used of Moses as sent by God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:10">Exodus 3:10</span>). Moffatt notes that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολος</span></span> is Ionic for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβευτης</span></span>, "not a mere envoy, but an ambassador or representative sent with powers." The author has already termed Jesus high priest (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογια</span></span> (confession) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:13">2 Corinthians 9:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:12">1 Timothy 6:12</span>. These Hebrew Christians had confessed Jesus as their Apostle and High Priest. They do not begin to understand what Jesus is and means if they are tempted to give him up. The word runs through Hebrews with an urgent note for fidelity (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14">Hebrews 4:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:23">Hebrews 10:23</span>). See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομον</span></span>, same, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span>, say), to say the same thing, to agree, to confess, to profess. </p>
