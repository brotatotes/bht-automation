 Holy brethren  (αδελφο αγιο). Only here in N.T., for αγιοις in 1 Thessalonians 5:27 only in late MSS. See Hebrews 2:11 for same idea. First time the author makes direct appeal to the readers, though first person in Hebrews 2:1.Partakers  (μετοχο). See Luke 5:7 for "partners" in the fishing, elsewhere in N.T. only in Hebrews (Hebrews 1:9; Hebrews 6:4; Hebrews 12:8) in N.T.Of a heavenly calling  (κλησεως επουρανιου). Only here in the N.T., though same idea in Hebrews 9:15. See η ανω κλησις in Philippians 3:14 (the upward calling). The call comes from heaven and is to heaven in its appeal.Consider  (κατανοησατε). First aorist active imperative of κατανοεω, old compound verb (κατα, νους), to put the mind down on a thing, to fix the mind on as in Matthew 7:3; Luke 12:24.Even Jesus  (Ιησουν). No "even" in the Greek, just like the idiom in Hebrews 2:9, the human name held up with pride.The Apostle and High Priest of our confession  (τον αποστολον κα αρχιερεα της ομολογιας ημων). In descriptive apposition with Ιησουν and note the single article τον. This is the only time in the N.T. that Jesus is called αποστολος, though he often used αποστελλω of God's sending him forth as in John 17:3 (απεστειλας). This verb is used of Moses as sent by God (Exodus 3:10). Moffatt notes that αποστολος is Ionic for πρεσβευτης, "not a mere envoy, but an ambassador or representative sent with powers." The author has already termed Jesus high priest (Hebrews 2:17). For ομολογια (confession) see 2 Corinthians 9:13; 1 Timothy 6:12. These Hebrew Christians had confessed Jesus as their Apostle and High Priest. They do not begin to understand what Jesus is and means if they are tempted to give him up. The word runs through Hebrews with an urgent note for fidelity (Hebrews 4:14; Hebrews 10:23). See ομολογεω (ομον, same, λεγω, say), to say the same thing, to agree, to confess, to profess.
