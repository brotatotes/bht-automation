<p><b> Take heed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπετε</span></span>). Present active imperative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:2">Philippians 3:2</span> (three times) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπω</span></span> in place of the more usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορατε</span></span>. Solemn warning to the Jewish Christians from the experience of the Israelites as told in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:95">Hebrews 3:95</span>.</p>
<p><b>Lest haply there shall be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ποτε εστα</span></span>). Negative purpose with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ποτε</span></span> and the future indicative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:2">Mark 14:2</span>. But we have in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:8">Colossians 2:8</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη τις εστα</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:25">Hebrews 12:25</span>; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> occurs with the aorist subjunctive, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ποτε</span></span> with present subjunctive (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:1">Hebrews 4:1</span>) or aorist subjunctive (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:39">Acts 5:39</span>).</p>
<p><b>In any one of you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τιν υμων</span></span>). The application is personal and pointed.</p>
<p><b>An evil heart of unbelief </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρδια πονηρα απιστιας</span></span>). A remarkable combination.</p>
<p><b>Heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρδια</span></span>) is common in the LXX (about 1,000 times), but "evil heart" only twice in the O.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+16:12">Jeremiah 16:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+18:12">Jeremiah 18:12</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Απιστιας</span></span> is more than mere unbelief, here rather disbelief, refusal to believe, genitive case describing the evil heart marked by disbelief which is no mark of intelligence then or now.</p>
<p><b>In falling away from the living God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω αποστηνα απο θεου ζωντος</span></span>). "In the falling away" (locative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> of the second aorist active (intransitive) infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιστημ</span></span>, to stand off from, to step aside from (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> with the ablative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεου</span></span>) the living God (common phrase in the O.T. and the N.T. for God as opposed to lifeless idols)). "Remember that to apostatize from Christ in whom you have found God is to apostatize from God" (Dods). That is true today. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+20:8">Ezekiel 20:8</span> for this use of the verb. </p>
