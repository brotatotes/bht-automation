<p><b> For we are become partakers of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετοχο γαρ του Χριστου γεγοναμεν</span></span>). Second perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>, "we have become," not the equivalent of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσμεν</span></span> (are). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετοχο</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:9">Hebrews 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:4">Hebrews 6:4</span>. We have become partners with Christ and hence (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>, for) should not be tricked into apostasy.</p>
<p><b>If we hold fast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν περ κατασχωμεν</span></span>). The same condition as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> (indeed, forsooth) added to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span>. Jonathan Edwards once said that the sure proof of election is that one holds out to the end.</p>
<p><b>The beginning of our confidence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αρχην της υποστασεως</span></span>). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποστασις</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span>. These faltering believers (some even apostates) began with loud confidence and profession of loyalty. And now? </p>
