<p><b> While it is said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω λεγεσθα</span></span>). Locative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> of the articular present passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span>, "in the being said." Thus the author (cf. same phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+42:4">Psalms 42:4</span>) introduces the repeated quotation from verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:7">Hebrews 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:8">Hebrews 3:8</span>. Probably it is to be connected with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατασχωμεν</span></span>, though it can be joined with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλειτε</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:13">Hebrews 3:13</span> (treating <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:14">Hebrews 3:14</span> as a parenthesis). </p>
