<p><b> Who </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τινες</span></span>). Clearly interrogative, not indefinite (some).</p>
<p><b>Did provoke </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεπικραναν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραπικρινω</span></span>, apparently coined by the LXX like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραπικρασμος</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:15">Hebrews 3:15</span>) to which it points, exasperating the anger of God.</p>
<p><b>Nay, did not all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ου παντες</span></span>). "A favourite device of the diatribe style" (Moffatt), answering one rhetorical question with another (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:8">Luke 17:8</span>) as in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:17">Hebrews 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:18">Hebrews 3:18</span>, There was a faithful minority mentioned by Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:7">1 Corinthians 10:7</span>). </p>
