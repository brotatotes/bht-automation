 Who was faithful  (πιστον οντα). Present active participle with predicate accusative agreeing with Ιησουν, "as being faithful."That appointed him  (τω ποιησαντ αυτον). See 1 Samuel 12:6. Dative case of the articular participle (aorist active) of ποιεω and the reference is to God. Note πιστος as in Hebrews 2:17.As also was Moses  (ως κα Μωυσης). The author makes no depreciatory remarks about Moses as he did not about the prophets and the angels. He cheerfully admits that Moses was faithful "in all his house" (εν ολω τω οικω αυτου), an allusion to Numbers 12:7 (εαν ολω τω οικω μου) about Moses. The "his" is God's. The use of οικος for the people (family) of God, not the building, but the group (1 Timothy 3:15) in which God is the Father. But wherein is Jesus superior to Moses? The argument is keen and skilful.
