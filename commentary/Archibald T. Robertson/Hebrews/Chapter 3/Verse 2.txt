<p><b> Who was faithful </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστον οντα</span></span>). Present active participle with predicate accusative agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησουν</span></span>, "as being faithful."</p>
<p><b>That appointed him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω ποιησαντ αυτον</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+12:6">1 Samuel 12:6</span>. Dative case of the articular participle (aorist active) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span> and the reference is to God. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστος</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>.</p>
<p><b>As also was Moses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως κα Μωυσης</span></span>). The author makes no depreciatory remarks about Moses as he did not about the prophets and the angels. He cheerfully admits that Moses was faithful "in all his house" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ολω τω οικω αυτου</span></span>), an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:7">Numbers 12:7</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ολω τω οικω μου</span></span>) about Moses. The "his" is God's. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικος</span></span> for the people (family) of God, not the building, but the group (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span>) in which God is the Father. But wherein is Jesus superior to Moses? The argument is keen and skilful. </p>
