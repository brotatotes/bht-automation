<p><b> And Moses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα Μωυσης μεν</span></span>). "Now Moses indeed on his part" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν</span></span> contrasted with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>In </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>). Moses was in "God's house" "as a servant" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως θεραπων</span></span>). Old word, in LXX, only here in N.T. and quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:7">Numbers 12:7</span>. Kin to the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεραπευω</span></span>, to serve, to heal, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεραπεια</span></span>, service (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:11">Luke 9:11</span>) and a group of servants (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42">Luke 12:42</span>).</p>
<p><b>For a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις μαρτυριον των λαληθησομενων</span></span>). Objective genitive of the articular future passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span>. It is not certain what it means whether the "testimony" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυριον</span></span>) is to Moses or to God and whether it points on to Christ. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9">Hebrews 9:9</span> see <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολη</span></span> applied to the old dispensation as a symbol pointing to Christ and Christianity.</p>
<p><b>But Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος δε</span></span>). In contrast with Moses (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:5">Hebrews 3:5</span>).</p>
<p><b>As a son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως υιος</span></span>). Instead of a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεραπων</span></span> (servant).</p>
<p><b>Over his house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τον οικον αυτου</span></span>). The difference between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> added to that between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεραπων</span></span>. It is very neat and quite conclusive, especially when we recall the high place occupied by Moses in Jewish thought. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:11">Acts 7:11</span> the Jews accused Stephen of speaking "blasphemous words against Moses and God" (putting Moses on a par with God). </p>
