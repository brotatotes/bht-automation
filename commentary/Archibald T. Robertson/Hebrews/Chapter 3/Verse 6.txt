<p><b> Whose house are we </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου οικος εσμεν ημεις</span></span>). We Christians (Jew and Gentile) looked at as a whole, not as a local organization.</p>
<p><b>If we hold fast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν κατασχωμεν</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and second aorist (effective) active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεχω</span></span>. This note of contingency and doubt runs all through the Epistle. We are God's house if we do not play the traitor and desert.</p>
<p><b>Boldness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησιαν</span></span>)</p>
<p><b>and glorying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα καυχημα</span></span>) some had lost. The author makes no effort to reconcile this warning with God's elective purpose. He is not exhorting God, but these wavering Christians. All these are Pauline words. B does not have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεχρ τελους βεβαιαν</span></span> (firm unto the end), but it is clearly genuine in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:14">Hebrews 3:14</span>. He pleads for intelligent confidence. </p>
