<p><b> Wherefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διο</span></span>). Probably this inferential conjunction (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια, ο</span></span>, because of which) goes with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη σκληρυνητε</span></span> (harden not) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:8">Hebrews 3:8</span> rather than with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπετε</span></span> (take heed) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span> unless the long quotation be considered a parenthesis. The long quotation in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:7-11">Hebrews 3:7-11</span> is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:7-11">Psalms 95:7-11</span>. After the quotation the author has "three movements" (Moffatt) in his discussion of the passage as applied to the Jewish Christians (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12-19">Hebrews 3:12-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:1-10">Hebrews 4:1-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:11-13">Hebrews 4:11-13</span>). The peril of apostasy as shown by the example of the Israelites is presented with vividness and power.</p>
<p><b>As the Holy Ghost saith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως λεγε το πνευμα το αγιον</span></span>). Just this phrase nowhere else in the N.T., except <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:11">Acts 21:11</span> (Agabus), though practically the same idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:8">Hebrews 9:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:15">Hebrews 10:15</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span> the adjective "Holy" is wanting as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:2">Hebrews 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:3">Hebrews 3:3</span>. But the writer quotes this Psalm as the Word of God and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:7">Hebrews 4:7</span> attributes it to David.</p>
<p><b>If ye shall hear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ακουσητε</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span>. </p>
