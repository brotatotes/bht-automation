<p><b> Wherewith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span>). Literally, "where" (the wilderness) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+8:15">Deuteronomy 8:15</span>.</p>
<p><b>Tempted me by proving me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επειρασαν εν δοκιμασια</span></span>). No word for "me." The Israelites "tested" God "in putting to the proof" (only N.T. use of this word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμαζω</span></span> and this from the LXX). They were not content with God's promise, but demanded objective proof (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργα</span></span>, deeds) of God. </p>
