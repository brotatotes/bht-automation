 Wherewith  (ου). Literally, "where" (the wilderness) as in Deuteronomy 8:15.Tempted me by proving me  (επειρασαν εν δοκιμασια). No word for "me." The Israelites "tested" God "in putting to the proof" (only N.T. use of this word from δοκιμαζω and this from the LXX). They were not content with God's promise, but demanded objective proof (εργα, deeds) of God.
