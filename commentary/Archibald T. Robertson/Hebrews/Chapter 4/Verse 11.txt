 Let us therefore give diligence  (σπουδασωμεν ουν). Volitive subjunctive aorist of σπουδαζω, old verb to hasten (2 Timothy 4:9), to be eager and alert (1 Thessalonians 2:17). The exhortation has a warning like that in Hebrews 4:1.That no man fall  (ινα μη πεση). Negative purpose with ινα μη and the second aorist active subjunctive of πιπτω, to fall.After the same example of disobedience  (εν τω αυτω υποδειγματ της απειθειας). The unbelief is like that seen in the Israelites (Hebrews 3:12; Hebrews 3:18; Hebrews 4:2). Hυποδειγμα is a late word from υποδεικνυμ (Matthew 3:7) and means a copy (John 13:15; James 5:10). The Israelites set a terrible example and it is so easy to copy the bad examples.
