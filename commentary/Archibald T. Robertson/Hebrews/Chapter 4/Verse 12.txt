<p><b> The word of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λογος του θεου</span></span>). That just quoted about the promise of rest and God's rest, but true of any real word of God.</p>
<p><b>Living </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζων</span></span>). Cf. the Living God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span>). In Philo and the Book of Wisdom the Logos of God is personified, but still more in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1-18">John 1:1-18</span> where Jesus is pictured as the Logos on a par with God. "Our author is using Philonic language rather than Philonic ideas" (Moffatt). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:63">John 6:63</span>: "The words which I have spoken are spirit and are life."</p>
<p><b>Active </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργης</span></span>). Energetic, powerful (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:12">John 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:29">Colossians 1:29</span>).</p>
<p><b>Sharper </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τομωτερος</span></span>). Comparative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τομος</span></span>, cutting (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεμνω</span></span>, to cut), late adjective, here only in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Than </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span>). Often so after a comparative (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:8">Luke 16:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:13">2 Corinthians 12:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>Two-edged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διστομον</span></span>). "Two-mouthed" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι-, στομα</span></span>), double-mouthed like a river (Polybius), branching ways (Sophocles), applied to sword (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξιφος</span></span>) by Homer and Euripides.</p>
<p><b>Piercing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διικνουμενος</span></span>). Present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διικνεομα</span></span>, old verb to go through, here only in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Even to the dividing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ μερισμου</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεριζω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μερος</span></span>, part), to partition.</p>
<p><b>Of soul and spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχης κα πνευματος</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span>, but not an argument for trichotomy. Psychology is constantly changing its terminology.</p>
<p><b>Of both joints and marrow </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρμων τε κα μυελων</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρω</span></span>, to join, comes <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρμος</span></span>, old word, here only in the N.T. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μυελος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυω</span></span>, to shut), old word, here only in N.T. This surgeon goes into and through the joints and marrow, not cleaving between them.</p>
<p><b>Quick to discern </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριτικος</span></span>). Verbal adjective in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ικος</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>, skilled in judging, as the surgeon has to be and able to decide on the instant what to do. So God's word like his eye sees the secret lurking doubt and unbelief "of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενθυμησεων κα εννοιων καρδιας</span></span>). The surgeon carries a bright and powerful light for every dark crevice and a sharp knife for the removal of all the pus revealed by the light. It is a powerful picture here drawn. </p>
