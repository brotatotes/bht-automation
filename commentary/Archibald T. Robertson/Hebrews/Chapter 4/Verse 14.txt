 A great high priest  (αρχιερεα μεγαν). The author now takes up the main argument of the Epistle, already alluded to in Hebrews 1:3; Hebrews 2:17; Hebrews 3:1, the priestly work of Jesus as superior to that of the Levitical line (Hebrews 4:14-12). Jesus is superior to the prophets (Hebrews 1:1-3), to angels (Hebrews 1:4-2), to Moses (Hebrews 3:1-4), he has already shown. Here he only terms Jesus "great" as high priest (a frequent adjective with high priest in Philo) but the superiority comes out as he proceeds.Who hath passed through the heavens  (διεληλυθοτα τους ουρανους). Perfect active participle of διερχομα, state of completion. Jesus has passed through the upper heavens up to the throne of God (Hebrews 1:3) where he performs his function as our high priest. This idea will be developed later (Hebrews 6:19; Hebrews 7:26-28; Hebrews 9:11; Hebrews 9:24).Jesus the Son of God  (Ιησουν τον υιον του θεου). The human name linked with his deity, clinching the argument already made (Hebrews 1:1-4).Let us hold fast our confession  (κρατωμεν της ομολογιας). Present active volitive subjunctive of κρατεω, old verb (from κρατος, power), with genitive to cling to tenaciously as here and Hebrews 6:18 and also with the accusative (2 Thessalonians 2:15; Colossians 2:19). "Let us keep on holding fast." This keynote runs all through the Epistle, the exhortation to the Jewish Christians to hold on to the confession (Hebrews 3:1) of Christ already made. Before making the five points of Christ's superior priestly work (better priest than Aaron, Hebrews 5:1-7; under a better covenant, Hebrews 8:1-13; in a better sanctuary, Hebrews 9:1-12; offering a better sacrifice, Hebrews 9:13-10; based on better promises, Hebrews 10:19-12), the author gives a double exhortation (Hebrews 4:14-16) like that in Hebrews 2:1-4 to hold fast to the high priest (Hebrews 4:14) and to make use of him (Hebrews 4:16).
