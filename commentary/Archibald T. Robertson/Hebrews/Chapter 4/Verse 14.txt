<p><b> A great high priest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχιερεα μεγαν</span></span>). The author now takes up the main argument of the Epistle, already alluded to in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>, the priestly work of Jesus as superior to that of the Levitical line (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14-12">Hebrews 4:14-12</span>). Jesus is superior to the prophets (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1-3">Hebrews 1:1-3</span>), to angels (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4-2">Hebrews 1:4-2</span>), to Moses (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1-4">Hebrews 3:1-4</span>), he has already shown. Here he only terms Jesus "great" as high priest (a frequent adjective with high priest in Philo) but the superiority comes out as he proceeds.</p>
<p><b>Who hath passed through the heavens </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεληλυθοτα τους ουρανους</span></span>). Perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διερχομα</span></span>, state of completion. Jesus has passed through the upper heavens up to the throne of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>) where he performs his function as our high priest. This idea will be developed later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:19">Hebrews 6:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26-28">Hebrews 7:26-28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11">Hebrews 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:24">Hebrews 9:24</span>).</p>
<p><b>Jesus the Son of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησουν τον υιον του θεου</span></span>). The human name linked with his deity, clinching the argument already made (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1-4">Hebrews 1:1-4</span>).</p>
<p><b>Let us hold fast our confession </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατωμεν της ομολογιας</span></span>). Present active volitive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατεω</span></span>, old verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατος</span></span>, power), with genitive to cling to tenaciously as here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:18">Hebrews 6:18</span> and also with the accusative (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:15">2 Thessalonians 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:19">Colossians 2:19</span>). "Let us keep on holding fast." This keynote runs all through the Epistle, the exhortation to the Jewish Christians to hold on to the confession (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>) of Christ already made. Before making the five points of Christ's superior priestly work (better priest than Aaron, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:1-7">Hebrews 5:1-7</span>; under a better covenant, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1-13">Hebrews 8:1-13</span>; in a better sanctuary, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:1-12">Hebrews 9:1-12</span>; offering a better sacrifice, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13-10">Hebrews 9:13-10</span>; based on better promises, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19-12">Hebrews 10:19-12</span>), the author gives a double exhortation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14-16">Hebrews 4:14-16</span>) like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:1-4">Hebrews 2:1-4</span> to hold fast to the high priest (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14">Hebrews 4:14</span>) and to make use of him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span>). </p>
