<p><b> That cannot be touched with the feeling </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη δυναμενον συνπαθησα</span></span>). "Not able to sympathize with." First aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνπαθεω</span></span>, late compound verb from the late adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνπαθος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:15">Romans 12:15</span>), both from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνπασχω</span></span>, to suffer with (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:26">1 Corinthians 12:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>), occurring in Aristotle and Plutarch, in N.T. only in Hebrews (here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:34">Hebrews 10:34</span>).</p>
<p><b>One that hath been tempted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπειρασμενον</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζω</span></span>, as already shown in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>.</p>
<p><b>Without sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρις αμαρτιας</span></span>). This is the outstanding difference that must never be overlooked in considering the actual humanity of Jesus. He did not yield to sin. But more than this is true. There was no latent sin in Jesus to be stirred by temptation and no habits of sin to be overcome. But he did have "weaknesses" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασθενεια</span></span>) common to our human nature (hunger, thirst, weariness, etc.). Satan used his strongest weapons against Jesus, did it repeatedly, and failed. Jesus remained "undefiled" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμιαντος</span></span>) in a world of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:46">John 8:46</span>). This is our ground of hope, the sinlessness of Jesus and his real sympathy. </p>
