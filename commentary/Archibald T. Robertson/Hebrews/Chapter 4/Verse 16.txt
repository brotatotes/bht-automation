 Let us therefore draw near  (προσερχωμεθα ουν). Present active middle volitive subjunctive of προσερχομα. "Let us keep on coming to" our high priest, this sympathizing and great high priest. Instead of deserting him, let us make daily use of him. This verb in Hebrews means reverent approach for worship (Hebrews 7:25; Hebrews 10:1; Hebrews 10:22; Hebrews 11:6).Unto the throne of grace  (τω θρονω της χαριτος). This old word (θρονος) we have taken into English, the seat of kings and of God and so of Christ (Hebrews 1:3; Hebrews 1:8), but marked by grace because Jesus is there (Matthew 19:28). Hence we should come "with boldness" (μετα παρρησιας). Telling Jesus the whole story of our shortcomings.That we may receive mercy  (ινα λαβωμεν ελεος). Purpose clause with ινα and second aorist active subjunctive of λαμβανω.And find grace  (κα χαριν ευρωμεν). Second aorist active subjunctive of ευρισκω. We are sure to gain both of these aims because Jesus is our high priest on the throne.To help us in time of need  (εις ευκαιρον βοηθειαν). Βοηθεια is old word (from βοηθεω, Hebrews 2:18 which see), in N.T. only here and Acts 27:17. Ευκαιρος is an old word also (ευ, well, καιρος, opportunity), only here in N.T. "For well-timed help," "for help in the nick of time," before too late.
