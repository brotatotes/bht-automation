 For indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us  (κα γαρ εσμεν ευηγγελισμενο εσμεν). Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of ευαγγελιζω (from ευαγγελιον, good news, glad tidings) to bring good news, used here in its original sense as in verse Hebrews 4:6 of the Israelites (ευαγγελισθεντες first aorist passive participle).Even as also they  (καθαπερ κακεινο). See verse Hebrews 4:6. We have the promise of rest as the Israelites had. The parallel holds as to the promise, the privilege, the penalty.The word of hearing  (ο λογος της ακοης). As in 1 Thessalonians 2:13. Genitive ακοης describing λογος, the word marked by hearing (the word heard).Because they were not united by faith with them that heard  (μη συνκεκερασμενους τη πιστε τοις ακουσασιν). Μη, the usual negative of the participle. A very difficult phrase. The text is uncertain whether the participle (perfect passive of συνκεραννυμ, old verb to mix together) ends in -ος agreeing with λογος or -ους agreeing with εκεινους (them). Taking it in -ους the translation is correct. Πιστε is in the instrumental case and τοις ακουσασιν in the associative instrumental after συν.
