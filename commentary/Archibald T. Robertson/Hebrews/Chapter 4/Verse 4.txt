<p><b> Somewhere on this wise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">που ουτως</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:6">Hebrews 2:6</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">που τις</span></span> for a like indefinite allusion to an Old Testament quotation. Here it is <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:2">Genesis 2:2</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:11">Exodus 20:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+31:17">Exodus 31:17</span>). Moffatt notes that Philo quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:2">Genesis 2:2</span> with the same "literary mannerism."</p>
<p><b>Rested </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεπαυσεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταπαυω</span></span>, intransitive here, but transitive in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:8">Hebrews 4:8</span>. It is not, of course, absolute rest from all creative activity as Jesus shows in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:17">John 5:17</span>. But the seventh day of God's rest was still going on (clearly not a twenty-four hour day). </p>
