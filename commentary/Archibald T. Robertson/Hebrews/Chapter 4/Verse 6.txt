<p><b> It remaineth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολειπετα</span></span>). Present passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολειπω</span></span>, old verb to leave behind, to remain over. So again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:9">Hebrews 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26">Hebrews 10:26</span>. Here the infinitive clause (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινας εισελθειν εις αυτην</span></span>) is the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολειπετα</span></span>. This left-over promise is not repeated, though not utilized by the Israelites under Moses nor in the highest sense by Joshua and David.</p>
<p><b>Failed to enter in </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εισηλθον</span></span>). "Did not enter in" (second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισερχομα</span></span>). It is a rabbinical argument all along here, but the author is writing to Jews. </p>
