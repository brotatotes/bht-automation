<p><b> Joshua </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησους</span></span>). The Greek form is Jesus. Condition of the second class (determined as unfulfilled) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and aorist indicative in the condition and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> with the imperfect in the conclusion.</p>
<p><b>He would not have spoken </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ελαλε</span></span>). Wrong translation, "he would not speak" (be speaking), in the passage in David. Imperfect tense, not aorist. </p>
