 A sabbath rest  (σαββατισμος). Late word from σαββατιζω (Exodus 16:30) to keep the Sabbath, apparently coined by the author (a doubtful passage in Plutarch). Here it is parallel with καταπαυσις (cf. Revelation 14:13).For the people of God  (τω λαω του θεου). Dative case of blessed personal interest to the true Israel (Galatians 6:16).
