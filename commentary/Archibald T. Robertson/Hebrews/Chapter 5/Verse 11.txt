<p><b> Of whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ ου</span></span>). Or "concerning which," for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> can be either masculine or neuter (genitive). It is the likeness of Jesus as high priest to Melchizedek that the author has in mind. He is ready to discuss that but for the fear that the reader may fail to grasp his meaning, for he will run counter to the usual Jewish ideas. Hence he pauses to stir up the interest of the readers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:11-6">Hebrews 5:11-6</span>) before going on with the argument (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:1-28">Hebrews 7:1-28</span>).</p>
<p><b>Hard of interpretation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυσερμηνευτος</span></span>). Late and rare verbal compound (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυσ, ερμηνευω</span></span>), in Diodorus and Philo, here only in N.T. Hard to explain because of the strange (to Jews) line taken, but still more because of their dulness.</p>
<p><b>Dull of hearing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νωθρο ταις ακοαις</span></span>). Old adjective (papyri also), from negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νη</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωθεω</span></span>, to push, no push in the hearing, slow and sluggish in mind as well as in the ears. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:12">Hebrews 6:12</span> (slack, sluggish). Plato calls some students <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νωθρο</span></span> (stupid). </p>
