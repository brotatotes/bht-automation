 Who can bear gently  (μετριοπαθειν δυναμενος). Present active infinitive of the late verb μετριοπαθεω (μετριος, moderate, πατεω, to feel or suffer). It is a philosophical term used by Aristotle to oppose the απαθεια (lack of feeling) of the Stoics. Philo ranks it below απαθεια. Josephus (Ant. XII. 32) uses it of the moderation of Vespasian and Titus towards the Jews. It occurs here only in the N.T. "If the priest is cordially to plead with God for the sinner, he must bridle his natural disgust at the loathsomeness of sensuality, his impatience at the frequently recurring fall, his hopeless alienation from the hypocrite and the superficial, his indignation at any confession he hears from the penitent" (Dods).With the ignorant  (τοις αγνοουσιν). Dative case of the articular present active participle of αγνοεω, old verb not to know (Mark 9:32).And erring  (κα πλανωμενοις). Present middle participle (dative case) of πλαναω. The one article with both participles probably makes it a hendiadys, sins of ignorance (both accidence and sudden passion) as opposed to high-handed sins of presumption and deliberate purpose. People who sinned "willingly" (εκουσιως, Hebrews 10:26) had no provision in the Levitical system. For deliberate apostasy (Hebrews 3:12; Hebrews 10:26) no pardon is offered.Is compassed with infirmity  (περικειτα ασθενειαν). Present passive indicative of the old verb περικειμα here used transitively as in Acts 28:20 (αλυσιν, chain). The priest himself has weakness lying around him like a chain. Not so Jesus.
