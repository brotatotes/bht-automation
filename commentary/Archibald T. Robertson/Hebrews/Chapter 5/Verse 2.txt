<p><b> Who can bear gently </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετριοπαθειν δυναμενος</span></span>). Present active infinitive of the late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετριοπαθεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετριος</span></span>, moderate, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατεω</span></span>, to feel or suffer). It is a philosophical term used by Aristotle to oppose the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαθεια</span></span> (lack of feeling) of the Stoics. Philo ranks it below <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαθεια</span></span>. Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. XII. 32) uses it of the moderation of Vespasian and Titus towards the Jews. It occurs here only in the N.T. "If the priest is cordially to plead with God for the sinner, he must bridle his natural disgust at the loathsomeness of sensuality, his impatience at the frequently recurring fall, his hopeless alienation from the hypocrite and the superficial, his indignation at any confession he hears from the penitent" (Dods).</p>
<p><b>With the ignorant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις αγνοουσιν</span></span>). Dative case of the articular present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνοεω</span></span>, old verb not to know (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:32">Mark 9:32</span>).</p>
<p><b>And erring </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα πλανωμενοις</span></span>). Present middle participle (dative case) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλαναω</span></span>. The one article with both participles probably makes it a hendiadys, sins of ignorance (both accidence and sudden passion) as opposed to high-handed sins of presumption and deliberate purpose. People who sinned "willingly" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκουσιως</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26">Hebrews 10:26</span>) had no provision in the Levitical system. For deliberate apostasy (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26">Hebrews 10:26</span>) no pardon is offered.</p>
<p><b>Is compassed with infirmity </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περικειτα ασθενειαν</span></span>). Present passive indicative of the old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περικειμα</span></span> here used transitively as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:20">Acts 28:20</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλυσιν</span></span>, chain). The priest himself has weakness lying around him like a chain. Not so Jesus. </p>
