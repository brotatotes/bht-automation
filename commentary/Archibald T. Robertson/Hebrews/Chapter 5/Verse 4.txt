Dative case of personal interest (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτω</span></span>). The priest was called of God. This is the ideal and was true of Aaron. The modern minister is not a priest, but he also should be a God-called man and not one who pushes himself into the ministry or into ecclesiastical office. </p>
