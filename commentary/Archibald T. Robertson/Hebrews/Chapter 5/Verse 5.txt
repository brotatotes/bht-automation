<p><b> So Christ also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως κα ο Χριστος</span></span>). Just as with Aaron. Jesus had divine appointment as high priest also.</p>
<p><b>To be made </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενηθηνα</span></span>). First aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>High priest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχιερεα</span></span>). Predicate accusative agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτον</span></span> (himself) object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοξασεν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>But he that spake unto him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ο λαλησας προς αυτον</span></span>). Ellipsis of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοξασεν</span></span> to be supplied from preceding clause. God did glorify Jesus in appointing him priest as we see in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span> quoted already as Messianic (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5">Hebrews 1:5</span>). Jesus himself repeatedly claimed that the Father sent him on his mission to the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:30">John 5:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:43">John 5:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:54">John 8:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>, etc.). Bruce holds that Christ's priesthood is co-eval with his Sonship. Davidson thinks it is merely suitable because he is Son. Clearly the Father nominated (Dods) the Son to the Messianic priesthood (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>). </p>
