<p><b> In another place </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ετερω</span></span>). That is <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:4">Psalms 110:4</span>. It is this crucial passage by which the author will prove the superiority of Jesus to Aaron as high priest. Only the word priest (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερευς</span></span>) occurs here which the author uses as synonymous with high priest (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχιερευς</span></span>). The point lies in the meaning of the phrase "After the order of Melchizedek" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα την ταξιν Μελχισεδεκ</span></span>). But at this point the only thing pressed is the fact of the divine appointment of Jesus as priest. He returns to this point (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:10-7">Hebrews 5:10-7</span>). </p>
