 In the days of his flesh  (εν ταις ημεραις της σαρκος αυτου). Here (verses Hebrews 5:7-9) the author turns to the other requirement of a high priest (human sympathy). Since Jesus was "without sin" (Hebrews 4:15) he did not have to offer sacrifices "for himself," yet in all other points he felt the sympathy of the human high priest, even more so by reason of his victory over sin.Having offered up  (προσενεγκας). Second aorist active (-α form) participle of προσφερω (cf. verse Hebrews 5:3). An allusion to the Agony of Christ in Gethsemane.Supplications  (ικετηριας). Socrates, Polybius, Job (Job 40:22) combine this word with δεησεις (prayers) as here. The older form was ικεσια. The word ικετηριος is an adjective from ικετης (a suppliant from ικω, to come to one) and suggests one coming with an olive-branch (ελαια). Here only in the N.T.With strong crying and tears  (μετα κραυγης ισχυρας κα δακρυων). See Luke 22:44. for a picture of the scene in Gethsemane (anguish and pathos). No doubt the writer has in mind other times when Jesus shed tears (John 11:35; Luke 19:41), but Gethsemane chiefly.To save him from death  (σωζειν εκ θανατου). A reference to the cry of Jesus in Gethsemane (Matthew 26:39).Having been heard for his godly fear  (εισακουσθεις απο της ευλαβειας). Old word from ευλαβης (taking hold well, Luke 2:25 from ευ, λαμβανω, the verb ευλαβεομα in N.T. only in Hebrews 11:7), in N.T. only here and Hebrews 12:28. Fine picture of Christ's attitude toward the Father in the prayer in Gethsemane and in all his prayers. Jesus in Gethsemane at once surrendered his will to that of the Father who heard his plea and enabled him to acquiesce in the Father's will.
