<p><b> In the days of his flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ταις ημεραις της σαρκος αυτου</span></span>). Here (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7-9">Hebrews 5:7-9</span>) the author turns to the other requirement of a high priest (human sympathy). Since Jesus was "without sin" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>) he did not have to offer sacrifices "for himself," yet in all other points he felt the sympathy of the human high priest, even more so by reason of his victory over sin.</p>
<p><b>Having offered up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσενεγκας</span></span>). Second aorist active (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-α</span></span> form) participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσφερω</span></span> (cf. verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:3">Hebrews 5:3</span>). An allusion to the Agony of Christ in Gethsemane.</p>
<p><b>Supplications </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικετηριας</span></span>). Socrates, Polybius, Job (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+40:22">Job 40:22</span>) combine this word with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεησεις</span></span> (prayers) as here. The older form was <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικεσια</span></span>. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικετηριος</span></span> is an adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικετης</span></span> (a suppliant from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικω</span></span>, to come to one) and suggests one coming with an olive-branch (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαια</span></span>). Here only in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>With strong crying and tears </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα κραυγης ισχυρας κα δακρυων</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:44">Luke 22:44</span>. for a picture of the scene in Gethsemane (anguish and pathos). No doubt the writer has in mind other times when Jesus shed tears (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:35">John 11:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:41">Luke 19:41</span>), but Gethsemane chiefly.</p>
<p><b>To save him from death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωζειν εκ θανατου</span></span>). A reference to the cry of Jesus in Gethsemane (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:39">Matthew 26:39</span>).</p>
<p><b>Having been heard for his godly fear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισακουσθεις απο της ευλαβειας</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευλαβης</span></span> (taking hold well, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:25">Luke 2:25</span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ, λαμβανω</span></span>, the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευλαβεομα</span></span> in N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:7">Hebrews 11:7</span>), in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:28">Hebrews 12:28</span>. Fine picture of Christ's attitude toward the Father in the prayer in Gethsemane and in all his prayers. Jesus in Gethsemane at once surrendered his will to that of the Father who heard his plea and enabled him to acquiesce in the Father's will. </p>
