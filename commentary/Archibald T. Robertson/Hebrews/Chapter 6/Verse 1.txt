<p><b> Wherefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διο</span></span>). Because of the argument already made about the difficulty of the subject and the dulness of the readers.</p>
<p><b>Let us cease to speak </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεντες τον λογον</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιημ</span></span>, to leave off or behind.</p>
<p><b>Of the first principles of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της αρχης του Χριστου</span></span>). Objective genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστου</span></span> (about Christ). "Leaving behind the discussion of the beginning about Christ," another way of saying again <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα στοιχεια της αρχης των λογιων του θεου</span></span> of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>And press on </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα φερωμεθα</span></span>). Volitive present subjunctive passive, "Let us be borne on" (both the writer and the readers). The Pythagorean Schools use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερωμεθα</span></span> in precisely this sense of being borne on to a higher stage of instruction. Bleek quotes several instances of Greek writers using together as here of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεντες φερωμεθα</span></span> (Eurip., <i>Androm</i>. 393, for instance).</p>
<p><b>Unto perfection </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ την τελειοτητα</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειος</span></span> mature, adults as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:14">Hebrews 5:14</span>. Only twice in N.T. (here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:14">Colossians 3:14</span>). Let us go on to the stage of adults, not babes, able to masticate solid spiritual food. The writer will assume that the readers are adults in his discussion of the topic.</p>
<p><b>Not laying again the foundation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη παλιν θεμελιον καταβαλλομενο</span></span>). The regular idiom for laying down the foundation of a building (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμελιον</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:48">Luke 6:48</span>). The metaphor is common (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11">1 Corinthians 3:11</span>) and the foundation is important, but one cannot be laying the foundation always if he is to build the house. There are six items mentioned here as part of the "foundation," though the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδαχην</span></span> in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμελιον</span></span> may mean that there are only four included in the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμελιον</span></span>. Two are qualitative genitives after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμελιον</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοιας</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστεως</span></span>). What is meant by "dead works" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο νεκρων εργων</span></span>) is not clear (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>), though the reference may be to touching a corpse (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:1">Numbers 19:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+31:19">Numbers 31:19</span>). There are frequent allusions to the deadening power of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:17">James 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:26">James 2:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:25">John 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1">Romans 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:11">Romans 6:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8">Romans 7:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:13">Colossians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span>). The use of repentance and faith together occurs also elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:15">Mark 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:21">Acts 20:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:9">1 Thessalonians 1:9</span>). </p>
