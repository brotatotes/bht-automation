<p><b> Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span>). Which hope. What would life be without this blessed hope based on Christ as our Redeemer?</p>
<p><b>As an anchor of the soul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως αγκυραν της ψυχης</span></span>). Old word, literally in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:29">Acts 27:29</span>, figuratively here, only N.T. examples. The ancient anchors were much like the modern ones with iron hooks to grapple the rocks and so hold on to prevent shipwreck (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:19">1 Timothy 1:19</span>).</p>
<p><b>Both sure and steadfast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασφαλη τε κα βεβαιαν</span></span>). This anchor of hope will not slip (alpha privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφαλλω</span></span>, to totter) or lose its grip (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεβαια</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαινω</span></span>, to go, firm, trusty).</p>
<p><b>That which is within the veil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το εσωτερον του καταπετασματος</span></span>). The Holy of Holies, "the inner part of the veil" (the space behind the veil), in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:24">Acts 16:24</span> (of the inner prison). The anchor is out of sight, but it holds. That is what matters. </p>
