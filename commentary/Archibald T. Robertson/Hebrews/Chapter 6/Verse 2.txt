<p>The other four items are qualitative genitives with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδαχην</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισμων, επιθεσεως χειρων, αναστασεως νεκρων, κριματος αιωνιου</span></span>). The plural <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισμων</span></span> "by itself does not mean specifically Christian baptism either in this epistle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:10">Hebrews 9:10</span>) or elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:4">Mark 7:4</span>), but ablutions or immersions such as the mystery religions and the Jewish cultus required for initiates, proselytes, and worshippers in general" (Moffatt). The disciples of the Baptist had disputes with the Jews over purification (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:25">John 3:25</span>). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:2">Acts 19:2</span>. "The laying on of hands" seems to us out of place in a list of elementary principles, but it was common as a sign of blessing (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:13">Matthew 19:13</span>), of healing (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:32">Mark 7:32</span>), in the choice of the Seven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:6">Acts 6:6</span>), in the bestowal of the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:17">Acts 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:6">Acts 19:6</span>), in separation for a special task (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:3">Acts 13:3</span>), in ordination (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:22">1 Timothy 5:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span>). Prayer accompanied this laying on of the hands as a symbol. The resurrection of the dead (both just and unjust, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:15">Acts 24:15</span>) is easily seen to be basal (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:0">1 Corinthians 15:0</span>) as well as eternal judgment (timeless and endless). </p>
