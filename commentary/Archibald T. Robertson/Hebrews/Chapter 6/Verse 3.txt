 If God permit  (εανπερ επιτρεπη ο θεος). Condition of the third class with εανπερ (note περ indeed). See 1 Corinthians 16:7 (εαν ο κυριος επιτρεψη) and Acts 18:21 (του θεου θελοντος). It is not an idle form with the author. He means that he will go on with the argument and not attempt to lay again the foundation (the elements). Moffatt takes him to mean that he will teach them the elements at a later time (Hebrews 13:23) if the way opens, a less probable interpretation.
