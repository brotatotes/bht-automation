<p><b> It is impossible to renew them again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδυνατον παλιν ανακαινιζειν</span></span>). The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδυνατον</span></span> (impossible) comes first in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:4">Hebrews 6:4</span> without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> (is) and there is no "them" in the Greek. There are three other instances of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδυνατον</span></span> in Hebrews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:18">Hebrews 6:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:4">Hebrews 10:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:6">Hebrews 11:6</span>). The present active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακαινιζω</span></span> (late verb, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα, καινος</span></span>, here only in the N.T., but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακαινοω</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16">2 Corinthians 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδυνατον</span></span> bluntly denies the possibility of renewal for apostates from Christ (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12-4">Hebrews 3:12-4</span>). It is a terrible picture and cannot be toned down. The one ray of light comes in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:8-12">Hebrews 6:8-12</span>, not here.</p>
<p><b>Seeing they crucify to themselves afresh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστραυρουντας εαυτοις</span></span>). Present active participle (accusative plural agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους ... παραπεσοντας</span></span>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανασταυροω</span></span>, the usual verb for crucify in the old Greek so that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα-</span></span> here does not mean "again" or "afresh," but "up," <i>sursum</i>, not <i>rursum</i> (Vulgate). This is the reason why renewal for such apostates is impossible. They crucify Christ.</p>
<p><b>And put him to an open shame </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα παραδειγματιζοντας</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδειγματιζω</span></span>, late verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδειγμα</span></span> (example), to make an example of, and in bad sense to expose to disgrace. Simplex verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειγματισα</span></span> in this sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:19">Matthew 1:19</span>. </p>
