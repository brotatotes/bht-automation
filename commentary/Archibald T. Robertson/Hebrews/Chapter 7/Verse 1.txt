<p><b> This Melchizedek </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος ο Μελχισεδεκ</span></span>). The one already mentioned several times with whose priesthood that of Christ is compared and which is older and of a higher type than that of Aaron. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:18-20">Genesis 14:18-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:110">Genesis 14:110</span> for the only account of Melchizedek in the Old Testament. It is a daring thing to put Melchizedek above Aaron, but the author does it. Moffatt calls verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:1-3">Hebrews 7:1-3</span> "a little sermon" on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:20">Hebrews 6:20</span>. It is "for ever" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον αιωνα</span></span>) that he explains. Melchizedek is the only one in his line and stands alone in the record in Genesis. The interpretation is rabbinical in method, but well adapted to Jewish readers. The description is taken verbatim from Genesis except that "who met" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο συναντησας</span></span>) is here applied to Melchizedek from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:17">Genesis 14:17</span> instead of to the King of Sodom. They both met Abraham as a matter of fact. For this verb (first aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνανταω</span></span>) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:37">Luke 9:37</span>.</p>
<p><b>Slaughter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπης</span></span>). Old word for cutting (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπτω</span></span>, to cut), here only in N.T. These kings were Amraphel, Arioch, Chedorlaomer, Tidal. Amraphel is usually taken to be Khammurabi.</p>
<p><b>Priest of God Most High </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερευς του θεου του υψιστου</span></span>). He is called "priest" and note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του υψιστου</span></span> applied to God as the Canaanites, Phoenicians, Hebrews did. It is used also of Zeus and the Maccabean priest-kings. The demons apply it to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:7">Mark 5:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:28">Luke 8:28</span>). </p>
