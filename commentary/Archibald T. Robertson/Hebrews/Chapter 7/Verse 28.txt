<p><b> After the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα τον νομον</span></span>). As shown in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:11-19">Hebrews 7:11-19</span>, and with an oath (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:4">Psalms 110:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>Son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιον</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span> linked with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:4">Psalms 110:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>Perfected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετελειωμενον</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειοω</span></span>. The process (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>) was now complete. Imperfect and sinful as we are we demand a permanent high priest who is sinless and perfectly equipped by divine appointment and human experience (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:1-10">Hebrews 5:1-10</span>) to meet our needs, and with the perfect offering of himself as sacrifice. </p>
