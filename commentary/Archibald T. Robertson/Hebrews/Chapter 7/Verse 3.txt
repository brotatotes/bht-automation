<p><b> Without father, without mother, without genealogy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απατωρ, αμητωρ, αγενεαλογητος</span></span>). Alliteration like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:30">Romans 1:30</span>, the first two old words, the third coined by the author (found nowhere else) and meaning simply "devoid of any genealogy." The argument is that from silence, made much of by Philo, but not to be pressed. The record in Genesis tells nothing of any genealogy. Melchizedek stands alone. He is not to be understood as a miraculous being without birth or death. Melchizedek has been made more mysterious than he is by reading into this interpretation what is not there.</p>
<p><b>Made like </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφωμοιωμενος</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφομοιοω</span></span>, old verb, to produce a facsimile or copy, only here in N.T. The likeness is in the picture drawn in Genesis, not in the man himself. Such artificial interpretation does not amount to proof, but only serves as a parallel or illustration.</p>
<p><b>Unto the Son of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω υιω του θεου</span></span>). Associative instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Abideth a priest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενε ιερευς</span></span>). According to the record in Genesis, the only one in his line just as Jesus stands alone, but with the difference that Jesus continues priest in fact in heaven.</p>
<p><b>Continually </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το διηνεκες</span></span>). Old phrase (for the continuity) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον αιωνα</span></span>, in N.T. only in Hebrews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:3">Hebrews 7:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:14">Hebrews 10:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:21">Hebrews 10:21</span>). </p>
