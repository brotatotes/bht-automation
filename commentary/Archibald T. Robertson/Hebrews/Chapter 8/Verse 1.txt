<p><b> In the things which we are saying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τοις λεγομενοις</span></span>). Locative case of the articular present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:5">Luke 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:4">Hebrews 11:4</span>, "in the matter of the things being discussed."</p>
<p><b>The chief point </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφαλαιον</span></span>). Neuter singular of the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφαλαιος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφαλη</span></span>, head), belonging to the head. Vulgate <i>capitulum</i>, nominative absolute in old and common sense, the main matter (even so without the article as in Thucydides), "the pith" (Coverdale), common in the papyri as in Greek literature. The word also occurs in the sense of the sum total or a sum of money (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:28">Acts 22:28</span>) as in Plutarch, Josephus, and also in the papyri (Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>).</p>
<p><b>Such an high priest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοιουτον αρχιερεα</span></span>). As the one described in chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16-7">Hebrews 4:16-7</span> and in particular <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26">Hebrews 7:26</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοιουτος</span></span>) <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:27">Hebrews 7:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:28">Hebrews 7:28</span>. But the discussion of the priestly work of Jesus continues through <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:3">Hebrews 12:3</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τοιουτος</span></span> is both retrospective and prospective. Here we have a summary of the five points of superiority of Jesus as high priest (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1-6">Hebrews 8:1-6</span>). He is himself a better priest than Aaron (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοιουτος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1">Hebrews 8:1</span> such as shown in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16-7">Hebrews 4:16-7</span>); he works in a better sanctuary (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:2">Hebrews 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>); he offers a better sacrifice (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:3">Hebrews 8:3</span>); he is mediator of a better covenant (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:6">Hebrews 8:6</span>); his work rests on better promises (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:6">Hebrews 8:6</span>); hence he has obtained a better ministry as a whole (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:6">Hebrews 8:6</span>). In this resume (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφελαιον</span></span>) the author gives the pith (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφαλαιον</span></span>) of his argument, curiously enough with both senses of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεφαλαιον</span></span> (pith, summary) pertinent. He will discuss the four points remaining thus: (1) the better covenant, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:7-13">Hebrews 8:7-13</span>. (2) The better sanctuary, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:1-12">Hebrews 9:1-12</span>. (3) The better sacrifice, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13-10">Hebrews 9:13-10</span>. (4) The better promises, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19-12">Hebrews 10:19-12</span>. One point (the better high priest, like Melchizedek) has already been discussed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16-7">Hebrews 4:16-7</span>).</p>
<p><b>Sat down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθισεν</span></span>). Repetition of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θρονου</span></span> (the throne) added. This phrase prepares the way for the next point. </p>
