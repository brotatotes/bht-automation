 This  (αυτη). The "new" one of verse Hebrews 8:8.That I will make  (ην διαθησομα). Future middle of διατιθημ, "that I will covenant," cognate accusative (ην), using the same root in the verb as in διαθηκη.I will put  (διδους). "Giving," present active participle of διδωμ, to give.Into their mind  (εις την διανοιαν αυτων). Their intellect, their moral understanding, all the intellect as in Aristotle (Colossians 1:21; Ephesians 4:18).On their heart  (επ καρδιας αυτων). Either genitive singular or accusative plural. Καρδια is the seat of man's personal life (Westcott), the two terms covering the whole of man's inward nature.A god  (εις θεον). Note the Hebraistic use of εις in the predicate instead of the usual nominative θεος as in "a people" (εις λαον). This was the ideal of the old covenant (Exodus 6:7), now at last to be a fact.
