<p><b> This </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτη</span></span>). The "new" one of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:8">Hebrews 8:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>That I will make </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην διαθησομα</span></span>). Future middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διατιθημ</span></span>, "that I will covenant," cognate accusative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span>), using the same root in the verb as in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαθηκη</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>I will put </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδους</span></span>). "Giving," present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>, to give.</p>
<p><b>Into their mind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την διανοιαν αυτων</span></span>). Their intellect, their moral understanding, all the intellect as in Aristotle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:21">Colossians 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:18">Ephesians 4:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>On their heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ καρδιας αυτων</span></span>). Either genitive singular or accusative plural. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Καρδια</span></span> is the seat of man's personal life (Westcott), the two terms covering the whole of man's inward nature.</p>
<p><b>A god </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις θεον</span></span>). Note the Hebraistic use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> in the predicate instead of the usual nominative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span> as in "a people" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις λαον</span></span>). This was the ideal of the old covenant (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+6:7">Exodus 6:7</span>), now at last to be a fact. </p>
