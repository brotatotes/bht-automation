<p><b> In that he saith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω λεγειν</span></span>). Locative case of the articular present active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span>, "in the saying as to him."</p>
<p><b>He hath made the first old </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπαλαιωκεν την πρωτην</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλαιοω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλαιος</span></span> (in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινος</span></span>, fresh, new), to treat as old and out of date. The conclusion is to the point.</p>
<p><b>That which is becoming old and waxeth aged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το παλαιουμενον κα γηρασκον</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γηρασκω</span></span> is old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γηρας</span></span> (age) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γερων</span></span> (old man) and refers to the decay of old age so that both ideas appear here in opposition to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλαιος</span></span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεραιος</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Is nigh unto vanishing away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγγυς αφανισμου</span></span>). Genitive case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγγυς</span></span> and late word for disappearance (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφανιζω</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19">Matthew 6:19</span>), here only in the N.T. The author writes as if the Old Testament legal and ceremonial system were about to vanish before the new covenant of grace. If he wrote after A.D. 70, would he not have written "has vanished away"? </p>
