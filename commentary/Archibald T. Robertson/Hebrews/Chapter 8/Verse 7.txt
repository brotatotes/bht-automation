<p><b> That first covenant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η πρωτη εκεινη</span></span>). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαθηκη</span></span> (covenant) is not expressed, but clearly meant by the feminine gender <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτη</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Faultless </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμεμπτος</span></span>). Old compound adjective for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:6">Luke 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:15">Philippians 2:15</span>. The condition is second class and assumes that the old covenant was not "blameless," apparently a serious charge which he hastens to explain.</p>
<p><b>For a second </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευτερας</span></span>). Objective genitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαθηκης</span></span> understood. The conclusion with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and the imperfect passive indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζητειτο</span></span>) is clearly a second-class condition. See a like argument in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:11">Hebrews 7:11</span>. </p>
