 Only with meats and drinks and divers washings  (μονον επ βρωμασιν κα πομασιν κα διαφοροις βαπτισμοις). The parenthesis of the Revised Version here is unnecessary. The use of επ here with the locative case is regular, "in the matter of" (Luke 12:52; John 12:16; Acts 21:24). What ritual value these Levitical sacrifices had was confined to minute regulations about diet and ceremonial cleansing (clean and unclean). For "divers" (διαφοροις, late adjective, in N.T. only in Hebrews 1:4; Hebrews 8:6; Hebrews 9:10; Romans 12:6) say "different" or "various." Βαπτισμοις is, of course, the Jewish ceremonial immersions (cf. Mark 7:4; Exodus 29:4; Leviticus 11:25; Leviticus 11:28; Numbers 8:7; Revelation 6:2).Carnal ordinances  (δικαιωμασιν σαρκος). But the correct text is undoubtedly simply δικαιωματα σαρκος (nominative case), in apposition with δωρα τε κα θυσια (gifts and sacrifices). See Hebrews 9:1 for δικαιωματα.Imposed  (επικειμενα). Present middle or passive participle of επικειμα, old verb to lie upon (be laid upon). Cf. 1 Corinthians 9:16.Until a time of reformation  (μεχρ καιρου διορθωσεως). Definite statement of the temporary nature of the Levitical system already stated in Hebrews 7:10-17; Hebrews 8:13 and argued clearly by Paul in Galatians 3:15-22. Διορθωσις is a late word, here alone in N.T. (from διορθοω, to set right or straight), used by Hippocrates for making straight misshapen limbs like ανορθοω in Hebrews 12:12. Here for reformation like διορθωμα (reform) in Acts 24:2. Christianity itself is the great Reformation of the current Judaism (Pharisaism) and the spiritual Judaism foreshadowed by the old Abrahamic promise (see Hebrews 9:3; Hebrews 9:9).
