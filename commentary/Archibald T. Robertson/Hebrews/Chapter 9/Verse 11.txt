 Having come  (παραγενομενος). Second aorist middle participle of παραγινομα. This is the great historic event that is the crux of history. "Christ came on the scene, and all was changed" (Moffatt).Of the good things to come  (των μελλοντων αγαθων). But B D read γενομενων (that are come). It is a nice question which is the true text. Both aspects are true, for Christ is High Priest of good things that have already come as well as of the glorious future of hope. Westcott prefers γενομενων, Moffatt μελλοντων.Through the greater and more perfect tabernacle  (δια της μειζονος κα τελειοτερας σκηνης). Probably the instrumental use of δια (2 Corinthians 2:4; Romans 2:27; Romans 14:20) as accompaniment, not the local idea (Hebrews 4:14; Hebrews 10:20). Christ as High Priest employed in his work the heavenly tabernacle (Hebrews 8:2) after which the earthly was patterned (Hebrews 9:24).Not made with hands  (ου χειροποιητου). Old compound verbal for which see Mark 14:58; Acts 7:48; Acts 17:24. Cf. Hebrews 8:2. Here in the predicate position.Not of this creation  (ου ταυτης της κτισεως). Explanation of ου χιεροποιητου. For κτισις see 2 Corinthians 5:17; Romans 8:19. For the idea see 2 Corinthians 4:18; Hebrews 8:2. This greater and more perfect tabernacle is heaven itself (Hebrews 9:24).
