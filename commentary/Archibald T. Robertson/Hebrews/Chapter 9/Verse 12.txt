<p><b> Through his own blood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του ιδιου αιματος</span></span>). This is the great distinction between Christ as High Priest and all other high priests. They offer blood (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:7">Hebrews 9:7</span>), but he offered his own blood. He is both victim and High Priest. See the same phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:12">Hebrews 13:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>.</p>
<p><b>Once for all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφαπαξ</span></span>). In contrast to the repeated (annual) entrances of the Levitical high priests (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:7">Hebrews 9:7</span>).</p>
<p><b>Into the holy place </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τα αγια</span></span>). Here, as in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:8">Hebrews 9:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:24">Hebrews 9:24</span> heaven itself.</p>
<p><b>Having obtained </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευραμενος</span></span>). First aorist middle (indirect) participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκω</span></span>, simultaneous action with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισηλθεν</span></span>, and by or of himself "as the issue of personal labour directed to this end" (Westcott). The value of Christ's offering consists in the fact that he is the Son of God as well as the Son of man, that he is sinless and so a perfect sacrifice with no need of an offering for himself, and that it is voluntary on his part (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:17">John 10:17</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λυτρωσις</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυτροω</span></span>) is a late word for the act of ransoming (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυτρον</span></span>, ransom), in O.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:68">Luke 1:68</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:38">Luke 2:38</span>. But <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολυτρωσις</span></span> elsewhere (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:28">Luke 21:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:35">Hebrews 11:35</span>). For "eternal" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιωνιαν</span></span>, here feminine form) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:2">Hebrews 6:2</span>. The author now turns to discuss the better sacrifice (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13-10">Hebrews 9:13-10</span>) already introduced. </p>
