 Ashes  (σποδος). Old word, in N. T. only here, Matthew 11:21; Luke 10:13. Common in LXX.Of a heifer  (δαμαλεως). Old word (δαμαλις), a red heifer whose ashes mingled with water (μετα υδατος, verse Hebrews 9:19) were sprinkled (ραντιζουσα, present active participle of ραντιζω, in LXX, though ραινω more common) on the contaminated or defiled ones (Hebrews 9:19) as the blood of bulls and goats was offered for sins (Hebrews 9:16).Sanctify  (αγιαζε). First-class condition, assumed as true. This ceremonial ritual does serve "for the cleansing (καθαροτητα, old word here only in N.T.) of the flesh," but not for the conscience (verse Hebrews 9:9). The cow was αμωμον, the individual καθαρος.
