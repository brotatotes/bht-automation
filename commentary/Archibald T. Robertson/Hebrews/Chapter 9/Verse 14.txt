<p><b> How much more </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποσω μαλλον</span></span>). Instrumental case, "by how much more," by the measure of the superiority of Christ's blood to that of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer.</p>
<p><b>Through the eternal Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια πνευματος αιωνιου</span></span>). Not the Holy Spirit, but Christ's own spirit which is eternal as he is. There is thus a moral quality in the blood of Christ not in that of other sacrifices.</p>
<p><b>Offered himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτον προσηνεγκεν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσφερω</span></span> (used so often as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:1">Hebrews 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:3">Hebrews 5:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:3">Hebrews 8:3</span>). The voluntary character of Christ's death is again emphasized.</p>
<p><b>Without blemish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμωμον</span></span>). Old compound adjective (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:22">Colossians 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:19">1 Peter 1:19</span>) as the sacrifice had to be (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:1">Exodus 29:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+1:3">Leviticus 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+1:10">Leviticus 1:10</span>).</p>
<p><b>Shall cleanse from conscience </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαριε την συνειδησιν υμων</span></span>). Future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαριζω</span></span>. Some MSS. have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημων</span></span> (our). The old Greek used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαιρω</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαριζω</span></span> (in inscriptions for ceremonial cleansing, Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, pp. 216f.), for cleansing.</p>
<p><b>From dead works </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο νεκρων εργων</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:1">Hebrews 6:1</span>. "A pause might be made before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργων</span></span>, from dead--(not bodies but) works." </p>
