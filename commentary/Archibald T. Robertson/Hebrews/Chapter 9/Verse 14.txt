 How much more  (ποσω μαλλον). Instrumental case, "by how much more," by the measure of the superiority of Christ's blood to that of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer.Through the eternal Spirit  (δια πνευματος αιωνιου). Not the Holy Spirit, but Christ's own spirit which is eternal as he is. There is thus a moral quality in the blood of Christ not in that of other sacrifices.Offered himself  (εαυτον προσηνεγκεν). Second aorist active indicative of προσφερω (used so often as in Hebrews 5:1; Hebrews 5:3; Hebrews 8:3). The voluntary character of Christ's death is again emphasized.Without blemish  (αμωμον). Old compound adjective (Colossians 1:22; 1 Peter 1:19) as the sacrifice had to be (Exodus 29:1; Leviticus 1:3; Leviticus 1:10).Shall cleanse from conscience  (καθαριε την συνειδησιν υμων). Future active indicative of καθαριζω. Some MSS. have ημων (our). The old Greek used καθαιρω, not καθαριζω (in inscriptions for ceremonial cleansing, Deissmann, Bible Studies, pp. 216f.), for cleansing.From dead works  (απο νεκρων εργων). As in Hebrews 6:1. "A pause might be made before εργων, from dead--(not bodies but) works."
