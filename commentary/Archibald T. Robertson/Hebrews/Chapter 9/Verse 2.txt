 A tabernacle the first  (σκηνη η πρωτη). See Hebrews 8:2 for σκηνη. Large tents usually had two divisions (the outer and the inner or the first and the second). Note πρωτη for the first of two as with the first covenant (Hebrews 8:7; Hebrews 8:13; Hebrews 9:1). The large outer tent was entered first and was called Hαγια (Holy), the first division of the tabernacle. The two divisions are here termed two tabernacles.Was prepared  (κατεσκευασθη). First aorist passive of κατασκευαζω. See Hebrews 3:3. For the furniture see Hebrews 9:25; Hebrews 9:26. Three items are named here: the candlestick (η λυχνια, late word for λυχνιον) or lampstand, necessary since there were no windows (Exodus 25:31-39); the table (η τραπεζα, old word, Matthew 15:27) for the bread (Exodus 25:23-30; Leviticus 24:6 of pure gold); the shewbread (η προθεσις των αρτων) as in Exodus 25:30; Exodus 40:23; Leviticus 24:5-9. Probably a hendiadys for the table with the loaves of God's Presence.
