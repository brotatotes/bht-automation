<p><b> I may almost say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχεδον</span></span>). Old adverb, only three times in the N.T., here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:44">Acts 13:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:26">Acts 19:26</span>. Here it qualifies the entire clause, not just <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>With blood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αιματ</span></span>). In blood. There were exceptions (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:10">Exodus 19:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:30">Exodus 32:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+5:11">Leviticus 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+15:5">Leviticus 15:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:46">Numbers 16:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+31:23">Numbers 31:23</span>, etc.).</p>
<p><b>Apart from shedding of blood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρις αιματεκχυσιας</span></span>). A double compound first found here (coined by the writer) and later in ecclesiastical writers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιμα</span></span>, blood, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>, out, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χεω</span></span>, to pour, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκχυσις αιματος</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:28">1 Kings 18:28</span>). "Pouring out of blood." The author seems to have in mind Christ's words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:28">Matthew 26:28</span>: "This is my blood of the covenant which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins." The blood is the vital principle and is efficacious as an atonement. The blood of Christ sets aside all other plans for pardon. </p>
