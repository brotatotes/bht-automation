<p><b> The copies </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα υποδειγματα</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span> for this word, the earthly (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:4">Hebrews 8:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:1">Hebrews 9:1</span>) tabernacle.</p>
<p><b>With these </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτοις</span></span>). Instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>, like the rites above described (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:19">Hebrews 9:19</span>), perhaps with some disparagement.</p>
<p><b>Themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτα</span></span>). The heavenly realities (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:2">Hebrews 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11">Hebrews 9:11</span>).</p>
<p><b>With better sacrifices </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρειττοσιν θυσιαις</span></span>). Instrumental case again. Point of this section (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13-10">Hebrews 9:13-10</span>).</p>
<p><b>Than these </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα ταυτας</span></span>). Use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> and the accusative case after a comparative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:9">Hebrews 1:9</span>. To us it seems a bit strained to speak of the ritual cleansing or dedication of heaven itself by the appearance of Christ as Priest-Victim. But the whole picture is highly mystical. </p>
