 Made with hands  (χειροποιητα). See verse Hebrews 9:11 for this word.Like in pattern to the true  (αντιτυπα των αληθινων). Late compound word, only twice in N.T. (here, 1 Peter 3:21). Polybius uses αντιτυπος for infantry "opposite" to the cavalry. In modern Greek it means a copy of a book. Here it is the "counterpart of reality" (Moffatt). Moses was shown a τυπος (model) of the heavenly realities and he made an αντιτυπον on that model, "answering to the type" (Dods) or model. In 1 Peter 3:21 αντιτυπος has the converse sense, "the reality of baptism which corresponds to or is the antitype of the deluge" (Dods).Now to appear  (νυν εμφανισθηνα). Purpose clause by the first aorist passive infinitive of εμφανιζω (Matthew 27:53; John 14:21). For the phrase see Psalms 42:3. For this work of Christ as our High Priest and Paraclete in heaven see Hebrews 7:25; Romans 8:34; 1 John 2:1.
