Present middle (or passive) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκειμα</span></span>, "is laid away" for men. Cf. same verb in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:20">Luke 19:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span> (Paul's crown).</p>
<p><b>Once to die </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαξ αποθανειν</span></span>). Once for all to die, as once for all to live here. No reincarnation here.</p>
<p><b>After this cometh judgement </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα τουτο κρισις</span></span>). Death is not all. Man has to meet Christ as Judge as Jesus himself graphically pictures (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31-46">Matthew 25:31-46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25-29">John 5:25-29</span>). </p>
