<p><b> After the second veil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα το δευτερον καταπετασμα</span></span>). The first veil opened from outside into the Holy Place, the second veil opened from the Holy Place into the Holy of Holies (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hαγια Hαγιων</span></span>). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταπετασμα</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταπεταννυμ</span></span>, to spread down, and we have already had it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:19">Hebrews 6:19</span>. Cf. also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:51">Matthew 27:51</span>. </p>
