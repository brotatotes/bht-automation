<p><b> Having a golden censer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρυσουν εχουσα θυμιατηριον</span></span>). The present active participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχουσα</span></span> (feminine singular) agrees with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνη</span></span> (the Holy of Holies). It is not certain whether <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυμιατηριον</span></span> here means censer or altar of incense. In the LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+26:19">2 Chronicles 26:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+8:11">Exodus 8:11</span>; IV Macc. 7:11) it means censer and apparently so in the inscriptions and papyri. But in Philo and Josephus it means altar of incense for which the LXX has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυσιαστηριον του θυμιατος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:1-10">Exodus 30:1-10</span>). Apparently the altar of incense was in the Holy Place, though in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:1-10">Exodus 30:1-10</span> it is left quite vague. B puts it in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:2">Hebrews 9:2</span>. So we leave the discrepancy unsettled. At any rate the altar of incense was used for the Holy of Holies ("its ritual associations," Dods).</p>
<p><b>The ark of the covenant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την κιβωτον της διαθηκης</span></span>). A box or chest four feet long, two and a half broad and high (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:10">Exodus 25:10</span>). The Scotch have a "meal-ark."</p>
<p><b>Wherein </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν η</span></span>). In the ark. There were three treasures in the ark of the covenant (a pot of manna, Aaron's rod, the tables of the covenant). For the pot of manna (golden added in the LXX) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:32-34">Exodus 16:32-34</span>. For Aaron's rod that budded (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η βλαστησασα</span></span>, first aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλαστανω</span></span>) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+17:1-11">Numbers 17:1-11</span>. For the tables of the covenant see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:16">Exodus 25:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+31:18">Exodus 31:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+9:9">Deuteronomy 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+10:5">Deuteronomy 10:5</span>. Not definitely clear about these items in the ark, but on front, except that <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:9">1 Kings 8:9</span> states that it did contain the tables of the covenant. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλακες</span></span> (tables) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:3">2 Corinthians 3:3</span> (only other N.T. example). </p>
