<p><b> James </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιακωβος</span></span>). Grecised form (nominative absolute) of the Hebrew <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιακωβ</span></span> (so LXX). Common name among the Jews, and this man in Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. XX.9.1) and three others of this name in Josephus also.</p>
<p><b>Servant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span>). Bond-servant or slave as Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:1">Titus 1:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>Of the Lord Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριου Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). Here on a par with God (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεου</span></span>) and calls himself not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδελφος</span></span> (brother) of Jesus, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span>. The three terms here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1">James 2:1</span> have their full significance: Jesus is the Messiah and Lord. James is not an Ebionite. He accepts the deity of Jesus his brother, difficult as it was for him to do so. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριος</span></span> is frequent in the LXX for <i>Elohim</i> and <i>Jahweh</i> as the Romans applied it to the emperor in their emperor worship. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος Ιησους</span></span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:11">Philippians 2:11</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος Ιησους Χριστος</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>To the twelve tribes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταις δωδεκα φυλαις</span></span>). Dative case. The expression means "Israel in its fulness and completeness" (Hort), regarded as a unity (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:7">Acts 26:7</span>) with no conception of any "lost" tribes.</p>
<p><b>Which are of the Dispersion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταις εν τη διασπορα</span></span>). "Those in the Dispersion" (repeated article). The term appears in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+28:25">Deuteronomy 28:25</span> (LXX) and comes from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασπειρω</span></span>, to scatter (sow) abroad. In its literal sense we have it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:34">John 7:34</span>, but here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span> Christian Jews are chiefly, if not wholly, in view. The Jews at this period were roughly divided into Palestinian Jews (chiefly agriculturists) and Jews of the Dispersion (dwellers in cities and mainly traders). In Palestine Aramaic was spoken as a rule, while in the Western Diaspora the language was Greek (<i>Koine</i>, LXX), though the Eastern Diaspora spoke Aramaic and Syriac. The Jews of the Diaspora were compelled to compare their religion with the various cults around them (comparative religion) and had a wider outlook on life. James writes thus in cultural <i>Koine</i> but in the Hebraic tone.</p>
<p><b>Greeting </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρειν</span></span>). Absolute infinitive (present active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρω</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:23">Acts 15:23</span> (the Epistle to Antioch and the churches of Syria and Galatia). It is the usual idiom in the thousands of papyri letters known to us, but in no other New Testament letter. But note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρειν λεγετε</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:10">2 John 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:11">2 John 1:11</span>. </p>
