<p><b> Let no one say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεις λεγετω</span></span>). Present active imperative, prohibiting such a habit.</p>
<p><b>When he is tempted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζομενος</span></span>). Present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζω</span></span>, here in evil sense of tempt, not test, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:1">Matthew 4:1</span>. Verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12-18">James 1:12-18</span> give a vivid picture of temptation.</p>
<p><b>I am tempted of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο θεου πειραζομα</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> shows origin (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> with ablative case), not agency (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο</span></span>), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:13">Mark 1:13</span>, of Satan. It is contemptible, but I have heard wicked and weak men blame God for their sins. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+19:3">Proverbs 19:3</span>; Sirach 15:11f. Temptation does not spring "from God."</p>
<p><b>Cannot be tempted with evil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απειραστος κακων</span></span>). Verbal compound adjective (alpha privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζω</span></span>), probably with the ablative case, as is common with alpha privative (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 516), though Moulton (<i>Prolegomena</i>, p. 74) treats it as the genitive of definition. The ancient Greek has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απειρατος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραω</span></span>), but this is the earliest example of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απειραστος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζω</span></span>) made on the same model. Only here in the N.T. Hort notes <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απειρατος κακων</span></span> as a proverb (Diodorus, Plutarch, Josephus) "free from evils." That is possible here, but the context calls for "untemptable" rather than "untempted."</p>
<p><b>And he himself tempteth no man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζε δε αυτος ουδενα</span></span>). Because "untemptable." </p>
