<p><b> Ye know this </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστε</span></span>). Or "know this." Probably the perfect active indicative (literary form as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:17">Hebrews 12:17</span>, unless both are imperative, while in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:4">James 4:4</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδατε</span></span>, the usual vernacular <i>Koine</i> perfect indicative). The imperative uses only <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστε</span></span> and only the context can decide which it is. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εστο</span></span> (let be) is imperative.</p>
<p><b>Swift to hear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταχυς εις το ακουσα</span></span>). For this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το</span></span> with the infinitive after an adjective see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:9">1 Thessalonians 4:9</span>. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το</span></span> after adjectives see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:19">Romans 16:19</span>. The picture points to listening to the word of truth (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:18">James 1:18</span>) and is aimed against violent and disputatious speech (chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:1-12">James 3:1-12</span>). The Greek moralists often urge a quick and attentive ear.</p>
<p><b>Slow to speak </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βραδυς εις το λαλησα</span></span>). Same construction and same ingressive aorist active infinitive, slow to begin speaking, not slow while speaking.</p>
<p><b>Slow to anger </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βραδυς εις οργην</span></span>). He drops the infinitive here, but he probably means that slowness to speak up when angry will tend to curb the anger. </p>
