<p><b> Count it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγησασθε</span></span>). First aorist middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγεομα</span></span>, old verb to consider. Do it now and once for all.</p>
<p><b>All joy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασαν χαραν</span></span>). "Whole joy," " unmixed joy," as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:29">Philippians 2:29</span>. Not just "some joy" along with much grief.</p>
<p><b>When </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span>). "Whenever," indefinite temporal conjunction.</p>
<p><b>Ye fall into </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιπεσητε</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive (with the indefinite <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span>) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιπιπτω</span></span>, literally to fall around (into the midst of), to fall among as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:30">Luke 10:30</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ληισταις περιεπεσεν</span></span> (he fell among robbers). Only other N.T. example of this old compound is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:41">Acts 27:41</span>. Thucydides uses it of falling into affliction. It is the picture of being surrounded (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span>) by trials.</p>
<p><b>Manifold temptations </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειρασμοις ποικιλοις</span></span>). Associative instrumental case. The English word temptation is Latin and originally meant trials whether good or bad, but the evil sense has monopolized the word in our modern English, though we still say "attempt." The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειρασμος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζω</span></span>, late form for the old <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:21">Acts 26:21</span>, both in good sense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:6">John 6:6</span>, and in bad sense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span>) does not occur outside of the LXX and the N.T. except in Dioscorides (A.D. 100?) of experiments on diseases. "Trials" is clearly the meaning here, but the evil sense appears in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span> (clearly in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζω</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:13">James 1:13</span>) and so in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:8">Hebrews 3:8</span>. Trials rightly faced are harmless, but wrongly met become temptations to evil. The adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποικιλος</span></span> (manifold) is as old as Homer and means variegated, many coloured as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:6">2 Timothy 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:6">1 Peter 1:6</span> we have this same phrase. It is a bold demand that James here makes. </p>
