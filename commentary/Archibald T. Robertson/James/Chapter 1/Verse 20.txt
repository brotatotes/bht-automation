<p><b> The wrath of man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οργη ανδρος</span></span>). Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηρ</span></span> (as opposed to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυνη</span></span> woman), not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπος</span></span> of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:19">James 1:19</span> (inclusive of both man and woman). If taken in this sense, it means that a man's anger (settled indignation in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυμος</span></span>, boiling rage or fury) does not necessarily work God's righteousness. There is such a thing as righteous indignation, but one is not necessarily promoting the cause of God by his own personal anger. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:35">Acts 10:35</span> for "working righteousness," and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:9">James 2:9</span> for "working sin" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργαζομα</span></span> both times). </p>
