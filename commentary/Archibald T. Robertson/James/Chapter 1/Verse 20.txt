 The wrath of man  (οργη ανδρος). Here ανηρ (as opposed to γυνη woman), not ανθρωπος of verse James 1:19 (inclusive of both man and woman). If taken in this sense, it means that a man's anger (settled indignation in contrast with θυμος, boiling rage or fury) does not necessarily work God's righteousness. There is such a thing as righteous indignation, but one is not necessarily promoting the cause of God by his own personal anger. See Acts 10:35 for "working righteousness," and James 2:9 for "working sin" (εργαζομα both times).
