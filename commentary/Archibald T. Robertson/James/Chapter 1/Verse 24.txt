<p><b> He beholdeth himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατενοησεν εαυτον</span></span>). Usually explained as gnomic aorist like those in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:11">James 1:11</span>, but the ordinary force of the tenses is best here. "He glanced at himself (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατενοησεν</span></span> aorist) and off he has gone (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεληλυθεν</span></span> perfect active) and straightway forgot (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επελαθετο</span></span>, second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιλανθανομα</span></span>) what sort of a man he was" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οποιος ην</span></span>, back in the picture, imperfect tense). The tenses thus present a vivid and lifelike picture of the careless listener to preaching (Christ's wayside hearer). </p>
