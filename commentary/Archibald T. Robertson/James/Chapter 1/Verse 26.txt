<p><b> Thinketh himself to be religious </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκε θρησκος εινα</span></span>). Condition of first class (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ει-δοκε</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θρησκος</span></span> (of uncertain etymology, perhaps from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θρεομα</span></span>, to mutter forms of prayer) is predicate nominative after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα</span></span>, agreeing with the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκε</span></span> (either "he seems" or "he thinks"). This source of self-deception is in saying and doing. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θρησκος</span></span> is found nowhere else except in lexicons. Hatch (<i>Essays in Biblical Greek</i>, pp. 55-57) shows that it refers to the external observances of public worship, such as church attendance, almsgiving, prayer, fasting (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1-18">Matthew 6:1-18</span>). It is the Pharisaic element in Christian worship.</p>
<p><b>While he bridleth not his tongue </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη χαλιναγωγων γλωσσαν εαυτου</span></span>). "Not bridling his own tongue." A reference to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:19">James 1:19</span> and the metaphor is repeated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:12">James 3:12</span>. This is the earliest known example of the compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλιναγωγεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλινος</span></span>, bridle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγο</span></span>, to lead). It occurs also in Lucian. The picture is that of a man putting the bridle in his own mouth, not in that of another. See the similar metaphor of muzzling (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιμοω</span></span>) one's mouth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:12">Matthew 22:12</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφιμωθη</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Deceiveth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απατων</span></span>). Present active participle from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απατη</span></span> (deceit). He plays a trick on himself.</p>
<p><b>Religion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θρησκεια</span></span>). Later form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θρησκιη</span></span> (Herodotus) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θρησκος</span></span> above. It means religious worship in its external observances, religious exercise or discipline, but not to the exclusion of reverence. In the N.T. we have it also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:5">Acts 26:5</span> of Judaism and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span> of worshipping angels. It is vain (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ματαιος</span></span>, feminine form same as masculine) or empty. Comes to nothing. </p>
