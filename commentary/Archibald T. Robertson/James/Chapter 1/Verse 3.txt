<p><b>The proof </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το δοκιμιον</span></span>). Now known (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, pp. 259ff.) from the papyri examples of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμιος</span></span> as an adjective in the same sense (good gold, standard gold) as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμος</span></span> proved or tested (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το δοκιμιον</span></span> (neuter article with neuter single adjective) here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>, clearly means "the genuine element in your faith," not "crucible" nor "proving." Your faith like gold stands the test of fire and is approved as standard. James here, as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:6">James 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1">James 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:15">James 5:15</span>, regards faith (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span>) like Paul "as the very foundation of religion" (Mayor).</p>
