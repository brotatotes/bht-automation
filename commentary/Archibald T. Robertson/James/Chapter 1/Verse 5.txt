<p><b> Lacketh wisdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λειπετα σοφιας</span></span>). Condition of first class, assumed as true, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and present passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λειπω</span></span> to be destitute of, with ablative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφιας</span></span>. "If any one falls short of wisdom." A banking figure, to have a shortage of wisdom (not just knowledge, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωσεως</span></span>, but wisdom <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφιας</span></span>, the practical use of knowledge) .</p>
<p><b>Let him ask </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτειτω</span></span>). Present active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτεω</span></span>, "let him keep on asking."</p>
<p><b>Of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα του θεου</span></span>). "From (from beside) God," ablative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>. Liberally (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απλως</span></span>). This old adverb occurs here only in the N.T. (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απλους</span></span>, single-fold, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:22">Matthew 6:22</span>, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απλοτης</span></span>, simplicity, generosity, is common-- <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:2">2 Corinthians 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span>). But the adverb is common in the papyri by way of emphasis as simply or at all (Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>). Mayor argues for the sense of "unconditionally" (the logical moral sense) while Hort and Ropes agree and suggest "graciously." The other sense of "abundantly" or "liberally" suits the idea in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απλοτης</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:2">2 Corinthians 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span>, but no example of the adverb in this sense has been found unless this is one here. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:1">Isaiah 55:1</span> for the idea of God's gracious giving and the case of Solomon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+3:9-12">1 Kings 3:9-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+2:3">Proverbs 2:3</span>).</p>
<p><b>Upbraideth not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ονειδιζοντος</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονειδιζω</span></span> (old verb to reproach, to cast in one's teeth, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:11">Matthew 5:11</span>) in the ablative case like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδοντος</span></span> agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεου</span></span> and with the usual negative of the participle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span>). This is the negative statement of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδοντος απλως</span></span> (giving graciously). The evil habit of giving stinging words along with the money is illustrated in Sirach 41:22 and Plutarch (<i>De adulat.</i>, p. 64A). ] Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>And it shall be given him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα δοθησετα αυτω</span></span>). First future passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>, a blessed promise in accord with the words of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7">Matthew 7:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:11">Matthew 7:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:13">Luke 11:13</span>), meaning here not only "wisdom," but all good gifts, including the Holy Spirit. There are frequent reminiscences of the words of Jesus in this Epistle. </p>
