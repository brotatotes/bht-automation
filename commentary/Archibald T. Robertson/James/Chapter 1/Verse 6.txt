<p><b> In faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πιστε</span></span>). Faith here "is the fundamental religious attitude" (Ropes), belief in God's beneficent activity and personal reliance on him (Oesterley).</p>
<p><b>Nothing doubting </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν διακρινομενος</span></span>). Negative way of saying <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πιστε</span></span> (in faith), present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακρινω</span></span>, old verb to separate (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>) between (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>), to discriminate as shown clearly in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:12">Acts 11:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:9">Acts 15:9</span>, but no example of the sense of divided against oneself has been found earlier than the N.T., though it appears in later Christian writings. It is like the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαμεριζομα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:18">Luke 11:18</span> and occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:21">Matthew 21:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:23">Mark 11:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:20">Acts 10:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:20">Romans 4:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span>. It is a vivid picture of internal doubt.</p>
<p><b>Is like </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εοικεν</span></span>). Second perfect active indicative with the linear force alone from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εικω</span></span> to be like. Old form, but in N.T. only here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:23">James 1:23</span> (a literary touch, not in LXX).</p>
<p><b>The surge of the sea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλυδων θαλασσης</span></span>). Old word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλυζω</span></span> to wash against) for a dashing or surging wave in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυμα</span></span> (successive waves), in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:24">Luke 8:24</span>. In associative instrumental case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εοικεν</span></span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλυδονιζω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλυδων</span></span>), to toss by waves.</p>
<p><b>Driven by the wind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεμιζομενω</span></span>). Present passive participle (agreeing in case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλυδων</span></span>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεμιζω</span></span>, earliest known example and probably coined by James (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεμος</span></span>), who is fond of verbs in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ιζω</span></span> (Mayor). The old Greek used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεμοω</span></span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span> Paul uses both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλυδονιζω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιφερω ανεμω</span></span>. It is a vivid picture of the sea whipped into white-caps by the winds.</p>
<p><b>Tossed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ριπιζομενω</span></span>). Present passive participle also in agreement with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλυδων</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ριπιζω</span></span>, rare verb (Aristophanes, Plutarch, Philo) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ριπις</span></span> (a bellows or fire-fan), here only in N.T. It is a picture of "the restless swaying to and fro of the surface of the water, blown upon by shifting breezes" (Hort), the waverer with slight rufflement. </p>
