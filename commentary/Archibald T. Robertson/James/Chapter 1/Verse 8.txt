<p><b> Man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηρ</span></span>). Instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπος</span></span> (general term) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:7">James 1:7</span>, perhaps for variety (Ropes), but often in James (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:23">James 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:2">James 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:2">James 3:2</span>), though in other Epistles usually in distinction from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυνη</span></span> (woman).</p>
<p><b>Double-minded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διψυχος</span></span>). First appearance of this compound known and in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:8">James 4:8</span>. Apparently coined by James, but copied often in early Christian writings and so an argument for the early date of James' Epistle (Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δις</span></span> twice and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span> soul, double-souled, double-minded, Bunyan's "Mr. Facing-both-ways." Cf. the rebuke to Peter (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιστασας</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:31">Matthew 14:31</span>.</p>
<p><b>Unstable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακαταστατος</span></span>). Late double compound (alpha privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταστατος</span></span> verbal from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθιστημ</span></span>), in LXX once (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:11">Isaiah 54:11</span>) and in Polybius, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:8">James 3:8</span>. It means unsteady, fickle, staggering, reeling like a drunken man. Surely to James such "doubt" is no mark of intellectuality. </p>
