 But  (δε). Return to the point of view in verse James 1:2.Of low degree  (ο ταπεινος). "The lowly" brother, in outward condition (Luke 1:52), humble and poor as in Psalms 9:39; Proverbs 30:14, not the spiritually humble as in Matthew 11:29; James 4:6. In the LXX ταπεινος was used for either the poor in goods or the poor in spirit. Christianity has glorified this word in both senses. Already the rich and the poor in the churches had their occasion for jealousies.Glory in his high estate  (καυχασθω εν τω υψε αυτου). Paradox, but true. In his low estate he is "in his height" (υψος, old word, in N.T., also in Luke 1:78; Ephesians 3:1; etc.).
