<p><b> But </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>). Return to the point of view in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>Of low degree </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ταπεινος</span></span>). "The lowly" brother, in outward condition (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:52">Luke 1:52</span>), humble and poor as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+9:39">Psalms 9:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+30:14">Proverbs 30:14</span>, not the spiritually humble as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:6">James 4:6</span>. In the LXX <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταπεινος</span></span> was used for either the poor in goods or the poor in spirit. Christianity has glorified this word in both senses. Already the rich and the poor in the churches had their occasion for jealousies.</p>
<p><b>Glory in his high estate </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχασθω εν τω υψε αυτου</span></span>). Paradox, but true. In his low estate he is "in his height" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υψος</span></span>, old word, in N.T., also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:78">Luke 1:78</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span>; etc.). </p>
