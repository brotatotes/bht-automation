 My brethren  (αδελφο μου). Transition to a new topic as in James 1:19; James 2:5; James 2:14; James 3:1; James 5:7.Hold not  (μη εχετε). Present active imperative of εχω with negative μη, exhortation to stop holding or not to have the habit of holding in the fashion condemned.The faith of our Lord Jesus Christ  (την πιστιν του κυριου ημων Ιησου Χριστου). Clearly objective genitive, not subjective (faith of), but "faith in our Lord Jesus Christ," like εχετε πιστιν θεου (Mark 11:22), "have faith in God." See the same objective genitive with πιστις in Acts 3:6; Galatians 2:16; Romans 3:22; Revelation 14:12. Note also the same combination as in James 1:1 "our Lord Jesus Christ" (there on a par with God).The Lord of Glory  (της δοξης). Simply "the Glory." No word for "Lord" (κυριου) in the Greek text. Της δοξης clearly in apposition with του κυριου Ιησου Χριστου. James thus terms "our Lord Jesus Christ" the Shekinah Glory of God. See Hebrews 9:5 for "the cherubim of Glory." Other New Testament passages where Jesus is pictured as the Glory are Romans 9:4; 2 Corinthians 4:6; Ephesians 1:17; Hebrews 1:3. Cf. 2 Corinthians 8:9; Philippians 2:5-11.With respect of persons  (εν προσωπολημψιαις). A Christian word, like προσωπολημπτης (Acts 10:34) and προσωπολημπτειτε (James 2:9), not in LXX or any previous Greek, but made from προσωπον λαμβανειν (Luke 20:21; Galatians 2:6), which is α Hebrew idiom for panim nasa, "to lift up the face on a person," to be favorable and so partial to him. See προσωπολημψια in this sense of partiality (respect of persons) in Romans 2:11; Colossians 3:25; Ephesians 6:9 (nowhere else in N.T.). Do not show partiality.
