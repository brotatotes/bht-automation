<p><b> Whosoever shall keep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οστις τηρηση</span></span>). Indefinite relative clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οστις</span></span> and aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρεω</span></span>, old verb, to guard (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρος</span></span> guarding), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:36">Matthew 27:36</span>, without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> (though often used, but only one example of modal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν=αν</span></span> in James, viz., <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:4">James 4:4</span>). This modal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span>) merely interprets the sentence as either more indefinite or more definite (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 957f.).</p>
<p><b>And yet stumble in one point </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πταιση δε εν εν</span></span>). First aorist active subjunctive also of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πταιω</span></span>, old verb, to trip, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:2">James 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11">Romans 11:11</span>. "It is incipient falling" (Hort).</p>
<p><b>He is become </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγονεν</span></span>). Second perfect indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>, "he has become" by that one stumble.</p>
<p><b>Guilty of all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντων ενοχος</span></span>). Genitive of the crime with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενοχος</span></span>, old adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεχω</span></span> (to hold on or in), held in, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:29">Mark 3:29</span>. This is law. To be a lawbreaker one does not have to violate all the laws, but he must keep all the law (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολον τον νομον</span></span>) to be a law-abiding citizen, even laws that one does not like. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:18">Matthew 5:18</span> for this same principle. There is Talmudic parallel: "If a man do all, but omit one, he is guilty for all and each." This is a pertinent principle also for those who try to save themselves. But James is urging obedience to all God's laws. </p>
