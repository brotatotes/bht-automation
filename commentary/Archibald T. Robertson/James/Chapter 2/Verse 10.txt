 Whosoever shall keep  (οστις τηρηση). Indefinite relative clause with οστις and aorist active subjunctive of τηρεω, old verb, to guard (from τηρος guarding), as in Matthew 27:36, without αν (though often used, but only one example of modal εαν=αν in James, viz., James 4:4). This modal αν (εαν) merely interprets the sentence as either more indefinite or more definite (Robertson, Grammar, p. 957f.).And yet stumble in one point  (πταιση δε εν εν). First aorist active subjunctive also of πταιω, old verb, to trip, as in James 3:2; Romans 11:11. "It is incipient falling" (Hort).He is become  (γεγονεν). Second perfect indicative of γινομα, "he has become" by that one stumble.Guilty of all  (παντων ενοχος). Genitive of the crime with ενοχος, old adjective from ενεχω (to hold on or in), held in, as in Mark 3:29. This is law. To be a lawbreaker one does not have to violate all the laws, but he must keep all the law (ολον τον νομον) to be a law-abiding citizen, even laws that one does not like. See Matthew 5:18 for this same principle. There is Talmudic parallel: "If a man do all, but omit one, he is guilty for all and each." This is a pertinent principle also for those who try to save themselves. But James is urging obedience to all God's laws.
