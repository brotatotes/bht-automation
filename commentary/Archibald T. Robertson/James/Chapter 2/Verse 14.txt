 What doth it profit?  (τ οφελοσ;). Rhetorical question, almost of impatience. Old word from οφελλω, to increase, in N.T. only here, verse James 2:16; 1 Corinthians 15:32. "Τ οφελος was a common expression in the vivacious style of a moral diatribe" (Ropes).If a man say  (εαν λεγη τις). Condition of third class with εαν and the present active subjunctive of λεγω, "if one keep on saying."He hath faith  (πιστιν εχειν). Infinitive in indirect assertion after λεγη.But have not works  (εργα δε μη εχη). Third-class condition continued, "but keeps on not having (μη and present active subjunctive εχη) works." It is the spurious claim to faith that James here condemns.Can that faith save him?  (μη δυνατα η πιστις σωσα αυτον;). Negative answer expected (μη). Effective aorist active infinitive σωσα (from σωζω). The article η here is almost demonstrative in force as it is in origin, referring to the claim of faith without works just made.
