<p><b> What doth it profit? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ οφελοσ;</span></span>). Rhetorical question, almost of impatience. Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφελλω</span></span>, to increase, in N.T. only here, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:16">James 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:32">1 Corinthians 15:32</span>. "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ οφελος</span></span> was a common expression in the vivacious style of a moral diatribe" (Ropes).</p>
<p><b>If a man say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν λεγη τις</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and the present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span>, "if one keep on saying."</p>
<p><b>He hath faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστιν εχειν</span></span>). Infinitive in indirect assertion after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγη</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>But have not works </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργα δε μη εχη</span></span>). Third-class condition continued, "but keeps on not having (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and present active subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχη</span></span>) works." It is the spurious claim to faith that James here condemns.</p>
<p><b>Can that faith save him? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη δυνατα η πιστις σωσα αυτον;</span></span>). Negative answer expected (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>). Effective aorist active infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωσα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωζω</span></span>). The article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span> here is almost demonstrative in force as it is in origin, referring to the claim of faith without works just made. </p>
