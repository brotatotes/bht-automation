 If a brother or sister be naked  (εαν αδελφος η αδελφη γυμνο υπαρχωσιν). Condition again of third class (supposable case) with εαν and present active subjunctive of υπαρχω, to exist, in the plural though η (or) is used and not κα (and). Hence γυμνο is masculine plural in the predicate nominative. It does not here mean absolutely naked, but without sufficient clothing as in Matthew 25:36; John 21:7; Acts 19:16.In lack of daily food  (λειπομενο της εφημερου τροφης). Present passive participle of λειπω and ablative case τροφης like λειπετα σοφιας (James 1:5). The old adjective εφημερος (ο επ ημεραν ων, that which is for a day) occurs here only in the N.T., though εφημερια (daily routine) is found in Luke 1:5; Luke 1:8. This phrase occurs in Diodorus, but not in LXX.
