<p><b> And one of you say unto them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπη δε τις αυτοις εξ υμων</span></span>). Third-class condition again continued from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:15">James 2:15</span> with second aorist active subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπη</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Go in peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαγετε εν ειρηνη</span></span>). Present active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαγω</span></span>. Common Jewish farewell (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+18:6">Judges 18:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+1:17">1 Samuel 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+20:42">1 Samuel 20:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2sa+15:9">2 Samuel 15:9</span>). Used by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:34">Mark 5:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:50">Luke 7:50</span>).</p>
<p><b>Be ye warmed and filled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θερμαινεσθε κα χορταζεσθε</span></span>). Present imperative either middle (direct) or passive. We have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θερμαινομα</span></span> as a direct middle in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:18">John 18:18</span> (were warming themselves) and that makes good sense here: "Warm yourselves." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χορταζω</span></span> was originally used for pasturing cattle, but came to be used of men also as here. "Feed yourselves" (if middle, as is likely). Instead of warm clothes and satisfying food they get only empty words to look out for themselves.</p>
<p><b>And yet ye give not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη δωτε δε</span></span>). Third-class condition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> (and yet) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>, to give, cold deeds with warm words.</p>
<p><b>The things needful to the body </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα επιτηδεια του σωματος</span></span>). "The necessities of the body" (the necessaries of life). Old adjective from adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτηδες</span></span> (enough), only here in N.T.</p>
<p><b>What doth it profit? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ οφελοσ;</span></span>). As in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:14">James 2:14</span> and here the conclusion (apodosis) of the long condition begun in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:15">James 2:15</span>. </p>
