 And one of you say unto them  (ειπη δε τις αυτοις εξ υμων). Third-class condition again continued from verse James 2:15 with second aorist active subjunctive ειπη.Go in peace  (υπαγετε εν ειρηνη). Present active imperative of υπαγω. Common Jewish farewell (Judges 18:6; 1 Samuel 1:17; 1 Samuel 20:42; 2 Samuel 15:9). Used by Jesus (Mark 5:34; Luke 7:50).Be ye warmed and filled  (θερμαινεσθε κα χορταζεσθε). Present imperative either middle (direct) or passive. We have θερμαινομα as a direct middle in John 18:18 (were warming themselves) and that makes good sense here: "Warm yourselves." Χορταζω was originally used for pasturing cattle, but came to be used of men also as here. "Feed yourselves" (if middle, as is likely). Instead of warm clothes and satisfying food they get only empty words to look out for themselves.And yet ye give not  (μη δωτε δε). Third-class condition with δε (and yet) and μη and the second aorist active subjunctive of διδωμ, to give, cold deeds with warm words.The things needful to the body  (τα επιτηδεια του σωματος). "The necessities of the body" (the necessaries of life). Old adjective from adverb επιτηδες (enough), only here in N.T.What doth it profit?  (τ οφελοσ;). As in verse James 2:14 and here the conclusion (apodosis) of the long condition begun in verse James 2:15.
