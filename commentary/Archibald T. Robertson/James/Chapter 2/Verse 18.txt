<p><b> Yea, a man will say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ερε τις</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον</span></span>. But <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ'</span></span> here is almost certainly adversative (But some one will say), not confirmatory. James introduces an imaginary objector who speaks one sentence: "Thou hast faith and I have works" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συ πιστιν εχεις καγω εργα εχω</span></span>). Then James answers this objector. The objector can be regarded as asking a short question: "Hast thou faith?" In that case James replies: "I have works also."</p>
<p><b>Show me thy faith apart from thy works </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειξον μο την πιστιν σου χωρις των εργων</span></span>). This is the reply of James to the objector. First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεικνυμ</span></span>, tense of urgency. The point lies in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρις</span></span>, which means not "without," but "apart from," as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:6">Hebrews 11:6</span> (with the ablative case), "the works that properly belong to it and should characterise it" (Hort). James challenges the objector to do this.</p>
<p><b>And I by my works will shew thee my faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καγω σο δειξω εκ των εργων μου την πιστιν</span></span>). It is not faith <i>or</i> works, but proof of real faith (live faith <i>vs</i>. dead faith). The mere profession of faith with no works or profession of faith shown to be alive by works. This is the alternative clearly stated. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστιν</span></span> (faith) in both cases. James is not here discussing "works" (ceremonial works) as a means of salvation as Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:3">James 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:4">James 2:4</span>, but works as proof of faith. </p>
