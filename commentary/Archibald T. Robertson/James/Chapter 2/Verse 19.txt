<p><b> Thou believest that God is one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ πιστευεις οτ εις θεος εστιν</span></span>). James goes on with his reply and takes up mere creed apart from works, belief that God exists (there is one God), a fundamental doctrine, but that is not belief or trust in God. It may be mere creed.</p>
<p><b>Thou doest well </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλως ποιεις</span></span>). That is good as far as it goes, which is not far.</p>
<p><b>The demons also believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τα δαιμονια πιστευουσιν</span></span>). They go that far (the same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>). They never doubt the fact of God's existence.</p>
<p><b>And shudder </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα φρισσουσιν</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρισσω</span></span>, old onomatopoetic verb to bristle up, to shudder, only here in N.T. Like Latin <i>horreo</i> (horror, standing of the hair on end with terror). The demons do more than believe a fact. They shudder at it. </p>
