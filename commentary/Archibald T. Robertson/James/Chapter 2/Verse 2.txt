<p><b> For </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>). An illustration of the prohibition.</p>
<p><b>If there come in </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν εισελθη</span></span>). Condition of third class (supposable case) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and second (ingressive) aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισερχομα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Into your synagogue </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις συναγωγην υμων</span></span>). The common word for the gathering of Jews for worship (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:11">Luke 12:11</span>) and particularly for the building where they met (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:15">Luke 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:20">Luke 4:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:28">Luke 4:28</span>, etc.). Here the first is the probable meaning as it clearly is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:25">Hebrews 10:25</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την επισυναγωγην εαυτων</span></span>), where the longer compound occurs. It may seem a bit odd for a Christian church (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησια</span></span>) to be termed <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγωγη</span></span>, but James is writing to Jewish Christians and this is another incidental argument for the early date. Epiphanius (<i>Haer</i>. XXX. 18) states that the Ebionites call their church <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγωγη</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησια</span></span>. In the fourth century an inscription has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγωγη</span></span> for the meeting-house of certain Christians.</p>
<p><b>A man with a gold ring </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηρ χρυσοδακτυλιος</span></span>). "A gold-fingered man," "wearing a gold ring." The word occurs nowhere else, but Lucian has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρυσοχειρ</span></span> (gold-handed) and Epictetus has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρυσους δακτυλιους</span></span> (golden seal-rings). "Hannibal, after the battle of Cannae, sent as a great trophy to Carthage, three bushels of gold-rings from the fingers of Roman knights slain in battle" (Vincent).</p>
<p><b>In fine clothing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εσθητ λαμπρα</span></span>). "In bright (brilliant) clothing" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:11">Luke 23:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:30">Acts 10:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:41">Revelation 18:41</span>. In contrast with "vile clothing" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ρυπαρα εσθητ</span></span>), "new glossy clothes and old shabby clothes" (Hort). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ρυπαρος</span></span> (late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυπος</span></span>, filth, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:21">1 Peter 3:21</span>) means filthy, dirty. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:11">Revelation 22:11</span> (filthy).</p>
<p><b>Poor man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πτωχος</span></span>). Beggarly mendicant (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:21">Matthew 19:21</span>), the opposite of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλουσιος</span></span> (rich). </p>
