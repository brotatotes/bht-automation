<p><b> Justified by works </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ εργων εδικαιωθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοω</span></span> (see Galatians and Romans for this verb, to declare righteous, to set right) in a question with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span> expecting an affirmative answer. This is the phrase that is often held to be flatly opposed to Paul's statement in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:1-5">Romans 4:1-5</span>, where Paul pointedly says that it was the faith of Abraham (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:9">Romans 4:9</span>) that was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness, not his works. But Paul is talking about the faith of Abraham before his circumcision (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:10">James 4:10</span>) as the basis of his being set right with God, which faith is symbolized in the circumcision. James makes plain his meaning also.</p>
<p><b>In that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανενεγκας Ισαακ τον υιον αυτου επ το θυσιαστηριον</span></span>). They use the same words, but they are talking of different acts. James points to the offering (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανενεγκας</span></span> second aorist--with first aorist ending--active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναφερω</span></span>) of Isaac on the altar (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:16">Genesis 22:16</span>) as <i>proof</i> of the faith that Abraham already had. Paul discusses Abraham's faith as the basis of his justification, that and not his circumcision. There is no contradiction at all between James and Paul. Neither is answering the other. Paul may or may not have seen the Epistle of James, who stood by him loyally in the Conference in Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:15">James 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:2">James 2:2</span>). </p>
