<p><b> Was fulfilled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επληρωθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span>, the usual verb for fulfilling Scripture. So James quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:6">Genesis 15:6</span> as proving his point in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:21">James 2:21</span> that Abraham had works with his faith, the very same passage that Paul quotes in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3">Romans 4:3</span> to show that Abraham's faith preceded his circumcision and was the basis of his justification. And both James and Paul are right, each to illustrate a different point.</p>
<p><b>And he was called the friend of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα φιλος θεου εκληθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καληο</span></span>. Not a part of the Scripture quoted. Philo calls Abraham the friend of God and see <i>Jubilees</i> 19:9; 30:20. The Arabs today speak of Abraham as God's friend. It was evidently a common description before James used it, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+41:8">Isaiah 41:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+20:7">2 Chronicles 20:7</span>. </p>
