<p><b> Ye see </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορατε</span></span>). Present indicative active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>. Now he uses the plural again as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:14">James 2:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Is justified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιουτα</span></span>). Present passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοω</span></span>, here not "is made righteous," but "is shown to be righteous." James is discussing the proof of faith, not the initial act of being set right with God (Paul's idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:1-10">Romans 4:1-10</span>).</p>
<p><b>And not only by faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκ εκ πιστεως μονον</span></span>). This phrase clears up the meaning of James. Faith (live faith) is what we must all have (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:18">James 2:18</span>), only it must shew itself also in deeds as Abraham's did. </p>
