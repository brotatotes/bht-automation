 Ye see  (ορατε). Present indicative active of οραω. Now he uses the plural again as in James 2:14.Is justified  (δικαιουτα). Present passive indicative of δικαιοω, here not "is made righteous," but "is shown to be righteous." James is discussing the proof of faith, not the initial act of being set right with God (Paul's idea in Romans 4:1-10).And not only by faith  (κα ουκ εκ πιστεως μονον). This phrase clears up the meaning of James. Faith (live faith) is what we must all have (James 2:18), only it must shew itself also in deeds as Abraham's did.
