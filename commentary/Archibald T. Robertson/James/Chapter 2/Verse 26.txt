<p><b> Apart from the spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρις πνευματος</span></span>). "Apart from breath" (the breath of life). It is not easy to tell when one is dead, but the absence of a sign of breath on a glass before the mouth and nose is proof of death. Startling picture of dead faith in our churches and church members with only a name to live (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:2">Revelation 3:2</span>). </p>
