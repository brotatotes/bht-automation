 Are ye not divided in your own mind?  (ου διεκριθητε εν εαυτοισ;). First aorist (gnomic) passive indicative of διακρινω, to separate, conclusion of the third-class condition (future) in a rhetorical question in the gnomic aorist (as if past) with ou expecting an affirmative answer. For this idiom (gnomic aorist) in a conclusion of the third-class condition see 1 Corinthians 7:28. "Were ye not divided in (among) yourselves?" Cf. James 1:6; Matthew 21:21.Judges with evil thoughts  (κριτα διαλογισμων πονηρων). Descriptive genitive as in James 1:25. Διαλογισμος is an old word for reasoning (Romans 1:21). Reasoning is not necessarily evil, but see Matthew 15:19 (πονηρο) and Mark 7:21 (κακο) for evil reasonings, and 1 Timothy 2:8 without an adjective. See James 1:8; James 4:8 for διψυχος. They are guilty of partiality (a divided mind) as between the two strangers.
