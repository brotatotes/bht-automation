<p><b> Did not God choose? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ ο θεος εξελεξατο;</span></span>). Affirmative answer expected. First aorist middle (indirect, God chose for himself) indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεγω</span></span>, the very form used by Paul three times of God's choice in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:27">1 Corinthians 1:27</span>.</p>
<p><b>As to the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω κοσμω</span></span>). The ethical dative of interest, as the world looks at it as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:20">Acts 7:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18">1 Corinthians 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:4">2 Corinthians 10:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:4">James 4:4</span>. By the use of the article (the poor) James does not affirm that God chose all the poor, but only that he did choose poor people (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:23-26">Matthew 10:23-26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:26-28">1 Corinthians 1:26-28</span>).</p>
<p><b>Rich in faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλουσιους εν πιστε</span></span>). Rich because of their faith. As he has shown in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:9">James 1:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>Which he promised </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ης επεγγειλατο</span></span>). Genitive of the accusative relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> attracted to the case of the antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλειας</span></span> (the Messianic kingdom), the same verb and idea already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επηγγειλατο</span></span>). Cf. the beatitude of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span> for the poor in spirit. </p>
