 But ye have dishonoured the poor man  (υμεις δε ητιμασατε τον πτωχον). First aorist active indicative of ατιμαζω, old verb from ατιμος, dishonoured (Matthew 13:57). In the act of partiality pictured in James 2:3.Oppress you  (καταδυναστευουσιν υμων). Not very common compound (καταδυναστευω, present active indicative, from κατα and δυναστης, potentate, Luke 1:52), used of the devil in Acts 10:38 (only other N.T. example). Examples in papyri of harsh treatment by men in authority. Already poor Christians are feeling pressure from rich Jews as overlords.Drag you  (ελκουσιν υμας). Old and vigorous word for violent treatment, as of Paul in Acts 16:19; Acts 21:30. Cf. such violence in Luke 12:58; Acts 8:3.Before the judgment-seats  (εις κριτηρια). "To courts of justice" as in 1 Corinthians 6:2; 1 Corinthians 6:4 (only other N.T. examples). Common in the papyri in this sense. From κρινω to judge, κριτης (judge), place where judgment is given.
