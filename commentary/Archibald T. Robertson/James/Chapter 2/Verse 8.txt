<p><b> Howbeit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεντο</span></span>). Probably not adversative here, but simply confirmatory, "if now," "if indeed," "if really." Common in Xenophon in this sense. See the contrast (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:9">James 2:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>If ye fulfil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τελειτε</span></span>). Condition of first class, assumed as true with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελεω</span></span>, old verb, to bring to completion, occurring in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:27">Romans 2:27</span> also with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομος</span></span> (law). Jesus used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:17">Matthew 4:17</span>. James has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρεω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:10">James 2:10</span>.</p>
<p><b>The royal law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομον βασιλικον</span></span>). Old adjective for royal, regal (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλευς</span></span> king), as of an officer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:46">John 4:46</span>). But why applied to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομος</span></span>? The Romans had a phrase, <i>lex regia</i>, which came from the king when they had kings. The absence of the article is common with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:11">James 4:11</span>). It can mean a law fit to guide a king, or such as a king would choose, or even the king of laws. Jesus had said that on the law of love hang all the law and the prophets (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:40">Matthew 22:40</span>), and he had given the Golden Rule as the substance of the Law and the prophets (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:12">Matthew 7:12</span>). This is probably the royal law which is violated by partiality (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:3">James 2:3</span>). It is in accord with the Scripture quoted here (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+19:18">Leviticus 19:18</span>) and ratified by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:28">Luke 10:28</span>). </p>
