<p><b> Be not many teachers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πολλο διδασκαλο γινεσθε</span></span>). Prohibition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and present middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>. "Stop becoming many teachers" (so many of you). There is thus a clear complaint that too many of the Jewish Christians were attempting to teach what they did not clearly comprehend. There was a call for wise teachers (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:13">James 3:13</span>), not for foolish ones. This soon became an acute question, as one can see in I Cor. 12 to 14. They were not all teachers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:26">1 Corinthians 14:26</span>). The teacher is here treated as the wise man (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:13-18">James 3:13-18</span>) as he ought to be. The rabbi was the teacher (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:7">Matthew 23:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:38">John 1:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:10">John 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:16">John 20:16</span>). Teachers occupied an honourable position among the Christians (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>). James counts himself a teacher (we shall receive, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:1">James 3:1</span>) and this discussion is linked on with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:19-27">James 1:19-27</span>. Teachers are necessary, but incompetent and unworthy ones do much harm.</p>
<p><b>Heavier judgment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζον κριμα</span></span>). "Greater sentence." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:40">Mark 12:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:47">Luke 20:47</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περρισοτερον κριμα</span></span> (the sentence from the judge, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:2">Romans 13:2</span>). The reason is obvious. The pretence of knowledge adds to the teacher's responsibility and condemnation. </p>
