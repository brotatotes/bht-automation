<p><b> Ought not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου χρη</span></span>). The only use of this old impersonal verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χραω</span></span>) in the N.T. It is more like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεπε</span></span> (it is appropriate) than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> (it is necessary). It is a moral incongruity for blessing and cursing to come out of the same mouth.</p>
<p><b>So to be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως γινεσθα</span></span>). "So to keep on happening," not just "to be," present middle infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>. </p>
