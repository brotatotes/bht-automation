 In many things  (πολλα). Accusative neuter plural either cognate with πταιομεν or accusative of general reference. On πταιομεν (stumble) see on James 2:10. James includes himself in this list of stumblers.If not  (ει-ου). Condition of first class with ου (not μη) negativing the verb πταιε.In word  (εν λογω). In speech. The teacher uses his tongue constantly and so is in particular peril on this score.The same  (ουτος). "This one" (not ο αυτος the same).A perfect man  (τελειος ανηρ). "A perfect husband" also, for ανηρ is husband as well as man in distinction from woman (γυνη). The wife is at liberty to test her husband by this rule of the tongue.To bridle the whole body also  (χαλιναγωγησα κα ολον το σωμα). See James 1:26 for this rare verb applied to the tongue (γλωσσαν). Here the same metaphor is used and shown to apply to the whole body as horses are led by the mouth. The man follows his own mouth whether he controls the bridle therein (James 1:26) or someone else holds the reins. James apparently means that the man who bridles his tongue does not stumble in speech and is able also to control his whole body with all its passions. See Titus 1:11 about stopping people's mouths (επιστομιζω).
