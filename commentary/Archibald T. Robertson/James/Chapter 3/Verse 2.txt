<p><b> In many things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλα</span></span>). Accusative neuter plural either cognate with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πταιομεν</span></span> or accusative of general reference. On <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πταιομεν</span></span> (stumble) see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:10">James 2:10</span>. James includes himself in this list of stumblers.</p>
<p><b>If not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ει-ου</span></span>). Condition of first class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> (not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>) negativing the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πταιε</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>In word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν λογω</span></span>). In speech. The teacher uses his tongue constantly and so is in particular peril on this score.</p>
<p><b>The same </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>). "This one" (not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αυτος</span></span> the same).</p>
<p><b>A perfect man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειος ανηρ</span></span>). "A perfect husband" also, for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηρ</span></span> is husband as well as man in distinction from woman (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυνη</span></span>). The wife is at liberty to test her husband by this rule of the tongue.</p>
<p><b>To bridle the whole body also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλιναγωγησα κα ολον το σωμα</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:26">James 1:26</span> for this rare verb applied to the tongue (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γλωσσαν</span></span>). Here the same metaphor is used and shown to apply to the whole body as horses are led by the mouth. The man follows his own mouth whether he controls the bridle therein (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:26">James 1:26</span>) or someone else holds the reins. James apparently means that the man who bridles his tongue does not stumble in speech and is able also to control his whole body with all its passions. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:11">Titus 1:11</span> about stopping people's mouths (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστομιζω</span></span>). </p>
