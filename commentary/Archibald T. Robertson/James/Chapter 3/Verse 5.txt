 A little member  (μικρον μελος). Μελος is old and common word for members of the human body (1 Corinthians 12:12; Romans 6:13, etc.).Boasteth great things  (μεγαλα αυχε). Present active indicative of αυχεω, old verb, here only in N.T. The best MSS. here separate μεγαλα from αυχεω, though μεγαλαυχεω does occur in Aeschylus, Plato, etc. Μεγαλα is in contrast with μικρον.How much--how small  (ηλικον--ηλικην). The same relative form for two indirect questions together, "What-sized fire kindles what-sized forest?" For double interrogatives see Mark 15:24. The verb αναπτε is present active indicative of αναπτω, to set fire to, to kindle (Luke 12:49, only other N.T. example except some MSS. in Acts 28:2). Hυλην is accusative case, object of αναπτε, and occurs here only in N.T., though old word for forest, wood. Forest fires were common in ancient times as now, and were usually caused by small sparks carelessly thrown.
