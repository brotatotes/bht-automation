<p><b> The tongue is a fire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η γλωσσα πυρ</span></span>). So necessarily since there is no article with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρ</span></span> (apparently same word as German <i>feuer</i>, Latin <i>purus</i>, English <i>pure, fire</i>). This metaphor of fire is applied to the tongue in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+16:27">Proverbs 16:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+26:18-22">Proverbs 26:18-22</span>; Sirach 28:22.</p>
<p><b>The world of iniquity </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κοσμος της αδικιας</span></span>). A difficult phrase, impossible to understand according to Ropes as it stands. If the comma is put after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρ</span></span> instead of after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικιας</span></span>, then the phrase may be the predicate with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθιστατα</span></span> (present passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθιστημ</span></span>, "is constituted," or the present middle "presents itself"). Even so, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοσμος</span></span> remains a difficulty, whether it means the "ornament" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:3">1 Peter 3:3</span>) or "evil world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:27">James 1:27</span>) or just "world" in the sense of widespread power for evil. The genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικιας</span></span> is probably descriptive (or qualitative). Clearly James means to say that the tongue can play havoc in the members of the human body.</p>
<p><b>Which defileth the whole body </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η σπιλουσα ολον το σωμα</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπιλοω</span></span> late <i>Koine</i>, verb, to stain from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπιλος</span></span> (spot, also late word, in N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:27">Ephesians 5:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:13">2 Peter 2:13</span>), in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:23">Judges 1:23</span>. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:27">James 1:27</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασπιλον</span></span> (unspotted).</p>
<p><b>Setteth on fire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φλογιζουσα</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φλογιζω</span></span>, old verb, to set on fire, to ignite, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φλοξ</span></span> (flame), in N.T. only in this verse. See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπτε</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:5">James 3:5</span>).</p>
<p><b>The wheel of nature </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον τροχον γενεσεως</span></span>). Old word for wheel (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρεχω</span></span>, to run), only here in N.T. "One of the hardest passages in the Bible" (Hort). To what does <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τροχον</span></span> refer? For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσεως</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:23">James 1:23</span> apparently in the same sense. Vincent suggests "the wheel of birth" (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:18">Matthew 1:18</span>). The ancient writers often use this same phrase (or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυκλος</span></span>, cycle, in place of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τροχος</span></span>), but either in a physiological or a philosophical sense. James may have caught the metaphor from the current use, but certainly he has no such Orphic or Pythagorean doctrine of the transmigration of souls, "the unending round of death and rebirth" (Ropes). The wheel of life may be considered either in motion or standing still, though setting on fire implies motion. There is no reference to the zodiac.</p>
<p><b>And is set on fire by hell </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα φλογιζομενη υπο γεεννης</span></span>). Present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φλογιζω</span></span>, giving the continual source of the fire in the tongue. For the metaphor of fire with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεεννα</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:22">Matthew 5:22</span>. </p>
