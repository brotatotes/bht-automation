 Whence  (ποθεν). This old interrogative adverb (here twice) asks for the origin of wars and fights. James is full of interrogatives, like all diatribes.Wars  (πολεμο)--fightings  (μαχα).War  (πολεμος, old word, Matthew 24:6) pictures the chronic state or campaign, while μαχη (also old word, 2 Corinthians 7:5) presents the separate conflicts or battles in the war. So James covers the whole ground by using both words. The origin of a war or of any quarrel is sometimes hard to find, but James touches the sore spot here.Of your pleasures  (εκ των ηδονων υμων). Old word from ηδομα. Ablative case here after εκ, "out of your sinful, sensual lusts," the desire to get what one does not have and greatly desires.That war  (των στρατευομενων). Present middle articular participle (ablative case agreeing with ηδονων) of στρατευω, to carry on a campaign, here as in 1 Peter 2:11 of the passions in the human body. James seems to be addressing nominal Christians, "among you" (εν υμιν). Modern church disturbances are old enough in practice.
