<p><b> Whence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποθεν</span></span>). This old interrogative adverb (here twice) asks for the origin of wars and fights. James is full of interrogatives, like all diatribes.</p>
<p><b>Wars </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολεμο</span></span>)</p>
<p><b>--fightings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαχα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>War </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολεμος</span></span>, old word, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:6">Matthew 24:6</span>) pictures the chronic state or campaign, while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαχη</span></span> (also old word, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:5">2 Corinthians 7:5</span>) presents the separate conflicts or battles in the war. So James covers the whole ground by using both words. The origin of a war or of any quarrel is sometimes hard to find, but James touches the sore spot here.</p>
<p><b>Of your pleasures </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ των ηδονων υμων</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδομα</span></span>. Ablative case here after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>, "out of your sinful, sensual lusts," the desire to get what one does not have and greatly desires.</p>
<p><b>That war </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των στρατευομενων</span></span>). Present middle articular participle (ablative case agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδονων</span></span>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατευω</span></span>, to carry on a campaign, here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:11">1 Peter 2:11</span> of the passions in the human body. James seems to be addressing nominal Christians, "among you" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υμιν</span></span>). Modern church disturbances are old enough in practice. </p>
