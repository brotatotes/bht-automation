 Humble yourselves  (ταπεινωθητε). First aorist passive imperative of ταπεινοω, old verb from ταπεινος (James 1:9), as in Matthew 18:4. The passive here has almost the middle or reflexive sense. The middle voice was already giving way to the passive. See 1 Peter 5:6 for this same form with the same promise of exaltation.He shall exalt you  (υψωσε υμας). Future active indicative of υψοω, common verb from υψος (height), used by Jesus in contrast with ταπεινοω as here (Matthew 23:12; Luke 14:11; Luke 18:14).
