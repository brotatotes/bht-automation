<p><b> Speak not one against another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη καταλαλειτε αλληλων</span></span>). Prohibition against such a habit or a command to quit doing it, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the present imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλαλεω</span></span>, old compound usually with the accusative in ancient Greek, in N.T. only with the genitive (here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:12">1 Peter 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:16">1 Peter 3:16</span>). Often harsh words about the absent. James returns to the subject of the tongue as he does again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:12">James 5:12</span> (twice before, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:26">James 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:1-12">James 3:1-12</span>).</p>
<p><b>Judgeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινων</span></span>). In the sense of harsh judgment as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:1">Matthew 7:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:37">Luke 6:37</span> (explained by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταδικαζω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Not a doer of the law, but a judge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ποιητης νομου, αλλα κριτης</span></span>). This tone of superiority to law is here sharply condemned. James has in mind God's law, of course, but the point is the same for all laws under which we live. We cannot select the laws which we will obey unless some contravene God's law, and so our own conscience (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:20">Acts 4:20</span>). Then we are willing to give our lives for our rebellion if need be. </p>
