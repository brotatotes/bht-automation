 Go to now  (αγε νυν). Interjectional use of αγε (from αγω) as in James 5:1 (only N.T. instances) with a plural verb (ο λεγοντες, present active articular participle, ye that say) as is common in ancient Greek like ιδε νυν ηκουσατε (Matthew 26:65).Today or tomorrow  (σημερον η αυριον). Correct text (Aleph B), not κα (and).Into this city  (εις τηνδε την πολιν). Old demonstrative οδε, rare in N.T. (Luke 10:39) save in neuter plural ταδε (these things Acts 21:11). One would point out the city on the map (Mayor) as he made the proposal (we will go, πορευσομεθα).And spend a year there  (κα ποιησομεν εκε ενιαυτον). Another future (active of ποιεω). "We will do a year there."And trade  (κα εμπορευσομεθα). Future middle of εμπορευομα (εν, πορευομα, to go in), old verb from εμπορος (a merchant or trader, a drummer, one going in and getting the trade, Matthew 13:45), a vivid picture of the Jewish merchants of the time.And get gain  (κα κερδησομεν). Future (Ionic form) active of κερδαινω, old verb from κερδος (gain, Philippians 1:21), as in Matthew 16:26.
