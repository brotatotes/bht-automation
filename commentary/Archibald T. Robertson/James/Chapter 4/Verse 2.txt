<p><b> Ye lust </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιθυμειτε</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιθυμεω</span></span>, old word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι, θυμος</span></span>, yearning passion for), not necessarily evil as clearly not in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:15">Luke 22:15</span> of Christ, but usually so in the N.T., as here. Coveting what a man or nation does not have is the cause of war according to James.</p>
<p><b>Ye kill and covet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φονευετε κα ζηλουτε</span></span>). Present active indicatives of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φονευω</span></span> (old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φονευς</span></span>, murderer) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλοω</span></span>, to desire hotly to possess (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span>). It is possible (perhaps probable) that a full stop should come after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φονευετε</span></span> (ye kill) as the result of lusting and not having. Then we have the second situation: "Ye covet and cannot obtain (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτυχειν</span></span>, second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτυγχανω</span></span>), and (as a result) ye fight and war." This punctuation makes better sense than any other and is in harmony with verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:1">James 4:1</span>. Thus also the anticlimax in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φονευετε</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλουτε</span></span> is avoided. Mayor makes the words a hendiadys, "ye murderously envy."</p>
<p><b>Ye have not, because ye ask not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εχετε δια το μη αιτεισθα υμας</span></span>). James refers again to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εχετε</span></span> (ye do not have) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:2">James 4:2</span>. Such sinful lusting will not obtain. "Make the service of God your supreme end, and then your desires will be such as God can fulfil in answer to your prayer" (Ropes). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:31-33">Matthew 6:31-33</span>. The reason here is expressed by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> and the accusative of the articular present middle infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτεω</span></span>, used here of prayer to God as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7">Matthew 7:7</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυμας</span></span> (you) is the accusative of general reference. Note the middle voice here as in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτεισθε</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:3">James 4:3</span>. Mayor argues that the middle here, in contrast with the active, carries more the spirit of prayer, but Moulton (<i>Prol</i>., p. 160) regards the distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτεω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτεομα</span></span> often "an extinct subtlety." </p>
