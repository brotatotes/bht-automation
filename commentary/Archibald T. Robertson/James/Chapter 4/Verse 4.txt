 Ye adulteresses  (μοιχαλιδες). Μοιχο κα (ye adulterers) is spurious (Syrian text only). The feminine form here is a common late word from the masculine μοιχο. It is not clear whether the word is to be taken literally here as in Romans 7:3, or figuratively for all unfaithful followers of Christ (like an unfaithful bride), as in 2 Corinthians 11:1; Ephesians 5:24-28 (the Bride of Christ). Either view makes sense in this context, probably the literal view being more in harmony with the language of verses James 4:2. In that case James may include more than Christians in his view, though Paul talks plainly to church members about unchastity (Ephesians 5:3-5).Enmity with God  (εχθρα του θεου). Objective genitive θεου with εχθρα (predicate and so without article), old word from εχθρος, enemy (Romans 5:10), with εις θεον (below and Romans 8:7).Whosoever therefore would be  (ος εαν ουν βουληθη). Indefinite relative clause with ος and modal εαν and the first aorist passive (deponent) subjunctive of βουλομα, to will (purpose).A friend of the world  (φιλος του κοσμου). Predicate nominative with infinitive εινα agreeing with ος. See James 2:23 for φιλος θεου (friend of God).Maketh himself  (καθιστατα). Present passive (not middle) indicative as in James 3:6, "is constituted," "is rendered."An enemy of God  (εχθρος του θεου). Predicate nominative and anarthrous and objective genitive (θεου).
