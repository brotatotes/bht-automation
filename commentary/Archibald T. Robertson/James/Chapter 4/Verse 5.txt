<p><b> The Scripture </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η γραφη</span></span>). Personification as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:8">Galatians 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:23">James 2:23</span>. But no O.T. passage is precisely like this, though it is "a poetical rendering" (Ropes) of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:5">Exodus 20:5</span>. The general thought occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:3-5">Genesis 6:3-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:8-16">Isaiah 63:8-16</span>, etc. Paul has the same idea also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:17">Galatians 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:21">Galatians 5:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:6">Romans 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:8">Romans 8:8</span>). It is possible that the reference is really to the quotation in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:6">James 4:6</span> from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:34">Proverbs 3:34</span> and treating all before as a parenthesis. There is no way to decide positively.</p>
<p><b>In vain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κενως</span></span>). Old adverb (Aristotle) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κενως</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:20">James 2:20</span>), here alone in N.T. "Emptily," not meaning what it says.</p>
<p><b>Made to dwell </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατωικισεν</span></span>). First aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατοικιζω</span></span>, old verb, to give a dwelling to, only here in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Long unto envying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς φθονον επιποθε</span></span>). A difficult phrase. Some even take <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς φθονον</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγε</span></span> rather than with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιποθε</span></span>, as it naturally does go, meaning "jealously." But even so, with God presented as a jealous lover, does <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πνευμα</span></span> refer to the Holy Spirit as the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιποθε</span></span> or to man's spirit as the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιποθε</span></span>? Probably the former and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιποθε</span></span> then means to yearn after in the good sense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:8">Philippians 1:8</span>. </p>
