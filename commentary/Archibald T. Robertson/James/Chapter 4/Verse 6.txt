 More grace  (μειζονα χαριν). "Greater grace." Greater than what? "Greater grace in view of the greater requirement" (Ropes), like Romans 5:20. God does this.Wherefore  (διο). To prove this point James quotes Proverbs 3:34.God resisteth the proud  (ο θεος υπερηφανοις αντιτασσετα). Present middle (direct) indicative of αντιτασσω, old military term, to range in battle against, with dative case (Romans 13:2) as in James 5:6. Hυπερηφανοις (υπερ, φαινομα) is like our vernacular "stuck-up folks" (Romans 1:30), "haughty persons."But giveth grace to the humble  (ταπεινοις δε διδωσιν χαριν). Anarthrous adjective again, "to humble or lowly persons," for which word see James 1:9. Cf. James 2:5-7; James 5:1-6.
