 Come now, ye rich  (αγε νυν ο πλουσιο). Exclamatory interjection as in James 4:13. Direct address to the rich as a class as in 1 Timothy 6:17. Apparently here James has in mind the rich as a class, whether believer, as in James 1:10, or unbeliever, as in James 2:1; James 2:6. The plea here is not directly for reform, but a warning of certain judgment (James 5:1-6) and for Christians "a certain grim comfort in the hardships of poverty" (Ropes) in James 5:7-11.Weep and howl  (κλαυσατε ολολυζοντες). "Burst into weeping (ingressive aorist active imperative of κλαιω as in James 4:9), howling with grief" (present active participle of the old onomatopoetic verb ολολυζω, here only in N.T., like Latin ululare, with which compare αλαλαζω in Matthew 5:38.For your miseries  (επ ταις ταλαιπωριαις υμων). Old word from ταλαιπωρος (Romans 7:24) and like ταλαιπωρεω in James 4:9 (from τλαω to endure and πωρος a callus).That are coming upon you  (ταις επερχομεναις). Present middle participle of the old compound επερχομα to come upon, used here in futuristic prophetic sense.
