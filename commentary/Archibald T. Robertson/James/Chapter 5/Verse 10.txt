 For an example  (υποδειγμα). Late word for the old παραδειγμα, from υποδεικνυμ, to copy under, to teach (Luke 6:47), here for copy to be imitated as in John 13:15, as a warning (Hebrews 4:11). Here predicate accusative with τους προφητας (the prophets) as the direct object of λαβετε (second aorist active imperative of λαμβανω).Of suffering  (της κακοπαθιας). Old word from κακοπαθης (suffering evil, κακοπαθεω in verse James 5:13; 2 Timothy 2:3; 2 Timothy 2:9), here only in N.T.Of patience  (μακροθυμιας). Like μακροθυμεω in James 5:7. See both μακροθυμια and υπομονη in 2 Corinthians 4:6; Colossians 1:11 (the one restraint from retaliating, the other not easily succumbing).In the name of  (εν τω ονοματ). As in Jeremiah 20:9. With the authority of the Lord (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 198).
