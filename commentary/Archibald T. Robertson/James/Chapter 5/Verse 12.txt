<p><b> Above all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ παντων</span></span>). No connection with what immediately precedes. Probably an allusion to the words of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:34-37">Matthew 5:34-37</span>). It is not out of place here. See the same phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:8">1 Peter 4:8</span>. Robinson (<i>Ephesians</i>, p. 279) cites like examples from the papyri at the close of letters. Here it means "But especially" (Ropes).</p>
<p><b>Swear not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ομνυετε</span></span>). Prohibition of the habit (or to quit doing it if guilty) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the present active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομνυω</span></span>. The various oaths (profanity) forbidden (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητε</span></span>, thrice) are in the accusative case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομνυετε</span></span>, according to rule (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουρανον, γην, ορκον</span></span>). The Jews were wont to split hairs in their use of profanity, and by avoiding God's name imagine that they were not really guilty of this sin, just as professing Christians today use "pious oaths" which violate the prohibition of Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Let be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητω</span></span>). Imperative active third singular of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span>, late form (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:22">1 Corinthians 16:22</span>) for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστω</span></span>. "Your yea be yea" (and no more). A different form from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:37">Matthew 5:37</span>.</p>
<p><b>That ye fall not under judgment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη υπο κρισιν πεσητε</span></span>). Negative purpose with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη</span></span> and the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιπτω</span></span>, to fall. See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη κριθητε</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:9">James 5:9</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κρισις</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>) is the act of judging rather than the judgment rendered (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριμα</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:1">James 3:1</span>). </p>
