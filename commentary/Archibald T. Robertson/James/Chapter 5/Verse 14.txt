<p><b> Is any among you sick? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασθενε τις εν υμιν;</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασθενεω</span></span>, old verb, to be weak (without strength), often in N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:8">Matthew 10:8</span>).</p>
<p><b>Let him call for </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκαλεσασθω</span></span>). First aorist (ingressive) middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκαλεω</span></span>. Note change of tense (aorist) and middle (indirect) voice. Care for the sick is urged in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:14">1 Thessalonians 5:14</span> ("help the sick"). Note the plural here, "elders of the church, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17">Acts 20:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:6">Acts 15:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:18">Acts 21:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span> (bishops).</p>
<p><b>Let them pray over him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευξασθωσαν επ' αυτον</span></span>). First aorist middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευχομα</span></span>. Prayer for the sick is clearly enjoined.</p>
<p><b>Anointing him with oil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλειψαντες ελαιω</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλειφω</span></span>, old verb, to anoint, and the instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαιον</span></span> (oil). The aorist participle can be either simultaneous or antecedent with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευξασθωσαν</span></span> (pray). See the same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλειφω ελαιω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:13">Mark 6:13</span>. The use of olive oil was one of the best remedial agencies known to the ancients. They used it internally and externally. Some physicians prescribe it today. It is clear both in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:13">Mark 6:13</span> and here that medicinal value is attached to the use of the oil and emphasis is placed on the worth of prayer. There is nothing here of the pagan magic or of the later practice of "extreme unction" (after the eighth century). It is by no means certain that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλειφω</span></span> here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:13">Mark 6:13</span> means "anoint" in a ceremonial fashion rather than "rub" as it commonly does in medical treatises. Trench (N.T. Synonyms) says: "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αλειφειν</span></span> is the mundane and profane, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χριειν</span></span> the sacred and religious, word." At bottom in James we have God and medicine, God and the doctor, and that is precisely where we are today. The best physicians believe in God and want the help of prayer. </p>
