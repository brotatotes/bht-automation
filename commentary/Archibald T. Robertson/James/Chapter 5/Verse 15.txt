<p><b> The prayer of faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ευχη της πιστεως</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:6">James 1:6</span> for prayer marked by faith.</p>
<p><b>Shall save </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωσε</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωζω</span></span>, to make well. As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:21">Matthew 9:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:56">Mark 6:56</span>. No reference here to salvation of the soul. The medicine does not heal the sick, but it helps nature (God) do it. The doctor cooperates with God in nature.</p>
<p><b>The sick </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον καμνοντα</span></span>). Present active articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καμνω</span></span>, old verb, to grow weary (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:3">Hebrews 12:3</span>), to be sick (here), only N.T. examples.</p>
<p><b>The Lord shall raise him up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγερε αυτον ο κυριος</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγειρω</span></span>. Precious promise, but not for a professional "faith-healer" who scoffs at medicine and makes merchandise out of prayer.</p>
<p><b>And if he have committed sins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καν αμαρτιας η πεποιηκως</span></span>). Periphrastic perfect active subjunctive (unusual idiom) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εαν</span></span> (crasis <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καν</span></span>) in condition of third class. Supposing that he has committed sins as many sick people have (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:5">Mark 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:14">John 5:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:2">John 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:30">1 Corinthians 11:30</span>).</p>
<p><b>It shall be forgiven him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεθησετα αυτω</span></span>). Future passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιημ</span></span> (impersonal passive as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:2">Matthew 7:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7">Matthew 7:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:10">Romans 10:10</span>). Not in any magical way, not because his sickness has been healed, not without change of heart and turning to God through Christ. Much is assumed here that is not expressed. </p>
