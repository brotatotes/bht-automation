 The prayer of faith  (η ευχη της πιστεως). Cf. James 1:6 for prayer marked by faith.Shall save  (σωσε). Future active of σωζω, to make well. As in Matthew 9:21; Mark 6:56. No reference here to salvation of the soul. The medicine does not heal the sick, but it helps nature (God) do it. The doctor cooperates with God in nature.The sick  (τον καμνοντα). Present active articular participle of καμνω, old verb, to grow weary (Hebrews 12:3), to be sick (here), only N.T. examples.The Lord shall raise him up  (εγερε αυτον ο κυριος). Future active of εγειρω. Precious promise, but not for a professional "faith-healer" who scoffs at medicine and makes merchandise out of prayer.And if he have committed sins  (καν αμαρτιας η πεποιηκως). Periphrastic perfect active subjunctive (unusual idiom) with κα εαν (crasis καν) in condition of third class. Supposing that he has committed sins as many sick people have (Mark 2:5; John 5:14; John 9:2; 1 Corinthians 11:30).It shall be forgiven him  (αφεθησετα αυτω). Future passive of αφιημ (impersonal passive as in Matthew 7:2; Matthew 7:7; Romans 10:10). Not in any magical way, not because his sickness has been healed, not without change of heart and turning to God through Christ. Much is assumed here that is not expressed.
