<p><b> Confess therefore your sins one to another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξομολογεισθε ουν αλληλοις τας αμαρτιας</span></span>). Present middle (indirect) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξομολογεω</span></span>. Confession of sin to God is already assumed. But public confession of certain sins to one another in the meetings is greatly helpful in many ways. This is not confessing to one man like a priest in place of the public confession. One may confess to the pastor without confessing to God or to the church, with little benefit to anybody.</p>
<p><b>Pray for one another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευχεσθε υπερ αλληλων</span></span>). Present middle imperative. Keep this up.</p>
<p><b>That ye may be healed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως ιαθητε</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως</span></span> and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιαομα</span></span>. Probably of bodily healing (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:14">James 5:14</span>), though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιαομα</span></span> is used also of healing of the soul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:15">Matthew 13:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:24">1 Peter 2:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:13">Hebrews 12:13</span>) as Mayor takes it here.</p>
<p><b>Availeth much </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολυ ισχυε</span></span>). "Has much force." Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυς</span></span>, strength).</p>
<p><b>In its working </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργουμενη</span></span>). Probably the present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργεω</span></span> as Paul apparently uses it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6">Galatians 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:12">2 Corinthians 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</span>, meaning "when it works." The passive is possible, as is the usual idiom elsewhere. Mayor argues strongly for the passive here, "when it is exercised" (Ropes). </p>
