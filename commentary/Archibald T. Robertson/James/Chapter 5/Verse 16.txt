 Confess therefore your sins one to another  (εξομολογεισθε ουν αλληλοις τας αμαρτιας). Present middle (indirect) of εξομολογεω. Confession of sin to God is already assumed. But public confession of certain sins to one another in the meetings is greatly helpful in many ways. This is not confessing to one man like a priest in place of the public confession. One may confess to the pastor without confessing to God or to the church, with little benefit to anybody.Pray for one another  (προσευχεσθε υπερ αλληλων). Present middle imperative. Keep this up.That ye may be healed  (οπως ιαθητε). Purpose clause with οπως and the first aorist passive subjunctive of ιαομα. Probably of bodily healing (verse James 5:14), though ιαομα is used also of healing of the soul (Matthew 13:15; 1 Peter 2:24; Hebrews 12:13) as Mayor takes it here.Availeth much  (πολυ ισχυε). "Has much force." Present active indicative of ισχυω (from ισχυς, strength).In its working  (ενεργουμενη). Probably the present middle participle of ενεργεω as Paul apparently uses it in Galatians 5:6; 2 Corinthians 4:12; 2 Thessalonians 2:7, meaning "when it works." The passive is possible, as is the usual idiom elsewhere. Mayor argues strongly for the passive here, "when it is exercised" (Ropes).
