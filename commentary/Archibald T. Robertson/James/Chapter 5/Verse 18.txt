 Gave rain  (υετον εδωκεν). This idiom is in the LXX of God as here of heaven (1 Samuel 12:17; 1 Kings 18:1) and also in Acts 14:17 instead of εβρεξεν of verse James 5:17. Hυετον is old word for rain (from υω, to rain), genuine here, but not in verse James 5:7.Brought forth  (εβλαστησεν). First aorist active of βλαστανω, old verb, to sprout (intransitive as Mark 4:27), here as occasionally in later Greek transitive with accusative καρπον.
