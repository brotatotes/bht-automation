<p><b> If any one among you do err </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν τις εν υμιν πλανηθη</span></span>). Third-class condition (supposed case) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλαναω</span></span>, old verb, to go astray, to wander (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:12">Matthew 18:12</span>), figuratively (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:2">Hebrews 5:2</span>).</p>
<p><b>From the truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο της αληθειας</span></span>). For truth see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:18">James 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:14">James 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:32">John 8:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:6">1 John 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:18">1 John 3:18</span>. It was easy then, and is now, to be led astray from Christ, who is the Truth.</p>
<p><b>And one convert him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα επιστρεψη τις αυτον</span></span>). Continuation of the third-class condition with the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστρεφω</span></span>, old verb, to turn (transitive here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:16">Luke 1:16</span>, but intransitive often as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:35">Acts 9:35</span>). </p>
