<p><b> Let him know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκετω</span></span>). Present active imperative third person singular of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, but Westcott and Hort read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκετε</span></span> (know ye) after B. In either case it is the conclusion of the condition in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:19">James 5:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>He which converteth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο επιστρεψας</span></span>). First aorist active articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστρεφω</span></span> of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:19">James 5:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>From the error </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ πλανης</span></span>). "Out of the wandering" of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:19">James 5:19</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλανη</span></span>, from which <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλαναω</span></span> is made). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:6">1 John 4:6</span> for contrast between "truth" and "error."</p>
<p><b>A soul from death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχην εκ θανατου</span></span>). The soul of the sinner (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτωλον</span></span>) won back to Christ, not the soul of the man winning him. A few MSS. have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> added (his soul), which leaves it ambiguous, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> is not genuine. It is ultimate and final salvation here meant by the future (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωσε</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Shall cover a multitude of sins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλυψε πληθος αμαρτιων</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλυπτω</span></span>, old verb, to hide, to veil. But whose sins (those of the converter or the converted)? The Roman Catholics (also Mayor and Ropes) take it of the sins of the converter, who thus saves himself by saving others. The language here will allow that, but not New Testament teaching in general. It is apparently a proverbial saying which Resch considers one of the unwritten sayings of Christ (Clem. Al. <i>Paed</i>. iii. 12). It occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:8">1 Peter 4:8</span>, where it clearly means the sins of others covered by love as a veil thrown over them. The saying appears also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+10:12">Proverbs 10:12</span>: "Hatred stirs up strife, but love hides all transgressions"--that is "love refuses to see faults" (Mayor admits). That is undoubtedly the meaning in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:8">1 Peter 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:20">James 5:20</span>. </p>
