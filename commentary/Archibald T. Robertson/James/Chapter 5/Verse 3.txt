<p><b>As fire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως πυρ</span></span>). Editors differ here whether to connect this phrase with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαγετα</span></span>, just before (as Mayor), for fire eats up more rapidly than rust, or with the following, as Westcott and Hort and Ropes, that is the eternal fire of Gehenna which awaits them (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:41">Matthew 25:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:44">Mark 9:44</span>). This interpretation makes a more vivid picture for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθησαυρισατε</span></span> (ye have laid up, first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θησαυριζω</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19">Matthew 6:19</span> and see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+16:27">Proverbs 16:27</span>), but it is more natural to take it with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαγετα</span></span>. </p>
