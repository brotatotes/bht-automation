 Ye have lived delicately  (ετρυφησατε). First aorist (constative, summary) active indicative of τρυφαω, old verb from τρυφη (luxurious living as in Luke 7:25, from θρυπτω, to break down, to enervate), to lead a soft life, only here in N.T.Taken your pleasure  (εσπαταλησατε). First aorist (constative) active indicative of σπαταλαω, late and rare verb to live voluptuously or wantonly (from σπαταλη, riotous living, wantonness, once as bracelet), in N.T. only here and 1 Timothy 5:6.Ye have nourished  (εθρεψατε). First aorist (constative) active indicative of τρεφω, old verb, to feed, to fatten (Matthew 6:26). They are fattening themselves like sheep or oxen all unconscious of "the day of slaughter" (εν ημερα σφαγης, definite without the article) ahead of them. For this use of σφαγης see Romans 8:36 (προβατα σφαγης, sheep for the slaughter, σφαγη from σφαζω, to slay), consummate sarcasm on the folly of sinful rich people.
