<p><b>Ye have killed the righteous one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφονευσατε τον δικαιον</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φονευω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:11">James 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:2">James 4:2</span>). "The righteous one" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των δικαιον</span></span>) is the generic use of the singular with article for the class. There is probably no direct reference to one individual, though it does picture well the death of Christ and also the coming death of James himself, who was called the Just (Eus. <i>H.E</i>. ii. 23). Stephen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:52">Acts 7:52</span>) directly accuses the Sanhedrin with being betrayers and murderers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προδοτα κα φονεις</span></span>) of the righteous one (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του δικαιου</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>He doth not resist you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ αντιτασσετα υμιν</span></span>). It is possible to treat this as a question. Present middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιτασσω</span></span>, for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:6">James 4:6</span>. Without a question the unresisting end of the victim (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον δικαιον</span></span>) is pictured. With a question (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span>, expecting an affirmative answer) God or Lord is the subject, with the final judgment in view. There is no way to decide definitely. </p>
