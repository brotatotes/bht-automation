 Ye have condemned  (κατεδικασατε). First aorist active indicative of καταδικαζω, old verb (from καταδικη, condemnation, Acts 25:15). The rich controlled the courts of justice.Ye have killed the righteous one  (εφονευσατε τον δικαιον). First aorist active indicative of φονευω (James 2:11; James 4:2). "The righteous one" (των δικαιον) is the generic use of the singular with article for the class. There is probably no direct reference to one individual, though it does picture well the death of Christ and also the coming death of James himself, who was called the Just (Eus. H.E. ii. 23). Stephen (Acts 7:52) directly accuses the Sanhedrin with being betrayers and murderers (προδοτα κα φονεις) of the righteous one (του δικαιου).He doth not resist you  (ουκ αντιτασσετα υμιν). It is possible to treat this as a question. Present middle indicative of αντιτασσω, for which see James 4:6. Without a question the unresisting end of the victim (τον δικαιον) is pictured. With a question (ουκ, expecting an affirmative answer) God or Lord is the subject, with the final judgment in view. There is no way to decide definitely.
