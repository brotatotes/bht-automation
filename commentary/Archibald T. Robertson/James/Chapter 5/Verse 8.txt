 Ye also  (κα υμεις). As well as the farmers.Stablish  (στηριξατε). First aorist active imperative of στηριζω, old verb, (from στηριγξ, a support) to make stable, as in Luke 22:32; 1 Thessalonians 3:13.Is at hand  (ηγγικεν). Present perfect active indicative of εγγιζω, common verb, to draw near (from εγγυς), in James 4:8, for drawing near. Same form used by John in his preaching (Matthew 3:2). In 1 Peter 4:7 the same word appears to have an eschatological sense as apparently here. How "near" or "nigh" did James mean? Clearly, it could only be a hope, for Jesus had distinctly said that no one knew when he would return.
