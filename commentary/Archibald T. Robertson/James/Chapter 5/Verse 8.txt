<p><b> Ye also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υμεις</span></span>). As well as the farmers.</p>
<p><b>Stablish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηριξατε</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηριζω</span></span>, old verb, (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηριγξ</span></span>, a support) to make stable, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:32">Luke 22:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>Is at hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγγικεν</span></span>). Present perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγγιζω</span></span>, common verb, to draw near (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγγυς</span></span>), in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:8">James 4:8</span>, for drawing near. Same form used by John in his preaching (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:7">1 Peter 4:7</span> the same word appears to have an eschatological sense as apparently here. How "near" or "nigh" did James mean? Clearly, it could only be a hope, for Jesus had distinctly said that no one knew when he would return. </p>
