<p><b> Murmur not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη στεναζετε</span></span>). Prohibition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the present active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στεναζω</span></span>, old verb, to groan. "Stop groaning against one another," as some were already doing in view of their troubles. In view of the hope of the Second Coming lift up your heads.</p>
<p><b>That ye be not judged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη κριθητε</span></span>). Negative purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη</span></span> and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>. As already indicated (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:12">James 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:12">James 4:12</span>) and repeated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:12">James 5:12</span>. Reminiscence of the words of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:1">Matthew 7:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Standeth before the doors </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ των θυρων εστηκεν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>, "is standing now." Again like the language of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:33">Matthew 24:33</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ θυραις</span></span>) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:29">Mark 13:29</span>. Jesus the Judge is pictured as ready to enter for the judgment. </p>
