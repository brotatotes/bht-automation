<p><b> In the beginning </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αρχη</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αρχη</span></span> is definite, though anarthrous like our at home, in town, and the similar Hebrew <i>be reshith</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:1">Genesis 1:1</span>. But Westcott notes that here John carries our thoughts beyond the beginning of creation in time to eternity. There is no argument here to prove the existence of God any more than in Genesis. It is simply assumed. Either God exists and is the Creator of the universe as scientists like Eddington and Jeans assume or matter is eternal or it has come out of nothing.</p>
<p><b>Was </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span>). Three times in this sentence John uses this imperfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span> to be which conveys no idea of origin for God or for the Logos, simply continuous existence. Quite a different verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span>, became) appears in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span> for the beginning of the Incarnation of the Logos. See the distinction sharply drawn in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:58">John 8:58</span> "before Abraham came (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσθα</span></span>) I am" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span>, timeless existence).</p>
<p><b>The Word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λογος</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογος</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span>, old word in Homer to lay by, to collect, to put words side by side, to speak, to express an opinion. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογος</span></span> is common for reason as well as speech. Heraclitus used it for the principle which controls the universe. The Stoics employed it for the soul of the world (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανιμα μυνδ</span></span>) and Marcus Aurelius used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπερματικος λογος</span></span> for the generative principle in nature. The Hebrew <i>memra</i> was used in the Targums for the manifestation of God like the Angel of Jehovah and the Wisdom of God in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+8:23">Proverbs 8:23</span>. Dr. J. Rendel Harris thinks that there was a lost wisdom book that combined phrases in Proverbs and in the Wisdom of Solomon which John used for his Prologue (The Origin of the <i>Prologue to St. John</i>, p. 43) which he has undertaken to reproduce. At any rate John's standpoint is that of the Old Testament and not that of the Stoics nor even of Philo who uses the term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογος</span></span>, but not John's conception of personal pre-existence. The term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογος</span></span> is applied to Christ only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:13">Revelation 19:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span> "concerning the Word of life" (an incidental argument for identity of authorship). There is a possible personification of "the Word of God" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:12">Hebrews 4:12</span>. But the personal pre-existence of Christ is taught by Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:17">Colossians 1:17</span>) and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span> and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>. This term suits John's purpose better than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφια</span></span> (wisdom) and is his answer to the Gnostics who either denied the actual humanity of Christ (Docetic Gnostics) or who separated the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αεον</span></span> Christ from the man Jesus (Cerinthian Gnostics). The pre-existent Logos "became flesh" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρξ εγενετο</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>) and by this phrase John answered both heresies at once.</p>
<p><b>With God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τον θεον</span></span>). Though existing eternally with God the Logos was in perfect fellowship with God. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προς</span></span> with the accusative presents a plane of equality and intimacy, face to face with each other. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span> we have a like use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span>: "We have a Paraclete with the Father" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακλητον εχομεν προς τον πατερα</span></span>). See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσωπον προς προσωπον</span></span> (face to face, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span>), a triple use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span>. There is a papyrus example of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> in this sense <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το γνωστον της προς αλληλους συνηθειας</span></span>, "the knowledge of our intimacy with one another" (M.&amp;M., <i>Vocabulary</i>) which answers the claim of Rendel Harris, <i>Origin of Prologue</i>, p. 8) that the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:3">Mark 6:3</span> is a mere Aramaism. It is not a classic idiom, but this is <i>Koine</i>, not old Attic. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span> John has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα σο</span></span> the more common idiom.</p>
<p><b>And the Word was God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα θεος ην ο λογος</span></span>). By exact and careful language John denied Sabellianism by not saying <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος ην ο λογος</span></span>. That would mean that all of God was expressed in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λογος</span></span> and the terms would be interchangeable, each having the article. The subject is made plain by the article (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λογος</span></span>) and the predicate without it (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span>) just as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:24">John 4:24</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα ο θεος</span></span> can only mean "God is spirit," not "spirit is God." So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:16">1 John 4:16</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος αγαπη εστιν</span></span> can only mean "God is love," not "love is God" as a so-called Christian scientist would confusedly say. For the article with the predicate see Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 767f. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Λογος σαρξ εγενετο</span></span>, "the Word became flesh," not "the flesh became Word." Luther argues that here John disposes of Arianism also because the Logos was eternally God, fellowship of Father and Son, what Origen called the Eternal Generation of the Son (each necessary to the other). Thus in the Trinity we see personal fellowship on an equality. </p>
