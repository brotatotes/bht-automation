<p><b> He was in the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω κοσμω ην</span></span>). Imperfect tense of continuous existence in the universe before the Incarnation as in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:2">John 1:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>Was made by him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' αυτου εγενετο</span></span>). "Through him." Same statement here of "the world" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κοσμος</span></span>) as that made in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span> of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Knew him not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον ουκ εγνω</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινοσκω</span></span>, what Gildersleeve called a negative aorist, refused or failed to recognize him, his world that he had created and that was held together by him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>). Not only did the world fail to know the Pre-incarnate Logos, but it failed to recognize him when he became Incarnate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:26">John 1:26</span>). Two examples in this sentence of John's fondness for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> as in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:5">John 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>, the paratactic rather than the hypotactic construction, like the common Hebrew use of <i>wav</i>. </p>
