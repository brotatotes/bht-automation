<p><b> Unto his own </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τα ιδια</span></span>). Neuter plural, "unto his own things," the very idiom used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:27">John 19:27</span> when the Beloved Disciple took the mother of Jesus "to his own home." The world was "the own home" of the Logos who had made it. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:32">John 16:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:6">Acts 21:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>They that were his own </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ιδιο</span></span>). In the narrower sense, "his intimates," "his own family," "his own friends" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>. Jesus later said that a prophet is not without honour save in his own country (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:4">Mark 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:44">John 4:44</span>), and the town of Nazareth where he lived rejected him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:28">Luke 4:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:58">Matthew 13:58</span>). Probably here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ιδιο</span></span> means the Jewish people, the chosen people to whom Christ was sent first (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:24">Matthew 15:24</span>), but in a wider sense the whole world is included in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ιδιο</span></span>. Conder's <i>The Hebrew Tragedy</i> emphasizes the pathos of the situation that the house of Israel refused to welcome the Messiah when he did come, like a larger and sadder Enoch Arden experience.</p>
<p><b>Received him not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον ου παρελαβον</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαμβανω</span></span>, old verb to take to one's side, common verb to welcome, the very verb used by Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:3">John 14:3</span> of the welcome to his Father's house. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατελαβεν</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:5">John 1:5</span>. Israel slew the Heir (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>) when he came, like the wicked husbandmen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:14">Luke 20:14</span>). </p>
