<p><b> As many as received him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσο ελαβον αυτον</span></span>). Effective aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span> "as many as did receive him," in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ιδιο</span></span> just before, exceptional action on the part of the disciples and other believers.</p>
<p><b>To them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοις</span></span>). Dative case explanatory of the relative clause preceding, an anacoluthon common in John 27 times as against 21 in the Synoptists. This is a common Aramaic idiom and is urged by Burney (<i>Aramaic Origin</i>, etc., p. 64) for his theory of an Aramaic original of the Fourth Gospel.</p>
<p><b>The right </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσιαν</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:27">John 5:27</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκεν</span></span> (first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσιαν</span></span> means authority but includes power (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις</span></span>). Here it is more the notion of privilege or right.</p>
<p><b>To become </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσθα</span></span>). Second aorist middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>, to become what they were not before.</p>
<p><b>Children of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνα θεου</span></span>). In the full spiritual sense, not as mere offspring of God true of all men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:28">Acts 17:28</span>). Paul's phrase <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιο θεου</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:26">Galatians 3:26</span>) for believers, used also by Jesus of the pure in heart (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:9">Matthew 5:9</span>), does not occur in John's Gospel (but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:7">Revelation 21:7</span>). It is possible that John prefers <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα τεκνα του θεου</span></span> for the spiritual children of God whether Jew or Gentile (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:52">John 11:52</span>) because of the community of nature (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνον</span></span> from root <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκ-</span></span>, to beget). But one cannot follow Westcott in insisting on "adoption" as Paul's reason for the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιο</span></span> since Jesus uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιο θεου</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:9">Matthew 5:9</span>. Clearly the idea of regeneration is involved here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:3">John 3:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Even to them that believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις πιστευουσιν</span></span>). No "even" in the Greek, merely explanatory apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοις</span></span>, dative case of the articular present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>On his name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ονομα</span></span>). Bernard notes <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω εις</span></span> 35 times in John, to put trust in or on. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:38">John 3:38</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω εις το ονομα αυτου</span></span>. This common use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span> for the person is an Aramaism, but it occurs also in the vernacular papyri and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ονομα</span></span> is particularly common in the payment of debts (Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15">Acts 1:15</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονοματα</span></span> for persons. </p>
