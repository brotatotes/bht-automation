<p><b> Which were born </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εγεννηθησαν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενναω</span></span>, to beget, "who were begotten." By spiritual generation (of God, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ θεου</span></span>), not by physical (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ αιματων</span></span>, plural as common in classics and O.T., though why it is not clear unless blood of both father and mother; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ θεληματος σαρκος</span></span>, from sexual desire; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ θεληματος ανδρος</span></span>, from the will of the male). But <i>b</i> of the old Latin reads <i>qui natus est</i> and makes it refer to Christ and so expressly teach the Virgin Birth of Jesus. Likewise Irenaeus reads <i>qui natus est</i> as does Tertullian who argues that <i>qui nati sunt</i> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εγεννηθησαν</span></span>) is an invention of the Valentinian Gnostics. Blass (<i>Philology of the Gospels</i>, p. 234) opposes this reading, but all the old Greek uncials read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εγεννηθησαν</span></span> and it must be accepted. The Virgin Birth is doubtless implied in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>, but it is not stated in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:13">John 1:13</span>. </p>
