<p><b> And the Word became flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο λογος σαρξ εγενετο</span></span>). See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span> for this verb and note its use for the historic event of the Incarnation rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>. Note also the absence of the article with the predicate substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρξ</span></span>, so that it cannot mean "the flesh became the Word." The Pre-existence of the Logos has already been plainly stated and argued. John does not here say that the Logos entered into a man or dwelt in a man or filled a man. One is at liberty to see an allusion to the birth narratives in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:16-25">Matthew 1:16-25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:28-38">Luke 1:28-38</span>, if he wishes, since John clearly had the Synoptics before him and chiefly supplemented them in his narrative. In fact, one is also at liberty to ask what intelligent meaning can one give to John's language here apart from the Virgin Birth? What ordinary mother or father ever speaks of a child "becoming flesh"? For the Incarnation see also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:3">Romans 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>. "To explain the exact significance of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span> in this sentence is beyond the powers of any interpreter" (Bernard). Unless, indeed, as seems plain, John is referring to the Virgin Birth as recorded in Matthew and Luke. "The Logos of philosophy is, John declares, the Jesus of history" (Bernard). Thus John asserts the deity and the real humanity of Christ. He answers the Docetic Gnostics who denied his humanity.</p>
<p><b>Dwelt among us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσκηνωσεν εν ημιν</span></span>). First aorist ingressive aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνοω</span></span>, old verb, to pitch one's tent or tabernacle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνος</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνη</span></span>), in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:7-15">John 1:7-15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:12">John 12:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:6">John 13:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:3">John 21:3</span>. In Revelation it is used of God tabernacling with men and here of the Logos tabernacling, God's Shekinah glory here among us in the person of his Son.</p>
<p><b>We beheld his glory </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθεασαμεθα την δοξαν αυτου</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεαομα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεα</span></span>, spectacle). The personal experience of John and of others who did recognize Jesus as the Shekinah glory (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξα</span></span>) of God as James, the brother of Jesus, so describes him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1">James 2:1</span>). John employs <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεαομα</span></span> again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:32">John 1:32</span> (the Baptist beholding the Spirit coming down as a dove) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:38">John 1:38</span> of the Baptist gazing in rapture at Jesus. So also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:35">John 4:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:45">John 11:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:12">1 John 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:14">1 John 4:14</span>. By this word John insists that in the human Jesus he beheld the Shekinah glory of God who was and is the Logos who existed before with God. By this plural John speaks for himself and all those who saw in Jesus what he did.</p>
<p><b>As of the only begotten from the Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως μονογενους παρα πατρος</span></span>). Strictly, "as of an only born from a father," since there is no article with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονογενους</span></span> or with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατρος</span></span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9">1 John 4:9</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον μονογενη</span></span> referring to Christ. This is the first use in the Gospel of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατηρ</span></span> of God in relation to the Logos. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μονογενης</span></span> (only born rather than only begotten) here refers to the eternal relationship of the Logos (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>) rather than to the Incarnation. It distinguishes thus between the Logos and the believers as children (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνα</span></span>) of God. The word is used of human relationships as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:12">Luke 7:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:42">Luke 8:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:38">Luke 9:38</span>. It occurs also in the LXX and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:17">Hebrews 11:17</span>, but elsewhere in N.T. only in John's writings. It is an old word in Greek literature. It is not clear whether the words <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα πατρος</span></span> (from the Father) are to be connected with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονογενους</span></span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:46">John 6:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:29">John 7:29</span>, etc.) or with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαν</span></span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:41">John 5:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:44">John 5:44</span>). John clearly means to say that "the manifested glory of the Word was as it were the glory of the Eternal Father shared with His only Son" (Bernard). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:54">John 8:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9">John 14:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>Full </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρης</span></span>). Probably indeclinable accusative adjective agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαν</span></span> (or genitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονογενους</span></span>) of which we have papyri examples (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 275). As nominative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρης</span></span> can agree with the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσκηνωσεν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Of grace and truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριτος κα αληθειας</span></span>). Curiously this great word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις</span></span> (grace), so common with Paul, does not occur in John's Gospel save in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span>, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθεια</span></span> (truth) is one of the keywords in the Fourth Gospel and in 1John, occurring 25 times in the Gospel and 20 in the Johannine Epistles, 7 times in the Synoptics and not at all in Revelation (Bernard). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span> these two words picture the Gospel in Christ in contrast with the law of Moses. See Epistles of Paul for origin and use of both words. </p>
