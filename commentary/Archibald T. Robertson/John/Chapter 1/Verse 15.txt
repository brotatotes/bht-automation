<p><b> Beareth witness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρε</span></span>). Historical (dramatic) present indicative of this characteristic word in John (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:32">John 1:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:34">John 1:34</span> for historical examples of John's witness to Christ. This sentence is a parenthesis in Westcott and Hort's text, though the Revised Version makes a parenthesis of most of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>. The witness of John is adduced in proof of the glory full of grace and truth already claimed for the Incarnate Logos.</p>
<p><b>Crieth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεκραγεν</span></span>). Second perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραζω</span></span>, old verb for loud crying, repeated in dramatic form again for emphasis recalling the wonderful Voice in the wilderness which the Beloved Disciple can still hear echoing through the years.</p>
<p><b>This was </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος ην</span></span>). Imperfect indicative where John throws the tense back in past time when he looked forward to the coming of the Messiah as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:10">Acts 3:10</span> where we should prefer "is" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span>). Gildersleeve (<i>Syntax</i>, p. 96) calls this the "imperfect of sudden appreciation of the real state of things."</p>
<p><b>Of whom I said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον ειπον</span></span>). But B C and a corrector of Aleph (Westcott and Hort) have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ειπων</span></span> "the one who said," a parenthetical explanation about the Baptist, not the words of the Baptist about Christ.</p>
<p><b>After me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπισω μου</span></span>). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:27">John 1:27</span>. Later in time John means. He described "the Coming One" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ερχομενος</span></span>) before he saw Jesus. The language of John here is precisely that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο οπισω μου ερχομενος</span></span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:7">Mark 1:7</span>). The Beloved Disciple had heard the Baptist say these very words, but he also had the Synoptic Gospels.</p>
<p><b>Is become </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγονεν</span></span>). Second perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>. It is already an actual fact when the Baptist is speaking.</p>
<p><b>Before me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπροσθεν μου</span></span>). In rank and dignity, the Baptist means, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ισχυροτερος μου</span></span> "the one mightier than I" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:7">Mark 1:7</span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυροτερος μου</span></span> "mightier than I" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:28">John 3:28</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπροσθεν εκεινου</span></span> (before him, the Christ) does mean priority in time, but not here. This superior dignity of the Messiah John proudly recognizes always (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:25-30">John 3:25-30</span>).</p>
<p><b>For he was before me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ πρωτος μου ην</span></span>). Paradox, but clear. He had always been (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην ιμπερφεχτ</span></span>) before John in his Pre-incarnate state, but "after" John in time of the Incarnation, but always ahead of John in rank immediately on his Incarnation. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πρωτος μου</span></span> (superlative with ablative) occurs here when only two are compared as is common in the vernacular <i>Koine</i>. So the Beloved Disciple came first (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτος</span></span>) to the tomb, ahead of Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:4">John 20:4</span>). So also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτον υμων</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:18">John 15:18</span> means "before you" as if it were <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προτερον υμων</span></span>. Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:30">John 1:30</span> repeats these words almost exactly. </p>
