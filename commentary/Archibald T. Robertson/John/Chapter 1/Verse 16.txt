<p><b> For </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). Correct text (Aleph B C D L) and not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> (and) of the Textus Receptus. Explanatory reason for verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Of his fulness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του πληρωματος</span></span>). The only instance of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρωμα</span></span> in John's writings, though five times of Christ in Paul's Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:19">Colossians 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9">Colossians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:19">Colossians 1:19</span> for discussion of these terms of the Gnostics that Paul employs for all the attributes of God summed up in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9">Colossians 2:9</span>) and so used here by John of the Incarnate Logos.</p>
<p><b>We all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις παντες</span></span>). John is facing the same Gnostic depreciation of Christ of which Paul writes in Colossians. So here John appeals to all his own contemporaries as participants with him in the fulness of the Logos.</p>
<p><b>Received </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαβομεν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>, a wider experience than beholding (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθεασαμεθα</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>) and one that all believers may have.</p>
<p><b>Grace for grace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριν αντ χαριτος</span></span>). The point is in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span>, a preposition disappearing in the <i>Koine</i> and here only in John. It is in the locative case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντα</span></span> (end), "at the end," and was used of exchange in sale. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:11">Luke 11:11</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ ιχθυος οφιν</span></span>, "a serpent for a fish," <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span> where "joy" and "cross" are balanced against each other. Here the picture is "grace" taking the place of "grace" like the manna fresh each morning, new grace for the new day and the new service. </p>
