<p><b> No man hath seen God at any time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεον ουδεις εωρακεν πωποτε</span></span>). "God no one has ever seen." Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>. Seen with the human physical eye, John means. God is invisible (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:20">Exodus 33:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+4:12">Deuteronomy 4:12</span>). Paul calls God <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αορατος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:17">1 Timothy 1:17</span>). John repeats the idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:37">John 5:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:46">John 6:46</span>. And yet in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:7">John 14:7</span> Jesus claims that the one who sees him has seen the Father as here.</p>
<p><b>The only begotten Son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μονογενης υιος</span></span>). This is the reading of the Textus Receptus and is intelligible after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως μονογενους παρα πατρος</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>. But the best old Greek manuscripts (Aleph B C L) read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονογενης θεος</span></span> (God only begotten) which is undoubtedly the true text. Probably some scribe changed it to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μονογενης υιος</span></span> to obviate the blunt statement of the deity of Christ and to make it like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>. But there is an inner harmony in the reading of the old uncials. The Logos is plainly called <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>. The Incarnation is stated in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>, where he is also termed <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονογενης</span></span>. He was that before the Incarnation. So he is "God only begotten," "the Eternal Generation of the Son" of Origen's phrase.</p>
<p><b>Which is in the bosom of the Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ων εις τον κολπον του πατρος</span></span>). The eternal relation of the Son with the Father like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τον θεον</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13">John 3:13</span> there is some evidence for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ων εν τω ουρανω</span></span> used by Christ of himself while still on earth. The mystic sense here is that the Son is qualified to reveal the Father as Logos (both the Father in Idea and Expression) by reason of the continual fellowship with the Father.</p>
<p><b>He </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκινος</span></span>). Emphatic pronoun referring to the Son.</p>
<p><b>Hath declared him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηγησατο</span></span>). First aorist (effective) middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηγεομα</span></span>, old verb to lead out, to draw out in narrative, to recount. Here only in John, though once in Luke's Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+24:35">John 24:35</span>) and four times in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:8">John 10:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:12">John 15:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:14">John 15:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:19">John 21:19</span>). This word fitly closes the Prologue in which the Logos is pictured in marvellous fashion as the Word of God in human flesh, the Son of God with the Glory of God in him, showing men who God is and what he is. </p>
