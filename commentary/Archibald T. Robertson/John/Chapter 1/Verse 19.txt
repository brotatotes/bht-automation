<p><b> And this is the witness of John </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αυτη εστιν η μαρτυρια του Ιωανου</span></span>). He had twice already alluded to it (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:7">John 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span>) and now he proceeds to give it as the most important item to add after the Prologue. Just as the author assumes the birth narratives of Matthew and Luke, so he assumes the Synoptic accounts of the baptism of Jesus by John, but adds various details of great interest and value between the baptism and the Galilean ministry, filling out thus our knowledge of this first year of the Lord's ministry in various parts of Palestine. The story in John proceeds along the same lines as in the Synoptics. There is increasing unfolding of Christ to the disciples with increasing hostility on the part of the Jews till the final consummation in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><b>When the Jews sent unto him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε απεστειλαν προς αυτον ο Ιουδαιο</span></span>). John, writing in Ephesus near the close of the first century long after the destruction of Jerusalem, constantly uses the phrase "the Jews" as descriptive of the people as distinct from the Gentile world and from the followers of Christ (at first Jews also). Often he uses it of the Jewish leaders and rulers in particular who soon took a hostile attitude toward both John and Jesus. Here it is the Jews from Jerusalem who sent (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστειλαν</span></span>, first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστελλω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Priests and Levites </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερεις κα Λευειτας</span></span>). Sadducees these were. Down below in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:24">John 1:24</span> the author explains that it was the Pharisees who sent the Sadducees. The Synoptics throw a flood of light on this circumstance, for in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span> we are told that the Baptist called the Pharisees and Sadducees "offspring of vipers" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:7">Luke 3:7</span>). Popular interest in John grew till people were wondering "in their hearts concerning John whether haply he were the Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:15">Luke 3:15</span>). So the Sanhedrin finally sent a committee to John to get his own view of himself, but the Pharisees saw to it that Sadducees were sent.</p>
<p><b>To ask him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ερωτησωσιν αυτον</span></span>). Final <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερωταω</span></span>, old verb to ask a question as here and often in the <i>Koine</i> to ask for something (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span>) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτεω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Who art thou? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ τις ει;</span></span>). Direct question preserved and note proleptic position of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ</span></span>, "Thou, who art thou?" The committee from the Sanhedrin put the question sharply up to John to define his claims concerning the Messiah. </p>
