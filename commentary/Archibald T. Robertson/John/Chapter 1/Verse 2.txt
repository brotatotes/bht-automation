<p><b> The same </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>). "This one," the Logos of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>, repeated for clarity, characteristic of John's style. He links together into one phrase two of the ideas already stated separately, "in the beginning he was with God," "afterwards in time he came to be with man" (Marcus Dods). Thus John clearly states of the Logos Pre-existence before Incarnation, Personality, Deity. </p>
