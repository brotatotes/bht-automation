<p><b> And he confessed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ωμολογησεν</span></span>). The continued paratactic use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> (and) and the first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογεω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομον, λεγω</span></span>, to say the same thing), to confess, in the Synoptics (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:32">Matthew 10:32</span>) as here.</p>
<p><b>And denied not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκ ηρνησατο</span></span>). Negative statement of same thing in Johannine fashion, first aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρνεομα</span></span>, another Synoptic and Pauline word (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:33">Matthew 10:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:12">2 Timothy 2:12</span>). He did not contradict or refuse to say who he was.</p>
<p><b>And he confessed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ωμολογησεν</span></span>). Thoroughly Johannine again in the paratactic repetition.</p>
<p><b>I am not the Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω ουκ ειμ ο Χριστος</span></span>). Direct quotation again with recitative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> before it like our modern quotation marks. "I am not the Messiah," he means by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Χριστος</span></span> (the Anointed One). Evidently it was not a new question as Luke had already shown (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:15">Luke 3:15</span>). </p>
