<p><b> And they asked him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ηρωτησαν αυτον</span></span>). Here the paratactic <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> is like the transitional <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν</span></span> (then).</p>
<p><b>What then? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ ουν;</span></span>). Argumentative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν</span></span> like Paul's <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ουν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:15">Romans 6:15</span>. <i>Quid ergo?</i> <b> Art thou Elijah? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συ Ελιας ει;</span></span>). The next inevitable question since Elijah had been understood to be the forerunner of the Messiah from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:5">Malachi 4:5</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:11">Mark 9:11</span> Jesus will identify John with the Elijah of Malachi's prophecy. Why then does John here flatly deny it? Because the expectation was that Elijah would return in person. This John denies. Jesus only asserts that John was Elijah in spirit. Elijah in person they had just seen on the Mount of Transfiguration.</p>
<p><b>He saith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγε</span></span>). Vivid dramatic present.</p>
<p><b>I am not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ειμ</span></span>). Short and blunt denial.</p>
<p><b>Art thou the prophet? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο προφητης ε συ;</span></span>). "The prophet art thou?" This question followed naturally the previous denials. Moses (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>) had spoken of a prophet like unto himself. Christians interpreted this prophet to be the Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:22">Acts 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:37">Acts 7:37</span>), but the Jews thought him another forerunner of the Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:40">John 7:40</span>). It is not clear in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:15">John 6:15</span> whether the people identified the expected prophet with the Messiah, though apparently so. Even the Baptist later became puzzled in prison whether Jesus himself was the true Messiah or just one of the forerunners (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:19">Luke 7:19</span>). People wondered about Jesus himself whether he was the Messiah or just one of the looked for prophets (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:28">Mark 8:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:14">Matthew 16:14</span>).</p>
<p><b>And he answered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα απεκριθη</span></span>). First aorist passive (deponent passive, sense of voice gone) indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκρινομα</span></span>, to give a decision from myself, to reply.</p>
<p><b>No </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ου</span></span>). Shortest possible denial. </p>
