<p><b> He said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφη</span></span>). Common imperfect active (or second aorist active) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φημ</span></span>, to say, old defective verb.</p>
<p><b>I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω φωνη βοωντος εν τη ερημω</span></span>). For his answer John quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:3">Isaiah 40:3</span>. The Synoptics (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:3">Mark 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:3">Matthew 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:4">Luke 3:4</span>) quote this language from Isaiah as descriptive of John, but do not say that he also applied it to himself. There is no reason to think that he did not do so. John also refers to Isaiah as the author of the words and also of the message, "<b> Make straight the way of the Lord </b>" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ευθυνατε την οδον του κυριου</span></span>). By this language (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευθυνω</span></span> in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:4">James 3:4</span>, first aorist active imperative here) John identifies himself to the committee as the forerunner of the Messiah. The early writers note the differences between the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογος</span></span> (Word) for the Messiah and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνη</span></span> (Voice) for John. </p>
