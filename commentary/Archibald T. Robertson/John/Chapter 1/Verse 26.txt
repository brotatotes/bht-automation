<p><b> In the midst of you standeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεσος υμων στηκε</span></span>). Adjective as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:18">John 19:18</span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν μεσω υμων</span></span>. Present active indicative of late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηκω</span></span> from perfect stem <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστηκα</span></span>. John had already baptized Jesus and recognized him as the Messiah.</p>
<p><b>Whom ye know not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον υμεις ουκ οιδατε</span></span>). This was the tragedy of the situation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span>). Apparently this startling declaration excited no further inquiry from the committee. </p>
