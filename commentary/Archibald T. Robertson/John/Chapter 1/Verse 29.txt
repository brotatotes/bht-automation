<p><b> On the morrow </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη επαυριον</span></span>). Locative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημηρα</span></span> (day) understood after the adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαυριον</span></span>. "Second day of this spiritual diary" (Bernard) from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>Seeth Jesus coming </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπε τον Ιησουν ερχομενον</span></span>). Dramatic historical present indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπε</span></span>) with vivid present middle participle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομενον</span></span>). Graphic picture.</p>
<p><b>Behold the Lamb of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδε ο αμνος του θεου</span></span>). Exclamation <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδε</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδου</span></span>, not verb, and so nominative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμνος</span></span>. Common idiom in John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:36">John 1:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:26">John 3:26</span>, etc.). For "the Lamb of God" see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:36">John 19:36</span>) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:19">1 Peter 1:19</span>. The passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:6">Isaiah 53:6</span> is directly applied to Christ by Philip in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:32">Acts 8:32</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:17">Matthew 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:22">1 Peter 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:28">Hebrews 9:28</span>. But the Jews did not look for a suffering Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:34">John 12:34</span>) nor did the disciples at first (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:32">Mark 9:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:21">Luke 24:21</span>). But was it not possible for John, the Forerunner of the Messiah, to have a prophetic insight concerning the Messiah as the Paschal Lamb, already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:53">John 1:53</span>, even if the rabbis did not see it there? Symeon had it dimly (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:35">Luke 2:35</span>), but John more clearly. So Westcott rightly. Bernard is unwilling to believe that John the Baptist had more insight on this point than current Judaism. Then why and how did he recognize Jesus as Messiah at all? Certainly the Baptist did not have to be as ignorant as the rabbis.</p>
<p><b>Which taketh away the sin of the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αιρων την αμαρτιαν του κοσμου</span></span>). Note singular <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιαν</span></span> not plural <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιας</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:5">1 John 3:5</span>) where same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρω</span></span>, to bear away, is used. The future work of the Lamb of God here described in present tense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span> about the blood of Christ. He is the Lamb of God for the world, not just for Jews. </p>
