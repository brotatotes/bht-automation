<p><b> All things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα</span></span>). The philosophical phrase was <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα παντα</span></span> (the all things) as we have it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:6">1 Corinthians 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>. In verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:10">John 1:10</span> John uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κοσμος</span></span> (the orderly universe) for the whole.</p>
<p><b>Were made </b> (egeneto). Second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>, the constative aorist covering the creative activity looked at as one event in contrast with the continuous existence of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:2">John 1:2</span>. All things "came into being." Creation is thus presented as a becoming (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>) in contrast with being (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>By him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' αυτου</span></span>). By means of him as the intermediate agent in the work of creation. The Logos is John's explanation of the creation of the universe. The author of Hebrews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>) names God's Son as the one "through whom he made the ages." Paul pointedly asserts that "the all things were created in him" (Christ) and "the all things stand created through him and unto him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>). Hence it is not a peculiar doctrine that John here enunciates. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:6">1 Corinthians 8:6</span>, Paul distinguishes between the Father as the primary source (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ ου</span></span>) of the all things and the Son as the intermediate agent as here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ου</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Without him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρις αυτου</span></span>). Old adverbial preposition with the ablative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:14">Philippians 2:14</span>, "apart from." John adds the negative statement for completion, another note of his style as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:20">John 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>. Thus John excludes two heresies (Bernard) that matter is eternal and that angels or aeons had a share in creation.</p>
<p><b>Not anything </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε εν</span></span>). "Not even one thing." Bernard thinks the entire Prologue is a hymn and divides it into strophes. That is by no means certain. It is doubtful also whether the relative clause "that hath been made" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο γεγονεν</span></span>) is a part of this sentence or begins a new one as Westcott and Hort print it. The verb is second perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>. Westcott observes that the ancient scholars before Chrysostom all began a new sentence with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο γεγονεν</span></span>. The early uncials had no punctuation. </p>
