<p><b> And I knew him not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καγω ουκ ηιδειν αυτον</span></span>). Repeated in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:33">John 1:33</span>. Second past perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span> as imperfect. He had predicted the Messiah and described him before he met him and baptized him. See the Synoptics for that story. Whether John knew Jesus personally before the baptism we do not know.</p>
<p><b>But that he should be made manifest to Israel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ινα φανερωθη τω Ισραηλ</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανεροω</span></span>. The purpose of John's ministry was to manifest to Israel with their spiritual privileges (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:49">John 1:49</span>) the presence of the Messiah. Hence he was baptizing in water those who confessed their sins, he means, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:5">Mark 1:5</span>. The Synoptic account is presupposed all along here. </p>
