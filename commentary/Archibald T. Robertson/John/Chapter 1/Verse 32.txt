<p><b> Bare witness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμαρτυρησεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρεω</span></span>. Another specimen of John's witness to the Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:7">John 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:35">John 1:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:36">John 1:36</span>).</p>
<p><b>I have beheld </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεθεαμα</span></span>). Perfect middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεαομα</span></span>, the realization of the promise of the sign (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:33">John 1:33</span>) by which he should recognize the Messiah. As a matter of fact, we know that he so recognized Jesus as Messiah when he came for baptism before the Holy Spirit came (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:14">Matthew 3:14</span>). But this sight of the Spirit descending as a dove upon Jesus at his baptism (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:10">Mark 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:22">Luke 3:22</span>) became permanent proof to him. John's allusion assumes the Synoptic record. The Semites regarded the dove as a symbol of the Spirit. </p>
