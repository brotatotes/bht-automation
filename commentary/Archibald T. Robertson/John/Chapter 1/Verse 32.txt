 Bare witness  (εμαρτυρησεν). First aorist active indicative of μαρτυρεω. Another specimen of John's witness to the Messiah (John 1:7; John 1:15; John 1:19; John 1:29; John 1:35; John 1:36).I have beheld  (τεθεαμα). Perfect middle indicative of θεαομα, the realization of the promise of the sign (verse John 1:33) by which he should recognize the Messiah. As a matter of fact, we know that he so recognized Jesus as Messiah when he came for baptism before the Holy Spirit came (Matthew 3:14). But this sight of the Spirit descending as a dove upon Jesus at his baptism (Mark 1:10; Matthew 3:16; Luke 3:22) became permanent proof to him. John's allusion assumes the Synoptic record. The Semites regarded the dove as a symbol of the Spirit.
