<p><b> He said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος ειπεν</span></span>). Explicit and emphatic pronoun as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:8">John 1:8</span>, referring to God as the one who sent John (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:6">John 1:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>With the Holy Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πνευματ αγιω</span></span>). "In the Holy Spirit." Here again one needs the background of the Synoptics for the contrast between John's baptism in water (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:26">John 1:26</span>) and that of the Messiah in the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:8">Mark 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:16">Luke 3:16</span>). </p>
