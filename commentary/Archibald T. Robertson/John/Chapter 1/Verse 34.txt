<p><b> I have seen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εωρακα</span></span>). Present perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>. John repeats the statement of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:32">John 1:32</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεθεαμα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Have borne witness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεμαρτυρηκα</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρεω</span></span> for which verb see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:32">John 1:32</span>.</p>
<p><b>This is the Son of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο υιος του θεου</span></span>). The Baptist saw the Spirit come on Jesus at his baptism and undoubtedly heard the Father's voice hail him as "My Beloved Son" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:11">Mark 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:22">Luke 3:22</span>). Nathanael uses it as a Messianic title (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:49">John 1:49</span>) as does Martha (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:27">John 11:27</span>). The Synoptics use it also of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:11">Mark 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:33">Matthew 14:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:70">Luke 22:70</span>). Caiaphas employs it to Christ as a Messianic title (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:63">Matthew 26:63</span>) and Jesus confessed under oath that he was (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>), thus applying the term to himself as he does in John's Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:36">John 10:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:4">John 11:4</span>) and by implication (the Father, the Son) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:22">Luke 10:22</span>). Hence in the Synoptics also Jesus calls himself the Son of God. The phrase means more than just Messiah and expresses the peculiar relation of the Son to the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:18">John 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:7">John 19:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:31">John 20:31</span>) like that of the Logos with God in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>. </p>
