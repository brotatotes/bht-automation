<p><b> Come and ye shall see </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχεσθε κα οψεσθε</span></span>). Polite invitation and definite promise (future middle indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψεσθε</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>, correct text, not imperative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδετε</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Where he abode </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">που μενε</span></span>). Indirect question preserving the present active indicative after secondary tense (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδαν</span></span>, saw) according to regular Greek idiom. Same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:38">John 1:38</span>.</p>
<p><b>With him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ' αυτω</span></span>). "By his side," "beside him."</p>
<p><b>That day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ημεραν εκεινην</span></span>). Accusative of extent of time, all during that day.</p>
<p><b>About the tenth hour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωρα ως δεκατη</span></span>). Roman time and so ten o'clock in the morning. John in Ephesus at the close of the century naturally uses Roman time. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:19">John 20:19</span> "evening on that day," clearly Roman time. Thus also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:14">John 19:14</span> (sixth hour, morning) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:25">Mark 15:25</span> (third hour, nine A.M.) suit. To his latest day John never forgot the hour when first he met Jesus. </p>
