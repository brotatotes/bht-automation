<p><b> In him was life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτω ζωη ην</span></span>). That which has come into being (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>) in the Logos was life. The power that creates and sustains life in the universe is the Logos. This is what Paul means by the perfect passive verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτιστα</span></span> (stands created) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>. This is also the claim of Jesus to Martha (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25">John 11:25</span>). This is the idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span> "bearing (upholding) the all things by the word of his power." Once this language might have been termed unscientific, but not so now after the spiritual interpretation of the physical world by Eddington and Jeans. Usually in John <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωη</span></span> means spiritual life, but here the term is unlimited and includes all life; only it is not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιος</span></span> (manner of life), but the very principle or essence of life. That is spiritual behind the physical and to this great scientists today agree. It is also personal intelligence and power. Some of the western documents have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> here instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> to bring out clearly the timelessness of this phrase of the work of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογος</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>And the life was the light of men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα η ζωη ην το φως των ανθρωπων</span></span>). Here the article with both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωη</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φως</span></span> makes them interchangeable. "The light was the life of men" is also true. That statement is curiously like the view of some physicists who find in electricity (both light and power) the nearest equivalent to life in its ultimate physical form. Later Jesus will call himself the light of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>). John is fond of these words life and light in Gospel, Epistles, Revelation. He here combines them to picture his conception of the Pre-incarnate Logos in his relation to the race. He was and is the Life of men (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των ανθρωπον</span></span>, generic use of the article) and the Light of men. John asserts this relation of the Logos to the race of men in particular before the Incarnation. </p>
