<p><b> He findeth first </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκε ουτος πρωτον</span></span>). "This one finds (vivid dramatic present) first" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προτων</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προτων</span></span> (adverb supported by Aleph A B fam. 13) means that Andrew sought "his own brother Simon" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αδελφον τον ιδιον Σιμωνα</span></span>) before he did anything else. But Aleph L W read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτος</span></span> (nominative adjective) which means that Andrew was the first who went after his brother implying that John also went after his brother James. Some old Latin manuscripts (b, e, r apparently), have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μανε</span></span> for Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρω</span></span> (early in the morning). Bernard thinks that this is the true reading as it allows more time for Andrew to bring Simon to Jesus. Probably <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτον</span></span> is correct, but even so John likely brought also his brother James after Andrew's example.</p>
<p><b>We have found the Messiah </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hευρηκαμεν τον Μεσσιαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκω</span></span>. Andrew and John had made the greatest discovery of the ages, far beyond gold or diamond mines. The Baptist had told about him. "We have seen him."</p>
<p><b>Which is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εστιν</span></span>). Same explanatory neuter relative as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:38">John 1:38</span>, "which word is." This Aramaic title Messiah is preserved in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:25">John 4:25</span>, elsewhere translated into <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος</span></span>, Anointed One, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χριω</span></span>, to anoint. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span> for discussion. </p>
