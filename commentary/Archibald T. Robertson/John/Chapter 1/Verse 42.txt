<p><b> Looked upon him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμβλεψας αυτω</span></span>). See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:36">John 1:36</span> for same word and form of John's eager gaze at Jesus. Luke uses this word of Jesus when Peter denied him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:61">Luke 22:61</span>).</p>
<p><b>He brought him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγαγεν αυτον</span></span>). Effective second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγο</span></span> as if Andrew had to overcome some resistance on Simon's part.</p>
<p><b>Thou shalt be called Cephas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ κληθηση Κηφας</span></span>). Apparently before Simon spoke. We do not know whether Jesus had seen Simon before or not, but he at once gives him a nickname that will characterize him some day, though not yet, when he makes the noble confession (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:17">Matthew 16:17</span>), and Jesus will say, "Thou art Peter." Here the future passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλεω</span></span> is only prophecy. The Aramaic <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χηφας</span></span> (rock) is only applied to Simon in John except by Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:18">Galatians 1:18</span>, etc.). But the Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πετρος</span></span> is used by all. In the ancient Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πετρα</span></span> was used for the massive ledge of rock like Stone Mountain while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πετρος</span></span> was a detached fragment of the ledge, though itself large. This distinction may exist in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:17">Matthew 16:17</span>, except that Jesus probably used Aramaic which would not have such a distinction. </p>
