<p><b> On the morrow </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη επαυριον</span></span>). The fourth of the days from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>He findeth Philip </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκε Φιλιππον</span></span>). Vivid dramatic present as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:41">John 1:41</span>, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηθελησεν</span></span> (was minded, wished) is aorist active indicative. Apparently not an accidental finding, possibly due to the efforts of Andrew and Peter. Both Andrew and Philip have Greek names.</p>
<p><b>Follow me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακολουθε μο</span></span>). Present active imperative, a direct challenge to Philip. Often Jesus uses this verb to win disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:14">Mark 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:22">Matthew 8:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:21">Matthew 9:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:21">Matthew 19:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:59">Luke 9:59</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:19">John 21:19</span>). Already Jesus had four personal followers (Andrew and Simon, John and James). He has begun his work. </p>
