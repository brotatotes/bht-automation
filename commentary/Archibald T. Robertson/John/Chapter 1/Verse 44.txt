<p><b> From Bethsaida </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο Βηθσαιδα</span></span>). Same expression in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:21">John 12:21</span> with the added words "of Galilee," which locates it in Galilee, not in Iturea. There were two Bethsaidas, one called Bethsaida Julias in Iturea (that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10">Luke 9:10</span>) or the Eastern Bethsaida, the other the Western Bethsaida in Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45">Mark 6:45</span>), perhaps somewhere near Capernaum. This is the town of Andrew and Peter and Philip. Hence Philip would be inclined to follow the example of his townsmen. </p>
