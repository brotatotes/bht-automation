<p><b> Philip findeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκε Φιλιππος</span></span>). Dramatic present again. Philip carries on the work. One wins one. If that glorious beginning had only kept on! Now it takes a hundred to win one.</p>
<p><b>Nathaniel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον Ναθαναηλ</span></span>). It is a Hebrew name meaning "God has given" like the Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θεοδορε</span></span> (Gift of God). He was from Cana of Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:2">John 21:2</span>), not far from Bethsaida and so known to Philip. His name does not occur in the Synoptics while Bartholomew (a patronymic, <i>Bar Tholmai</i>) does not appear in John. They are almost certainly two names of the same man. Philip uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρηκαμεν</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:41">John 1:41</span>) also to Nathanael and so unites himself with the circle of believers, but instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μεσσιαν</span></span> describes him "of whom (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον</span></span> accusative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγραψεν</span></span>) Moses in the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>) and the prophets (so the whole O.T. as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:27">Luke 24:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:44">Luke 24:44</span>) did write."</p>
<p><b>Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησουν υιον του Ιωσηφ τον απο Ναζαρετ</span></span>). More exactly, "Jesus, son of Joseph, the one from Nazareth." Jesus passed as son (no article in the Greek) of Joseph, though John has just described him as "God-only Begotten" in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>, but certainly Philip could not know this. Bernard terms this part "the irony of St. John" for he is sure that his readers will agree with him as to the real deity of Jesus Christ. These details were probably meant to interest Nathanael. </p>
