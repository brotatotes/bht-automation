 Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?  (Εκ Ναζαρετ δυνατα τ αγαθον ειναι;). Literally, "Out of Nazareth can anything good be."

The best thing in all the world came out of Nazareth, but Philip does not argue the point. A saying had arisen that no prophet comes out of Galilee (John 7:52), untrue like many such sayings.Come and see  (ερχου κα ιδε). Present middle imperative (come on) and second active imperative (and see at once). Philip followed the method of Jesus with Andrew and John (verse John 1:39), probably without knowing it. Wise is the one who knows how to deal with the sceptic.
