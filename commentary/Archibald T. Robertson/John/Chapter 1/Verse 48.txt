<p><b> Whence knowest thou me? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ποθεν με γινωσκεισ;</span></span>). Nathanael is astonished at this tribute, at any knowledge about himself by Jesus. He had overheard Christ's comment and longed to know its source.</p>
<p><b>Before Philip called thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προ του σε Φιλιππον φωνησα</span></span>). Idiomatic Greek, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ</span></span> and the ablative case of the articular aorist active infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του φωνησα</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνεω</span></span>, to call) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σε</span></span> as the object and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φιλιππον</span></span>, the accusative of general reference, "before the calling thee as to Philip."</p>
<p><b>When thou wast under the fig tree </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οντα υπο την συκην</span></span>). "Being under the fig tree," accusative present participle agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σε</span></span>. The fig tree was a familiar object in Palestine, probably in leaf at this time, the accusative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο</span></span> may suggest that Nathanael had withdrawn there for prayer. Note genitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποκατω</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:50">John 1:50</span>. Jesus saw Nathanael's heart as well as his mere presence there. He saw him in his worship and so knew him. </p>
