 Whence knowest thou me?  (Ποθεν με γινωσκεισ;). Nathanael is astonished at this tribute, at any knowledge about himself by Jesus. He had overheard Christ's comment and longed to know its source.Before Philip called thee  (Προ του σε Φιλιππον φωνησα). Idiomatic Greek, προ and the ablative case of the articular aorist active infinitive (του φωνησα, from φωνεω, to call) with σε as the object and Φιλιππον, the accusative of general reference, "before the calling thee as to Philip."When thou wast under the fig tree  (οντα υπο την συκην). "Being under the fig tree," accusative present participle agreeing with σε. The fig tree was a familiar object in Palestine, probably in leaf at this time, the accusative with υπο may suggest that Nathanael had withdrawn there for prayer. Note genitive with υποκατω in verse John 1:50. Jesus saw Nathanael's heart as well as his mere presence there. He saw him in his worship and so knew him.
