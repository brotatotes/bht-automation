 Thou art the Son of God  (συ ε ο υιος του θεου). Whether Nathanael had heard the Baptist say this of Jesus (John 1:34) we do not know, apparently not, but Nathanael was a student of the Old Testament as Philip implied (John 1:45) and was quick to put together his knowledge, the statement of Philip, and the manifest supernatural knowledge of Jesus as just shown. There is no reason for toning down the noble confession of Nathanael in the light of Christ's claim in verse John 1:51. Cf. the confession of Peter in John 6:69; Matthew 16:16 and Martha's in John 11:27. Nathanael goes further.Thou art King of Israel  (Βασιλευς ε του Ισραηλ). To us this seems an anti-climax, but not so to Nathanael for both are Messianic titles in John 1:2 and Jesus is greeted in the Triumphal Entry as the King of Israel (John 12:13).
