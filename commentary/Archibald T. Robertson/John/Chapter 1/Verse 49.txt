<p><b> Thou art the Son of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ ε ο υιος του θεου</span></span>). Whether Nathanael had heard the Baptist say this of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:34">John 1:34</span>) we do not know, apparently not, but Nathanael was a student of the Old Testament as Philip implied (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:45">John 1:45</span>) and was quick to put together his knowledge, the statement of Philip, and the manifest supernatural knowledge of Jesus as just shown. There is no reason for toning down the noble confession of Nathanael in the light of Christ's claim in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:51">John 1:51</span>. Cf. the confession of Peter in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:69">John 6:69</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:16">Matthew 16:16</span> and Martha's in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:27">John 11:27</span>. Nathanael goes further.</p>
<p><b>Thou art King of Israel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βασιλευς ε του Ισραηλ</span></span>). To us this seems an anti-climax, but not so to Nathanael for both are Messianic titles in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:2">John 1:2</span> and Jesus is greeted in the Triumphal Entry as the King of Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:13">John 12:13</span>). </p>
