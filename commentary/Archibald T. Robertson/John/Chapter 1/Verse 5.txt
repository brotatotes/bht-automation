 Shineth  (φαινε). Linear present active indicative of φαινω, old verb from φαω, to shine (φαοσ, φως). "The light keeps on giving light."In the darkness  (εν τη σκοτια). Late word for the common σκοτος (kin to σκια, shadow). An evident allusion to the darkness brought on by sin. In 2 Peter 2:17 we have ο ζοφος του σκοτου (the blackness of darkness). The Logos, the only real moral light, keeps on shining both in the Pre-incarnate state and after the Incarnation. John is fond of σκοτια (σκοτος) for moral darkness from sin and φως (φωτιζω, φαινω) for the light that is in Christ alone. In 1 John 2:8 he proclaims that "the darkness is passing by and the true light is already shining." The Gnostics often employed these words and John takes them and puts them in the proper place.Apprehended it not  (αυτο ου κατελαβεν). Second aorist active indicative of καταλαμβανω, old verb to lay hold of, to seize. This very phrase occurs in John 12:35 (ινα μη σκοτια υμας καταλαβη) "that darkness overtake you not," the metaphor of night following day and in 1 Thessalonians 5:4 the same idiom (ινα καταλαβη) is used of day overtaking one as a thief. This is the view of Origen and appears also in 2Macc. 8:18. The same word appears in Aleph D in John 6:17 κατελαβε δε αυτους η σκοτια ("but darkness overtook them," came down on them). Hence, in spite of the Vulgate comprehenderunt, "overtook" or "overcame" seems to be the idea here. The light kept on shining in spite of the darkness that was worse than a London fog as the Old Testament and archaeological discoveries in Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, Crete, Asia Minor show.
