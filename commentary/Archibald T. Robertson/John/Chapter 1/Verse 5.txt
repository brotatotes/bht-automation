<p><b> Shineth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαινε</span></span>). Linear present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαινω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαω</span></span>, to shine (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαοσ, φως</span></span>). "The light keeps on giving light."</p>
<p><b>In the darkness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη σκοτια</span></span>). Late word for the common <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκοτος</span></span> (kin to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκια</span></span>, shadow). An evident allusion to the darkness brought on by sin. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:17">2 Peter 2:17</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ζοφος του σκοτου</span></span> (the blackness of darkness). The Logos, the only real moral light, keeps on shining both in the Pre-incarnate state and after the Incarnation. John is fond of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκοτια</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκοτος</span></span>) for moral darkness from sin and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φως</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωτιζω, φαινω</span></span>) for the light that is in Christ alone. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:8">1 John 2:8</span> he proclaims that "the darkness is passing by and the true light is already shining." The Gnostics often employed these words and John takes them and puts them in the proper place.</p>
<p><b>Apprehended it not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτο ου κατελαβεν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλαμβανω</span></span>, old verb to lay hold of, to seize. This very phrase occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:35">John 12:35</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη σκοτια υμας καταλαβη</span></span>) "that darkness overtake you not," the metaphor of night following day and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span> the same idiom (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα καταλαβη</span></span>) is used of day overtaking one as a thief. This is the view of Origen and appears also in 2Macc. 8:18. The same word appears in Aleph D in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:17">John 6:17</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατελαβε δε αυτους η σκοτια</span></span> ("but darkness overtook them," came down on them). Hence, in spite of the Vulgate <i>comprehenderunt</i>, "overtook" or "overcame" seems to be the idea here. The light kept on shining in spite of the darkness that was worse than a London fog as the Old Testament and archaeological discoveries in Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, Crete, Asia Minor show. </p>
