<p><b> Answered and said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκριθη κα ειπεν</span></span>). This redundant use of both verbs (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:26">John 1:26</span>) occurs in the Synoptics also and in the LXX also. It is Aramaic also and vernacular. It is not proof of an Aramaic original as Burney argues (<i>Aramaic Origin</i>, etc., p. 53).</p>
<p><b>Because </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). Causal use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> at beginning of the sentence as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:19">John 14:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:19">John 15:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:6">John 16:6</span>. The second <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον</span></span> (I saw) is either declarative (that) or merely recitative (either makes sense here).</p>
<p><b>Thou shalt see greater things than these </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζω τουτων οψη</span></span>). Perhaps volitive future middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span> (though merely futuristic is possible as with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψεσθε</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:51">John 1:51</span>) ablative case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span> after the comparative adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζω</span></span>. The wonder of Nathanael no doubt grew as Jesus went on. </p>
