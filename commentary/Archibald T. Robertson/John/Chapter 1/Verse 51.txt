<p><b> Verily, Verily </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αμην, αμην</span></span>). Hebrew word transliterated into Greek and then into English, our "amen." John always repeats it, not singly as in the Synoptics, and only in the words of Jesus, an illustration of Christ's authoritative manner of speaking as shown also by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω υμιν</span></span> (I say unto you). Note plural <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν</span></span> though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span> just before is singular (to him). Jesus addresses thus others besides Nathanael.</p>
<p><b>The heaven opened </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον ουρανον ανεωιγοτα</span></span>). Second perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιγω</span></span> with double reduplication, standing open. The words remind one of what took place at the baptism of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:21">Luke 3:21</span>), but the immediate reference is to the opened heaven as the symbol of free intercourse between God and man (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+64:1">Isaiah 64:1</span>) and as it was later illustrated in the death of Stephen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:56">Acts 7:56</span>). There is a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+28:12">Genesis 28:12</span>, Jacob's vision at Bethel. That was a dream to Jacob, but Christ is himself the bond of fellowship between heaven and earth, between God and man, for Jesus is both "the Son of God" as Nathanael said and "the Son of Man" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τον υιον του ανθρωπου</span></span>) as Jesus here calls himself. God and man meet in Christ. He is the true Jacob's Ladder. "I am the Way," Jesus will say. He is more than King of Israel, he is the Son of Man (the race). So quickly has this Gospel brought out in the witness of the Baptist, the faith of the first disciples, the claims of Jesus Christ, the fully developed picture of the Logos who is both God and man, moving among men and winning them to his service. At the close of the ministry Christ will tell Caiaphas that he will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:62">Mark 14:62</span>). Here at the start Jesus is conscious of the final culmination and in apocalyptic eschatological language that we do not fully understand he sets forth the dignity and majesty of his Person. </p>
