<p><b> For witness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις μαρτυριαν</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρεω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυς</span></span>), both more common in John's writings than the rest of the N.T. This the purpose of the Baptist's ministry.</p>
<p><b>That he might bear witness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μαρτυρηση</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρεω</span></span> to make clearer <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις μαρτυριαν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Of the light </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ του φωτος</span></span>). "Concerning the light." The light was shining and men with blinded eyes were not seeing the light (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:26">John 1:26</span>), blinded by the god of this world still (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>). John had his own eyes opened so that he saw and told what he saw. That is the mission of every preacher of Christ. But he must first have his own eyes opened.</p>
<p><b>That all might believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα πιστευσωσιν</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>, ingressive aorist "come to believe." This is one of John's great words (about 100 times), "with nine times the frequency with which it is used by the Synoptists" (Bernard). And yet <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span>, so common in Paul, John uses only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span> and four times in the Apocalypse where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span> does not occur at all. Here it is used absolutely as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:50">John 1:50</span>, etc.</p>
<p><b>Through him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' αυτου</span></span>). As the intermediate agent in winning men to believe in Christ (the Logos) as the Light and the Life of men. This is likewise the purpose of the author of this book (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:31">John 21:31</span>). The preacher is merely the herald to point men to Christ. </p>
