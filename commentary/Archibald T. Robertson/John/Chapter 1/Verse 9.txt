<p><b> There was </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span>). Imperfect indicative. Emphatic position at the beginning of the sentence and so probably not periphrastic conjugation with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομενον</span></span> (coming) near the end, though that is possible.</p>
<p><b>The true light </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το φως το αληθινον</span></span>). "The light the genuine," not a false light of wreckers of ships, but the dependable light that guides to the harbor of safety. This true light had been on hand all the time in the darkness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> imperfect, linear action) before John came.</p>
<p><b>Even the light </b> (not in the Greek). Added in the English to make plain this interpretation.</p>
<p><b>Lighteth every man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωτιζε παντα ανθρωπον</span></span>). Old verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φως</span></span>) to give light as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:5">Revelation 22:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:35">Luke 11:35</span>. The Quakers appeal to this phrase for their belief that to every man there is given an inner light that is a sufficient guide, the Quaker's text it is called. But it may only mean that all the real light that men receive comes from Christ, not necessarily that each one receives a special revelation.</p>
<p><b>Coming </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομενον</span></span>). This present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span> can be taken with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπον</span></span> just before (accusative masculine singular), "every man as he comes into the world." It can also be construed with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φως</span></span> (nominative neuter singular). This idea occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:27">John 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:46">John 12:46</span>. In the two last passages the phrase is used of the Messiah which makes it probable here. But even so the light presented in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:27">John 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:46">John 12:46</span> is that of the Incarnate Messiah, not the Pre-incarnate Logos. Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοσμος</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα</span></span> occurs in the sense of the orderly universe as often in this Gospel. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>. </p>
