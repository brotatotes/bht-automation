<p><b> Verily, Verily </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αμην, αμην</span></span>). Solemn prelude by repetition as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:51">John 1:51</span>. The words do not ever introduce a fresh topic (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:34">John 8:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:51">John 8:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:58">John 8:58</span>). So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:7">John 10:7</span>. The Pharisees had previously assumed (Vincent) they alone were the authoritative guides of the people (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:24">John 9:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:29">John 9:29</span>). So Jesus has a direct word for them. So Jesus begins this allegory in a characteristic way. John does not use the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολη</span></span>, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροιμια</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:6">John 10:6</span>), and it really is an allegory of the Good Shepherd and self-explanatory like that of the Prodigal Son in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:15">John 10:15</span>. He first tells it in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1-5">John 10:1-5</span> and then explains and expands it in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:7-18">John 10:7-18</span>.</p>
<p><b>Into the fold of the sheep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την αυλην των προβατων</span></span>). Originally <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυλη</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αω</span></span>, to blow) in Homer's time was just an uncovered space around the house enclosed by a wall, then a roofless enclosure in the country where flocks were herded as here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:16">John 10:16</span>. It later came to mean the house itself or palace (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:3">Matthew 26:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:58">Matthew 26:58</span>, etc.). In the papyri it means the court attached to the house.</p>
<p><b>Climbeth up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινων</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινω</span></span>, to go up. One who goes up, not by the door, has to climb up over the wall.</p>
<p><b>Some other way </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλαχοθεν</span></span>). Rare word for old <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλοθεν</span></span>, but in 4Macc. 1:7 and in a papyrus. Only here in N.T.</p>
<p><b>The same </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος</span></span>). "That one" just described.</p>
<p><b>Is a thief and a robber </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλεπτης εστιν κα ληιστης</span></span>). Both old and common words (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλεπτω</span></span>, to steal, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ληιζομα</span></span>, to plunder). The distinction is preserved in the N.T. as here. Judas was a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλεπτης</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:6">John 12:6</span>), Barabbas a robber (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:40">John 18:40</span>) like the two robbers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:38">Matthew 27:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:44">Matthew 27:44</span>) crucified with Jesus erroneously termed thieves like "the thief on the cross" by most people. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:17">Mark 11:17</span>. Here the man jumping over the wall comes to steal and to do it by violence like a bandit. He is both thief and robber. </p>
