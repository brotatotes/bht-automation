 But that he may steal, and kill, and destroy  (ε μη ινα κλεψη κα θυση κα απολεση). Literally, "except that" (ε μη) common without (Matthew 12:4) and with verb (Galatians 1:7), "if not" (literally), followed here by final ινα and three aorist active subjunctives as sometimes by οταν (Mark 9:9) or οτ (2 Corinthians 12:13). Note the order of the verbs. Stealing is the purpose of the thief, but he will kill and destroy if necessary just like the modern bandit or gangster.I came that they may have life  (εγω ηλθον ινα ζωην εχωσιν). In sharp contrast (εγω) as the good shepherd with the thieves and robbers of verse John 10:1 came Jesus. Note present active subjunctive (εχωσιν), "that they (people) may keep on having life (eternal, he means)" as he shows in John 10:28. He is "the life" (John 14:6).And may have it abundantly  (κα περισσον εχωσιν). Repetition of εχωσιν (may keep on having) abundance (περισσον, neuter singular of περισσος). Xenophon (Anab. VII. vi. 31) uses περισσον εχειν, "to have a surplus," true to the meaning of overflow from περ (around) seen in Paul's picture of the overplus (υπερεπερισσευσεν in Romans 5:20) of grace. Abundance of life and all that sustains life, Jesus gives.
