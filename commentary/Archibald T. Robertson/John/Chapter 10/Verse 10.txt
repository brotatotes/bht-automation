<p><b> But that he may steal, and kill, and destroy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη ινα κλεψη κα θυση κα απολεση</span></span>). Literally, "except that" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη</span></span>) common without (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:4">Matthew 12:4</span>) and with verb (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7">Galatians 1:7</span>), "if not" (literally), followed here by final <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and three aorist active subjunctives as sometimes by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:9">Mark 9:9</span>) or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:13">2 Corinthians 12:13</span>). Note the order of the verbs. Stealing is the purpose of the thief, but he will kill and destroy if necessary just like the modern bandit or gangster.</p>
<p><b>I came that they may have life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω ηλθον ινα ζωην εχωσιν</span></span>). In sharp contrast (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω</span></span>) as the good shepherd with the thieves and robbers of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span> came Jesus. Note present active subjunctive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχωσιν</span></span>), "that they (people) may keep on having life (eternal, he means)" as he shows in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:28">John 10:28</span>. He is "the life" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>And may have it abundantly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα περισσον εχωσιν</span></span>). Repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχωσιν</span></span> (may keep on having) abundance (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσον</span></span>, neuter singular of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσος</span></span>). Xenophon (<i>Anab</i>. VII. vi. 31) uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσον εχειν</span></span>, "to have a surplus," true to the meaning of overflow from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> (around) seen in Paul's picture of the overplus (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερεπερισσευσεν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:20">Romans 5:20</span>) of grace. Abundance of life and all that sustains life, Jesus gives. </p>
