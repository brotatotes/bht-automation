<p><b> I am the good shepherd </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω ειμ ο ποιμην ο καλος</span></span>). Note repetition of the article, "the shepherd the good one." Takes up the metaphor of verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:2">John 10:2</span>. Vulgate <i>pastor bonus</i>. Philo calls his good shepherd <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθος</span></span>, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλος</span></span> calls attention to the beauty in character and service like "good stewards" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:10">1 Peter 4:10</span>), "a good minister of Christ Jesus" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:6">1 Timothy 4:6</span>). Often both adjectives appear together in the ancient Greek as once in the New Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:15">Luke 8:15</span>). "Beauty is as beauty does." That is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλος</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Layeth down his life for his sheep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ψυχην αυτου τιθησιν υπερ των προβατων</span></span>). For illustration see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+17:35">1 Samuel 17:35</span> (David's experience) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+31:4">Isaiah 31:4</span>. Dods quotes Xenophon (<i>Mem</i>. ii. 7, 14) who pictures even the sheep dog as saying to the sheep: "For I am the one that saves you also so that you are neither stolen by men nor seized by wolves." Hippocrates has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχην κατεθετο</span></span> (he laid down his life, i.e. died). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+12:3">Judges 12:3</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθηκα την ψυχην</span></span> means "I risked my life." The true physician does this for his patient as the shepherd for his sheep. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> here (over, in behalf of, instead of), but in the papyri <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> is the usual preposition for substitution rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span>. This shepherd gives his life for the sin of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span>). </p>
