<p><b> He that is a hireling </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μισθωτος</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθοω</span></span>, to hire (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:1">Matthew 20:1</span>) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθος</span></span> (hire, wages, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:7">Luke 10:7</span>), in N.T. only in this passage. Literally, "the hireling and not being a shepherd" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μισθωτος κα ουκ ων ποιμην</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span> with the participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span> to emphasize the certainty that he is not a shepherd in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη εισερχομενος</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span> (conceived case). See same contrast in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:8">1 Peter 1:8</span> between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ιδοντες</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ορωντες</span></span>. The hireling here is not necessarily the thief and robber of verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:8">John 10:8</span>. He may conceivably be a nominal shepherd (pastor) of the flock who serves only for the money, a sin against which Peter warned the shepherds of the flock "not for shameful gain" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:2">1 Peter 5:2</span>).</p>
<p><b>Whose own </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου ιδια</span></span>). Every true shepherd considers the sheep in his care "his own" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδια</span></span>) even if he does not actually "own" them. The mere "hireling" does not feel so.</p>
<p><b>Beholdeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεωρε</span></span>). Vivid dramatic present, active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεωρεω</span></span>, a graphic picture.</p>
<p><b>The wolf coming </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον λυκον ερχομενον</span></span>). Present middle predicate participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Leaveth the sheep, and fleeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιησιν τα προβατα κα φευγε</span></span>). Graphic present actives again of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιημ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φευγω</span></span>. The cowardly hireling cares naught for the sheep, but only for his own skin. The wolf was the chief peril to sheep in Palestine. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:6">Matthew 10:6</span> where Jesus says: "Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves."</p>
<p><b>And the wolf snatcheth them and scattereth them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο λυκος αρπαζε κα σκορπιζε</span></span>). Vivid parenthesis in the midst of the picture of the conduct of the hireling. Bold verbs these. For the old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαζω</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:15">John 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:12">Matthew 11:12</span>, and for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκορπιζω</span></span>, late word (Plutarch) for the Attic <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκεδαννυμ</span></span>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:30">Matthew 12:30</span>. It occurs in the vision of Ezekiel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:5">Ezekiel 34:5</span>) where because of the careless shepherds "the sheep became meat to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered." Jesus uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαζω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:29">John 10:29</span> where no one is able "to snatch" one out of the Father's hand. </p>
