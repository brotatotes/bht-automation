 He that is a hireling  (ο μισθωτος). Old word from μισθοω, to hire (Matthew 20:1) from μισθος (hire, wages, Luke 10:7), in N.T. only in this passage. Literally, "the hireling and not being a shepherd" (ο μισθωτος κα ουκ ων ποιμην). Note ουκ with the participle ων to emphasize the certainty that he is not a shepherd in contrast with μη εισερχομενος in verse John 10:1 (conceived case). See same contrast in 1 Peter 1:8 between ουκ ιδοντες and μη ορωντες. The hireling here is not necessarily the thief and robber of verses John 10:1; John 10:8. He may conceivably be a nominal shepherd (pastor) of the flock who serves only for the money, a sin against which Peter warned the shepherds of the flock "not for shameful gain" (1 Peter 5:2).Whose own  (ου ιδια). Every true shepherd considers the sheep in his care "his own" (ιδια) even if he does not actually "own" them. The mere "hireling" does not feel so.Beholdeth  (θεωρε). Vivid dramatic present, active indicative of θεωρεω, a graphic picture.The wolf coming  (τον λυκον ερχομενον). Present middle predicate participle of ερχομα.Leaveth the sheep, and fleeth  (αφιησιν τα προβατα κα φευγε). Graphic present actives again of αφιημ and φευγω. The cowardly hireling cares naught for the sheep, but only for his own skin. The wolf was the chief peril to sheep in Palestine. See Matthew 10:6 where Jesus says: "Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves."And the wolf snatcheth them and scattereth them  (κα ο λυκος αρπαζε κα σκορπιζε). Vivid parenthesis in the midst of the picture of the conduct of the hireling. Bold verbs these. For the old verb αρπαζω see John 6:15; Matthew 11:12, and for σκορπιζω, late word (Plutarch) for the Attic σκεδαννυμ, see Matthew 12:30. It occurs in the vision of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 34:5) where because of the careless shepherds "the sheep became meat to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered." Jesus uses αρπαζω in John 10:29 where no one is able "to snatch" one out of the Father's hand.
