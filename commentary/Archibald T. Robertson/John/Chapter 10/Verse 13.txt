<p><b> Because he is a hireling </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ μισθωτος εστιν</span></span>). And only that, without the shepherd heart that loves the sheep. Reason given for the conduct of the hireling after the parenthesis about the wolf.</p>
<p><b>And careth not for the sheep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ου μελε αυτω περ των προβατων</span></span>). Literally, "and it is no care to him about the sheep." This use of the impersonal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελε</span></span> (present active indicative) is quite common, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:16">Matthew 22:16</span>. But God does care (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:7">1 Peter 5:7</span>). </p>
