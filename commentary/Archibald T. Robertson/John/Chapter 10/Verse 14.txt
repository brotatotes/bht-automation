<p><b> I am the good-shepherd </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω ειμ ο ποιμην ο καλος</span></span>). Effective repetition.</p>
<p><b>And mine own know me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα γινωσκουσιν με τα εμα</span></span>). Jesus as the Good Shepherd knows his sheep by name as he had already said (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:3">John 10:3</span>) and now repeats. Yes, and they know his voice (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:4">John 10:4</span>), they have experimental knowledge (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>) of Jesus as their own Shepherd. Here (in this mutually reciprocal knowledge) lies the secret of their love and loyalty. </p>
