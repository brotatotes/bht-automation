 I am the good-shepherd  (εγω ειμ ο ποιμην ο καλος). Effective repetition.And mine own know me  (κα γινωσκουσιν με τα εμα). Jesus as the Good Shepherd knows his sheep by name as he had already said (verse John 10:3) and now repeats. Yes, and they know his voice (verse John 10:4), they have experimental knowledge (γινωσκω) of Jesus as their own Shepherd. Here (in this mutually reciprocal knowledge) lies the secret of their love and loyalty.
