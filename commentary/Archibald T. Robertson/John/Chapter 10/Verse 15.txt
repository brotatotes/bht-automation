<p><b> And I know the Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καγω γινωσκω τον πατερα</span></span>). Hence he is qualified to reveal the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>). The comparison of the mutually reciprocal knowledge between the Father and the Son illustrates what he has just said, though it stands above all else (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:22">Luke 10:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21-26">John 17:21-26</span>). We cannot claim such perfect knowledge of the Good Shepherd as exists between the Father and the Son and yet the real sheep do know the Shepherd's voice and do love to follow his leadership here and now in spite of thieves, robbers, wolves, hirelings.</p>
<p><b>And I lay down my life for the sheep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα την ψυχην μου τιθημ υπερ των προβατων</span></span>). This he had said in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>, but he repeats it now for clearness. This he does not just as an example for the sheep and for under-shepherds, but primarily to save the sheep from the wolves, the thieves and robbers. </p>
