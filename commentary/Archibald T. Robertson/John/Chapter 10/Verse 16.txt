<p><b> Other sheep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα προβατα</span></span>). Sheep, not goats, but "not of this fold" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ της αυλης ταυτης</span></span>). See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυλη</span></span>. Clearly "his flock is not confined to those enclosed in the Jewish fold, whether in Palestine or elsewhere" (Westcott). Christ's horizon takes in all men of all races and times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:52">John 11:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:32">John 12:32</span>). The world mission of Christ for all nations is no new idea with him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:11">Matthew 8:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:28">Luke 13:28</span>). God loved the world and gave his Son for the race (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Jον 3:16</span></span>),</p>
<p><b>Them also I must bring </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακεινα δε με αγαγειν</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> expressing the moral urgency of Christ's passion for God's people in all lands and ages. Missions in Christ's mind takes in the whole world. This is according to prophecy (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:6">Isaiah 42:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:6">Isaiah 49:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+56:8">Isaiah 56:8</span>) for the Messiah is to be a Light also to the Gentiles. It was typified by the brazen serpent (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14">John 3:14</span>). Christ died for every man. The Pharisees doubtless listened in amazement and even the disciples with slow comprehension.</p>
<p><b>And they shall hear my voice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα της φωνης μου ακουσοντα</span></span>). Future middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span> with the genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνης</span></span>. These words read like a transcript from the Acts and the Epistles of Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:9-11">John 10:9-11</span> in particular). See especially Paul's words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:28">Acts 28:28</span>. Present-day Christianity is here foretold. Only do we really listen to the voice of the Shepherd as we should? Jesus means that the Gentiles will hearken if the Jews turn away from him.</p>
<p><b>And they shall become one flock, one shepherd </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα γενησοντα μια ποιμνη, εις ποιμην</span></span>). Future middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>, plural, not singular <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενησετα</span></span> as some MSS. have it. All (Jews and Gentiles) will form one flock under one Shepherd. Note the distinction here by Jesus between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμνη</span></span> (old word, contraction of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμενη</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμην</span></span>, shepherd), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:31">Matthew 26:31</span>, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυλη</span></span> (fold) just before. There may be many folds of the one flock. Jerome in his Vulgate confused this distinction, but he is wrong. His use of <i>ovile</i> for both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυλη</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πομνιον</span></span> has helped Roman Catholic assumptions. Christ's use of "flock" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμνη</span></span>) here is just another metaphor for kingdom (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλεια</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:11">Matthew 8:11</span> where the children of the kingdom come from all climes and nations. See also the various metaphors in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:2">John 10:2</span> for this same idea. There is only the one Great Shepherd of the sheep (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:20">Hebrews 13:20</span>), Jesus Christ our Lord. </p>
