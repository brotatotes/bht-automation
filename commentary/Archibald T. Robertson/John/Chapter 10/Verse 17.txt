The Father's love for the Son is drawn out (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>) by the voluntary offering of the Son for the sin of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8">Romans 5:8</span>).

Jesus does for us what any good shepherd does (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>) as he has already said (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:15">John 10:15</span>). The value of the atoning death of Christ lies in the fact that he is the Son of God, the Son of Man, free of sin, and that he makes the offering voluntarily (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>).</p>

Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>. He looked beyond his death on the Cross to the resurrection. "The purpose of the Passion was not merely to exhibit his unselfish love; it was in order that He might resume His life, now enriched with quickening power as never before" (Bernard). The Father raised Jesus from the dead (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:32">Acts 2:32</span>). There is spontaneity in the surrender to death and in the taking life back again (Dods). </p>
