 No one taketh it away from me  (ουδεις αιρε αυτην απ' εμου). But Aleph B read ηρεν (first aorist active indicative of αιρω, to take away), probably correct (Westcott and Hort). "John is representing Jesus as speaking sub specie aeternitatis" (Bernard). He speaks of his death as already past and the resurrection as already accomplished. Cf. John 3:16.Of myself  (απ' εμαυτου). The voluntariness of the death of Jesus repeated and sharpened. D omits it, probably because of superficial and apparent conflict with John 5:19. But there is no inconsistency as is shown by John 3:16; Romans 5:8. The Father "gave" the Son who was glad to be given and to give himself.I have power to lay it down  (εξουσιαν εχω θεινα αυτην). Εξουσια is not an easy word to translate (right, authority, power, privilege). See John 1:12. Restatement of the voluntariness of his death for the sheep.  And I have power to take it again  (κα εξουσιαν εχω παλιν λαβειν αυτην). Note second aorist active infinitive in both cases (θεινα from τιθημ and λαβειν from λαμβανω), single acts. Recall John 2:19 where Jesus said: "And in three days I will raise it up." He did not mean that he will raise himself from the dead independently of the Father as the active agent (Romans 8:11).I received from my Father  (ελαβον παρα του πατρος μου). Second aorist active indicative of λαμβανω. He always follows the Father's command (εντολη) in all things (John 12:49; John 14:31). So now he is doing the Father's will about his death and resurrection.
