<p><b> No one taketh it away from me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεις αιρε αυτην απ' εμου</span></span>). But Aleph B read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρεν</span></span> (first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρω</span></span>, to take away), probably correct (Westcott and Hort). "John is representing Jesus as speaking <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i>" (Bernard). He speaks of his death as already past and the resurrection as already accomplished. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>Of myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' εμαυτου</span></span>). The voluntariness of the death of Jesus repeated and sharpened. D omits it, probably because of superficial and apparent conflict with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span>. But there is no inconsistency as is shown by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8">Romans 5:8</span>. The Father "gave" the Son who was glad to be given and to give himself.</p>
<p><b>I have power to lay it down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσιαν εχω θεινα αυτην</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εξουσια</span></span> is not an easy word to translate (right, authority, power, privilege). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:12">John 1:12</span>. Restatement of the voluntariness of his death for the sheep. </p>
<p><b> And I have power to take it again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εξουσιαν εχω παλιν λαβειν αυτην</span></span>). Note second aorist active infinitive in both cases (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεινα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαβειν</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>), single acts. Recall <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span> where Jesus said: "And in three days I will raise it up." He did not mean that he will raise himself from the dead independently of the Father as the active agent (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span>).</p>
<p><b>I received from my Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαβον παρα του πατρος μου</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>. He always follows the Father's command (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντολη</span></span>) in all things (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:49">John 12:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:31">John 14:31</span>). So now he is doing the Father's will about his death and resurrection. </p>
