 There arose a division again  (σχισμα παλιν εγενετο). As in John 7:43 in the crowd (also in John 7:12; John 7:31), so now among the hostile Jews (Pharisees) some of whom had previously professed belief in him (John 8:31). The direct reference of παλιν (again) may be to John 9:16 when the Pharisees were divided over the problem of the blind man. Division of opinion about Jesus is a common thing in John's Gospel (John 6:52; John 6:60; John 6:66; John 7:12; John 7:25; John 8:22; John 9:16; John 10:19; John 10:24; John 10:41; John 11:41; John 12:19; John 12:29; John 12:42; John 16:18).
