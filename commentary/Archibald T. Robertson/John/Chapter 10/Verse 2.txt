<p><b> The shepherd of the sheep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμην εστιν των προβατων</span></span>). No article with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμην</span></span>, "a shepherd to the sheep." He comes in by the door with the sheep whom he leads. Old word is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμην</span></span>, root meaning to protect. Jesus applies it to himself in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:16">John 10:16</span> and implies it here. It is used of Christ in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:25">1 Peter 2:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:20">Hebrews 13:20</span>. Paul applies it to ministers in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>. Jesus uses the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιμαινω</span></span>, to shepherd, to Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:16">John 21:16</span>) and Peter uses it to other preachers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:2">1 Peter 5:2</span>) and Paul uses it for bishops (elders) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>. Our word pastor is simply Latin for shepherd. Christ is drawing a sharp contrast after the conduct of the Pharisees towards the blind man between himself and them. </p>
