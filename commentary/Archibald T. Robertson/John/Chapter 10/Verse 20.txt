<p><b> He has a demon and is mad </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονιον εχε κα μαινετα</span></span>). As some had already said (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:20">John 7:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:48">John 8:48</span> with the addition of "Samaritan"). So long before in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:21">Mark 3:21</span>. An easy way of discounting Jesus. </p>
