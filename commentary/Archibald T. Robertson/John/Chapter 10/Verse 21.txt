<p><b> Of one possessed with a demon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονιζομενου</span></span>). Genitive of present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονιζω</span></span>. They had heard demoniacs talk, but not like this.</p>
<p><b>Can a demon open the eyes of the blind? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη δαιμονιον δυνατα τυφλον οφθαλμους ανοιξαι;</span></span>). Negative answer expected. Demons would more likely put out eyes, not open them. It was an unanswerable question. </p>
