<p><b> And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο δε τα ενκαινια εν τοις Ιεροσολυμοις</span></span>). But Westcott and Hort read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε</span></span> (then) instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> (and) on the authority of B L W 33 and some versions. This is probably correct: "At that time came the feast of dedication in Jerusalem." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τοτε</span></span> does not mean that the preceding events followed immediately after the incidents in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1-21">John 10:1-21</span>. Bernard brings chapter 9 up to this date (possibly also chapter 8) and rearranges chapter 10 in a purely arbitrary way. There is no real reason for this arrangement. Clearly there is a considerable lapse between the events in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:22-39">John 10:22-39</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1-21">John 10:1-21</span>, possibly nearly three months (from just after tabernacles <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span> to dedication <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:22">John 10:22</span>). The Pharisees greet his return with the same desire to catch him. This feast of dedication, celebrated for eight days about the middle of our December, was instituted by Judas Maccabeus B.C. 164 in commemoration of the cleansing of the temple from the defilements of pagan worship by Antiochus Epiphanes (1Macc. 4:59). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενκαινια</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινος</span></span>, new) occurs here only in the N.T. It was not one of the great feasts and could be observed elsewhere without coming to Jerusalem. Jesus had apparently spent the time between tabernacles and dedication in Judea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:1-13">Luke 10:1-13</span>).</p>
<p><b>Winter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειμων</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειμα</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χεω</span></span>, to pour, rain, or from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χιων</span></span>, snow). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:20">Matthew 24:20</span>. </p>
