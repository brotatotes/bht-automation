<p><b> Was walking </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεπατε</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιπατεω</span></span>, to walk around, picturesque imperfect.</p>
<p><b>In Solomon's porch </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη στοα του Σολομωνος</span></span>). A covered colonnade or portico in which people could walk in all weather. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:11">Acts 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:12">Acts 5:12</span> for this porch. This particular part of Solomon's temple was left uninjured by the Babylonians and survived apparently till the destruction of the temple by Titus A.D. 70 (Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. XX. 9,7). When John wrote, it was, of course, gone. </p>
