<p><b> Came round about him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκυκλωσαν αυτον</span></span>). Aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυκλοω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυκλος</span></span> (cycle, circle). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:20">Acts 14:20</span> for the circle of disciples around Paul when stoned. Evidently the hostile Jews cherished the memory of the stinging rebuke given them by Jesus when here last, particularly the allegory of the Good Shepherd (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1-19">John 10:1-19</span>), in which he drew so sharply their own picture.</p>
<p><b>How long dost thou hold us in suspense? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως ποτε την ψυχην ημων αιρεισ;</span></span>). Literally, "Until when dost thou lift up our soul?" But what do they mean by this metaphor? <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αιρω</span></span> is common enough to lift up the eyes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:41">John 11:41</span>), the voice (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:13">Luke 17:13</span>), and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+25:1">Psalms 25:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+86:4">Psalms 86:4</span> (Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. III. ii. 3) we have "to lift up the soul." We are left to the context to judge the precise meaning. Clearly the Jews mean to imply doubt and suspense. The next remark makes it clear.</p>
<p><b>If thou art the Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε συ ε ο Χριστος</span></span>). Condition of first class assumed to be true for the sake of argument.</p>
<p><b>Tell us plainly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον ημιν παρρησια</span></span>). Conclusion with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον</span></span> rather than the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπε</span></span> as if first aorist active imperative like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυσον</span></span>. The point is in "plainly" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησια</span></span>), adverb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:13">John 7:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:26">John 7:26</span> which see. That is to say "I am the Christ" in so many words. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:14">John 11:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:29">John 16:29</span> for the same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησια</span></span>. The demand seemed fair enough on the surface. They had made it before when here at the feast of tabernacles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:25">John 8:25</span>). Jesus declined to use the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος</span></span> (Messiah) then as now because of the political bearing of the word in their minds. The populace in Galilee had once tried to make him king in opposition to Pilate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:14">John 6:14</span>). When Jesus does confess on oath before Caiaphas that he is the Christ the Son of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:61">Mark 14:61</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:63">Matthew 26:63</span>), the Sanhedrin instantly vote him guilty of blasphemy and then bring him to Pilate with the charge of claiming to be king as a rival to Caesar. Jesus knew their minds too well to be caught now. </p>
