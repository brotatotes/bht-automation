 I told you, and you believe not  (ειπον υμιν κα ου πιστευετε). It was useless to say more. In John 7:14-10 Jesus had shown that he was the Son of the Father as he had previously claimed (John 5:17-47), but it was all to no purpose save to increase their rage towards him.These bear witness of me  (ταυτα μαρτυρε περ εμου). His works confirm his words as he had shown before (John 5:36). They believe neither his words nor his works.
