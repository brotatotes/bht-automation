<p><b> I told you, and you believe not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον υμιν κα ου πιστευετε</span></span>). It was useless to say more. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:14-10">John 7:14-10</span> Jesus had shown that he was the Son of the Father as he had previously claimed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:17-47">John 5:17-47</span>), but it was all to no purpose save to increase their rage towards him.</p>
<p><b>These bear witness of me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτα μαρτυρε περ εμου</span></span>). His works confirm his words as he had shown before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:36">John 5:36</span>). They believe neither his words nor his works. </p>
