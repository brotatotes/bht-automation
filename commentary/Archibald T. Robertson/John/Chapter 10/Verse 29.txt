<p><b> Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span>). Who. If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> (which) is correct, we have to take <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πατηρ</span></span> as nominative absolute or independent, "As for my Father."</p>
<p><b>Is greater than all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντων μειζων εστιν</span></span>). If we read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span>. But Aleph B L W read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> and A B Theta have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζον</span></span>. The neuter seems to be correct (Westcott and Hort). But is it? If so, the meaning is: "As for my Father, that which he hath given me is greater than all." But the context calls for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος ... μειζων</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πατηρ</span></span> as the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span>. The greatness of the Father, not of the flock, is the ground of the safety of the flock. Hence the conclusion that "no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand." </p>
