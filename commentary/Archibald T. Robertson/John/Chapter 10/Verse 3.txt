<p><b> To him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτω</span></span>). "To this one," the shepherd, in dative case.</p>
<p><b>The porter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θυρωρος</span></span>). Old word for doorkeeper (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυρα</span></span>, door, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωρα</span></span>, care, carer for the door). Used for man (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:34">Mark 13:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:3">John 10:3</span>) or woman (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:16">John 18:16</span>), only N.T. examples. The porter has charge of the sheep in the fold at night and opens the door in the morning for the shepherd. It is not certain that Jesus meant this detail to have a special application. The Holy Spirit, of course, does open the door of our hearts for Jesus through various agencies.</p>
<p><b>Hear his voice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της φωνης αυτου ακουε</span></span>). Hear and heed (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:27">John 10:27</span>). Note genitive case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνης</span></span> (accusative in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:8">John 3:8</span>).</p>
<p><b>By name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ' ονομα</span></span>). Several flocks might be herded in the same fold overnight. But the shepherd knows his own (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα ιδια</span></span>) sheep (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:27">John 10:27</span>) and calls their names. "It is still common for Eastern shepherds to give particular names to their sheep" (Bernard).</p>
<p><b>And leadeth them out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εξαγε αυτα</span></span>). Old and common verb, present active indicative. The sheep follow readily (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:27">John 10:27</span>) because they know their own shepherd's voice and his name for each of them and because he has led them out before. They love and trust their shepherd. </p>
