<p><b> One </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>). Neuter, not masculine (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>). Not one person (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:28">Galatians 3:28</span>), but one essence or nature. By the plural <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμυς</span></span> (separate persons) Sabellius is refuted, by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υνυμ</span></span> Arius. So Bengel rightly argues, though Jesus is not referring, of course, to either Sabellius or Arius. The Pharisees had accused Jesus of making himself equal with God as his own special Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span>). Jesus then admitted and proved this claim (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19-30">John 5:19-30</span>). Now he states it tersely in this great saying repeated later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:11">John 17:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21">John 17:21</span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:3">1 Corinthians 3:3</span> of the oneness in work of the planter and the waterer and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:11">John 17:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:23">John 17:23</span> of the hoped for unity of Christ's disciples. This crisp statement is the climax of Christ's claims concerning the relation between the Father and himself (the Son). They stir the Pharisees to uncontrollable anger. </p>
