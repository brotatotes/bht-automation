 One  (εν). Neuter, not masculine (εις). Not one person (cf. εις in Galatians 3:28), but one essence or nature. By the plural συμυς (separate persons) Sabellius is refuted, by υνυμ Arius. So Bengel rightly argues, though Jesus is not referring, of course, to either Sabellius or Arius. The Pharisees had accused Jesus of making himself equal with God as his own special Father (John 5:18). Jesus then admitted and proved this claim (John 5:19-30). Now he states it tersely in this great saying repeated later (John 17:11; John 17:21). Note εν used in 1 Corinthians 3:3 of the oneness in work of the planter and the waterer and in John 17:11; John 17:23 of the hoped for unity of Christ's disciples. This crisp statement is the climax of Christ's claims concerning the relation between the Father and himself (the Son). They stir the Pharisees to uncontrollable anger.
