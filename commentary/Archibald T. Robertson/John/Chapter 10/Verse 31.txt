 Took up stones again  (εβαστασαν παλιν λιθους). First aorist active indicative of βασταζω, old verb to pick up, to carry (John 12:6), to bear (Galatians 6:5). The παλιν refers to John 8:59 where ηραν was used. They wanted to kill him also when he made himself equal to God in John 5:18. Perhaps here εβαστασαν means "they fetched stones from a distance."To stone him  (ινα λιθασωσιν αυτον). Final clause with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of λιθαζω, late verb (Aristotle, Polybius) from λιθος (stone, small, Matthew 4:6, or large, Matthew 28:2), in John 10:31-33; John 11:8; Acts 5:26; Acts 14:19; 2 Corinthians 11:25; Hebrews 11:37, but not in the Synoptics. It means to pelt with stones, to overwhelm with stones.
