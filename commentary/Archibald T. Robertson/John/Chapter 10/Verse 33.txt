<p><b> For a good work we stone thee not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ καλου εργου ου λιθαζομεν</span></span>). "Concerning a good deed we are not stoning thee." Flat denial that the healing of the blind man on the Sabbath had led them to this attempt (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:59">John 8:59</span>) in spite of the facts.</p>
<p><b>But for blasphemy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα περ βλασφημιας</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:7">Acts 26:7</span> where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> with the genitive is also used with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγκαλουμα</span></span> for the charge against Paul. This is the only example in John of the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλασφημια</span></span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:31">Matthew 12:31</span>).</p>
<p><b>And because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα οτ συ ανθρωπος ων ποιεις σεαυτον θεον</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span> they stated the charge more accurately: "He called God his own Father, making himself equal with God." That is, he made himself the Son of God. This he did beyond a doubt. But was it blasphemy? Only if he was not the Son of God. The penalty for blasphemy was death by stoning (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+24:16">Leviticus 24:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+21:10">1 Kings 21:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+21:13">1 Kings 21:13</span>). </p>
