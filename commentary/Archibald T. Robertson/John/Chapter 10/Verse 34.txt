<p><b> Is it not written? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν γεγραμμενον;</span></span>). Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span> (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:17">John 2:17</span>) in place of the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγραπτα</span></span>. "Does it not stand written?"</p>
<p><b>In your law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω νομω υμων</span></span>). From <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+82:6">Psalms 82:6</span>. The term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομος</span></span> (law) applying here to the entire O.T. as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:34">John 12:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:25">John 15:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:19">Romans 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:21">1 Corinthians 14:21</span>. Aleph D Syr-sin. omit <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμων</span></span>, but needlessly. We have it already so from Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:17">John 8:17</span>. They posed as the special custodians of the O.T.</p>
<p><b>I said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ εγω ειπα</span></span>). Recitative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> before a direct quotation like our quotation marks. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ειπα</span></span> is a late second aorist form of indicative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-α</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ον</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Ye are gods </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεο εστε</span></span>). Another direct quotation after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπα</span></span> but without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>. The judges of Israel abused their office and God is represented in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+82:6">Psalms 82:6</span> as calling them "gods" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεο</span></span>, <i>elohim</i>) because they were God's representatives. See the same use of <i>elohim</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:6">Exodus 21:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:9">Exodus 22:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:28">Exodus 22:28</span>. Jesus meets the rabbis on their own ground in a thoroughly Jewish way. </p>
