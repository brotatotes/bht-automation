<p><b> If he called them gods </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε εκεινους ειπεν θεους</span></span>). Condition of first class, assumed as true. The conclusion (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:36">John 10:36</span>) is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις λεγετε</span></span>; (<b> Do ye say? </b>). As Jews (and rabbis) they are shut out from charging Jesus with blasphemy because of this usage in the O.T. It is a complete <i>ad hominem</i> argument. To be sure, it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+82:6">Psalms 82:6</span> a lower use of the term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span>, but Jesus did not call himself "Son of Jahweh," but "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος θεου</span></span>" which can mean only "Son of <i>Elohim</i>." It must not be argued, as some modern men do, that Jesus thus disclaims his own deity. He does nothing of the kind. He is simply stopping the mouths of the rabbis from the charge of blasphemy and he does it effectually. The sentence is quite involved, but can be cleared up.</p>
<p><b>To whom the word of God came </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς ους ο λογος του θεου εγενετο</span></span>). The relative points to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινους</span></span>, before. These judges had no other claim to the term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεο</span></span> (<i>elohim</i>).</p>
<p><b>And the scripture cannot be broken </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ου δυνατα λυθηνα η γραφη</span></span>). A parenthesis that drives home the pertinency of the appeal, one that the Pharisees had to accept. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λυθηνα</span></span> is first aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυω</span></span>, to loosen, to break. </p>
