<p><b> Of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον ο πατηρ ηγιασεν κα απεστειλεν εις τον κοσμον</span></span>). Another relative clause with the antecedent (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτον</span></span>, it would be, object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγετε</span></span>) unexpressed. Every word counts heavily here in contrast with the mere judges of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+82:6">Psalms 82:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>Thou blasphemest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ βλασφημεις</span></span>). Recitative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> again before direct quotation.</p>
<p><b>Because I said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ειπον</span></span>). Causal use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> and regular form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον</span></span> (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπα</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:34">John 10:34</span>).</p>
<p><b>I am the Son of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος του θεου ειμ</span></span>). Direct quotation again after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον</span></span>. This Jesus had implied long before as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:16">John 2:16</span> (my Father) and had said in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18-30">John 5:18-30</span> (the Father, the Son), in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:35">John 9:35</span> in some MSS., and virtually in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:30">John 10:30</span>. They will make this charge against Jesus before Pilate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:7">John 19:7</span>). Jesus does not use the article here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος</span></span>, perhaps (Westcott) fixing attention on the character of Son rather than on the person as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>. There is no answer to this question with its arguments. </p>
