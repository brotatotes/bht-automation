 Of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world  (ον ο πατηρ ηγιασεν κα απεστειλεν εις τον κοσμον). Another relative clause with the antecedent (τουτον, it would be, object of λεγετε) unexpressed. Every word counts heavily here in contrast with the mere judges of Psalms 82:6.Thou blasphemest  (οτ βλασφημεις). Recitative οτ again before direct quotation.Because I said  (οτ ειπον). Causal use of οτ and regular form ειπον (cf. ειπα in verse John 10:34).I am the Son of God  (υιος του θεου ειμ). Direct quotation again after ειπον. This Jesus had implied long before as in John 2:16 (my Father) and had said in John 5:18-30 (the Father, the Son), in John 9:35 in some MSS., and virtually in John 10:30. They will make this charge against Jesus before Pilate (John 19:7). Jesus does not use the article here with υιος, perhaps (Westcott) fixing attention on the character of Son rather than on the person as in Hebrews 1:2. There is no answer to this question with its arguments.
