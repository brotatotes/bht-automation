<p><b> But if I do </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δε ποιω</span></span>). Condition again of the first class, assumed as true, but with the opposite results.</p>
<p><b>Though ye believe not me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καν εμο μη πιστευητε</span></span>). Condition now of third class, undetermined (but with prospect), "Even if you keep on (present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευο</span></span>) not believing me."</p>
<p><b>Believe the works </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις εργοις πιστευετε</span></span>). These stand irrefutable. The claims, character, words, and works of Jesus challenge the world today as then.</p>
<p><b>That ye may know and understand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα γνωτε κα γινωσκητε</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span> repeated in different tenses (first <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωτε</span></span>, the second ingressive aorist active subjunctive, that ye may come to know; then the present active subjunctive, "that ye may keep on knowing"). This is Christ's deepest wish about his enemies who stand with stones in their uplifted hands to fling at him.</p>
<p><b>That the Father is in me, and I in the Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ εν εμο ο πατηρ καγω εν τω πατρ</span></span>). Thus he repeats (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:30">John 10:30</span>) sharply his real claim to oneness with the Father as his Son, to actual deity. It was a hopeless wish. </p>
