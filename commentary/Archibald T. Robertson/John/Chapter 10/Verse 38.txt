 But if I do  (ε δε ποιω). Condition again of the first class, assumed as true, but with the opposite results.Though ye believe not me  (καν εμο μη πιστευητε). Condition now of third class, undetermined (but with prospect), "Even if you keep on (present active subjunctive of πιστευο) not believing me."Believe the works  (τοις εργοις πιστευετε).

Thus he repeats (verse John 10:30) sharply his real claim to oneness with the Father as his Son, to actual deity. It was a hopeless wish.
