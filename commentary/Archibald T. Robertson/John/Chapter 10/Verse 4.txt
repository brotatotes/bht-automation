<p><b> When he hath put forth all his own </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν τα ιδια παντα εκβαλη</span></span>). Indefinite temporal clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> and the second aorist (effective) active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλλω</span></span>. No need of the <i>futurum exactum</i> idea, simply, "when he leads out all his own sheep." They are all out of the fold. He overlooks none. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εκβαλλω</span></span> does mean "thrust out" if a reluctant sheep wishes to linger too long.</p>
<p><b>He goeth before them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπροσθεν αυτων πορευετα</span></span>). Staff in hand he leads the way in front of the flock and they follow (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακολουθε</span></span>) him. What a lesson for pastors who seek to drive the church like cattle and fail. The true pastor leads in love, in words, in deeds. </p>
