<p><b> A stranger </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλοτριω</span></span>). Literally, "One belonging to another" (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλος</span></span>, opposed to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιος</span></span>). A shepherd of another flock, it may be, not necessarily the thief and robber of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span>. Note associative instrumental case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακολουθησουσιν</span></span> (future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακολουθεω</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:4">John 10:4</span>). Note the strong double negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span> here with the future indicative, though usually with the aorist subjunctive (Aleph L W have it here). They simply will not follow such a man or woman, these well-trained sheep will not.</p>
<p><b>But will flee from him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα φευξοντα απ' αυτου</span></span>). Future middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φευγω</span></span> and ablative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>. They will flee as if from a wolf or from the plague. Alas and alas, if only our modern pastors had the sheep (old and young) so trained that they would run away from and not run after the strange voices that call them to false philosophy, false psychology, false ethics, false religion, false life. </p>
