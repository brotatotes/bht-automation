<p><b> This parable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτην την παροιμιαν</span></span>). Old word for proverb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> (beside) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιμος</span></span>, way, a wayside saying or saying by the way. As a proverb in N.T. in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:22">2 Peter 2:22</span> (quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+26:11">Proverbs 26:11</span>), as a symbolic or figurative saying in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:25">John 16:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:29">John 16:29</span>, as an allegory in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:6">John 10:6</span>. Nowhere else in the N.T. Curiously enough in the N.T. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολη</span></span> occurs only in the Synoptics outside of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9">Hebrews 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:19">Hebrews 11:19</span>. Both are in the LXX. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παραβολη</span></span> is used as a proverb (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:23">Luke 4:23</span>) just as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροιμια</span></span> is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:22">2 Peter 2:22</span>. Here clearly <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροιμια</span></span> means an allegory which is one form of the parable. So there you are. Jesus spoke this <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροιμια</span></span> to the Pharisees, "but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινο δε ουκ εγνωσαν τινα ην α ελαλε αυτοις</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span> and note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> in indirect question as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:25">John 2:25</span> and both the interrogative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινα</span></span> and the relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span>. "Spake" (imperfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλε</span></span>) should be "Was speaking or had been speaking." </p>
