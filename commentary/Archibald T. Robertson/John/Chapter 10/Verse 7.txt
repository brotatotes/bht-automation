 Therefore again  (ουν παλιν). Jesus repeats the allegory with more detail and with more directness of application. Repeating a story is not usually an exhilarating experience.I am the door of the sheep  (εγω ειμ η θυρα των προβατων). The door for the sheep by which they enter. "He is the legitimate door of access to the spiritual αυλη, the Fold of the House of Israel, the door by which a true shepherd must enter" (Bernard). He repeats it in verse John 10:9. This is a new idea, not in the previous story (John 10:1-5). Moffatt follows the Sahidic in accepting ο ποιμην here instead of η θυρα, clearly whimsical. Jesus simply changes the metaphor to make it plainer. They were doubtless puzzled by the meaning of the door in verse John 10:1. Once more, this metaphor should help those who insist on the literal meaning of bread as the actual body of Christ in Mark 14:22. Jesus is not a physical "door," but he is the only way of entrance into the Kingdom of God (John 14:6).
