<p><b> Therefore again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν παλιν</span></span>). Jesus repeats the allegory with more detail and with more directness of application. Repeating a story is not usually an exhilarating experience.</p>
<p><b>I am the door of the sheep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω ειμ η θυρα των προβατων</span></span>). The door for the sheep by which they enter. "He is the legitimate door of access to the spiritual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυλη</span></span>, the Fold of the House of Israel, the door by which a true shepherd must enter" (Bernard). He repeats it in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:9">John 10:9</span>. This is a new idea, not in the previous story (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1-5">John 10:1-5</span>). Moffatt follows the Sahidic in accepting <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ποιμην</span></span> here instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η θυρα</span></span>, clearly whimsical. Jesus simply changes the metaphor to make it plainer. They were doubtless puzzled by the meaning of the door in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span>. Once more, this metaphor should help those who insist on the literal meaning of bread as the actual body of Christ in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:22">Mark 14:22</span>. Jesus is not a physical "door," but he is the only way of entrance into the Kingdom of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>). </p>
