<p><b> Before me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ εμου</span></span>). Aleph with the Latin, Syriac, and Sahidic versions omit these words (supported by A B D L W). But with or without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ εμου</span></span> Jesus refers to the false Messiahs and self-appointed leaders who made havoc of the flock. These are the thieves and robbers, not the prophets and sincere teachers of old. The reference is to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span>. There had been numerous such impostors already (Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. XVIII. i. 6; <i>War</i> II. viii. I) and Jesus will predict many more (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:23">Matthew 24:23</span>). They keep on coming, these wolves in sheep's clothing (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:15">Matthew 7:15</span>) who grow rich by fooling the credulous sheep. In this case "the sheep did not hear them" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ηκουσαν αυτων τα προβατα</span></span>). First aorist active indicative with genitive. Fortunate sheep who knew the Shepherd's voice. </p>
