<p><b> The door </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η θυρα</span></span>). Repeated from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:7">John 10:7</span>.</p>
<p><b>By me if any man enter in </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' εμου εαν τις εισελθη</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισερχομα</span></span>. Note proleptic and emphatic position of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' εμου</span></span>. One can call this narrow intolerance, if he will, but it is the narrowness of truth. If Jesus is the Son of God sent to earth for our salvation, he is the only way. He had already said it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:23">John 5:23</span>. He will say it again more sharply in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>. It is unpalatable to the religious dogmatists before him as it is to the liberal dogmatists today. Jesus offers the open door to "any one" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις</span></span>) who is willing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελε</span></span>) to do God's will (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:17">John 7:17</span>).</p>
<p><b>He shall be saved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωθησετα</span></span>). Future passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωζω</span></span>, the great word for salvation, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σως</span></span>, safe and sound. The sheep that comes into the fold through Jesus as the door will be safe from thieves and robbers for one thing. He will have entrance (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισλευσετα</span></span>) and outgo (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξελευσετα</span></span>), he will be at home in the daily routine (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:21">Acts 1:21</span>) of the sheltered flock.</p>
<p><b>And shall find pasture </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα νομην ευρησε</span></span>). Future (linear future) indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκω</span></span>, old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεμω</span></span>, to pasture. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:17">2 Timothy 2:17</span> (in sense of growth). This same phrase occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ch+4:40">1 Chronicles 4:40</span>. The shepherd leads the sheep to pasture, but this phrase pictures the joy of the sheep in the pasture provided by the shepherd. </p>
