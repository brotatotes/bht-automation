 The door  (η θυρα). Repeated from verse John 10:7.By me if any man enter in  (δι' εμου εαν τις εισελθη). Condition of third class with εαν and second aorist active subjunctive of εισερχομα. Note proleptic and emphatic position of δι' εμου. One can call this narrow intolerance, if he will, but it is the narrowness of truth. If Jesus is the Son of God sent to earth for our salvation, he is the only way. He had already said it in John 5:23. He will say it again more sharply in John 14:6. It is unpalatable to the religious dogmatists before him as it is to the liberal dogmatists today. Jesus offers the open door to "any one" (τις) who is willing (θελε) to do God's will (John 7:17).He shall be saved  (σωθησετα). Future passive of σωζω, the great word for salvation, from σως, safe and sound. The sheep that comes into the fold through Jesus as the door will be safe from thieves and robbers for one thing. He will have entrance (εισλευσετα) and outgo (εξελευσετα), he will be at home in the daily routine (cf. Acts 1:21) of the sheltered flock.And shall find pasture  (κα νομην ευρησε). Future (linear future) indicative of ευρισκω, old word from νεμω, to pasture. In N.T. only here and 2 Timothy 2:17 (in sense of growth). This same phrase occurs in 1 Chronicles 4:40. The shepherd leads the sheep to pasture, but this phrase pictures the joy of the sheep in the pasture provided by the shepherd.
