<p><b> Was sick </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην ασθενων</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασθενεω</span></span>, old verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασθενης</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σθενος</span></span>, strength).</p>
<p><b>Lazarus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λαζαρος</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:20">Luke 16:20</span> for the name of another man in the parable, a shortened form of Eleazer, only other N.T. use, but in Josephus and rabbinical writings. No connexion between this Lazarus and the one in the parable.</p>
<p><b>Of Bethany </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο Βηθανιας</span></span>). Use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:44">John 1:44</span> Philip of Bethsaida and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:45">John 1:45</span> Joseph of Nazareth. This Bethany is about two miles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:18">John 11:18</span>) east of Jerusalem on the south-east slope of Olivet and is now called El Azariyeh, from the name Lazarus. Jesus is still apparently at the other Bethany beyond Jordan (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:40">John 10:40</span>). It is doubtful if a distinction is meant here by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> between Bethany as the residence and some other village (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ της κωμης</span></span>) as the birthplace of Lazarus and the sisters.</p>
<p><b>Of Mary and Martha </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μαριας κα Μαρθας</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μαρθας</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μαρθης</span></span> for the genitive. Elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:19">John 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:38">Luke 10:38</span>) Martha comes first as the mistress and hostess. The two sisters are named for further identification of Lazarus. Martha was apparently the elder sister (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:5">John 11:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:19">John 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:38">Luke 10:38</span>). "The identification of Mary with Mary Magdalene is a mere conjecture supported by no direct evidence, and opposed to the general tenor of the Gospels" (Westcott). </p>
