<p><b>That I was not there </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ουκ ημην εκε</span></span>). Imperfect middle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημην</span></span> of the later Greek instead of the common active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> in indirect discourse in place of the usual present retained as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:13">John 11:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>To the intent ye may believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα πιστευσητε</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the ingressive aorist active subjunctive, "that ye may come to believe" (more than you do).

He is dead, but no matter, yea all the more let us go on to him. </p>
