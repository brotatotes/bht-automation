<p><b> Didymus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διδυμος</span></span>). The word means twin. Clearly Thomas had a twin brother or sister. Applied two other times to him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:24">John 20:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:2">John 21:2</span>). The Aramaic word for Thomas means Twin and Didymus is just the Greek equivalent of Thomas. He may even in Greek circles have been called Didymus.</p>
<p><b>His fellow disciples </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις συνμαθηταις</span></span>). Dative case and article use like "his." Only use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνμαθητες</span></span> in the N.T., rare word (in Plato).</p>
<p><b>Us also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ημεις</span></span>). As well as Jesus, since he is bent on going.</p>
<p><b>That we may die with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα αποθανωμεν μετ' αυτου</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποθνησκω</span></span>. Die with Jesus, Thomas means. Lazarus is already dead and they will kill Jesus (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:8">John 11:8</span>). Pessimistic courage surely. </p>
