 Had come  (εληλυθεισαν). Past perfect of ερχομα. These Jews were probably not hostile to Jesus. There were seven days of solemn mourning (1 Samuel 31:13). The presence of so many indicates the prominence of the family.To Martha and Mary  (προς την Μαρθαν κα Μαριαμ). Correct text, not the Textus Receptus προς τας περ Μαρθαν κα Μαριαμ (to the women about Martha and Mary).To console them  (ινα παραμυθησωντα). Purpose clause with ινα and first aorist middle subjunctive of παραμυθεομα, old verb (παρα, beside, μυθος, word), to put in a word beside, to offer consolation. Again in verse John 11:31. See 1 Thessalonians 2:11; 1 Thessalonians 5:14. See Job 2:13 for these visits of consolation, often deplorable enough, though kindly meant.
