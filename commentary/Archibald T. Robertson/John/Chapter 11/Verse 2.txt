<p><b> And it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην δε Μαριαμ η αλειψασα τον κυριον μυρω κα εκμαξασα τους ποδας αυτου ταις θριξιν αυτης</span></span>). This description is added to make plainer who Mary is "whose brother Lazarus was sick" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ης ο αδελφος Λαζαρος ησθενε</span></span>). There is an evident proleptic allusion to the incident described by John in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1-8">John 12:1-8</span> just after chapter 11. As John looks back from the end of the century it was all behind him, though the anointing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αλειψασα</span></span>, first aorist active articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλειφω</span></span>, old verb for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:13">Mark 6:13</span>) took place after the events in chapter 11. The aorist participle is timeless and merely pictures the punctiliar act. The same remark applies to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκμαξασα</span></span>, old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκμασσω</span></span>, to wipe off or away (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+12:3">Isaiah 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:5">Isaiah 13:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:38">Luke 7:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:44">Luke 7:44</span>). Note the Aramaic form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μαριαμ</span></span> as usual in John, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μαριας</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:1">John 11:1</span>. When John wrote, it was as Jesus had foretold (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:13">Matthew 26:13</span>), for the fame of Mary of Bethany rested on the incident of the anointing of Jesus. The effort to link Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene and then both names with the sinful woman of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:36-50">Luke 7:36-50</span> is gratuitous and to my mind grotesque and cruel to the memory of both Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalene. Bernard may be taken as a specimen: "The conclusion is inevitable that John (or his editor) regarded Mary of Bethany as the same person who is described by Luke as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτωλος</span></span>." This critical and artistic heresy has already been discussed in Vol. II on Luke's Gospel. Suffice it here to say that Luke introduces Mary Magdalene as an entirely new character in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:2">John 8:2</span> and that the details in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:36-50">Luke 7:36-50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1-8">John 12:1-8</span> have only superficial resemblances and serious disagreements. John is not here alluding to Luke's record, but preparing for his own in chapter 12. What earthly difficulty is there in two different women under wholly different circumstances doing a similar act for utterly different purposes? </p>
