<p><b> Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριε, ε ης ωδε ουκ αν απεθανεν ο αδελφος μου</span></span>). Condition of the second class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and the imperfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ης</span></span> (no aorist of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span>, to be) in the condition and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> with the second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποθνησκω</span></span>. Mary (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:32">John 11:32</span>) uses these identical words to Jesus. Clearly they had said so to each other with wistful longing if not with a bit of reproach for his delay. But they used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ης</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλθες</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενου</span></span>. But busy, practical Martha comes to the point. </p>
