 Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died  (Κυριε, ε ης ωδε ουκ αν απεθανεν ο αδελφος μου). Condition of the second class with ε and the imperfect ης (no aorist of ειμ, to be) in the condition and αν with the second aorist active indicative of αποθνησκω. Mary (verse John 11:32) uses these identical words to Jesus. Clearly they had said so to each other with wistful longing if not with a bit of reproach for his delay. But they used ης, not ηλθες or εγενου. But busy, practical Martha comes to the point.
