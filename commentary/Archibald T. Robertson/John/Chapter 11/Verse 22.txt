 And even now I know  (κα νυν οιδα). Rather just, "Even now I know." Αλλα (but) of the Textus Receptus is not genuine.Whatsoever thou shalt ask of God  (οσα αν αιτηση τον θεον). Indefinite relative (οσα, as many things as) with αν and the first aorist middle (indirect middle, thou thyself asking) subjunctive of αιτεω. Martha uses αιτεω (usual word of prayer of men to God) rather than ερωταω (usual word of Jesus praying to the Father), but in John 16:23 we have ερωταω used of prayer to Jesus and αιτεω of prayer to God. But the distinction is not to be pressed. "As many things as thou dost ask of God."God will give  (δωσε σο ο θεος). Repetition of ο θεος for emphasis. Martha still has courageous faith in the power of God through Jesus and Jesus in verse John 11:41 says practically what she has said here.
