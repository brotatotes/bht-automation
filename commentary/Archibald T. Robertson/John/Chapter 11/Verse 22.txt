<p><b> And even now I know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα νυν οιδα</span></span>). Rather just, "Even now I know." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αλλα</span></span> (but) of the Textus Receptus is not genuine.</p>
<p><b>Whatsoever thou shalt ask of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσα αν αιτηση τον θεον</span></span>). Indefinite relative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσα</span></span>, as many things as) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and the first aorist middle (indirect middle, thou thyself asking) subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτεω</span></span>. Martha uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτεω</span></span> (usual word of prayer of men to God) rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερωταω</span></span> (usual word of Jesus praying to the Father), but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:23">John 16:23</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερωταω</span></span> used of prayer to Jesus and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτεω</span></span> of prayer to God. But the distinction is not to be pressed. "As many things as thou dost ask of God."</p>
<p><b>God will give </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωσε σο ο θεος</span></span>). Repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος</span></span> for emphasis. Martha still has courageous faith in the power of God through Jesus and Jesus in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:41">John 11:41</span> says practically what she has said here. </p>
