 I am the resurrection and the life  (Εγω ειμ η αναστασις κα η ζωη). This reply is startling enough. They are not mere doctrines about future events, but present realities in Jesus himself. "The Resurrection is one manifestation of the Life: it is involved in the Life" (Westcott). Note the article with both αναστασις and ζωη. Jesus had taught the future resurrection often (John 6:39), but here he means more, even that Lazarus is now alive.Though he die  (καν αποθανη). "Even if he die," condition (concession) of third class with κα εαν (καν) and the second aorist active subjunctive of αποθνησκω (physical death, he means).Yet shall he live  (ζησετα). Future middle of ζαω (spiritual life, of course).
