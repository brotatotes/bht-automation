<p><b> I am the resurrection and the life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω ειμ η αναστασις κα η ζωη</span></span>). This reply is startling enough. They are not mere doctrines about future events, but present realities in Jesus himself. "The Resurrection is one manifestation of the Life: it is involved in the Life" (Westcott). Note the article with both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστασις</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωη</span></span>. Jesus had taught the future resurrection often (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39">John 6:39</span>), but here he means more, even that Lazarus is now alive.</p>
<p><b>Though he die </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καν αποθανη</span></span>). "Even if he die," condition (concession) of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εαν</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καν</span></span>) and the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποθνησκω</span></span> (physical death, he means).</p>
<p><b>Yet shall he live </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζησετα</span></span>). Future middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζαω</span></span> (spiritual life, of course). </p>
