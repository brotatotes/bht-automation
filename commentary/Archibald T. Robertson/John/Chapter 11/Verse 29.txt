<p><b> And she </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εκεινη</span></span>). Emphatic use of the demonstrative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος</span></span> as often in John, "And that one."</p>
<p><b>Arose quickly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγερθη</span></span>). First aorist (ingressive) passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγειρω</span></span> and intransitive. Naturally so on the sudden impulse of joy.</p>
<p><b>And went unto him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ηρχετο προς αυτον</span></span>). Imperfect middle, possibly inchoative, started towards him, certainly picturing her as she was going. </p>
