 Sent saying  (απεστειλαν λεγουσα). First aorist active indicative of αποστελλω and present active participle. The message was delivered by the messenger.Thou lovest  (φιλεις). Φιλεω means to love as a friend (see φιλος in verse John 11:11) and so warmly, while αγαπαω (akin to αγαμα, to admire, and αγαθος, good) means high regard. Here both terms occur of the love of Jesus for Lazarus (ηγαπα in verse John 11:5). Both occur of the Father's love for the Son (αγαπα in John 3:35, φιλε in John 5:20). Hence the distinction is not always observed.
