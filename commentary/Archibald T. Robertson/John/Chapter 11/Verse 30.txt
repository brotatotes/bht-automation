<p><b> Now Jesus was not yet come into the town </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουπω δε εληλυθε ο Ιησους εις την κωμην</span></span>). Explanatory parenthesis with past perfect as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:19">John 11:19</span>. Martha had her interview while he was still coming (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:20">John 11:20</span>) and left him (went off, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηλθεν</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:28">John 11:28</span>) to hurry to Mary with the news. Why Jesus tarried still where he had met Martha we do not know. Westcott says, "as though He would meet the sisters away from the crowd of mourners." </p>
