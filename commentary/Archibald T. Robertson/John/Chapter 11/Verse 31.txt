<p><b> Followed her </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκολουθησαν αυτη</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακολουθεω</span></span> with associative instrumental case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτη</span></span>). This crowd of consolers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραμυθουμενο</span></span>) meant kindly enough, but did the one wrong thing for Mary wished to see Jesus alone.

<p><b>Supposing that she was going unto the tomb </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαντες οτ υπαγε εις το μνημειον</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκεω</span></span>, justifying their conduct by a wrong inference. Note retention of present tense <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαγε</span></span> in indirect discourse after the secondary tense <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκολουθησαν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>To weep there </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα κλαυση εκε</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαιω</span></span>, old verb to weep. Sometimes to wail or howl in oriental style of grief, but surely not that here. At any rate this supposed purpose of Mary was a real reason for this crowd</p>
<p><b>not </b> to go with her. </p>
