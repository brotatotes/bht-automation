 Followed her  (ηκολουθησαν αυτη). First aorist active indicative of ακολουθεω with associative instrumental case (αυτη). This crowd of consolers (παραμυθουμενο) meant kindly enough, but did the one wrong thing for Mary wished to see Jesus alone. People with kind notions often so act. The secrecy of Martha (verse John 11:28) was of no avail.Supposing that she was going unto the tomb  (δοξαντες οτ υπαγε εις το μνημειον). First aorist active participle of δοκεω, justifying their conduct by a wrong inference. Note retention of present tense υπαγε in indirect discourse after the secondary tense ηκολουθησαν.To weep there  (ινα κλαυση εκε). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of κλαιω, old verb to weep. Sometimes to wail or howl in oriental style of grief, but surely not that here. At any rate this supposed purpose of Mary was a real reason for this crowdnot  to go with her.
