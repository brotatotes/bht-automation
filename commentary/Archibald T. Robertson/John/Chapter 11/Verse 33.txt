<p><b> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησους ουν ως ειδεν αυτην κλαιουσαν</span></span>). Proleptic position of "Jesus," "Jesus therefore when he saw." She was weeping at the feet of Jesus, not at the tomb.</p>
<p><b>And the Jews also weeping </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τους Ιουδαιους κλαιοντας</span></span>). Mary's weeping was genuine, that of the Jews was partly perfunctory and professional and probably actual "wailing" as the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαιω</span></span> can mean. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κλαιω</span></span> is joined with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλαλαζω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:38">Mark 5:38</span>, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολολυζω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:1">James 5:1</span>, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θορυβεω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:39">Mark 5:39</span>, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πενθεω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:10">Mark 16:10</span>. It was an incongruous combination.</p>
<p><b>He groaned in the spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεβριμησατο τω πνευματ</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμβριμαομα</span></span>, old verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βριμη</span></span>, strength) to snort with anger like a horse. It occurs in the LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+11:30">Daniel 11:30</span>) for violent displeasure. The notion of indignation is present in the other examples of the word in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:43">Mark 1:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:5">Mark 14:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:30">Matthew 9:30</span>). So it seems best to see that sense here and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:38">John 11:38</span>. The presence of these Jews, the grief of Mary, Christ's own concern, the problem of the raising of Lazarus--all greatly agitated the spirit of Jesus (locative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω πνευματ</span></span>). He struggled for self-control.</p>
<p><b>Was troubled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εταραξεν εαυτον</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταρασσω</span></span>, old verb to disturb, to agitate, with the reflexive pronoun, "he agitated himself" (not passive voice, not middle). "His sympathy with the weeping sister and the wailing crowd caused this deep emotion" (Dods). Some indignation at the loud wailing would only add to the agitation of Jesus. </p>
