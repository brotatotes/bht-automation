<p><b> Where have ye laid him? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Που τεθεικατε αυτον;</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>. A simple question for information. The only other like it in John is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:6">John 6:6</span> where it is expressly stated that Jesus knew what he was going to do. So it was here, only he politely asked for direction to the tomb of Lazarus. The people invite him to come and see, the very language used by Philip to Nathanael (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:46">John 1:46</span>). It was a natural and polite reply as they would show Jesus the way, but they had no idea of his purpose. </p>
