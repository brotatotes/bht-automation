<p><b> Jesus wept </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδακρυσεν ο Ιησους</span></span>). Ingressive first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δακρυω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δακρυ</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δακρυον</span></span>, a tear (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:19">Acts 20:19</span>), only here in N.T. It never means to wail, as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαιω</span></span> sometimes does. "Jesus burst into tears." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κλαιω</span></span> is used of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:41">Luke 19:41</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span> "with strong crying and tears" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα κραυγης κα δακρυων</span></span>). Apparently this was as Jesus started towards (see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:38">John 11:38</span>) the tomb. In a sense it was a reaction from the severe strain in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:33">John 11:33</span>, but chiefly it was the sheer human sympathy of his heart with Martha and Mary touched with the feeling of our common weakness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>). Often all that we can do is to shed tears in grief too deep for words. Jesus understood and understands. This is the shortest verse in the Bible, but no verse carries more meaning in it. </p>
