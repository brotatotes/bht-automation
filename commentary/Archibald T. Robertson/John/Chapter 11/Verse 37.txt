 Could not this man  (ουκ εδυνατο ουτος). Imperfect middle of δυναμα. They do not say δυνατα (can, present middle indicative). But clearly the opening of the blind man's eyes (chapter 9) had made a lasting impression on some of these Jews, for it was done three months ago.Have caused that this man also should not die  (ποιησα ινα κα ουτος μη αποθανη). First aorist active infinitive of ποιεω with ινα, like the Latin facere ut (sub-final use, Robertson, Grammar, p. 985), with the second aorist active subjunctive αποθανη and negative μη. These Jews share the view expressed by Martha (verse John 11:21) and Mary (verse John 11:32) that Jesus could haveprevented  the death of Lazarus.
