<p><b> Could not this man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εδυνατο ουτος</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμα</span></span>. They do not say <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνατα</span></span> (can, present middle indicative). But clearly the opening of the blind man's eyes (chapter 9) had made a lasting impression on some of these Jews, for it was done three months ago.</p>
<p><b>Have caused that this man also should not die </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησα ινα κα ουτος μη αποθανη</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>, like the Latin <i>facere ut</i> (sub-final use, Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 985), with the second aorist active subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποθανη</span></span> and negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>. These Jews share the view expressed by Martha (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:21">John 11:21</span>) and Mary (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:32">John 11:32</span>) that Jesus could have</p>
<p><b>prevented </b> the death of Lazarus. </p>
