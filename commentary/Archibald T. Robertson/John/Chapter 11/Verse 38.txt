 Again groaning in himself  (παλιν εμβριμωμενος εν εαυτω). Direct reference to the use of this same word (present middle participle here) in verse John 11:33, only with εν εαυτω (in himself) rather than τω πνευματ (in his spirit), practically the same idea. The speculation concerning his power stirred the depths of his nature again.Cometh to the tomb  (ερχετα εις το μνημειον). Vivid historical present.A cave  (σπηλαιον). Old word (from σπεος, cavern). Cf. Matthew 21:13.Lay against it  (επεκειτο επ' αυτω). Imperfect middle of επικειμα, old verb to lie upon as in John 21:9 and figuratively (1 Corinthians 9:16). Note repetition of επ with locative case. The use of a cave for burial was common (Genesis 23:19). Either the body was let down through a horizontal opening (hardly so here) or put in a tomb cut in the face of the rock (if so, επ can mean "against"). The stones were used to keep away wild animals from the bodies.
