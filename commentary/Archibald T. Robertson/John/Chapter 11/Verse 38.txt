<p><b> Again groaning in himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν εμβριμωμενος εν εαυτω</span></span>). Direct reference to the use of this same word (present middle participle here) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:33">John 11:33</span>, only with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εαυτω</span></span> (in himself) rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω πνευματ</span></span> (in his spirit), practically the same idea. The speculation concerning his power stirred the depths of his nature again.</p>
<p><b>Cometh to the tomb </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχετα εις το μνημειον</span></span>). Vivid historical present.</p>
<p><b>A cave </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπηλαιον</span></span>). Old word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπεος</span></span>, cavern). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:13">Matthew 21:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>Lay against it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεκειτο επ' αυτω</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επικειμα</span></span>, old verb to lie upon as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:9">John 21:9</span> and figuratively (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:16">1 Corinthians 9:16</span>). Note repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> with locative case. The use of a cave for burial was common (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+23:19">Genesis 23:19</span>). Either the body was let down through a horizontal opening (hardly so here) or put in a tomb cut in the face of the rock (if so, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> can mean "against"). The stones were used to keep away wild animals from the bodies. </p>
