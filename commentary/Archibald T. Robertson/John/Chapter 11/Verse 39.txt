<p><b> Take ye away the stone </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρατε τον λιθον</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρω</span></span>. They could do this much without the exercise of Christ's divine power. It was a startling command to them.</p>
<p><b>By this time he stinketh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη οζε</span></span>). Present active indicative of old verb, here only in N.T. (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+8:14">Exodus 8:14</span>). It means to give out an odour, either good or bad.</p>
<p><b>For he hath been dead four days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεταρταιος γαρ εστιν</span></span>). The Greek simply says, "For he is a fourth-day man." It is an old ordinal numeral from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεταρτος</span></span> (fourth). Herodotus (ii. 89) has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεταρταιος γενεσθα</span></span> of one four days dead as here. The word is only here in the N.T. The same idiom occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:13">Acts 28:13</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευτεραιο</span></span> (second-day men). Lightfoot (<i>Hor. Hebr.</i>) quotes a Jewish tradition (<i>Beresh. Rabba</i>) to the effect that the soul hovers around the tomb for three days hoping to return to the body, but on the fourth day leaves it. But there is no suggestion here that Martha held that notion. Her protest is a natural one in spite of her strong faith in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:22-27">John 11:22-27</span>. </p>
