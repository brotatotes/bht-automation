<p><b> Heard it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουσας</span></span>). The messenger delivered the message of the sisters. The reply of Jesus is for him and for the apostles.</p>
<p><b>Is not unto death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν προς θανατον</span></span>). Death in the final issue, to remain dead. Lazarus did die, but he did not remain dead. See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτια προς θανατον</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:16">1 John 5:16</span>, "sin unto death" (final death).</p>
<p><b>But for the glory of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' υπερ της δοξης του θεου</span></span>). In behalf of God's glory, as the sequel shows. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:3">John 9:3</span> about the man born blind. The death of Lazarus will illustrate God's glory. In some humble sense those who suffer the loss of loved ones are entitled to some comfort from this point made by Jesus about Lazarus. In a supreme way it is true of the death of Christ which he himself calls glorification of himself and God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:31">John 13:31</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span> John had already used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαζω</span></span> of the death of Christ.</p>
<p><b>That the Son of God may be glorified thereby </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα δοξασθη ο υιος του θεου δι' αυτης</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαζω</span></span>. Here Jesus calls himself "the Son of God." In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:54">John 8:54</span> Jesus had said: "It is my Father that glorifieth me." The raising of Lazarus from the tomb will bring glory to the Son of God. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span> for this idea in Christ's prayer. The raising of Lazarus will also bring to an issue his own death and all this involves the glorification of the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:16">John 12:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:31">John 13:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:13">John 14:13</span>). The death of Lazarus brings Jesus face to face with his own death. </p>
