 Heard it  (ακουσας). The messenger delivered the message of the sisters. The reply of Jesus is for him and for the apostles.Is not unto death  (ουκ εστιν προς θανατον). Death in the final issue, to remain dead. Lazarus did die, but he did not remain dead. See αμαρτια προς θανατον in 1 John 5:16, "sin unto death" (final death).But for the glory of God  (αλλ' υπερ της δοξης του θεου). In behalf of God's glory, as the sequel shows. Cf. John 9:3 about the man born blind. The death of Lazarus will illustrate God's glory. In some humble sense those who suffer the loss of loved ones are entitled to some comfort from this point made by Jesus about Lazarus. In a supreme way it is true of the death of Christ which he himself calls glorification of himself and God (John 13:31). In John 7:39 John had already used δοξαζω of the death of Christ.That the Son of God may be glorified thereby  (ινα δοξασθη ο υιος του θεου δι' αυτης). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist passive subjunctive of δοξαζω. Here Jesus calls himself "the Son of God." In John 8:54 Jesus had said: "It is my Father that glorifieth me." The raising of Lazarus from the tomb will bring glory to the Son of God. See John 17:1 for this idea in Christ's prayer. The raising of Lazarus will also bring to an issue his own death and all this involves the glorification of the Father (John 7:39; John 12:16; John 13:31; John 14:13). The death of Lazarus brings Jesus face to face with his own death.
