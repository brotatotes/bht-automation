<p><b> Said I not unto thee? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ουκ ειπον σοι;</span></span>). Jesus pointedly reminds Martha of his promise to raise Lazarus (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25">John 11:25</span>).</p>
<p><b>That if thou believedst </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ εαν πιστευσηις</span></span>). Indirect discourse with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and the first aorist active subjunctive (condition of third class) retained after the secondary tense <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον</span></span>. He had not said this very phrase, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν πιστευσηις</span></span>, to Martha, but he did say to her: <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πιστευεις τουτο</span></span>; (Believest thou this?). He meant to test Martha as to her faith already hinted at (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:22">John 11:22</span>) on this very point. Jesus had also spoken of increase of faith on the part of the disciples (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:15">John 11:15</span>).</p>
<p><b>Thou shouldest see the glory of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψη την δοξαν του θεου</span></span>). Future middle indicative of the old defective verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span> retained in the conclusion of this condition in indirect discourse. Jesus means the glory of God as shown in the resurrection of Lazarus as he had already said to the disciples (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:4">John 11:4</span>) and as he meant Martha to understand (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25">John 11:25</span>) and may in fact have said to her (the report of the conversation is clearly abridged). Hence Bernard's difficulty in seeing how Martha could understand the words of Jesus about the resurrection of Lazarus here and now seems fanciful and far-fetched. </p>
