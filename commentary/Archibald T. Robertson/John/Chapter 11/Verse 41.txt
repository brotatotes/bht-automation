 So they took away the stone  (ηραν ουν τον λιθον). First aorist active indicative of αιρω, but without the explanatory gloss of the Textus Receptus "from the place where the dead was laid" (not genuine).I thank thee that thou heardest me  (ευχαριστω σο οτ ηκουσας μου). See John 6:11 for ευχαριστεω. Clearly Jesus had prayed to the Father concerning the raising of Lazarus. He has the answer before he acts. "No pomp of incantation, no wrestling in prayer even; but simple words of thanksgiving, as if already Lazarus was restored" (Dods). Jesus well knew the issues involved on this occasion. If he failed, his own claims to be the Son of God (the Messiah), would be hopelessly discredited with all. If he succeeded, the rulers would be so embittered as to compass his own death.
