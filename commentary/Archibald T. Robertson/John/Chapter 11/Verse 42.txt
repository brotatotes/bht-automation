<p><b> And I knew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω δε ηιδειν</span></span>). Past perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span> used as imperfect. This confident knowledge is no new experience with Jesus. It has "always" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντοτε</span></span>) been so.</p>
<p><b>Which standeth around </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον περιεστωτα</span></span>). Second perfect active (intransitive) articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιιστημ</span></span>. It was a picturesque and perilous scene.</p>
<p><b>That they may believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα πιστευσωσιν</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and first ingressive aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>, "that they may come to believe."</p>
<p><b>That thou didst send me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ συ με απεστειλας</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστελλω</span></span> and note position of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ με</span></span> side by side. This claim Jesus had long ago made (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:36">John 5:36</span>) and had repeatedly urged (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:25">John 10:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:38">John 10:38</span>). Here was a supreme opportunity and Jesus opens his heart about it. </p>
