 And I knew  (εγω δε ηιδειν). Past perfect of οιδα used as imperfect. This confident knowledge is no new experience with Jesus. It has "always" (παντοτε) been so.Which standeth around  (τον περιεστωτα). Second perfect active (intransitive) articular participle of περιιστημ. It was a picturesque and perilous scene.That they may believe  (ινα πιστευσωσιν). Purpose clause with ινα and first ingressive aorist active subjunctive of πιστευω, "that they may come to believe."That thou didst send me  (οτ συ με απεστειλας). First aorist active indicative of αποστελλω and note position of συ με side by side. This claim Jesus had long ago made (John 5:36) and had repeatedly urged (John 10:25; John 10:38). Here was a supreme opportunity and Jesus opens his heart about it.
