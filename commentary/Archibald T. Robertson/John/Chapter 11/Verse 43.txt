<p><b> He cried with a loud voice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνη μεγαλη εκραυγασεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραυγαζω</span></span>, old and rare word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραυγη</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:19">Matthew 12:19</span>. Occurs again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:40">John 18:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:6">John 19:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:12">John 19:12</span>. Only once in the LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ezr+3:13">Ezra 3:13</span>) and with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνη μεγαλη</span></span> (either locative or instrumental case makes sense) as here. For this "elevated (great) voice" see also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:34">Mark 15:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:37">Mark 15:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:10">Revelation 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:3">Revelation 21:3</span>. The loud voice was not for the benefit of Lazarus, but for the sake of the crowd standing around that they might see that Lazarus came forth simultaneously with the command of Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Lazarus, come forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λαζαρε, δευρο εξω</span></span>). "Hither out." No verb, only the two adverbs, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευρο</span></span> here alone in John. Lazarus heard and obeyed the summons. </p>
