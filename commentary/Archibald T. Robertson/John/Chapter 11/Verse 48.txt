<p><b> If we let him thus alone </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν αφωμεν αυτον ουτως</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιημ</span></span>. "Suppose we leave him thus alone." Suppose also that he keeps on raising the dead right here next door to Jerusalem!</p>
<p><b>All will believe on him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντες πιστευσουσιν εις αυτον</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>. The inevitable conclusion, "all" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντες</span></span>), not just "some" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινες</span></span>). as now.</p>
<p><b>And the Romans will come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ελευσοντα ο Ρωμαιο</span></span>). Another inevitable result with the future middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>. Only if the people take Jesus as their political Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:15">John 6:15</span>) as they had once started to do. This is a curious muddle for the rulers knew that Jesus did not claim to be a political Messiah and would not be a rival to Caesar. And yet they use this fear (their own belief about the Messiah) to stir themselves to frenzy as they will use it with Pilate later.</p>
<p><b>And take away both our place and our nation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αρουσιν ημων κα τον τοπον κα το εθνος</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρω</span></span>, another certain result of their inaction. Note the order here when "place" (job) is put before nation (patriotism), for all the world like modern politicians who make the fate of the country turn on their getting the jobs which they are seeking. In the course of time the Romans will come, not because of the leniency of the Sanhedrin toward Jesus, but because of the uprising against Rome led by the Zealots and they will destroy both temple and city and the Sanhedrin will lose their jobs and the nation will be scattered. Future historians will say that this fate came as punishment on the Jews for their conduct toward Jesus. </p>
