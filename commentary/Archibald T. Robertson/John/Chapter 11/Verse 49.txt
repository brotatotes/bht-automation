<p><b> Caiaphas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Καιαφας</span></span>). Son-in-law of Annas and successor and high priest for 18 years (A.D. 18 to 36).</p>
<p><b>That year </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ενιαυτου εκεινου</span></span>). Genitive of time; his high-priesthood included that year (A.D. 29 or 30). So he took the lead at this meeting.</p>
<p><b>Ye know nothing at all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις ουκ οιδατε ουδεν</span></span>). In this he is correct, for no solution of their problem had been offered. </p>
