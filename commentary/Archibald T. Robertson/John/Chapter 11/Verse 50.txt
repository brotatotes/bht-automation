<p><b> That it is expedient for you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ συμφερε υμιν</span></span>). Indirect discourse with present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφερω</span></span> used with the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> clause as subject. It means to bear together, to be profitable, with the dative case as here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν</span></span>, for you). It is to your interest and that is what they cared most for.</p>
<p><b>That one man die </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα εις ανθρωπος αποθανη</span></span>). Sub-final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> with second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποθνησκω</span></span> as subject clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφερε</span></span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:7">John 18:7</span> for the same construction.</p>
<p><b>For the people </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ του λαου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυπερ</span></span> simply means <i>over</i>, but can be in behalf of as often, and in proper context the resultant idea is "instead of" as the succeeding clause shows and as is clearly so in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span> of the death of Christ and naturally so in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:14">2 Corinthians 5:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6">Romans 5:6</span>. In the papyri <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> is the usual preposition used of one who writes a letter for one unable to write.</p>
<p><b>And that the whole nation perish not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μη ολον το εθνος απολητα</span></span>). Continuation of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> construction with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the second aorist subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολλυμ</span></span>. What Caiaphas has in mind is the giving of Jesus to death to keep the nation from perishing at the hands of the Romans. Politicians are often willing to make a sacrifice of the other fellow. </p>
