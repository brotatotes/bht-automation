<p><b> Not of himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφ' εαυτου ουκ</span></span>). Not wholly of himself, John means. There was more in what Caiaphas said than he understood. His language is repeated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:14">John 18:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Prophesied </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επροφητευσεν</span></span>). Aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητευω</span></span>. But certainly unconscious prophecy on his part and purely accidental. Caiaphas meant only what was mean and selfish.</p>
<p><b>That Jesus should die </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ εμελλεν Ιησους αποθνησκειν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλω</span></span> in indirect discourse instead of the usual present retained after a secondary tense (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επροφητευσεν</span></span>) as sometimes occurs (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:25">John 2:25</span>). </p>
