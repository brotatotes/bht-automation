 But that he might also gather together into one  (αλλ' ινα συναγαγη εις εν). Purpose clause with ινα and the second aorist active subjunctive of συναγω. Caiaphas was thinking only of the Jewish people (λαου, εθνος, verse John 11:50). The explanation and interpretation of John here follow the lead of the words of Jesus about the other sheep and the one flock in John 10:16.That are scattered abroad  (τα διεσκορπισμενα). Perfect passive articular participle of διασκορπιζω, late verb (Polybius, LXX) to scatter apart, to winnow grain from chaff, only here in John. The meaning here is not the Diaspora (Jews scattered over the world), but the potential children of God in all lands and all ages that the death of Christ will gather "into one" (εις εν). A glorious idea, but far beyond Caiaphas.
