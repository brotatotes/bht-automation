<p><b> But that he might also gather together into one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ινα συναγαγη εις εν</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγω</span></span>. Caiaphas was thinking only of the Jewish people (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαου, εθνος</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:50">John 11:50</span>). The explanation and interpretation of John here follow the lead of the words of Jesus about the other sheep and the one flock in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:16">John 10:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>That are scattered abroad </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα διεσκορπισμενα</span></span>). Perfect passive articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασκορπιζω</span></span>, late verb (Polybius, LXX) to scatter apart, to winnow grain from chaff, only here in John. The meaning here is not the Diaspora (Jews scattered over the world), but the potential children of God in all lands and all ages that the death of Christ will gather "into one" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις εν</span></span>). A glorious idea, but far beyond Caiaphas. </p>
