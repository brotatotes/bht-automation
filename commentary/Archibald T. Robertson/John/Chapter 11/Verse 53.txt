<p><b> So from that day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' εκεινης ουν της ημερας</span></span>). The raising of Lazarus brought matters to a head so to speak. It was now apparently not more than a month before the end.</p>
<p><b>They took counsel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβουλευσαντο</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλευω</span></span>, old verb to take counsel, in the middle voice for themselves, among themselves. The Sanhedrin took the advice of Caiaphas seriously and plotted the death of Jesus.</p>
<p><b>That they might put him to death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα αποκτεινωσιν αυτον</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκτεινω</span></span>. It is an old purpose (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:19">John 7:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:59">John 8:59</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:39">John 10:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:8">John 11:8</span>) now revived with fresh energy due to the raising of Lazarus. </p>
