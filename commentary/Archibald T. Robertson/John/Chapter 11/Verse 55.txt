<p><b> Was near </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην εγγυς</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:13">John 2:13</span> for the same phrase. This last passover was the time of destiny for Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Before the passover to purify themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ του πασχα ινα αγνισωσιν εαυτους</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνιζω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνος</span></span> (pure), ceremonial purification here, of course. All this took time. These came "from the country" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ της χωρας</span></span>), from all over Palestine, from all parts of the world, in fact. John shifts the scene to Jerusalem just before the passover with no record of the way that Jesus came to Jerusalem from Ephraim. The Synoptic Gospels tell this last journey up through Samaria into Galilee to join the great caravan that crossed over into Perea and came down on the eastern side of the Jordan opposite Jericho and then marched up the mountain road to Bethany and Bethphage just beside Jerusalem. This story is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:11-19">Luke 17:11-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:1-52">Mark 10:1-52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1-20">Matthew 19:1-20</span>. John simply assumes the Synoptic narrative and gives the picture of things in and around Jerusalem just before the passover (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:56">John 11:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:57">John 11:57</span>). </p>
