<p><b> They sought therefore for Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζητουν ουν τον Ιησουν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητεω</span></span> and common <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν</span></span> of which John is so fond. They were seeking Jesus six months before at the feast of tabernacles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:11">John 7:11</span>), but now they really mean to kill him.</p>
<p><b>As they stood in the temple </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ιερω εστηκοτες</span></span>). Perfect active participle (intransitive) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>, a graphic picture of the various groups of leaders in Jerusalem and from other lands, "the knots of people in the Temple precincts" (Bernard). They had done this at the tabernacles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:11-13">John 7:11-13</span>), but now there is new excitement due to the recent raising of Lazarus and to the public order for the arrest of Jesus.</p>
<p><b>That he will not come to the feast? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ου μη ελθη εις την εορτην;</span></span>). The form of the question (indirect discourse after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκειτε</span></span>) assumes strongly that Jesus will not (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span>, double negative with second aorist active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελθη</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>) dare to come this time for the reason given in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:57">John 11:57</span>. </p>
