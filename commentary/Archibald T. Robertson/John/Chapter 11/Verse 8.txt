 Were but now seeking to stone thee  (νυν εζητουν σε λιθασα). Conative imperfect of ζητεω with reference to the event narrated in John 10:39 in these very words.Goest thou thither again?  (παλιν υπαγεις εκει;). Present active intransitive use of the compound υπαγω, to withdraw (6:21; 8:21) from this safe retreat (Vincent). It seemed suicidal madness to go back now.
