<p><b> Were but now seeking to stone thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν εζητουν σε λιθασα</span></span>). Conative imperfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητεω</span></span> with reference to the event narrated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:39">John 10:39</span> in these very words.</p>
<p><b>Goest thou thither again? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν υπαγεις εκει;</span></span>). Present active intransitive use of the compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαγω</span></span>, to withdraw (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">6:21; 8:21</span></span>) from this safe retreat (Vincent). It seemed suicidal madness to go back now. </p>
