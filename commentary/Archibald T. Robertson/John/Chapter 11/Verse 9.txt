<p><b> In the day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της ημερας</span></span>). Genitive of time, within the day, the twelve-hour day in contrast with night. The words of Jesus here illustrate what he had said in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:4">John 9:4</span>. It is not blind fatalism that Jesus proclaims, but the opposite of cowardice. He has full confidence in the Father s purpose about his "hour" which has not yet come. Jesus has courage to face his enemies again to do the Father's will about Lazarus.</p>
<p><b>If a man walk in the day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν τις περιπατη εν τη ημερα</span></span>). Condition of the third class, a conceived case and it applies to Jesus who walks in the full glare of noonday. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span> for the contrast between walking in the light and in the dark.</p>
<p><b>He stumbleth not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου προσκοπτε</span></span>). He does not cut (or bump) against this or that obstacle, for he can see. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κοπτω</span></span> is to cut and pros, against. </p>
