 Jesus therefore  (Ιησους ουν). Here ουν is not causal, but simply copulative and transitional, "and so" (Bernard), as often in John (John 1:22, etc.).Six days before the passover  (προ εξ ημερων του πασχα). This idiom, transposition of προ, is like the Latin use of ante, but it occurs in the old Doric, in the inscriptions and the papyri. See Amos 1:1 for it also (cf. Moulton, Proleg., pp. 100ff.; Robertson, Grammar, pp. 621f.). If the crucifixion was on Friday, as seems certain from both John and the Synoptics, then six days before would be the Jewish Sabbath preceding or more probably the Friday afternoon before, since Jesus would most likely arrive before the Sabbath. Probably we are to put together in one scene for the atmosphere John 11:55-57; John 12:1; John 12:9-11.Came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead  (ητλεν εις Βηθανιαν, οπου ην Λαζαροσ, ον ηγειρεν εκ νεκρων Ιησους). Each phrase explains the preceding. There is no reason for thinking this a gloss as Bernard does. It was a place of danger now after that great miracle and the consequent rage of the Sanhedrin (John 12:9-11). The crowd of eager spectators to see both Lazarus and Jesus would only intensify this rage.
