<p><b> The chief priests took counsel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβουλευσαντο ο αρχιερεις</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλευω</span></span>, old verb, seen already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:53">John 11:53</span> which see. The whole Sanhedrin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:32">John 7:32</span>) had decided to put Jesus to death and had asked for information concerning him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:57">John 11:57</span>) that might lead to his arrest, but the Sadducees were specially active now to accomplish the death of Lazarus also (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> with first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκτεινω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:53">John 11:53</span>). Perhaps they argued that, if they should kill both Jesus and Lazarus, then Lazarus would remain dead. The raising of Lazarus has brought matters to a crisis. Incidentally, it may be observed that here we may see the reason why the Synoptics do not tell the story of the raising of Lazarus, if he was still living (cf. the case of Malchus's name in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:10">John 18:10</span>). </p>
