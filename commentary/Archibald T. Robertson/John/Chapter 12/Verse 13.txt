<p><b> Took </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαβον</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>The branches of the palm-trees </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα βαια των φοινικων</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φοινιξ</span></span> is an old word for palm-tree (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9">Revelation 7:9</span> for the branches) and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:12">Acts 27:12</span> the name of a city. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βαιον</span></span> is apparently a word of Egyptian origin, palm branches, here only in N.T., but in the papyri and I Macc. 13:51. Here we have "the palm branches of the palm-trees." The use in 1 Macc. 13:51 (cf. II Macc. 10:7) is in the account of Simon's triumphal entry into Jerusalem. Bernard notes that to carry palms was a mark of triumphant homage to a victor or a king (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9">Revelation 7:9</span>). Palm-trees grew on the Mount of Olives (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:8">Mark 11:8</span>) on the road from Bethany to Jerusalem. The crowds (one in front and one behind, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:9">Mark 11:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:9">Matthew 21:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:18">John 2:18</span>) cut the branches as they came (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:8">Matthew 21:8</span>).</p>
<p><b>To meet him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις υπαντησιν αυτω</span></span>). Literally,</p>
<p><b>for a meeting </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαντησις</span></span>, late word from the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπανταω</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28">Matthew 8:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:20">John 11:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:30">John 11:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:18">John 12:18</span>, in the papyri, but only here in the N.T.) with him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span>, associative instrumental case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαντησιν</span></span> as after the verb in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:18">John 12:18</span>). It was a scene of growing excitement.</p>
<p><b>And cried out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εκραυγαζον</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραυγαζω</span></span>, old and rare verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραυγη</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:19">Matthew 12:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:15">John 19:15</span>.</p>
<p><b>Hosannah </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hωσαννα</span></span>). Transliteration of the Hebrew word meaning "Save now." The LXX renders it by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σωσον δη</span></span> (Save now).</p>
<p><b>Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευλογημενος ο ερχομενος εν ονοματ κυριου</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευλογεω</span></span>. Quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:25">Psalms 118:25</span>, written, some think, for the dedication of the second temple, or, as others think, for the feast of tabernacles after the return (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ezr+3:1">Ezra 3:1</span>). It was sung in the processional recitation then as a welcome to the worshippers. Here the words are addressed to the Messiah as is made plain by the addition of the words, "even the king of Israel" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο βασιλευς του Ισραηλ</span></span>) as Nathanael called him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:49">John 1:49</span>). Jesus is here hailed by the multitudes as the long-looked for Messiah of Jewish hope and he allows them so to greet him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:38-40">Luke 19:38-40</span>), a thing that he prevented a year before in Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:14">John 6:14</span>). It is probable that "in the name of the Lord" should be taken with "blessed" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+21:5">Deuteronomy 21:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2sa+6:18">2 Samuel 6:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:16">1 Kings 22:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+2:24">2 Kings 2:24</span>. The Messiah was recognized by Martha as the Coming One (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:27">John 11:27</span>) and is so described by the Baptist (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:3">Matthew 11:3</span>). Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:10">Mark 11:10</span>) adds "the kingdom that cometh" while Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:38">John 19:38</span>) has "the king that cometh." "It was this public acclamation of Jesus as King of Israel or King of the Jews which was the foundation of the charge made against him before Pilate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:33">John 18:33</span>)" (Bernard). </p>
