<p><b> Daughter of Zion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυγατηρ Σιων</span></span>). Nominative form (instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυγατερ</span></span>) but vocative case. The quotation is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:9">Zechariah 9:9</span> shortened.</p>
<p><b>Thy King cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο βασιλευς ερχετα</span></span>). Prophetic futuristic present. The ass was the animal ridden in peace as the horse was in war (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+10:4">Judges 10:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+12:14">Judges 12:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2sa+17:23">2 Samuel 17:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2sa+19:26">2 Samuel 19:26</span>). Zechariah pictures one coming in peace. So the people here regarded Jesus as the Prince of Peace in the triumphal entry.</p>
<p><b>Sitting on an ass's colt </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθημενος επ πωλον ονου</span></span>). Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:6">Matthew 21:6</span>) does speak of both the ass and the colt having garments put on them, but he does not say that Jesus "sat upon" both animals at once, for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επανω αυτων</span></span> (upon them) probably refers to the garments, not to the colts. When John wrote (end of the century), Jerusalem had fallen. Jesus will lament over Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:41">Luke 19:41</span>). So "Fear not" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη φοβου</span></span>). </p>
