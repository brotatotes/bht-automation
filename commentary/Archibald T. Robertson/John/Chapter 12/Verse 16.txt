<p><b> Understood not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εγνωσαν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>. Another comment by John concerning the failure of the disciples to know what was happening (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:22">John 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span>).</p>
<p><b>At the first </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πρωτον</span></span>). Adverbial accusative, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:40">John 10:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:39">John 19:39</span>.</p>
<p><b>Was glorified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοξασθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαζω</span></span>, to glorify, used of his death already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span> and by Jesus himself of his death, resurrection, and ascension in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:23">John 12:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:31">John 13:31</span>.</p>
<p><b>Then remembered they </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε εμνησθησαν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμνησκω</span></span>. It was easier to understand then and they had the Holy Spirit to help them (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:13-15">John 16:13-15</span>).</p>
<p><b>Were written of him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην επ' αυτω γεγραμμενα</span></span>). Periphrastic past perfect passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span> with neuter plural participle agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτα</span></span> (these things) and singular verb, though the plural <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν</span></span> could have been used. Note the threefold repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτα</span></span> in this verse, "clumsy" Bernard calls it, but making for clarity. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ' αυτω</span></span> for "of him" rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ αυτου</span></span> is unusual, but occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:11">Revelation 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:16">Revelation 22:16</span>.</p>
