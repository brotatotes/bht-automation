 The multitude  (ο οχλος). The multitude of verse John 12:13, not the crowd just mentioned that had been with Jesus at the raising of Lazarus. There were two crowds (one following Jesus, one meeting Jesus as here).Went and met him  (υπηντησεν αυτω). First aorist active indicative of υπανταω, old compound verb (υπο, ανταω) to go to meet, with associative instrumental case αυτω. Cf. John 4:51.That he had done this sign  (τουτο αυτον πεποιηκενα το σημειον). Perfect active infinitive in indirect discourse after ηκουσαν (first aorist active indicative of ακουω, to hear) (instead of a οτ clause) with the accusative of general reference αυτον (as to him) and another accusative (σημειον, sign) the object of the infinitive. Clearly there was much talk about the raising of Lazarus as the final proof that Jesus in truth is the Messiah of Jewish hope.
