<p><b> The multitude </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο οχλος</span></span>). The multitude of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:13">John 12:13</span>, not the crowd just mentioned that had been with Jesus at the raising of Lazarus. There were two crowds (one following Jesus, one meeting Jesus as here).</p>
<p><b>Went and met him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπηντησεν αυτω</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπανταω</span></span>, old compound verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο, ανταω</span></span>) to go to meet, with associative instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span>. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:51">John 4:51</span>.</p>
<p><b>That he had done this sign </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο αυτον πεποιηκενα το σημειον</span></span>). Perfect active infinitive in indirect discourse after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσαν</span></span> (first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span>, to hear) (instead of a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> clause) with the accusative of general reference <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον</span></span> (as to him) and another accusative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον</span></span>, sign) the object of the infinitive. Clearly there was much talk about the raising of Lazarus as the final proof that Jesus in truth is the Messiah of Jewish hope. </p>
