<p><b> So they made him a supper there </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποιησαν ουν αυτω δειπνον εκε</span></span>). Here again <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν</span></span> is not inferential, but merely transitional. This supper is given by Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:3-9">Mark 14:3-9</span>) and Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:6-13">Matthew 26:6-13</span>) just two days (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:1">Mark 14:1</span>) before the passover, that is on our Tuesday evening (beginning of Jewish Wednesday), while John mentions (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:2-9">John 12:2-9</span>) it immediately after the arrival of Jesus in Bethany (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span>). One must decide which date to follow. Mark and Matthew and Luke follow it with the visit of Judas to the Sanhedrin with an offer to betray Jesus as if exasperated by the rebuke by Jesus at the feast. Bernard considers that John "is here more probably accurate." It all turns on John's purpose in putting it here. This is the last mention of Jesus in Bethany and he may have mentioned it proleptically for that reason as seems to me quite reasonable. Westcott notes that in chapter 12 John closes his record of the public ministry of the Lord relative to the disciples at this feast (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1-11">John 12:1-11</span>), to the multitude in the triumphal entry (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:12-19">John 12:12-19</span>), to the world outside in the visit of the Greeks (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:20-36">John 12:20-36</span>), and with two summary judgements (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:36">John 12:36</span>). There is no further reason to refer to the feast in the house of another Simon when a sinful woman anointed Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:36-50">Luke 7:36-50</span>). It is no credit to Luke or to John with Mark and Matthew to have them all making a jumble like that. There were two anointings by two absolutely different women for wholly different purposes. See the discussion on Luke for further details.</p>
<p><b>And Martha served </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα η Μαρθα διηκονε</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονεω</span></span>, picturing Martha true to the account of her in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:40">Luke 10:40</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλην διακονιαν</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονειν</span></span> as here). But this fact does not show that Martha was the wife of this Simon at all. They were friends and neighbours and Martha was following her bent. It is Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:3">Mark 14:3</span>) and Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:6">Matthew 26:6</span>) who mention the name of the host. It is not Simon the Pharisee (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:36">Luke 7:36</span>), but Simon the leper (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:3">Mark 14:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:6">Matthew 26:6</span>) in whose house they meet. The name is common enough. The Simon in Luke was sharply critical of Jesus; this one is full of gratitude for what Jesus has done for him.</p>
<p><b>That sat at meat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των ανακειμενων</span></span>). "That lay back," reclined as they did, articular participle (ablative case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>) of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακειμα</span></span>. Perhaps Simon gave the feast partly in honour of Lazarus as well as of Jesus since all were now talking of both (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:9">John 12:9</span>). It was a gracious occasion. The guests were Jesus, the twelve apostles, and Martha, Mary, and Lazarus. </p>
