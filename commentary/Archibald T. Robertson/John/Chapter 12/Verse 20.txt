<p><b> Certain Greeks </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hελληνες τινες</span></span>). Real Greeks, not Greek-speaking Jews (Hellenists, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span>), but Greeks like those in Antioch (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:20">Acts 11:20</span>, correct text <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τους Hελληνας</span></span>) to whom Barnabas was sent. These were probably proselytes of the gate or God-fearers like those worshipping Greeks in Thessalonica whom Paul won to Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:4">Acts 17:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>To worship at the feast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα προσκυνησωσιν εν τη εορτη</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνεω</span></span>, old and common verb to kiss the hand in reverence, to bow the knee in reverence and worship. We do not know whence they came, whether from Decapolis, Galilee, or further away. They found the pilgrims and the city ringing with talk about Jesus. They may even have witnessed the triumphal entry. </p>
