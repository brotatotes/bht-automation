<p><b> To Philip which was of Bethsaida of Galilee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φιλιππω τω απο Βηθσαιδα της Γαλιλαιας</span></span>). He had a Greek name and the Greeks may have seen Philip in Galilee where there were many Greeks, probably (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45">Mark 6:45</span>) the Western Bethsaida in Galilee, not Bethsaida Julias on the Eastern side (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10">Luke 9:10</span>).</p>
<p><b>Asked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρωτων</span></span>). Imperfect active, probably inchoative, "began to ask," in contrast with the aorist tense just before (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσηλθαν</span></span>, came to).</p>
<p><b>Sir </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριε</span></span>). Most respectfully and courteously.</p>
<p><b>We would see Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελομεν τον Ιησουν ιδειν</span></span>). "We desire to see Jesus." This is not abrupt like our "we wish" or "we want," but perfectly polite. However, they could easily "see" Jesus, had already done so, no doubt. They wish an interview with Jesus. </p>
