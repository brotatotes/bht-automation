 To Philip which was of Bethsaida of Galilee  (Φιλιππω τω απο Βηθσαιδα της Γαλιλαιας). He had a Greek name and the Greeks may have seen Philip in Galilee where there were many Greeks, probably (Mark 6:45) the Western Bethsaida in Galilee, not Bethsaida Julias on the Eastern side (Luke 9:10).Asked  (ηρωτων). Imperfect active, probably inchoative, "began to ask," in contrast with the aorist tense just before (προσηλθαν, came to).Sir  (Κυριε). Most respectfully and courteously.We would see Jesus  (θελομεν τον Ιησουν ιδειν). "We desire to see Jesus." This is not abrupt like our "we wish" or "we want," but perfectly polite. However, they could easily "see" Jesus, had already done so, no doubt. They wish an interview with Jesus.
