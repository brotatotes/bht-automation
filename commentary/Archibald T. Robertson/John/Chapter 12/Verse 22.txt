<p><b> Andrew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω Ανδρεα</span></span>). Another apostle with a Greek name and associated with Philip again (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:7">John 6:7</span>), the man who first brought his brother Simon to Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:41">John 1:41</span>). Andrew was clearly a man of wisdom for a crisis. Note the vivid dramatic presents here,</p>
<p><b>cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχετα</span></span>),</p>
<p><b>telleth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγε</span></span>). What was the crisis? These Greeks wish an interview with Jesus. True Jesus had said something about "other sheep" than Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:16">John 10:16</span>), but he had not explained. Philip and Andrew wrestle with the problem that will puzzle Peter on the housetop in Joppa (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:9-18">Acts 10:9-18</span>), that middle wall of partition between Jew and Gentile that was only broken down by the Cross of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:11-22">Ephesians 2:11-22</span>) and that many Christians and Jews still set up between each other. Andrew has no solution for Philip and they bring the problem, but not the Greeks, to Jesus. </p>
