 Andrew  (τω Ανδρεα). Another apostle with a Greek name and associated with Philip again (John 6:7), the man who first brought his brother Simon to Jesus (John 1:41). Andrew was clearly a man of wisdom for a crisis. Note the vivid dramatic presents here,cometh  (ερχετα),telleth  (λεγε). What was the crisis? These Greeks wish an interview with Jesus. True Jesus had said something about "other sheep" than Jews (John 10:16), but he had not explained. Philip and Andrew wrestle with the problem that will puzzle Peter on the housetop in Joppa (Acts 10:9-18), that middle wall of partition between Jew and Gentile that was only broken down by the Cross of Christ (Ephesians 2:11-22) and that many Christians and Jews still set up between each other. Andrew has no solution for Philip and they bring the problem, but not the Greeks, to Jesus.
