 The hour is come  (εληλυθεν η ωρα). The predestined hour, seen from the start (John 2:4), mentioned by John (John 7:30; John 8:20) as not yet come and later as known by Jesus as come (John 13:1), twice again used by Jesus as already come (in the prayer of Jesus, John 17:1; Mark 14:41, just before the betrayal in the Garden). The request from the Greeks for this interview stirs the heart of Jesus to its depths.That the Son of man should be glorified  (ινα δοξασθη ο υιος του ανθρωπου). Purpose clause with ινα (not in the sense of οτε, when) and the first aorist passive subjunctive of δοξαζω, same sense as in John 12:16; John 13:31. The Cross must come before Greeks can really come to Jesus with understanding. But this request shows that interest in Jesus now extends beyond the Jewish circles.
