<p><b> The hour is come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εληλυθεν η ωρα</span></span>). The predestined hour, seen from the start (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:4">John 2:4</span>), mentioned by John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:30">John 7:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:20">John 8:20</span>) as not yet come and later as known by Jesus as come (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>), twice again used by Jesus as already come (in the prayer of Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:41">Mark 14:41</span>, just before the betrayal in the Garden). The request from the Greeks for this interview stirs the heart of Jesus to its depths.</p>
<p><b>That the Son of man should be glorified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα δοξασθη ο υιος του ανθρωπου</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> (not in the sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε</span></span>, when) and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαζω</span></span>, same sense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:16">John 12:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:31">John 13:31</span>. The Cross must come before Greeks can really come to Jesus with understanding. But this request shows that interest in Jesus now extends beyond the Jewish circles. </p>
