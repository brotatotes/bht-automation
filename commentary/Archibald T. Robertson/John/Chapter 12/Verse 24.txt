<p><b> Except </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη</span></span>). Negative condition of third class (undetermined, supposable case) with second aorist active participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεσων</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιπτω</span></span>, to fall) and the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποθνησκω</span></span>, to die.</p>
<p><b>A grain of wheat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κοκκος του σιτου</span></span>). Rather, "the grain of wheat."</p>
<p><b>By itself alone </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος μονος</span></span>). Both predicate nominatives after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενε</span></span>. It is not necessary to think (nor likely) that Jesus has in mind the Eleusinian mysteries which became a symbol of the mystery of spring. Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:36">1 Corinthians 15:36</span> uses the same illustration of the resurrection that Jesus does here. Jesus shows here the paradox that life comes through death. Whether the Greeks heard him or not we do not know. If so, they heard something not in Greek philosophy, the Christian ideal of sacrifice, "and this was foreign to the philosophy of Greece" (Bernard). Jesus had already spoken of himself as the bread of life (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:35-65">John 6:35-65</span>).</p>
<p><b>But if it die </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν δε αποθανη</span></span>). Parallel condition of the third class. Grains of wheat have been found in Egyptian tombs three or four thousand years old, but they are now dead. They bore no fruit. </p>
