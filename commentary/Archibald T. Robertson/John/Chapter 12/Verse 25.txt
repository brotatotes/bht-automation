<p><b> Loseth it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολλυε αυτην</span></span>). The second paradox. Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολλυω</span></span>. This great saying was spoken at various times as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:35">Mark 8:35</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:24">Luke 9:24</span>) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:39">Mark 10:39</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:33">Luke 17:33</span>). See those passages for discussion of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span> (life or soul). For "he that hateth his life" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μισων την ψυχην αυτου</span></span>) see the sharp contrasts in Luke <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26-35">John 14:26-35</span> where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισεω</span></span> is used of father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, as well as one's own life. Clearly <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισεω</span></span> means "hate" when the issue is between Christ and the dearest things of life as happens when the choice is between martyrdom and apostasy. In that case one keeps his soul for eternal life by losing his life (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span>, each time) here. That is the way to "guard" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλαξε</span></span>) life by being true to Christ. This is the second paradox to show Christ's philosophy of life. </p>
