<p><b> My soul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ψυχη μου</span></span>). The soul (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span>) here is synonymous with spirit (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:21">John 13:21</span>.</p>
<p><b>Is troubled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεταρακτα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταρασσω</span></span>, used also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:33">John 11:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:21">John 13:21</span> of Jesus. While John proves the deity of Jesus in his Gospel, he assumes throughout his real humanity as here (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:6">John 4:6</span>). The language is an echo of that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+6:4">Psalms 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+42:7">Psalms 42:7</span>. John does not give the agony in Gethsemane which the Synoptics have (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:35">Mark 14:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:39">Matthew 26:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:42">Luke 22:42</span>), but it is quite beside the mark to suggest, as Bernard does, that the account here is John's version of the Gethsemane experience. Why do some critics feel called upon to level down to a dead plane every variety of experience in Christ's life?</p>
<p><b>And what shall I say? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τ ειπω;</span></span>). Deliberative subjunctive which expresses vividly "a genuine, if momentary indecision" (Bernard). The request of the Greeks called up graphically to Jesus the nearness of the Cross.</p>
<p><b>Father, save me from this hour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατερ, σωσον με εκ της ωρας ταυτης</span></span>). Jesus began his prayers with "Father" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:41">John 11:41</span>). Dods thinks that this should be a question also. Westcott draws a distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> (out of) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> (from) to show that Jesus does not pray to draw back from the hour, but only to come safely out of it all and so interprets <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span>, but that distinction will not stand, for in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:44">John 1:44</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> are used in the same sense and in the Synoptics (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:35">Mark 14:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:39">Matthew 26:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+52:42">Luke 52:42</span>) we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>. If it holds here, we lose the point there. Here as in Gethsemane the soul of Jesus instinctively and naturally shrinks from the Cross, but he instantly surrenders to the will of God in both experiences.</p>
<p><b>But for this cause came I unto this hour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα δια τουτο ηλθον εις την ωραν ταυτην</span></span>). It was only a moment of human weakness as in Gethsemane that quickly passed. Thus understood the language has its natural meaning. </p>
