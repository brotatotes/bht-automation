 Father, glorify thy name  (πατερ, δοξασον σου το ονομα). First aorist (note of urgency) active imperative of δοξαζω and in the sense of his death already in verses John 12:16; John 12:23 and again in John 13:31; John 17:5. This is the prayer of the πνευμα (or ψυχη) as opposed to that of the σαρξ (flesh) in verse John 12:27. The "name" (ονομα) of God expresses the character of God (John 1:12; John 5:43; John 17:11). Cf. Matthew 6:9.A voice out of heaven  (φωνη εκ του ουρανου). This was the Father's answer to the prayer of Jesus for help. See already the Father's voice at the baptism of Jesus (Mark 1:11) and at the transfiguration (Mark 9:7). The rabbis called the audible voice of God bath-qol (the daughter of a voice).I have both glorified it and will glorify it again  (κα εδοξασα κα παλιν δοξασω). This definite assurance from the Father will nerve the soul of Jesus for the coming ordeal. Cf. John 11:40 for εδοξασα and John 13:31; John 17:5 for δοξασω.
