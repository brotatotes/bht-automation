<p><b> Not for my sake, but for your sakes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου δι' εμε, αλλα δι' υμας</span></span>). These words seem to contradict verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:28">John 12:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:29">John 12:29</span>. Bernard suggests an interpolation into the words of Jesus. But why not take it to be the figure of exaggerated contrast, "not merely for my sake, but also for yours"? </p>
