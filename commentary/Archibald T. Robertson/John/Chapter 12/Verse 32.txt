<p><b> And I, if I be lifted from the earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καγω αν υψωθω εκ της γης</span></span>). Note proleptic position of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω</span></span> (I). Condition of third class (undetermined with prospect) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> (=<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> here) with first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υψοω</span></span>, the verb used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14">John 3:14</span> of the brazen serpent and of the Cross of Christ as here and also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:28">John 8:28</span>. Westcott again presses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> to make it refer to the ascension rather than to the Cross, a wrong interpretation surely.</p>
<p><b>Will draw all men unto myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντας ελκυσω προς εμαυτον</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελκυω</span></span>, late form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελκω</span></span>, to draw, to attract. Jesus had already used this verb of the Father's drawing power (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44">John 6:44</span>). The magnetism of the Cross is now known of all men, however little they understand the mystery of the Cross. By "all men" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντας</span></span>) Jesus does not mean every individual man, for some, as Simeon said (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34">Luke 2:34</span>) are repelled by Christ, but this is the way that Greeks (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:22">John 12:22</span>) can and will come to Christ, by the way of the Cross, the only way to the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>). </p>
