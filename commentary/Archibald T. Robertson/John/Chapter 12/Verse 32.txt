 And I, if I be lifted from the earth  (καγω αν υψωθω εκ της γης). Note proleptic position of εγω (I). Condition of third class (undetermined with prospect) with αν (=εαν here) with first aorist passive subjunctive of υψοω, the verb used in John 3:14 of the brazen serpent and of the Cross of Christ as here and also in John 8:28. Westcott again presses εκ instead of απο to make it refer to the ascension rather than to the Cross, a wrong interpretation surely.Will draw all men unto myself  (παντας ελκυσω προς εμαυτον). Future active of ελκυω, late form of ελκω, to draw, to attract. Jesus had already used this verb of the Father's drawing power (John 6:44). The magnetism of the Cross is now known of all men, however little they understand the mystery of the Cross. By "all men" (παντας) Jesus does not mean every individual man, for some, as Simeon said (Luke 2:34) are repelled by Christ, but this is the way that Greeks (verse John 12:22) can and will come to Christ, by the way of the Cross, the only way to the Father (John 14:6).
