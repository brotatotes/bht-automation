 Signifying  (σημαινων). Present active participle of σεμαινω, old verb to give a sign (σημειον) as in Acts 25:27, and the whole phrase repeated in John 18:32 and nearly so in John 21:19. The indirect question here and in John 18:32 has the imperfect εμελλεν with present infinitive rather than the usual present μελλε retained while in John 21:19 the future indicative δοξασε occurs according to rule. The point in ποιω (qualitative relative in the instrumental case with θανατω) is the Cross (lifted up) as the kind of death before Christ.
