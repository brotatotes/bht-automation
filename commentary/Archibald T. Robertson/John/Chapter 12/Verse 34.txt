<p><b> Out of the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του νομου</span></span>). That is, "out of the Scriptures" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:34">John 10:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:25">John 15:25</span>).</p>
<p><b>The Christ abideth forever </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Χριστος μενε εις τον αιωνα</span></span>). Timeless present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενω</span></span>, to abide, remain. Perhaps from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:4">Psalms 89:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:4">Psalms 110:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:7">Isaiah 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:25">Ezekiel 37:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:14">Daniel 7:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>How sayest thou? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πως λεγεις συ;</span></span>). In opposition to the law (Scripture).</p>
<p><b>The Son of man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον υιον του ανθρωπου</span></span>). Accusative case of general reference with the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υψωθηνα</span></span> (first aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υψοω</span></span> and taken in the sense of death by the cross as Jesus used it in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:32">John 12:32</span>). Clearly the crowd understand Jesus to be "the Son of man" and take the phrase to be equivalent to "the Christ." This is the obvious way to understand the two terms in their reply, and not, as Bernard suggests, that they saw no connexion between "the Christ" (the Messiah) and "the Son of man." The use of "this" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>) in the question that follows is in contrast to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:32">John 12:32</span>. The Messiah (the Son of man) abides forever and is not to be crucified as you say he "must" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>) be. </p>
