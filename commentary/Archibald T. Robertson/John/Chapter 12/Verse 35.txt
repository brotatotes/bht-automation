 Yet a little while is the light among you  (ετ μικρον χρονον το φως εν υμιν εστιν). Χρονον is the accusative of extent of time. Jesus does not argue the point of theology with the crowd who would not understand. He turns to the metaphor used before when he claimed to be the light of the world (John 8:12) and urges that they take advantage of their privilege "while ye have the light" (ως το φως εχετε).That darkness overtake you not  (ινα μη σκοτια υμας καταλαβη). Purpose (negative) with ινα μη and second aorist active subjunctive of καταλαμβανω. See this verb in John 1:5. In 1 Thessalonians 5:4 this verb occurs with ημερα (day) overtaking one like a thief.Knoweth not whither he goeth  (ουκ οιδεν που υπαγε). See John 11:10 for this idea and the same language in 1 John 2:11. The ancients did not have our electric street lights. The dark streets were a terror to travellers.
