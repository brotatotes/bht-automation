<p><b> Yet a little while is the light among you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετ μικρον χρονον το φως εν υμιν εστιν</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χρονον</span></span> is the accusative of extent of time. Jesus does not argue the point of theology with the crowd who would not understand. He turns to the metaphor used before when he claimed to be the light of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>) and urges that they take advantage of their privilege "while ye have the light" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως το φως εχετε</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>That darkness overtake you not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη σκοτια υμας καταλαβη</span></span>). Purpose (negative) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη</span></span> and second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλαμβανω</span></span>. See this verb in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:5">John 1:5</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span> this verb occurs with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερα</span></span> (day) overtaking one like a thief.</p>
<p><b>Knoweth not whither he goeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ οιδεν που υπαγε</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:10">John 11:10</span> for this idea and the same language in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:11">1 John 2:11</span>. The ancients did not have our electric street lights. The dark streets were a terror to travellers. </p>
