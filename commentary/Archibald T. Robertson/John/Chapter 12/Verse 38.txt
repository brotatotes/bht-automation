 That might be fulfilled  (ινα πληρωθη). It is usually assumed that ινα here with the first aorist passive subjunctive of πληροω has its full telic force. That is probable as God's design, but it is by no means certain since ινα is used in the N.T. with the idea of result, just as ut in Latin is either purpose or result, as in John 6:7; John 9:2; 1 Thessalonians 5:4; Galatians 5:17; Romans 11:11 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 998). Paul in Romans 10:16 quotes Isaiah 53:1 as John does here but without ινα. See Romans 10:16 for discussion of the quotation. The next verse adds strength to the idea of design.
