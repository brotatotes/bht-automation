<p><b> That might be fulfilled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα πληρωθη</span></span>). It is usually assumed that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> here with the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span> has its full telic force. That is probable as God's design, but it is by no means certain since <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> is used in the N.T. with the idea of result, just as <i>ut</i> in Latin is either purpose or result, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:7">John 6:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:2">John 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:17">Galatians 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11">Romans 11:11</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 998). Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:16">Romans 10:16</span> quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:1">Isaiah 53:1</span> as John does here but without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:16">Romans 10:16</span> for discussion of the quotation. The next verse adds strength to the idea of design. </p>
