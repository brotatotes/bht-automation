<p><b> Judas Iscariot </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιουδας ο Ισκαριωτης</span></span>). See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Ισκαριωτης</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:22">John 14:22</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:71">John 6:71</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span> for like description of Judas save that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:71">John 6:71</span> the father's name is given in the genitive, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σιμωνος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ισκαριωτου</span></span> (agreeing with the father), but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ισκαριωτης</span></span> agrees with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιουδας</span></span>, not with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σιμωνος</span></span>. Clearly then both father and son were called "Iscariot" or man of Kerioth in the tribe of Judah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jos+15:25">Joshua 15:25</span>). Judas is the only one of the twelve not a Galilean.</p>
<p><b>One of his disciples </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις των μαθητων αυτου</span></span>). Likewise in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:71">John 6:71</span>, only there <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> is used after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> as some MSS. have here. This is the shameful fact that clung to the name of Judas.</p>
<p><b>Which should betray him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μελλων αυτον παραδιδονα</span></span>). John does not say in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:71">John 6:71</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμελλεν παραδιδονα αυτον</span></span>) or here that Judas "was predestined to betray Jesus" as Bernard suggests. He had his own responsibility for his guilt as Jesus said (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:24">Matthew 26:24</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μελλω</span></span> here simply points to the act as future, not as necessary. Note the contrast between Mary and Judas. "Mary in her devotion unconsciously provides for the honour of the dead. Judas in his selfishness unconsciously brings about the death itself" (Westcott). </p>
