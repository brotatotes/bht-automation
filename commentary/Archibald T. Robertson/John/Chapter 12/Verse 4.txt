 Judas Iscariot  (Ιουδας ο Ισκαριωτης). See ο Ισκαριωτης in John 14:22. See John 6:71; John 13:1 for like description of Judas save that in John 6:71 the father's name is given in the genitive, Σιμωνος and Ισκαριωτου (agreeing with the father), but in John 13:1 Ισκαριωτης agrees with Ιουδας, not with Σιμωνος. Clearly then both father and son were called "Iscariot" or man of Kerioth in the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:25). Judas is the only one of the twelve not a Galilean.One of his disciples  (εις των μαθητων αυτου). Likewise in John 6:71, only there εκ is used after εις as some MSS. have here. This is the shameful fact that clung to the name of Judas.Which should betray him  (ο μελλων αυτον παραδιδονα). John does not say in John 6:71 (εμελλεν παραδιδονα αυτον) or here that Judas "was predestined to betray Jesus" as Bernard suggests. He had his own responsibility for his guilt as Jesus said (Matthew 26:24). Μελλω here simply points to the act as future, not as necessary. Note the contrast between Mary and Judas. "Mary in her devotion unconsciously provides for the honour of the dead. Judas in his selfishness unconsciously brings about the death itself" (Westcott).
