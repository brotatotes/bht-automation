 He hath blinded  (τετυφλωκεν). Perfect active indicative of τυφλοω, old causative verb to make blind (from τυφλος, blind), in N.T. only here, 2 Corinthians 4:4; 1 John 2:11.He hardened  (επωρωσεν). First aorist active indicative of πωροω, a late causative verb (from πωρος, hard skin), seen already in Mark 6:52, etc. This quotation is from Isaiah 6:10 and differs from the LXX.Lest they should see  (ινα μη ιδωσιν). Negative purpose clause with ινα μη instead of μηποτε (never used by John) of the LXX. Matthew (Matthew 13:15) has μηποτε and quotes Jesus as using the passage as do Mark (Mark 4:12) and Luke (Luke 8:10). Paul quotes it again (Acts 28:26) to the Jews in Rome. In each instance the words of Isaiah are interpreted as forecasting the doom of the Jews for rejecting the Messiah. Matthew (Matthew 13:15) has συνωσιν where John has νοησωσιν (perceive), and both change from the subjunctive to the future (κα ιασομα), "And I should heal them." John has here στραφωσιν (second aorist passive subjunctive of στρεφω) while Matthew reads επιστρεψωσιν (first aorist active of επιστρεφω).
