<p><b> Because he saw his glory </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ειδεν την δοξαν αυτου</span></span>). Correct reading here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> (because), not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε</span></span> (when). Isaiah with spiritual vision saw the glory of the Messiah and spoke (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλησεν</span></span>) of him, John says, whatever modern critics may think or say. So Jesus said that Abraham saw his day (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:56">John 8:56</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>. </p>
