 Because he saw his glory  (οτ ειδεν την δοξαν αυτου). Correct reading here οτ (because), not οτε (when). Isaiah with spiritual vision saw the glory of the Messiah and spoke (ελαλησεν) of him, John says, whatever modern critics may think or say. So Jesus said that Abraham saw his day (John 8:56). Cf. Hebrews 11:13.
