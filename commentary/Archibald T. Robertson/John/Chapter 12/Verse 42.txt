 Nevertheless even  (ομως μεντο κα). For the old ομως see 1 Corinthians 14:7; Galatians 3:15 (only other examples in N.T.), here only with μεντο, "but yet," and κα, "even." In spite of what has just been said "many (πολλο) even of the rulers" (recall the lonely shyness of Nicodemus in John 3:1). These actually "believed on him" (επιστευσαν εις αυτον) in their convictions, a remarkable statement as to the effect that Christ had in Jerusalem as the Sanhedrin plotted his death. Cf. Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea.But because of the Pharisees  (αλλα δια τους Φαρισαιους). Like the whispered talk in John 7:13 "because of the fear of the Jews." Once the Pharisees sneeringly asked the officers (John 7:48): "Hath any one of the rulers believed on him?" And now "many of the rulers have believed on him."They did not confess  (ουχ ωμολογουν). Negative imperfect in contrast to the punctiliar aorist επιστευσαν. "They kept on not confessing." How like the cowardly excuses made today by those under conviction who refuse to step out for Christ.Lest they should be put out of the synagogue  (ινα μη αποσυναγωγο γενωντα). Cf. John 9:22 where this very word occurs in a purpose clause like this. Only once more in the N.T. (John 16:2), a Jewish word not in profane authors. This ostracism from the synagogue was dreaded by the Jews and made cowards of these "believing elders."More than  (μαλλον ηπερ). They preferred the glory and praise of men more than the glory and praise of God. How απροπος these words are to some suave cowards today.
