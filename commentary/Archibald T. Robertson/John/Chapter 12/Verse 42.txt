<p><b> Nevertheless even </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομως μεντο κα</span></span>). For the old <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομως</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:7">1 Corinthians 14:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:15">Galatians 3:15</span> (only other examples in N.T.), here only with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεντο</span></span>, "but yet," and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>, "even." In spite of what has just been said "many (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλο</span></span>) even of the rulers" (recall the lonely shyness of Nicodemus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:1">John 3:1</span>). These actually "believed on him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευσαν εις αυτον</span></span>) in their convictions, a remarkable statement as to the effect that Christ had in Jerusalem as the Sanhedrin plotted his death. Cf. Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea.</p>
<p><b>But because of the Pharisees </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα δια τους Φαρισαιους</span></span>). Like the whispered talk in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:13">John 7:13</span> "because of the fear of the Jews." Once the Pharisees sneeringly asked the officers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:48">John 7:48</span>): "Hath any one of the rulers believed on him?" And now "many of the rulers have believed on him."</p>
<p><b>They did not confess </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ ωμολογουν</span></span>). Negative imperfect in contrast to the punctiliar aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευσαν</span></span>. "They kept on not confessing." How like the cowardly excuses made today by those under conviction who refuse to step out for Christ.</p>
<p><b>Lest they should be put out of the synagogue </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη αποσυναγωγο γενωντα</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:22">John 9:22</span> where this very word occurs in a purpose clause like this. Only once more in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:2">John 16:2</span>), a Jewish word not in profane authors. This ostracism from the synagogue was dreaded by the Jews and made cowards of these "believing elders."</p>
<p><b>More than </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλλον ηπερ</span></span>). They preferred the glory and praise of men more than the glory and praise of God. How <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απροπος</span></span> these words are to some suave cowards today. </p>
