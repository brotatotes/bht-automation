<p><b> Cried and said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκραξεν κα ειπεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραζω</span></span>, to cry aloud, and second aorist active of defective verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερω</span></span>, to say. This is probably a summary of what Jesus had already said as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:36">John 12:36</span> John closes the public ministry of Jesus without the Synoptic account of the last day in the temple on our Tuesday (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:27-12">Mark 11:27-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:23-23">Matthew 21:23-23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:1-21">Luke 20:1-21</span>).</p>
<p><b>Not on me, but on him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου εις εμε, αλλα εις τον</span></span>). "Not on me only, but also on," another example of exaggerated contrast like that in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:30">John 12:30</span>. The idea of Jesus here is a frequent one (believing on Jesus whom the Father has sent) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:17">John 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:23">John 5:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:30">John 5:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:43">John 5:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:16">John 7:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:42">John 8:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:20">John 13:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:1">John 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:40">Matthew 10:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:48">Luke 9:48</span>. </p>
