 Rejecteth  (αθετων). Present active participle of αθετεω, late Koine verb (from αθετος, α privative, and τιθημ), to render null and void, only here in John, but see Mark 6:26; Mark 7:9.One that judgeth him  (τον κρινοντα αυτον). Articular present active participle of κρινω. See same idea in John 5:45; John 9:50.The same  (εκεινος). "That" very word of Christ which one rejects will confront him and accuse him to the Father "at the last day" (εν τη εσχατη ημερα, this phrase peculiar to John). There is no escaping it. And yet Jesus himself will bear witness for or against the one whose conduct has already revealed his attitude towards the message of God (Matthew 10:32; Luke 12:8).
