<p><b> He hath given </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεδωκεν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative. Christ has permanent commission.</p>
<p><b>What I should say and what I should speak </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ειπω κα τ λαλησω</span></span>). Indirect question retaining the deliberative subjunctive (second aorist active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπω</span></span>, first aorist active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλησω</span></span>). Meyer and Westcott take <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπω</span></span> to refer to the content and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλησω</span></span> more to the varying manner of delivery. Possibly so. </p>
