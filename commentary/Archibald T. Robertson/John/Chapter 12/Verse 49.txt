 He hath given  (δεδωκεν). Perfect active indicative. Christ has permanent commission.What I should say and what I should speak  (τ ειπω κα τ λαλησω). Indirect question retaining the deliberative subjunctive (second aorist active ειπω, first aorist active λαλησω). Meyer and Westcott take ειπω to refer to the content and λαλησω more to the varying manner of delivery. Possibly so.
