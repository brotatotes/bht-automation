<p><b> Sold </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επραθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιπρασκω</span></span>, old verb to sell (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:46">Matthew 13:46</span>).</p>
<p><b>For three hundred pence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τριακοσιων δηναριων</span></span>). Genitive of price. Same item in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:5">Mark 14:5</span>, while in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:9">Matthew 26:9</span> it is simply "for much" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλου</span></span>). But all three have "given to the poor" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοθη πτωχοις</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span> with dative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πτωχοις</span></span> (note absence of the article, poor people), real beggars, mendicants (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:21">Matthew 19:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:13">Luke 14:13</span>). But only John singles out Judas as the one who made the protest against this waste of money while Mark says that "some" had indignation and Matthew has it that "the disciples" had indignation. Clearly Judas was the spokesman for the group who chimed in and agreed with his protest. The amount here spent by Mary (ten guineas) would equal a day labourer's wages for a year (Dods). </p>
