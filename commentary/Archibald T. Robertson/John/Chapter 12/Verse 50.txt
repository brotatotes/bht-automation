<p><b> Life eternal </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωη αιωνιος</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:15">John 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46">Matthew 25:46</span> for this great phrase. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:68">John 6:68</span> Peter says to Jesus, "Thou hast the words of eternal life." Jesus had just said (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:63">John 6:63</span>) that his words were spirit and life. The secret lies in the source, "as the Father hath said to me" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρηκεν</span></span>). </p>
