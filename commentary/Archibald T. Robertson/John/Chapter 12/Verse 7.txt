<p><b> Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αφες αυτην, ινα εις την ημεραν του ενταφιασμου μου τηρηση αυτο</span></span>). This reading (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα τηρηση</span></span>, purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρεω</span></span>) rather than that of the Textus Receptus (just <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετηρεκεν</span></span>, perfect active indicative) is correct. It is supported by Aleph B D L W Theta. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> can be rendered as above after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφες</span></span> according to <i>Koine</i> idiom or more probably: "Let her alone: it was that," etc. (supplying "it was"). Either makes good sense. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενταφιασμος</span></span> is a later and rare substantive from the late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενταφιαζω</span></span>, to prepare for burial (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:12">Matthew 26:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:40">John 19:40</span>), and means preparation for burial. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:8">Mark 14:8</span>. "Preparation for my burial" is the idea here and in Mark. The idea of Jesus is that Mary had saved this money to use in preparing his body for burial. She is giving him the flowers before the funeral. We can hardly take it that Mary did not use all of the ointment for Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:3">Mark 14:3</span>) says that she broke it and yet he adds (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:8">Mark 14:8</span>) what John has here. It is a paradox, but Jesus is fond of paradoxes. Mary has kept this precious gift by giving it now beforehand as a preparation for my burial. We really keep what we give to Christ. This is Mary's glory that she had some glimmering comprehension of Christ's death which none of the disciples possessed. </p>
