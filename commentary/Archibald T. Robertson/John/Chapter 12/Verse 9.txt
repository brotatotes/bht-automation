 The common people  (ο οχλος πολυς). This is the right reading with the article ο, literally, "the people much or in large numbers." One is reminded of the French idiom. Gildersleeve (Syntax, p. 284) gives a few rare examples of the idiom ο ανηρ αγαθος. Westcott suggests that οχλος πολυς came to be regarded as a compound noun. This is the usual order in the N.T. rather than πολυς οχλος (Robertson, Grammar, p. 774). Mark (Mark 12:37) has ο πολυς οχλος. Moulton (Proleg., p. 84) terms ο οχλος πολυς here and in verse John 12:12 "a curious misplacement of the article." John's use of οχλος is usually the common crowd as "riff-raff."That he was  (οτ εστιν). Present active indicative retained in indirect discourse after the secondary tense (εγνω, second aorist active indicative of γινωσκω). These "Jews" are not all hostile to Jesus as in John 5:10; John 6:41, etc., but included some who were friendly (verse John 12:11).But that they might see Lazarus also  (αλλ' ινα κα τον Λαζαρον ιδωσιν). Purpose clause with ινα and second aorist active subjunctive of οραω. Motive enough to gather a great crowd, to see one raised from the dead (cf. verse John 12:1 for the same phrase, "whom he had raised from the dead"). Some of the very witnesses of the raising of Lazarus will bear witness later (verse John 12:17). It was a tense situation.
