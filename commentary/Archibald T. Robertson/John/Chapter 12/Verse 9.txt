<p><b> The common people </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο οχλος πολυς</span></span>). This is the right reading with the article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span>, literally, "the people much or in large numbers." One is reminded of the French idiom. Gildersleeve (<i>Syntax</i>, p. 284) gives a few rare examples of the idiom <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ανηρ αγαθος</span></span>. Westcott suggests that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλος πολυς</span></span> came to be regarded as a compound noun. This is the usual order in the N.T. rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολυς οχλος</span></span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 774). Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:37">Mark 12:37</span>) has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πολυς οχλος</span></span>. Moulton (<i>Proleg</i>., p. 84) terms <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο οχλος πολυς</span></span> here and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:12">John 12:12</span> "a curious misplacement of the article." John's use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλος</span></span> is usually the common crowd as "riff-raff."</p>
<p><b>That he was </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ εστιν</span></span>). Present active indicative retained in indirect discourse after the secondary tense (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγνω</span></span>, second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>). These "Jews" are not all hostile to Jesus as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:10">John 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:41">John 6:41</span>, etc., but included some who were friendly (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:11">John 12:11</span>).</p>
<p><b>But that they might see Lazarus also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ινα κα τον Λαζαρον ιδωσιν</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>. Motive enough to gather a great crowd, to see one raised from the dead (cf. verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span> for the same phrase, "whom he had raised from the dead"). Some of the very witnesses of the raising of Lazarus will bear witness later (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:17">John 12:17</span>). It was a tense situation. </p>
