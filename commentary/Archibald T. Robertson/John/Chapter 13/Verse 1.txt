<p><b> Now before the feast of the passover </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ δε της εορτης του πασχα</span></span>). Just before, John means, not twenty-four hours before, that is our Thursday evening (beginning of 15th of Nisan, sunset to sunset Jewish day), since Jesus was crucified on Friday 15th of Nisan. Hence Jesus ate the regular passover meal at the usual time. The whole feast, including the feast of unleavened bread, lasted eight days. For a discussion of the objections to this interpretation of John in connexion with the Synoptic Gospels one may consult my <i>Harmony of the Gospels</i>, pp. 279-84, and David Smith's <i>In the Days of His Flesh</i>, Appendix VIII. The passover feast began on the 15th Nisan at sunset, the passover lamb being slain the afternoon of 14th Nisan. There seems no real doubt that this meal in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1-30">John 13:1-30</span> is the real passover meal described by the Synoptics also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:18-21">Mark 14:18-21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:21-25">Matthew 26:21-25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:21-23">Luke 22:21-23</span>), followed by the institution of the Lord's Supper. Thus understood verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span> here serves as an introduction to the great esoteric teaching of Christ to the apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:2-17">John 13:2-17</span>), called by Barnas Sears <i>The Heart of Christ</i>. This phrase goes with the principal verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγαπησεν</span></span> (loved).</p>
<p><b>Knowing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδως</span></span>). Second perfect active participle, emphasizing the full consciousness of Christ. He was not stumbling into the dark as he faced "his hour" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου η ωρα</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:4">John 18:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:28">John 19:28</span> for other examples of the insight and foresight (Bernard) of Jesus concerning his death. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:23">John 12:23</span> for use before by Jesus.</p>
<p><b>That he should depart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μεταβη</span></span>). Sub-final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> with second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταβαινω</span></span>, old word, to go from one place to another, here (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:14">1 John 3:14</span>) to go from this world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:23">John 8:23</span>) back to the Father from whom he had come (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:12">John 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:28">John 14:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:10">John 16:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:28">John 16:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>).</p>
<p><b>His own which were in the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους ιδιους τους εν τω κοσμω</span></span>). His own disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:6">John 17:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:9">John 17:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:11">John 17:11</span>), those left in the world when he goes to the Father, not the Jews as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:23">Acts 4:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:8">1 Timothy 5:8</span> for the idiom. John pictures here the outgoing of Christ's very heart's love (chs. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:13-17">John 13:13-17</span>) towards these men whom he had chosen and whom he loved "unto the end" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τελος</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:22">Matthew 10:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:15">Luke 18:15</span>, but here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:16">1 Thessalonians 2:16</span> rather "to the uttermost." The culmination of the crisis ("his hour") naturally drew out the fulness of Christ's love for them as is shown in these great chapters (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:13-17">John 13:13-17</span>). </p>
