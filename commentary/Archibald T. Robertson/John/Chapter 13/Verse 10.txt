<p><b> He that is bathed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λελουμενος</span></span>). Perfect passive articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λουω</span></span>, to bathe the whole body (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:37">Acts 9:37</span>).</p>
<p><b>Save to wash his feet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη τους ποδας νιψασθα</span></span>). Aleph and some old Latin MSS. have only <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νιψασθα</span></span>, but the other words are genuine and are really involved by the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νιψασθα</span></span> (first aorist middle infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νιπτω</span></span>, to wash parts of the body) instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λουσασθα</span></span>, to bathe the whole body (just used before). The guest was supposed to bathe (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λουω</span></span>) before coming to a feast and so only the feet had to be washed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νιπτω</span></span>) on removing the sandals.</p>
<p><b>Clean </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαρος</span></span>). Because of the bath. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαρος</span></span> meaning external cleanliness see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:26">Matthew 23:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:59">Matthew 27:59</span> but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:3">John 15:3</span> it is used for spiritual purity as here in "ye are clean" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαρο</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Every whit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολος</span></span>). All of the body because of the bath. For this same predicate use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολος</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:34">John 9:34</span>.</p>
<p><b>But not all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ουχ παντες</span></span>). Strongly put exception (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ</span></span>). Plain hint of the treachery of Judas who is reclining at the table after having made the bargain with the Sanhedrin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:11">Mark 14:11</span>). A year ago Jesus knew that Judas was a devil and said to the apostles: "One of you is a devil" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:64">John 6:64</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:70">John 6:70</span>). But it did not hurt them then nor did they suspect each other then or now. It is far-fetched to make Jesus here refer to the cleansing power of his blood or to baptism as some do. </p>
