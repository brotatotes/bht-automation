<p><b> For he knew him that should betray him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηιδε γαρ τον παραδιδοντα αυτον</span></span>). Past perfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηιδε</span></span> used as imperfect. Jesus had known for a year at least (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:64">John 6:64</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:70">John 6:70</span>) and yet he treated Judas with his usual courtesy. The articular present participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδωμ</span></span>, "the betraying one," for Judas was already engaged in the process. Did Judas wince at this thrust from Jesus? </p>
