 Sat down again  (ανεπεσεν παλιν). Second aorist active indicative of αναπιπτω, old compound verb to fall back, to lie down, to recline. Παλιν (again) can be taken either with ανεπεσεν, as here, or with ειπεν (he said again).Know ye what I have done to you?  (γινωσκετε τ πεποιηκα υμιν;). "Do ye understand the meaning of my act?" Perfect active indicative of ποιεω with dative case (υμιν). It was a searching question, particularly to Simon Peter and Judas.
