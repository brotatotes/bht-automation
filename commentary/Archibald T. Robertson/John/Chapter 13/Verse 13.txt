<p><b> Ye </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις</span></span>). Emphatic.</p>
<p><b>Call me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνειτε με</span></span>). "Address me." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φωνεω</span></span> regular for addressing one with his title (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:48">John 1:48</span>).</p>
<p><b>Master </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hο διδασκαλος</span></span>). Nominative form (not in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span> accusative after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνειτε</span></span>), but really vocative in address with the article (called titular nominative sometimes) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hο Κυριος κα ο θεος μου</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:28">John 20:28</span>. "Teacher." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:28">John 11:28</span> for Martha's title for Jesus to Mary.</p>
<p><b>Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hο Κυριος</span></span>). Another and separate title. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:38">John 1:38</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διδασκαλε</span></span> (vocative form) for the Jewish <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ραββε</span></span> and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:36">John 9:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:38">John 9:38</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριε</span></span> for the Jewish <i>Mari</i>. It is significant that Jesus approves (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλως</span></span>, well) the application of both titles to himself as he accepts from Thomas the terms <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>For I am </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ γαρ</span></span>). Jesus distinctly claims here to be both Teacher and Lord in the full sense, at the very moment when he has rendered this menial, but symbolic, service to them. Here is a hint for those who talk lightly about "the peril of worshipping Jesus!" </p>
