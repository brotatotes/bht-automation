<p><b> An example </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποδειγμα</span></span>). For the old <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδειγμα</span></span> (not in N.T.), from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποδεικνυμ</span></span>, to show under the eyes as an illustration or warning (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>), common in the papyri for illustration, example, warning, here only in John, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:10">James 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:6">2 Peter 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:11">Hebrews 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span>. Peter uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπο</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:3">1 Peter 5:3</span>) with this incident in mind. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:7">Jude 1:7</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειγμα</span></span> (without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο</span></span>) occurs in the sense of example.</p>
<p><b>That ye also should do </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα κα υμεις ποιητε</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span> (keep on doing). Doing what? Does Jesus here institute a new church ordinance as some good people today hold? If so, it is curious that there is no record of it in the N.T. Jesus has given the disciples an object lesson in humility to rebuke their jealousy, pride, and strife exhibited at this very meal. The lesson of the "example" applies to all the relations of believers with each other. It is one that is continually needed. </p>
