 Is not greater  (ουκ εστιν μειζων). Comparative adjective of μεγας (greater) followed by the ablative case κυριου (contrast between slave, lord) and του πεμψαντος (articular participle of πεμπω, to send, with contrast with apostle, "one sent" (αποστολος) from αποστελλω). Jesus here enforces the dignity of service. In Luke 22:27 Jesus argues this point a bit. In Luke 6:40 the contrast is between the pupil and the teacher, though some pupils consider themselves superior to the teacher. In Matthew 10:24 Jesus uses both forms of the saying (pupil and slave). He clearly repeated this λογιον often.
