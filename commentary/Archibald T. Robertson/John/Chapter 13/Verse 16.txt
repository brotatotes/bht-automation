<p><b> Is not greater </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν μειζων</span></span>). Comparative adjective of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγας</span></span> (greater) followed by the ablative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριου</span></span> (contrast between slave, lord) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του πεμψαντος</span></span> (articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεμπω</span></span>, to send, with contrast with apostle, "one sent" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολος</span></span>) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστελλω</span></span>). Jesus here enforces the dignity of service. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:27">Luke 22:27</span> Jesus argues this point a bit. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:40">Luke 6:40</span> the contrast is between the pupil and the teacher, though some pupils consider themselves superior to the teacher. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:24">Matthew 10:24</span> Jesus uses both forms of the saying (pupil and slave). He clearly repeated this <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογιον</span></span> often. </p>
