<p><b> If ye know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε οιδατε</span></span>). Condition of first class assumed as true, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and present (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδατε</span></span> used as present) active indicative.</p>
<p><b>If ye do </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ποιητε</span></span>). Third-class condition, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and present active subjunctive, assumed as possible, "if ye keep on doing." Both conditions with the one conclusion coming in between, "happy are ye." Just knowing does not bring happiness nor just occasional doing. </p>
