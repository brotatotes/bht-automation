<p><b> Not of you all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου περ παντων</span></span>). As in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:11">John 13:11</span>, he here refers to Judas whose treachery is no surprise to Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:64">John 6:64</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:70">John 6:70</span>).</p>
<p><b>Whom I have chosen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινας εξελεξαμην</span></span>). Indirect question, unless <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινας</span></span> is here used as a relative like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ους</span></span>. The first aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεγω</span></span> is the same form used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:70">John 6:70</span>. Jesus refers to the choice (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13">Luke 6:13</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεξαμενος</span></span>, this very word again) of the twelve from among the large group of disciples. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θατ θε σχριπτυρε μιγτ βε φυλφιλλεδ</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ινα η γραφη πληρωθη</span></span>). See the same clause in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:12">John 17:12</span>. Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span>. This treachery of Judas was according to the eternal counsels of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:4">John 12:4</span>), but none the less Judas is responsible for his guilt. For a like elliptical clause see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:3">John 9:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:25">John 15:25</span>. The quotation is from the Hebrew of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+41:9">Psalms 41:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>He that eateth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο τρωγων</span></span>). Present active participle of old verb to gnaw, to chew, to eat, in N.T. only in John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:54">John 6:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:56">John 6:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:57">John 6:57</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:58">John 6:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:18">John 13:18</span>) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:38">Matthew 26:38</span>. LXX has here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εσθιων</span></span>.</p>

First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαιρω</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πτερνα</span></span>, old word for heel, only here in N.T. The metaphor is that of kicking with the heel or tripping with the heel like a wrestler. It was a gross breach of hospitality to eat bread with any one and then turn against him so.
