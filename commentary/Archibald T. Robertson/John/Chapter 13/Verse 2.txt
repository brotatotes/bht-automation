<p><b> During supper </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειπνου γινομενου</span></span>). Correct text, present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span> (not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενου</span></span>, second aorist middle participle, "being ended") genitive absolute. Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:4">John 13:4</span> shows plainly that the meal was still going on.</p>
<p><b>The devil having already put </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του διαβολου ηδη βεβληκοτος</span></span>). Another genitive absolute without a connective (asyndeton), perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλω</span></span>, to cast, to put. Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:3">Luke 22:3</span>) says that Satan entered Judas when he offered to betray Jesus. Hence John's "already" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη</span></span>) is pertinent. John repeats his statement in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:27">John 13:27</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:70">John 6:70</span> Jesus a year ago had seen that Judas was a devil.</p>
<p><b>To betray him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα παραδο αυτον</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:3">Acts 5:3</span>. Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδωμ</span></span> (form in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ο</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:10">Mark 14:10</span> rather than the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:4">Luke 22:4</span>). Satan had an open door by now into the heart of Judas. </p>
