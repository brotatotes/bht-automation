<p><b> Was at the table reclining in Jesus' bosom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην ανακειμενος εν τω κολπω του Ιησου</span></span>). No word for "table" in the text. Periphrastic imperfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακειμα</span></span>, to lie back, to recline. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κολπος</span></span> usual word for bosom (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>Whom Jesus loved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον ηγαπα Ιησους</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαω</span></span>, John's description of himself of which he was proud (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:26">John 19:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:2">John 20:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:7">John 21:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:20">John 21:20</span>), identified in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:24">John 21:24</span> as the author of the book and necessarily one of the twelve because of the "explicit" (Bernard) language of Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:17">Mark 14:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:14">Luke 22:14</span>). John son of Zebedee and brother of James. At the table John was on the right of Jesus lying obliquely so that his head lay on the bosom of Jesus. The centre, the place of honour, Jesus occupied. The next place in rank was to the left of Jesus, held by Peter (Westcott) or by Judas (Bernard) which one doubts. </p>
