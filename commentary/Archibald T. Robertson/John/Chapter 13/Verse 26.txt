<p><b> He </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος</span></span>). Emphatic pronoun again.</p>
<p><b>For whom I shall dip the sop </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω εγω βαψω το ψωμιον</span></span>). Dative case of the relative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω</span></span>) and future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτω</span></span>, to dip (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:24">Luke 16:24</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ψωμιον</span></span> is a diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψωμος</span></span>, a morsel, a common <i>Koine</i> word (in the papyri often), in N.T. only in this passage. It was and is in the orient a token of intimacy to allow a guest to dip his bread in the common dish (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ru+2:14">Ruth 2:14</span>). So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:20">Mark 14:20</span>. Even Judas had asked: "Is it I?" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:19">Mark 14:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:22">Matthew 26:22</span>).</p>
<p><b>Giveth it to Judas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωσιν Ιουδα</span></span>). Unobserved by the others in spite of Christ's express language, because "it was so usual a courtesy" (Bernard), "the last appeal to Judas' better feeling" (Dods). Judas now knew that Jesus knew his plot. </p>
