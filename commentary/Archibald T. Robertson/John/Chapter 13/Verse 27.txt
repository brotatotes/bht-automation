 Then entered Satan into him  (τοτε εισηλθεν εις εκεινον ο Σατανας). The only time the word Satan occurs in the Gospel. As he had done before (John 13:2; Luke 22:3) until Christ considered him a devil (John 6:70). This is the natural outcome of one who plays with the devil.That thou doest, do quickly  (Hο ποιεις ποιησον ταχειον). Aorist active imperative of ποιεω. "Do more quickly what thou art doing." Ταχειον is comparative of ταχεως (John 11:31) and in N.T. only here, John 20:4; Hebrews 13:19; Hebrews 13:23. See the eagerness of Jesus for the passion in Luke 12:50.
