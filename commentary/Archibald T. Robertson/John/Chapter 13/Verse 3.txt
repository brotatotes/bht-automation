 Knowing  (ειδως). Repeated from verse John 13:1, accenting the full consciousness of Jesus.Had given  (εδωκεν). So Aleph B L W, aorist active instead of δεδωκεν (perfect active) of διδωμ. Cf. John 3:31 for a similar statement with εν instead of εις. See Matthew 11:27 (Luke 10:22) and John 28:18 for like claim by Jesus to complete power.And that he came forth from God, and goeth unto God  (κα οτ απο θεου εξηλθεν κα προς τον θεον υπαγε). See plain statement by Jesus on this point in John 16:28. The use of προς τον θεον recalls the same words in John 1:1. Jesus is fully conscious of his deity and Messianic dignity when he performs this humble act.
