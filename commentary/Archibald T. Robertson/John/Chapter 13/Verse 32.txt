<p><b> In himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτω</span></span>). Reflexive pronoun. God is the source of the glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>) and is the glory succeeding the Cross (the glory with the Father in heaven).</p>
<p><b>And straightway </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ευθυς</span></span>). No postponement now. First and quickly the Cross, then the Ascension. </p>
