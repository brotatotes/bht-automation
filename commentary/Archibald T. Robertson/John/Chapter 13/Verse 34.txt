<p><b> New </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινην</span></span>). First, in contrast with the old (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχαιος</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλαιος</span></span>), the very adjective used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:7">1 John 2:7</span>) of the "commandment" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντολην</span></span>) at once called old (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλαια</span></span>). They had had it a long time, but the practice of it was new. Jesus does not hesitate, like the Father, to give commandments (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:10">John 15:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:12">John 15:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>That ye love one another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα αγαπατε αλληλους</span></span>). Non-final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> with present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαω</span></span>, the object clause being in the accusative case in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντολην</span></span>. Note the present tense (linear action), "keep on loving."</p>
<p><b>Even as </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως</span></span>). The measure of our love for another is set by Christ's love for us. </p>
