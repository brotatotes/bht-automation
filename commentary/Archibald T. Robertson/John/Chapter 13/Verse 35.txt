<p><b> By this </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τουτω</span></span>). Locative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>, "In this way," viz., "if ye have love" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν αγαπην εχητε</span></span>), condition of third class (in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τουτω</span></span>) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span> ("keep on having love"). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:23">John 17:23</span> where Jesus prays for mutual love among the disciples "that the world may know" that the Father sent him. Jerome (<i>ad Galat</i>. vi. 10) says that in his extreme old age John repeated often this command of Jesus and justified it: "Because it is the Lord's commandment; and if it be fulfilled it is enough." See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:31">John 14:31</span>. Tertullian (<i>Apol</i>. 39) urges it also as proof of being disciples. Hatred of one another <i>per contra</i>, is an argument that we are <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νοτ</span></span> disciples (learners) of Jesus. </p>
