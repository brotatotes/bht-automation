<p><b> "Why can I not follow thee even now?" </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τ ου δυναμα σο ακολουθειν αρτι;</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτ</span></span> (right now, this minute) instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν</span></span> (at this time, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:36">John 13:36</span>) illustrates the impatience of Peter.</p>
<p><b>I will lay down my life for thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεν ψυχην μου υπερ σου θησω</span></span>). Future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>. Peter, like the rest, had not yet grasped the idea of the death of Christ, but, like Thomas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:16">John 11:16</span>), he is not afraid of danger. He had heard Christ's words about the good shepherd (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>) and knew that such loyalty was the mark of a good disciple. </p>
