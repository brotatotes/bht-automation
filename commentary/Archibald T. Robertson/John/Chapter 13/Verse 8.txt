<p><b> Thou shalt never wash my feet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη νιψηις μου τους ποδας εις τον αιωνα</span></span>). Strong double negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span> with first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νιπτω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον αιωνα</span></span> (for ever) added and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μου</span></span> (my) made emphatic by position. Peter's sudden humility should settle the issue, he felt.</p>
<p><b>If I wash thee not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη νιψω σε</span></span>). Third-class condition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη</span></span> (negative). Jesus picks up the challenge of Peter whose act amounted to irreverence and want of confidence. "The first condition of discipleship is self-surrender" (Westcott). So "Jesus, waiting with the basin" (Dods), concludes.</p>
<p><b>Thou hast no part with me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εχεις μερος μετ' εμου</span></span>). Not simply here at the supper with its fellowship, but in the deeper sense of mystic fellowship as Peter was quick to see. Jesus does not make foot-washing essential to spiritual fellowship, but simply tests Peter's real pride and mock-humility by this symbol of fellowship. </p>
