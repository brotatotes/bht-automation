<p><b> Let not your heart be troubled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ταρασσεσθω υμων η καρδια</span></span>). Not here the physical organ of life (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:34">Luke 21:34</span>), but the seat of spiritual life (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα, ψυχη</span></span>), the centre of feeling and faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:10">Romans 10:10</span>), "the focus of the religious life" (Vincent) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:37">Matthew 22:37</span>. See these words repeated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27">John 14:27</span>. Jesus knew what it was to have a "troubled" heart (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:33">John 11:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:31">John 13:31</span>) where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταρασσω</span></span> is used of him. Plainly the hearts of the disciples were tossed like waves in the wind by the words of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:38">John 13:38</span>.</p>
<p><b>Ye believe ... believe also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευετε ... κα πιστευετε</span></span>). So translated as present active indicative plural second person and present active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>. The form is the same. Both may be indicative (ye believe ... and ye believe), both may be imperative (believe ... and believe or believe also), the first may be indicative (ye believe) and the second imperative (believe also), the first may be imperative (keep on believing) and the second indicative (and ye do believe, this less likely). Probably both are imperatives (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:22">Mark 11:22</span>), "keep on believing in God and in me." </p>
