<p><b> Believest thou not? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου πιστευεισ;</span></span>). Jesus had a right to expect greater faith from these men than from the blind man (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:35">John 9:35</span>) or Martha (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:27">John 11:27</span>). His words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:1">John 14:1</span> are clearly needed. This oneness with the Father Jesus had already stated (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:38">John 10:38</span>) as shown by his "words" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρηματα</span></span>) and his "works" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργα</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:34">John 3:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:62">John 6:62</span>. </p>
