<p><b> Shall he do also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακεινος ποιησε</span></span>). Emphatic pronoun <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος</span></span>, "that one also."</p>
<p><b>Greater works than these </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζονα τουτων</span></span>). Comparative adjective neuter plural from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγας</span></span> with ablative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span>. Not necessarily greater miracles and not greater spiritual works in quality, but greater in quantity. Cf. Peter at Pentecost and Paul's mission tours. "Because I go" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ εγω πορευορνα</span></span>). Reason for this expansion made possible by the Holy Spirit as Paraclete (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>). </p>
