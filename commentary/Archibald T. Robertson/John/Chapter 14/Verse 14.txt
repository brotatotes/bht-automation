<p><b> If ye shall ask me anything in my name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν τ αιτησητε με εν τω ονοματ μου</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτεω</span></span>. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span> (me) here is supported by Aleph B 33 Vulgate Syriac Peshitta. Just this phrase does not occur elsewhere in John and seems awkward, but see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:23">John 16:23</span>. If it is genuine, as seems likely, here is direct prayer to Jesus taught as we see it practiced by Stephen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:59">Acts 7:59</span>; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:20">Revelation 22:20</span>. </p>
