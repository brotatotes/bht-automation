 If ye shall ask me anything in my name  (εαν τ αιτησητε με εν τω ονοματ μου). Condition of third class with εαν and first aorist active subjunctive of αιτεω. The use of με (me) here is supported by Aleph B 33 Vulgate Syriac Peshitta. Just this phrase does not occur elsewhere in John and seems awkward, but see John 16:23. If it is genuine, as seems likely, here is direct prayer to Jesus taught as we see it practiced by Stephen in Acts 7:59; and in Revelation 22:20.
