 If ye love me  (εαν αγαπατε με). Third-class condition "if ye keep on loving (present active subjunctive, same contract form as indicative) me." Cf. verse John 14:23.Ye will keep  (τηρησετε). Future active of τηρεω, not aorist imperative τηρησατε (keep) as some MSS. have. For this phrase see also John 8:51; John 14:23; John 14:24; John 14:20; 1 John 2:5. Continued love prevents disobedience.
