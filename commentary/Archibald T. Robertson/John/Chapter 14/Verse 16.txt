<p><b> And I will pray the Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καγω ερωτησω τον πατερα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ερωταω</span></span> for prayer, not question (the old use), also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:23">John 16:23</span> (prayer to Jesus in same sense as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτεω</span></span>), <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span> (by Jesus as here); <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:9">John 17:9</span> (by Jesus), "make request of."</p>
<p><b>Another Comforter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλον παρακλητον</span></span>). Another of like kind (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλον</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερον</span></span>), besides Jesus who becomes our Paraclete, Helper, Advocate, with the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>, Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span>). This old word (Demosthenes), from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλεω</span></span>, was used for legal assistant, pleader, advocate, one who pleads another's cause (Josephus, Philo, in illiterate papyrus), in N.T. only in John's writings, though the idea of it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26-34">Romans 8:26-34</span>. Cf. Deissmann, <i>Light, etc.</i>, p. 336. So the Christian has Christ as his Paraclete with the Father, the Holy Spirit as the Father's Paraclete with us (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>For ever </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον αιωνα</span></span>). This the purpose (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>) in view and thus Jesus is to be with his people here forever (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:20">Matthew 28:20</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:14">John 4:14</span> for the idiom. </p>
