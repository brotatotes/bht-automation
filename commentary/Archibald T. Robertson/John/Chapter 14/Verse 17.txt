 The Spirit of truth  (το πνευμα της αληθειας). Same phrase in John 15:27; John 16:13; 1 John 4:6, "a most exquisite title" (Bengel). The Holy Spirit is marked by it (genitive case), gives it, defends it (cf. John 1:17), in contrast to the spirit of error (1 John 4:6).Whom  (ο). Grammatical neuter gender (ο) agreeing with πνευμα (grammatical), but rightly rendered in English by "whom" and note masculine εκεινος (verse John 14:26). He is a person, not a mere influence.Cannot receive  (ου δυνατα λαβειν). Left to itself the sinful world is helpless (1 Corinthians 2:14; Romans 8:7), almost Paul's very language on this point. The world lacks spiritual insight (ου θεωρε) and spiritual knowledge (ουδε γινωσκε). It failed to recognize Jesus (John 1:10) and likewise the Holy Spirit.Ye know him  (υμεις γινωσκετε αυτο). Emphatic position of υμεις (ye) in contrast with the world (John 15:19), because they have seen Jesus the Revealer of the Father (verse John 14:9).Abides  (μενε). Timeless present tense.With you  (παρ' υμιν). "By your side," "at home with you," not merely "with you" (μεθ' υμων) "in the midst of you."In you  (εν υμιν). In your hearts. So note μετα (John 14:16), παρα, εν.
