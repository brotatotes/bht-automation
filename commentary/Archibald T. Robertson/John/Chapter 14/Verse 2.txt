<p><b> Mansions </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονα</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενω</span></span>, to abide, abiding places, in N.T. only here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:23">John 14:23</span>. There are many resting-places in the Father's house (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικια</span></span>). Christ's picture of heaven here is the most precious one that we possess. It is our heavenly home with the Father and with Jesus.</p>
<p><b>If it were not so </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δε μη</span></span>). Ellipsis of the verb (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:21">Mark 2:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:5">Revelation 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:16">Revelation 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:11">John 14:11</span>). Here a suppressed condition of the second class (determined as unfulfilled) as the conclusion shows.</p>
<p><b>I would have told you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον αν υμιν</span></span>). Regular construction for this apodosis (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and aorist--second active--indicative).</p>
<p><b>For I go </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ πορευομα</span></span>). Reason for the consolation given, futuristic present middle indicative, and explanation of his words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:33">John 13:33</span> that puzzled Peter so (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:36">John 13:36</span>).</p>
<p><b>To prepare a place for you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετοιμασα τοπον υμιν</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of purpose of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετοιμαζω</span></span>, to make ready, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετοιμος</span></span>. Here only in John, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:40">Mark 10:40</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:23">Matthew 20:23</span>). It was customary to send one forward for such a purpose (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+10:33">Numbers 10:33</span>). So Jesus had sent Peter and John to make ready (this very verb) for the passover meal (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:12">Mark 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:17">Matthew 26:17</span>). Jesus is thus our Forerunner (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προδρομος</span></span>) in heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:20">Hebrews 6:20</span>). </p>
