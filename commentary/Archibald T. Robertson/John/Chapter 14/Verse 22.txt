<p><b> Not Iscariot </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ ο Ισκαριωτης</span></span>). Judas Iscariot had gone (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:30">John 13:30</span>), but John is anxious to make it clear that this Judas (common name, two apostles also named James) was not the infamous traitor. He is also called Thaddaeus or Lebbaeus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:17">Mark 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:3">Matthew 10:3</span>) and the brother (or son) of James (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:15">John 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:13">Acts 1:13</span>). This is the fourth interruption of the talk of Jesus (by Peter, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:36">John 13:36</span>; by Thomas, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:5">John 14:5</span>; by Philip, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:8">John 14:8</span>; by Judas, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:22">John 14:22</span>).</p>
<p><b>And not to the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουχ τω κοσμω</span></span>). Judas caught at the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμφανιζω</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:21">John 14:21</span> as perhaps a Messianic theophany visible to all the world as at the judgment (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:27">John 5:27</span>). He seems to suspect a change of plan on the part of Jesus (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ γεγονεν οτ</span></span>=how has it happened that). </p>
