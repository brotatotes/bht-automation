<p><b> If a man love me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν τις αγαπα με</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and present active subjunctive, "if one keep on loving me." That is key to the spiritual manifestation (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμφανιζω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>We will come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελευσομεθα</span></span>). Future middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span> and first person plural (the Father and I), not at the judgment, but here and now.</p>
<p><b>And make our abode with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μονην παρ' αυτω ποιησομεθα</span></span>). See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:2">John 14:2</span> for the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονη</span></span> (dwelling, abiding place). If the Holy Spirit "abides" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενε</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:17">John 14:17</span>) in you, that heart becomes a temple (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναος</span></span>) of the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>), and so a fit dwelling place for the Father and the Son, a glorious and uplifting reality. </p>
