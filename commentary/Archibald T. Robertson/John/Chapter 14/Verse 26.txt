<p><b> Whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span>). Grammatical neuter, but "whom" is correct translation. The Father will send the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:49">Luke 24:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:33">Acts 2:33</span>), but so will the Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>) as Jesus breathes the Holy Spirit upon the disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:22">John 20:22</span>). There is no contradiction in this relation of the Persons in the Trinity (the Procession of the Holy Spirit). Here the Holy Spirit (full title as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:29">Mark 3:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:32">Matthew 12:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:10">Luke 12:10</span>) is identified with the Paraclete.</p>
<p><b>He </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος</span></span>). Emphatic demonstrative pronoun and masculine like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακλητος</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Shall teach you all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμας διδαξε παντα</span></span>). The Holy Spirit knows "the deep things of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10">1 Corinthians 2:10</span>) and he is our Teacher in the Dispensation of the Holy Spirit of both new truth (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:25">John 14:25</span>) and old.</p>
<p><b>Bring to your remembrance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπομνησε υμας</span></span>). Future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπομιμνησκω</span></span>, old verb to remind, to recall, here only in this Gospel (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:10">3 John 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:14">2 Timothy 2:14</span>) and with two accusatives (person and thing). After pentecost the disciples will be able better to recall and to understand what Jesus had said (how dull they had been at times) and to be open to new revelations from God (cf. Peter at Joppa and Caesarea). </p>
