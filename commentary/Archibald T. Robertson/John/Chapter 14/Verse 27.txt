<p><b> My peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρηνην την εμην</span></span>). This is Christ's bequest to the disciples before he goes, the <i>shalom</i> of the orient for greeting and parting, used by Jesus in his appearances after the resurrection (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:19">John 20:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:21">John 20:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:26">John 20:26</span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:3">2 John 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:14">3 John 1:14</span>, but here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33">John 16:33</span> in the sense of spiritual peace such as only Christ can give and which his Incarnation offers to men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:14">Luke 2:14</span>).</p>
<p><b>Neither let it be fearful </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεδη δειλιατω</span></span>). Added to the prohibition in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:1">John 14:1</span>, only N.T. example of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειλιαω</span></span> (rare word in Aristotle, in a papyrus of one condemned to death), common in LXX, like palpitating of the heart (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειλος</span></span>). </p>
