<p><b> I go away, and I come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαγω κα ερχομα</span></span>), both futuristic presents (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:33">John 7:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:3">John 14:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:18">John 14:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>If ye loved me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε ηγαπατε με</span></span>). Second-class condition with the imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαω</span></span> referring to present time, implying that the disciples are not loving Jesus as they should.</p>
<p><b>Ye would have rejoiced </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχαρητε αν</span></span>). Second aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span>, conclusion of second-class condition referring to past time, "Ye would already have rejoiced before this" at Christ's going to the Father (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:12">John 14:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>Greater than I </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζων μου</span></span>). Ablative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μου</span></span> after the comparative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζων</span></span> (from positive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγας</span></span>). The filial relation makes this necessary. Not a distinction in nature or essence (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:30">John 10:30</span>), but in rank in the Trinity. No Arianism or Unitarianism here. The very explanation here is proof of the deity of the Son (Dods). </p>
