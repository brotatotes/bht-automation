<p><b> I am the way, and the truth, and the life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω ειμ η οδος κα η αληθεια κα η ζωη</span></span>). Either of these statements is profound enough to stagger any one, but here all three together overwhelm Thomas. Jesus had called himself "the life" to Martha (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25">John 11:25</span>) and "the door" to the Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:7">John 10:7</span>) and "the light of the world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>). He spoke "the way of God in truth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:14">Mark 12:14</span>). He is the way to God and the only way (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>), the personification of truth, the centre of life.</p>
<p><b>Except by me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη δι' εμου</span></span>). There is no use for the Christian to wince at these words of Jesus. If he is really the Incarnate Son of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>, they are necessarily true. </p>
