 I am the way, and the truth, and the life  (Εγω ειμ η οδος κα η αληθεια κα η ζωη). Either of these statements is profound enough to stagger any one, but here all three together overwhelm Thomas. Jesus had called himself "the life" to Martha (John 11:25) and "the door" to the Pharisees (John 10:7) and "the light of the world" (John 8:12). He spoke "the way of God in truth" (Mark 12:14). He is the way to God and the only way (verse John 14:6), the personification of truth, the centre of life.Except by me  (ε μη δι' εμου). There is no use for the Christian to wince at these words of Jesus. If he is really the Incarnate Son of God (John 1:1; John 1:14; John 1:18, they are necessarily true.
