 If ye had known me  (ε εγνωκειτε με). Past perfect indicative of γινωσκω, to know by personal experience, in condition of second class as is made plain by the conclusion (αν ηιδετε) where οιδα, not γινωσκω is used. Thomas and the rest had not really come to know Jesus, much as they loved him.From henceforth ye know him  (απ' αρτ γινωσκετε αυτον). Probably inchoative present active indicative, "ye are beginning to know the Father from now on."And have seen him  (κα εωρακατε). Perfect active indicative of οραω. Because they had seen Jesus who is the Son of God, the Image of God, and like God (John 1:18). Hence God is like Jesus Christ. It is a bold and daring claim to deity. The only intelligible conception of God is precisely what Jesus here says. God is like Christ.
