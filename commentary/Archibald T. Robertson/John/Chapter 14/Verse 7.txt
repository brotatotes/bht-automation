<p><b> If ye had known me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε εγνωκειτε με</span></span>). Past perfect indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, to know by personal experience, in condition of second class as is made plain by the conclusion (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν ηιδετε</span></span>) where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span> is used. Thomas and the rest had not really come to know Jesus, much as they loved him.</p>
<p><b>From henceforth ye know him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' αρτ γινωσκετε αυτον</span></span>). Probably inchoative present active indicative, "ye are beginning to know the Father from now on."</p>
<p><b>And have seen him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εωρακατε</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>. Because they had seen Jesus who is the Son of God, the Image of God, and like God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>). Hence God is like Jesus Christ. It is a bold and daring claim to deity. The only intelligible conception of God is precisely what Jesus here says. God is like Christ. </p>
