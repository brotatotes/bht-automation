<p><b> The true vine </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αμπελος η αληθινη</span></span>). "The vine the genuine." Assuming that the Lord's Supper had just been instituted by Jesus the metaphor of the vine is naturally suggested by "the fruit of the vine" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:25">Mark 14:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:29">Matthew 26:29</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αμπελος</span></span> in the papyri (Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>) is sometimes used in the sense of <i>ampelon</i> (vineyard), but not so here. Jesus uses various metaphors to illustrate himself and his work (the light, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>; the door, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:7">John 10:7</span>; the shepherd, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>; the vine, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:1">John 15:1</span>). The vine was common in Palestine. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+80:8">Psalms 80:8</span>. "On the Maccabean coinage Israel was represented by a vine" (Dods). Jesus is the genuine Messianic vine.</p>
