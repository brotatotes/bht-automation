<p><b> If ye do </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ποιητε</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and the present active subjunctive, "if ye keep on doing," not just spasmodic obedience. Just a different way of saying what is in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:10">John 15:10</span>. Obedience to Christ's commands is a prerequisite to discipleship and fellowship (spiritual friendship with Christ). He repeats it in the Great Commission (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:20">Matthew 28:20</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενετειλαμην</span></span>, I commanded) with the very word used here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντελλομα</span></span>, I command). </p>
