 The world would love its own  (ο κοσμος αν το ιδιον εφιλε). Conclusion of second-class condition (determined as unfulfilled), regular idiom with αν and imperfect indicative in present time.But because ye are not of the world  (οτ δε εκ του κοσμου ουκ εστε). Definite and specific reason for the world's hatred of real Christians whose very existence is a reproach to the sinful world. Cf. John 7:7; John 17:14; 1 John 3:13. Does the world hate us? If not, why not? Has the world become more Christian or Christians more worldly?
