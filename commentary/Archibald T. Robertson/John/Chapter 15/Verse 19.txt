<p><b> The world would love its own </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κοσμος αν το ιδιον εφιλε</span></span>). Conclusion of second-class condition (determined as unfulfilled), regular idiom with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and imperfect indicative in present time.</p>
<p><b>But because ye are not of the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ δε εκ του κοσμου ουκ εστε</span></span>). Definite and specific reason for the world's hatred of real Christians whose very existence is a reproach to the sinful world. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:7">John 7:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:14">John 17:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:13">1 John 3:13</span>. Does the world hate us? If not, why not? Has the world become more Christian or Christians more worldly? </p>
