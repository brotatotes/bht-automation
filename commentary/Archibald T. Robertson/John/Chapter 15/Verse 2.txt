 Branch  (κλημα). Old word from κλαω, to break, common in LXX for offshoots of the vine, in N.T. only here (verses John 15:2-6), elsewhere in N.T. κλαδος (Mark 4:32, etc.), also from κλαω, both words meaning tender and easily broken parts.In me  (εν εμο). Two kinds of connexion with Christ as the vine (the merely cosmic which bears no fruit, the spiritual and vital which bears fruit). The fruitless (not bearing fruit, μη φερον καρπον) the vine-dresser "takes away" (αιρε) or prunes away. Probably (Bernard) Jesus here refers to Judas.Cleanseth  (καθαιρε). Present active indicative of old verb καθαιρω (clean) as in verse John 15:3, only use in N.T., common in the inscriptions for ceremonial cleansing, though καθαριζω is more frequent (Hebrews 10:2).That it may bear more fruit  (ινα καρπον πλειονα φερη). Purpose clause with ινα and present active subjunctive of φερω, "that it may keep on bearing more fruit" (more and more). A good test for modern Christians and church members.
