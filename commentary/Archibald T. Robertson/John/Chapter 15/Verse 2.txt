<p><b> Branch </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλημα</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαω</span></span>, to break, common in LXX for offshoots of the vine, in N.T. only here (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:2-6">John 15:2-6</span>), elsewhere in N.T. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαδος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:32">Mark 4:32</span>, etc.), also from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαω</span></span>, both words meaning tender and easily broken parts.</p>
<p><b>In me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εμο</span></span>). Two kinds of connexion with Christ as the vine (the merely cosmic which bears no fruit, the spiritual and vital which bears fruit). The fruitless (not bearing fruit, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη φερον καρπον</span></span>) the vine-dresser "takes away" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρε</span></span>) or prunes away. Probably (Bernard) Jesus here refers to Judas.</p>
<p><b>Cleanseth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαιρε</span></span>). Present active indicative of old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαιρω</span></span> (clean) as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:3">John 15:3</span>, only use in N.T., common in the inscriptions for ceremonial cleansing, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαριζω</span></span> is more frequent (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:2">Hebrews 10:2</span>).</p>
<p><b>That it may bear more fruit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα καρπον πλειονα φερη</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερω</span></span>, "that it may keep on bearing more fruit" (more and more). A good test for modern Christians and church members. </p>
