<p><b> Remember </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνημονευετε</span></span>). Present active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνημονευω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνημων</span></span>, in John again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:4">John 16:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:21">John 16:21</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:16">John 13:16</span> for this word.</p>
<p><b>If they persecuted me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε εμε εδιωξαν</span></span>). Condition of first class. They certainly did persecute (first aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωκω</span></span>, to chase like a wild beast like the Latin <i>persequor</i>, our "persecute") Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:16">John 5:16</span>). They will persecute those like Jesus. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33">John 16:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:30">Mark 10:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:12">Luke 21:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:12">1 Corinthians 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:9">2 Corinthians 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:29">Galatians 4:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:12">2 Timothy 3:12</span> for proof that this prophecy came true. But the alternative is true and is stated by Jesus with a like condition of the first class, "if they kept my word" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τον λογον μου ετηρησαν</span></span>). The world does praise the word of Jesus, but dreads to follow it. </p>
