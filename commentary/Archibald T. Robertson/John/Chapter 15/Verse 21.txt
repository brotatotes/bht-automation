 Unto you  (εις υμας). Like the dative υμιν (Textus Receptus) as in the papyri and modern Greek (Robertson, Grammar, p. 594).For my name's sake  (δια το ονομα μου). See verse John 15:20. See this same warning and language in Matthew 10:22; Mark 13:13; Matthew 24:9; Luke 21:17). There is little difference in meaning from ενεκεν μου (Mark 13:9; Luke 21:12). Loyalty to the name of Christ will bring persecution as they will soon know (Acts 5:41; Philippians 1:29; 1 Peter 4:14). About the world's ignorance of God see Luke 23:34; Acts 3:17; John 16:3.
