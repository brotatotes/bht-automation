<p><b> They had not had sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιαν ουκ ειχοσαν</span></span>). Conclusion of condition of second class without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> because context makes it clear (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν δε</span></span>) without it (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1013). The imperfect active indicative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-οσαν</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ον</span></span> (also in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:24">John 15:24</span>) as common in the LXX, and occurs in the papyri and the inscriptions and the Boeotian dialect.</p>
<p><b>Excuse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφασιν</span></span>). Old word (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:5">1 Thessalonians 2:5</span>) either from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφαινω</span></span>, to show forth, or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφημ</span></span>, to speak forth. Mere pretence, in John only here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:24">John 15:24</span>. </p>
