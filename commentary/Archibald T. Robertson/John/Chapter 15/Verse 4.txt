<p><b> Abide in me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεινατε εν εμο</span></span>). Constative aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενω</span></span>. The only way to continue "clean" (pruned) and to bear fruit is to maintain vital spiritual connexion with Christ (the vine). Judas is gone and Satan will sift the rest of them like wheat (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:31">Luke 22:31</span>). Blind complacency is a peril to the preacher.</p>
<p><b>Of itself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφ' εαυτου</span></span>). As source (from itself) and apart from the vine (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:17">John 17:17</span>).</p>
<p><b>Except it abide </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη μενη</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span>, negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>, and present active (keep on abiding) subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μενω</span></span>. Same condition and tense in the application, "except ye abide in me." </p>
