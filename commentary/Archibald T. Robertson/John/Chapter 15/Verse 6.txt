<p><b> He is cast forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβληθη εξω</span></span>). Timeless or gnomic use of the first aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλω</span></span> as the conclusion of a third-class condition (see also verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:4">John 15:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:7">John 15:7</span> for the same condition, only constative aorist subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεινητε</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεινη</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:7">John 15:7</span>). The apostles are thus vividly warned against presumption. Jesus as the vine will fulfil his part of the relation as long as the branches keep in vital union with him.</p>
<p><b>As a branch </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως το κλημα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>And is withered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηρανθη</span></span>). Another timeless first aorist passive indicative, this time of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξηραινω</span></span>, same timeless use in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:11">James 1:11</span> of grass, old and common verb. They gather (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγουσιν</span></span>). Plural though subject not expressed, the servants of the vine-dresser gather up the broken off branches.</p>
<p><b>Are burned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιετα</span></span>). Present passive singular of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιω</span></span>, to burn, because <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κληματα</span></span> (branches) is neuter plural. See this vivid picture also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:41">Matthew 13:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:49">Matthew 13:49</span>. </p>
