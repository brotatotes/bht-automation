 He is cast forth  (εβληθη εξω). Timeless or gnomic use of the first aorist passive indicative of βαλλω as the conclusion of a third-class condition (see also verses John 15:4; John 15:7 for the same condition, only constative aorist subjunctive μεινητε and μεινη in verse John 15:7). The apostles are thus vividly warned against presumption. Jesus as the vine will fulfil his part of the relation as long as the branches keep in vital union with him.As a branch  (ως το κλημα).And is withered  (εξηρανθη). Another timeless first aorist passive indicative, this time of ξηραινω, same timeless use in James 1:11 of grass, old and common verb. They gather (συναγουσιν). Plural though subject not expressed, the servants of the vine-dresser gather up the broken off branches.Are burned  (καιετα). Present passive singular of καιω, to burn, because κληματα (branches) is neuter plural. See this vivid picture also in Matthew 13:41; Matthew 13:49.
