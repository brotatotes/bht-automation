 Ask whatsoever ye will  (ο εαν θελητε αιτησασθε). Indefinite relative with εαν and present active subjunctive of θελω, to wish, to will, and aorist middle imperative of αιτεω, to ask. This astounding command and promise (γενησετα, future middle of γινομα, it will come to pass) is not without conditions and limitations. It involves such intimate union and harmony with Christ that nothing will be asked out of accord with the mind of Christ and so of the Father. Christ's name is mentioned in John 15:16; cf. John 14:13; John 16:23.
