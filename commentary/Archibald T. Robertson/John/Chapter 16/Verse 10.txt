<p><b> And ye behold me no more </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκετ θεωρειτε με</span></span>). With the bodily eyes and without the Holy Spirit they are unable to behold Jesus with the spiritual vision (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:19">John 14:19</span>). Without Christ they lose the sense of righteousness as is seen in the "new morals" (immorality, loose views of marriage, etc.). </p>
