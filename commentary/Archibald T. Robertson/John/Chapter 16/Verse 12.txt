<p><b> But ye cannot bear them now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ου δυνασθε βασταζειν αρτ</span></span>). The literal sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασταζω</span></span>, to bear, occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:6">John 12:6</span>. For the figurative as here see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:10">Acts 15:10</span>. The untaught cannot get the full benefit of teaching (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:1">1 Corinthians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:11-14">Hebrews 5:11-14</span>). The progressive nature of revelation is a necessity. </p>
