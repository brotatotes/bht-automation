<p><b> And ye therefore now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υμεις ουν νυν</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:38">John 8:38</span> for like emphasis on</p>
<p><b>ye </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις</span></span>). The "sorrow" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυπην</span></span>) is like that of the mother in childbirth (real, but fleeting, with permanent joy following). The metaphor points, of course, to the resurrection of Jesus which did change the grief of the disciples to gladness, once they are convinced that Jesus has risen from the dead.</p>
<p><b>But I will see you again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν δε οψομα υμας</span></span>). Future middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>, to see. In verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:16">John 16:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:19">John 16:19</span> Jesus had said "ye shall see me" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψεσθε με</span></span>), but here we have one more blessed promise, "I shall see you," showing "that we are the objects of God's regard" (Westcott).</p>
<p><b>Shall rejoice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρησετα</span></span>). Second future passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Taketh away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρε</span></span>). Present active indicative, futuristic present, but B D have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρε</span></span> the future active (shall take away). This joy is a permanent possession. </p>
