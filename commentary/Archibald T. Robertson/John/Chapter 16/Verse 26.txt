 I say not  (ου λεγω). "I speak not." Christ did pray for the disciples before his death (John 14:16; John 17:9; John 17:15; John 17:24) and he prays also for sinners (Luke 23:34; 1 John 2:1). Here it is the special love of God for disciples of Jesus (John 14:21; John 14:23; John 17:23; 1 John 4:19). Note αιτεω and ερωταω used in practically the same sense as in verse John 16:23.
