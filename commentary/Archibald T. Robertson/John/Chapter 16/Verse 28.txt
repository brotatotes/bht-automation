<p><b> I came out from the Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηλθον εκ του πατρος</span></span>). Definite act (aorist), the Incarnation, with repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> (out of), while in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:27">John 16:27</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα του πατρος εξηλθον</span></span>) with no practical distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> in resultant idea.</p>
<p><b>Am come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εληλυθα</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:37">John 18:37</span>. The Incarnation is now a permanent fact, once only a blessed hope (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:27">John 11:27</span>). His leaving the world and going to the Father does not set aside the fact of the Incarnation. Both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιημ</span></span> (I leave) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορευομα</span></span> (I go) are futuristic present indicatives. </p>
