 Cometh  (ερχετα). Futuristic present middle indicative of ερχομα.Yea, is come  (κα εληλυθεν). Explanatory use of κα and the perfect active indicative as in John 12:23. The long-looked-for hour (ωρα) is so close that it has virtually begun. The time for the arrest of Jesus is near. See also John 17:1.That  (ινα). See verse John 16:2 for this same use of ινα (not οτε) with ερχομα ωρα.Ye shall be scattered  (σκορπισθητε). First aorist passive subjunctive of σκορπιζω, used in John 10:12 of sheep scampering from the wolf. Cf. Matthew 12:30; Luke 11:33.To his own  (εις τα ιδια). "To his own home" as in John 1:11; John 19:27. So Appian VI. 23.Shall leave  (αφητε). Second aorist subjunctive of αφιημ with ινα.And yet  (κα). Clear case of κα in adversative sense, not just "and."
