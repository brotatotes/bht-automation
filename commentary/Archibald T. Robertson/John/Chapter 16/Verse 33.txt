<p><b> That in me ye may have peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα εν εμο ειρηνην εχητε</span></span>). Present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>, "that ye may keep on having peace in me," even when I am put to death, peace to be found nowhere save in me (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27">John 14:27</span>).</p>
<p><b>Be of good cheer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαρσειτε</span></span>). Imperative active from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαρσος</span></span>, courage (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:15">Acts 28:15</span>). A word for courage in the face of danger, only here in John, but see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:2">Matthew 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:22">Matthew 9:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:49">Mark 10:49</span>.</p>
<p><b>I have overcome the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω, νενικηκα τον κοσμον</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νικαω</span></span>, to be victorious, to conquer. Always of spiritual victory in the N.T. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span>. This majestic proclamation of victory over death may be compared with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετελεστα</span></span> (<b> It is finished </b>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:30">John 19:30</span> as Christ died and with Paul's <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερνικωμεν</span></span> (we are more than conquerors) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:37">Romans 8:37</span>. </p>
