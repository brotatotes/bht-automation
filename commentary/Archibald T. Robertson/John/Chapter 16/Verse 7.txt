<p><b> It is expedient for you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφερε υμιν</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφερω</span></span>, old verb to bear together. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:50">John 11:50</span> where the phrase is used by Caiaphas "for us," here "for you" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν</span></span> ethical dative).</p>
<p><b>That I go away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα εγω απελθω</span></span>). Subject clause the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφερε</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απερχομα</span></span>. The reason (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>) for this startling statement follows.</p>
<p><b>If I go not away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη απελθω</span></span>). Third-class condition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and the negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απελθω</span></span> as before.</p>
<p><b>Will not come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη ελθη</span></span>). Strong double negative with second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>. The Holy Spirit was, of course, already at work in the hearts of men, but not in the sense of witnessing as Paraclete which could only take place after Jesus had gone back to the Father.</p>
<p><b>But if I go </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν δε πορευθω</span></span>). Third-class condition again (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορευομα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>I will send </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεμψω</span></span>). First person future as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:15">John 16:15</span>. </p>
