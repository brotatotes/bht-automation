<p><b> And he </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εκεινος</span></span>). Emphatic demonstrative masculine pronoun.</p>
<p><b>When he is come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελθων</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, "having come" or "coming."</p>
<p><b>Will convict the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγξε τον κοσμον</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγχω</span></span>, old word for confuting, convicting by proof already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:29">John 3:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:46">John 8:46</span>. Jesus had been doing this (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:7">John 7:7</span>), but this is pre-eminently the work of the Holy Spirit and the most needed task today for our complacent age.</p>
<p><b>In respect of sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ αμαρτιας</span></span>). Concerning the reality of sin as missing the mark and as wronging God and man, and not a mere slip or animal instinct or devoid of moral responsibility or evil. Some scientists and psychologists (Freudians and behaviourists) seem bent on destroying man's sense of sin. Hence crime waves even in youth.</p>
<p><b>And of righteousness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα περ δικαιοσυνης</span></span>). The opposite of "sin" and to be yearned for after conviction. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:19-3">Romans 1:19-3</span> about the necessity of the God-kind of righteousness and the Sermon on the Mount for Christ's idea of righteousness.</p>
<p><b>And of judgment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα περ κρισεως</span></span>). As certain to come as condemnation because of sin and the lack of righteousness. These are not played out motives in human life, but basal. For this ministry we have the help of the Paraclete. The Paraclete is here spoken of "not as man's advocate with God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>), but as Christ's advocate with the world" (Bernard). </p>
