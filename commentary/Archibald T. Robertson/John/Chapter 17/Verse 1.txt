<p><b> Lifting up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαρας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαιρω</span></span>, old and common verb with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφθαλμους</span></span> (eyes) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:35">John 4:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:5">John 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:41">John 11:41</span>.</p>
<p><b>Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πατερ</span></span>). Vocative form as in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:11">John 17:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:41">John 11:41</span>, Christ's usual way of beginning his prayers. It is inconceivable that this real <i>Lord's Prayer</i> is the free composition of a disciple put into the mouth of Jesus. It is rather "the tenacious memory of an old man recalling the greatest days of his life" (Bernard), aided by the Holy Spirit promised for this very purpose (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:13">John 16:13</span>). Jesus had the habit of prayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:35">Mark 1:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:46">Mark 6:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:21">Luke 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:16">Luke 5:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:12">Luke 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:18">Luke 9:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:28">Luke 9:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:22">Luke 11:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:42">Luke 11:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:34">Luke 23:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:46">Luke 23:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:41">John 11:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:27">John 12:27</span>). He prayed here for himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1-5">John 17:1-5</span>), for the disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:6-19">John 17:6-19</span>), for all believers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:20-26">John 17:20-26</span>). The prayer is similar in spirit to the Model Prayer for us in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:9-13">Matthew 6:9-13</span>. The hour for his glorification has come as he had already told the disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:31">John 13:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:23">John 12:23</span>).</p>
<p><b>Glorify thy Son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξασον σου τον υιον</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαζω</span></span>, the only personal petition in this prayer. Jesus had already used this word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαζω</span></span> for his death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:31">John 13:31</span>). Here it carries us into the very depths of Christ's own consciousness. It is not merely for strength to meet the Cross, but for the power to glorify the Father by his death and resurrection and ascension, "that the Son may glorify thee" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ο υιος δοξαση σε</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist active subjunctive. </p>
