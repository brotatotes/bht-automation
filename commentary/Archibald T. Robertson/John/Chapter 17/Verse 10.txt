 Are  (εστιν). Singular number in the Greek (is), not the plural εισιν (are), emphasizing the unity of the whole as in John 16:15. "This no creature can say in reference to God" (Luther).I am glorified in them  (δεδοξασμα εν αυτοις). "I stand glorified (perfect passive indicative of δοξαζω) in the disciples" (εν αυτοις), in spite of all their shortcomings and failings. There is comfort for us in this.
