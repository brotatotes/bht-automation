<p><b> Are </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span>). Singular number in the Greek (is), not the plural <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισιν</span></span> (are), emphasizing the unity of the whole as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:15">John 16:15</span>. "This no creature can say in reference to God" (Luther).</p>
<p><b>I am glorified in them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεδοξασμα εν αυτοις</span></span>). "I stand glorified (perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαζω</span></span>) in the disciples" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτοις</span></span>), in spite of all their shortcomings and failings. There is comfort for us in this. </p>
