 And these  (κα ουτο or αυτο, they). Note adversative use of κα (= but these).I come  (ερεομα). Futuristic present, "I am coming." Cf. John 13:3; John 14:12; John 17:13. Christ will no longer be visibly present to the world, but he will be with the believers through the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:20).Holy Father  (πατερ αγιε). Only here in the N.T., but see 1 John 2:20; Luke 1:49 for the holiness of God, a thoroughly Jewish conception. See John 6:69 where Peter calls Jesus ο αγιος του θεου. For the word applied to saints see Acts 9:13. See verse John 17:25 for πατηρ δικαιε (Righteous Father).Keep them  (τηρησον αυτους). First aorist (constative) active imperative of τηρεω, as now specially needing the Father's care with Jesus gone (urgency of the aorist tense in prayer).Which  (ω). Locative case of the neuter relative singular, attracted from the accusative ο to the case of the antecedent ονοματ (name).That they may be one  (ινα ωσιν εν). Purpose clause with ινα and the present active subjunctive of ειμ (that they may keep on being). Oneness of will and spirit (εν, neuter singular), not one person (εις, masculine singular) for which Christ does not pray. Each time Jesus uses εν (verses John 17:11; John 17:21; John 17:22) and once, εις εν, "into one" (verse John 17:23). This is Christ's prayer for all believers, for unity, not for organic union of which we hear so much. The disciples had union, but lacked unity or oneness of spirit as was shown this very evening at the supper (Luke 22:24; John 13:4-15). Jesus offers the unity in the Trinity (three persons, but one God) as the model for believers. The witness of the disciples will fail without harmony (John 17:21).
