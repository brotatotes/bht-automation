<p><b> And these </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουτο</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτο</span></span>, they). Note adversative use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> (= but these).</p>
<p><b>I come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερεομα</span></span>). Futuristic present, "I am coming." Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:3">John 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:12">John 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:13">John 17:13</span>. Christ will no longer be visibly present to the world, but he will be with the believers through the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:20">Matthew 28:20</span>).</p>
<p><b>Holy Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατερ αγιε</span></span>). Only here in the N.T., but see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:20">1 John 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:49">Luke 1:49</span> for the holiness of God, a thoroughly Jewish conception. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:69">John 6:69</span> where Peter calls Jesus <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αγιος του θεου</span></span>. For the word applied to saints see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:13">Acts 9:13</span>. See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:25">John 17:25</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατηρ δικαιε</span></span> (Righteous Father).</p>
<p><b>Keep them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρησον αυτους</span></span>). First aorist (constative) active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τηρεω</span></span>, as now specially needing the Father's care with Jesus gone (urgency of the aorist tense in prayer).</p>
<p><b>Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω</span></span>). Locative case of the neuter relative singular, attracted from the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> to the case of the antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονοματ</span></span> (name).</p>
<p><b>That they may be one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ωσιν εν</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span> (that they may keep on being). Oneness of will and spirit (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>, neuter singular), not one person (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>, masculine singular) for which Christ does not pray. Each time Jesus uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:11">John 17:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21">John 17:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:22">John 17:22</span>) and once, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις εν</span></span>, "into one" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:23">John 17:23</span>). This is Christ's prayer for all believers, for unity, not for organic union of which we hear so much. The disciples had union, but lacked unity or oneness of spirit as was shown this very evening at the supper (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:24">Luke 22:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:4-15">John 13:4-15</span>). Jesus offers the unity in the Trinity (three persons, but one God) as the model for believers. The witness of the disciples will fail without harmony (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21">John 17:21</span>). </p>
