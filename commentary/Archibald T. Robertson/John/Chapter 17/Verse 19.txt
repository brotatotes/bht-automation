<p><b> I sanctify myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω αγιαζω εμαυτον</span></span>). To his holy ministry to which the Father "sanctified" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγιασεν</span></span>) him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:36">John 10:36</span>).</p>
<p><b>That they themselves also may be sanctified in truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ωσιν κα αυτο ηγιασμενο εν αληθεια</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the periphrastic perfect passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιαζω</span></span> (that they may remain sanctified). The act of Christ helps us, but by no means takes the place of personal consecration on the part of the believer. This high and holy prayer and act of Christ should shame any one who uses the livery of heaven to serve the devil in as does, alas, sometimes happen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:13-15">2 Corinthians 11:13-15</span>). </p>
