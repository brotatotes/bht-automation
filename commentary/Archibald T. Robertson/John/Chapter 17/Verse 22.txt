 And the glory  (καγω την δοξαν). Literally, "And I the glory," with emphasis on "I." It is the glory of the Incarnate Word (Bernard), cf. John 1:14; John 2:11, not the glory of the Eternal Word mentioned in John 17:24. Bengel says: Quanta majestas Christianorum! Then verse John 17:22 repeats the unity prayed for in verse John 17:21.
