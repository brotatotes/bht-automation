 I will  (θελω). Perfect identity of his will with that of the Father in "this moment of spiritual exaltation" (Bernard), though in Gethsemane Jesus distinguishes between his human will and that of the Father (Mark 14:36).Where I am  (οπου ειμ εγω). That is heaven, to be with Jesus (John 12:26; John 13:36; John 14:3; Romans 8:17; 2 Timothy 2:11).That they may behold  (ινα θεωρωσιν). Another purpose clause with ινα and the present active subjunctive of θεωρεω, "that they may keep on beholding," the endless joy of seeing Jesus "as he is" (1 John 3:2) in heaven.Before the foundation of the world  (προ καταβολης κοσμου). This same phrase in Ephesians 1:4; 1 Peter 1:20 and six other times we have καταβολη κοσμου (Matthew 25:34; Luke 11:50; Hebrews 4:3; Hebrews 9:26; Revelation 13:8; Revelation 17:8). Here we find the same pre-incarnate consciousness of Christ seen in John 17:5.
