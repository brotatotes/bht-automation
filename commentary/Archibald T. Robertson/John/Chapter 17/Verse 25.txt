<p><b> O righteous Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πατηρ δικαιε</span></span>). Nominative form with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατηρ</span></span> used as vocative (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:28">John 20:28</span>), but vocative form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιε</span></span>. Then the righteousness of God is appealed to like God's holiness in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:11">John 17:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>The world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο κοσμος</span></span>). The translations usually slur over the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> as untranslatable in English. Westcott suggests "while" as a sort of correlative. It is quite possible that here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> is almost concessive like "though" and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>=yet: "though the world did not know thee, yet I knew thee, and these knew thee." See Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1182 for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και--δε--κα</span></span> and various other uses of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> in John's Gospel. </p>
