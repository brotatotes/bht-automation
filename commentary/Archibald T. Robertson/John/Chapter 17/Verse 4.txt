<p><b> I glorified thee on the earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω σε εδοξασα επ της γης</span></span>). Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span> is parenthetical and so verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:4">John 17:4</span> goes on after verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>. He had prayed for further glorification.</p>
<p><b>Having accomplished </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειωσας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειοω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειος</span></span> (perfect).

That was Christ's "food" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βρωμα</span></span>) and joy. Now as he faces death he has no sense of failure as some modern critics say, but rather fulness of attainment as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:30">John 19:30</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετελεστα</span></span>). Christ does not die as a disappointed man, but as the successful messenger, apostle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστειλας</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>) of the Father to men.</p>
<p><b>Thou hast given </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεδωκας</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>, regarded as a permanent task. </p>
