 I glorified thee on the earth  (εγω σε εδοξασα επ της γης). Verse John 17:3 is parenthetical and so verse John 17:4 goes on after verse John 17:2. He had prayed for further glorification.Having accomplished  (τελειωσας). First aorist active participle of τελειοω, old verb from τελειος (perfect). Used in John 4:34 by Jesus with το εργον as here. That was Christ's "food" (βρωμα) and joy. Now as he faces death he has no sense of failure as some modern critics say, but rather fulness of attainment as in John 19:30 (τετελεστα). Christ does not die as a disappointed man, but as the successful messenger, apostle (απεστειλας, verse John 17:3) of the Father to men.Thou hast given  (δεδωκας). Perfect active indicative of διδωμ, regarded as a permanent task.
