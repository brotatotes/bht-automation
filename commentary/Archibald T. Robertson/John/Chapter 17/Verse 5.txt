<p><b> With thine own self </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα σεαυτω</span></span>). "By the side of thyself." Jesus prays for full restoration to the pre-incarnate glory and fellowship (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>) enjoyed before the Incarnation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>). This is not just ideal pre-existence, but actual and conscious existence at the Father's side (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα σο</span></span>, with thee) "which I had" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ειχον</span></span>, imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>, I used to have, with attraction of case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span> because of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξη</span></span>), "before the world was" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ του τον κοσμον εινα</span></span>), "before the being as to the world" (cf. verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span>). It is small wonder that those who deny or reject the deity of Jesus Christ have trouble with the Johannine authorship of this book and with the genuineness of these words. But even Harnack admits that the words here and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span> are "undoubtedly the reflection of the certainty with which Jesus himself spoke" (<i>What Is Christianity</i>, Engl. Tr., p. 132). But Paul, as clearly as John, believes in the actual pre-existence and deity of Jesus Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:5-11">Philippians 2:5-11</span>). </p>
