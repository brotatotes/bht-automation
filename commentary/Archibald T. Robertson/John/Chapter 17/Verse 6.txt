 I manifested  (εφανερωσα). First aorist active indicative of φανεροω (from φανερος, manifest). Another word for claiming successful accomplishment of his task as in verse John 17:4 with εδοξασα and in verse John 17:26 with εγνωρισα.Whom  (ους). Accusative case after εδωκας, not attracted to case of antecedent (ανθρωποις). Jesus regards the apostles as the Father's gift to him. Recall the night of prayer before he chose them.They have kept  (τετηρηκαν). Perfect active indicative, late Koine form for the third plural instead of the usual τετηρηκασιν. Jesus claims loyalty and fidelity in these men with the one exception of Judas (verse John 17:12). He does not claim perfection for them, but they have at least held on to the message of the Father in spite of doubt and wavering (John 6:67-71; Matthew 16:15-20).
