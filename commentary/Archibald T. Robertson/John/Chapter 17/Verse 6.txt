<p><b> I manifested </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφανερωσα</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανεροω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανερος</span></span>, manifest). Another word for claiming successful accomplishment of his task as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:4">John 17:4</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοξασα</span></span> and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:26">John 17:26</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγνωρισα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ους</span></span>). Accusative case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκας</span></span>, not attracted to case of antecedent (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωποις</span></span>). Jesus regards the apostles as the Father's gift to him. Recall the night of prayer before he chose them.</p>
<p><b>They have kept </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετηρηκαν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative, late <i>Koine</i> form for the third plural instead of the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετηρηκασιν</span></span>. Jesus claims loyalty and fidelity in these men with the one exception of Judas (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:12">John 17:12</span>). He does not claim perfection for them, but they have at least held on to the message of the Father in spite of doubt and wavering (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:67-71">John 6:67-71</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:15-20">Matthew 16:15-20</span>). </p>
