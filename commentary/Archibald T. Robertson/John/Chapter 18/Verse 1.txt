Literally, "of the Cedars," "Brook of the Cedars." Only here in N.T. So 2 Samuel 15:23. Textus Receptus like Josephus (Ant. VIII, 1, 5) has the singular του Κεδρων (indeclinable). As a matter of fact it was always dry save after a heavy rain.A garden  (κηπος). Old word, in N.T. only here, verse John 18:26; John 19:41 (Joseph's); Luke 13:19.
