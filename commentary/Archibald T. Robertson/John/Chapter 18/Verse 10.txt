<p><b> Having a sword </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχων μαχαιραν</span></span>). It was unlawful to carry a weapon on a feast-day, but Peter had become alarmed at Christ's words about his peril. They had two swords or knives in the possession of the eleven according to Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+22:38">John 22:38</span>). After the treacherous kiss of Judas (on the hand or the cheek?) the disciples asked: "Lord, shall we smite with the sword?" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:49">Luke 22:49</span>). Apparently before Jesus could answer Peter with his usual impulsiveness jerked out (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειλκυσεν</span></span>, first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελκυω</span></span> for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44">John 6:44</span>) his sword and cut off the right ear of Malchus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:10">John 18:10</span>), a servant of the high priest. Peter missed the man's head as he swerved to his left. Luke also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:50">Luke 22:50</span>) mentions the detail of the right ear, but John alone mentions the man's name and Peter's. There was peril to Peter in his rash act as comes out later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:26">John 18:26</span>), but he was dead long before John wrote his Gospel as was Lazarus of whom John could also safely write (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:9-11">John 12:9-11</span>).
