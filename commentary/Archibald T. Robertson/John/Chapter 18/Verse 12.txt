<p><b> The chief captain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο χιλιαρχος</span></span>). They actually had the Roman commander of the cohort along (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:31">Acts 21:31</span>), not mentioned before.</p>
<p><b>Seized </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνελαβον</span></span>). Second aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συλλαμβανω</span></span>, old verb to grasp together, to arrest (technical word) in the Synoptics in this context (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:48">Mark 14:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:55">Matthew 26:55</span>), here alone in John.</p>
<p><b>Bound </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδησαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεω</span></span>, to bind. As a matter of course, with the hands behind his back, but with no warrant in law and with no charge against him.</p>
<p><b>To Annas first </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς Ανναν πρωτον</span></span>). Ex-high priest and father-in-law (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πενθερος</span></span>, old word, only here in N.T.) of Caiaphas the actual high priest. Then Jesus was subjected to a preliminary and superfluous inquiry by Annas (given only by John) while the Sanhedrin were gathering before Caiaphas. Bernard curiously thinks that the night trial actually took place here before Annas and only the early morning ratification was before Caiaphas. So he calmly says that "Matthew inserts the name <i>Caiaphas</i> at this point (the night trial) in which he seems to have been mistaken." But why "mistaken"?</p>
<p><b>That year </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ενιαυτου εκεινου</span></span>). Genitive of time. </p>
