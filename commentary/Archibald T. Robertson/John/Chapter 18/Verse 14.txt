 He which gave command  (ο συμβουλευσας). First aorist active articular participle of συμβουλευω, old verb (Matthew 26:4). The reference is to John 11:50.It was expedient  (συμφερε). Present active indicative retained in indirect assertion after secondary tense (ην, was). Here we have the second aorist active infinitive αποθανειν as the subject of συμφερε, both good idioms in the Koine.
