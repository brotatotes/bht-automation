<p><b> Followed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκολουθε</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακολουθεω</span></span>, "was following," picturesque and vivid tense, with associative instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω Ιησου</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Another disciple </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλος μαθητης</span></span>). Correct text without article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> (genuine in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:16">John 18:16</span>). Peter's companion was the Beloved Disciple, the author of the book (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:24">John 21:24</span>).</p>
<p><b>Was known unto the high priest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην γνωστος τω αρχιερε</span></span>). Verbal adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, to know (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:19">Acts 1:19</span>) with dative case. How well known the word does not say, not necessarily a personal friend, well enough known for the portress to admit John. "The account of what happened to Peter might well seem to be told from the point of view of the servants' hall" (Sanday, <i>Criticism of the Fourth Gospel</i>, p. 101).</p>
<p><b>Entered in with Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεισηλθεν τω Ιησου</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of the double compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεισερχομα</span></span>, old verb, in N.T. here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:22">John 6:22</span>. With associative instrumental case.</p>
<p><b>Into the court </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την αυλην</span></span>). It is not clear that this word ever means the palace itself instead of the courtyard (uncovered enclosure) as always in the papyri (very common). Clearly courtyard in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:66">Mark 14:66</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:69">Matthew 26:69</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:55">Luke 22:55</span>). Apparently Annas had rooms in the official residence of Caiaphas. </p>
