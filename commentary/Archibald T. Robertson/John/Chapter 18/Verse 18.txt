Old word, in LXX, only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:9">John 21:9</span> in N.T. A heap of burning coals (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθραξ</span></span>, coal). Cf. our "anthracite." It was cold (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχος ην</span></span>).

<p><b>Were warming themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθερμαινοντο</span></span>). Direct middle imperfect indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θερμαινω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θερμος</span></span>).
