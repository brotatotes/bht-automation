<p><b> Resorted thither </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνηχθη εκε</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγω</span></span>, old verb to gather together. A bit awkward here till you add "with his disciples." Judas knew the place, and the habit of Jesus to come here at night for prayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:39">Luke 22:39</span>). Hence his offer to catch Jesus while the feast was going on, catch him at night and alone in his usual place of prayer (the very spirit of the devil). </p>
