<p><b>Struck Jesus with his hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκεν ραπισμα τω Ιησου</span></span>). Late word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραπισμα</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραπιζω</span></span>, to smite with a rod or with the palm of the hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:67">Matthew 26:67</span>). It occurs only three times in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:65">Mark 14:65</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:22">John 18:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:3">John 19:3</span>), in each of which it is uncertain whether the blow is with a rod or with the palm of the hand (probably this, a most insulting act). The papyri throw no real light on it. "He gave Jesus a slap in the face." Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:20">2 Corinthians 11:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>So </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως</span></span>). As Jesus had done in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:21">John 18:21</span>, a dignified protest in fact by Jesus. </p>
