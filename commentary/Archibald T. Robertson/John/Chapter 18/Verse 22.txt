Perfect active (intransitive) participle of παριστημ (transitive), to place beside. One of the temple police who felt his importance as protector of Annas.Struck Jesus with his hand  (εδωκεν ραπισμα τω Ιησου). Late word ραπισμα is from ραπιζω, to smite with a rod or with the palm of the hand (Matthew 26:67). It occurs only three times in the N.T. (Mark 14:65; John 18:22; John 19:3), in each of which it is uncertain whether the blow is with a rod or with the palm of the hand (probably this, a most insulting act). The papyri throw no real light on it. "He gave Jesus a slap in the face." Cf. 2 Corinthians 11:20.So  (ουτως). As Jesus had done in verse John 18:21, a dignified protest in fact by Jesus.
