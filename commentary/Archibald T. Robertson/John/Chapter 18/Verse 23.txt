<p><b> If I have spoken evil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε κακως ελαλησα</span></span>). Condition of first class (assumed to be true), with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and aorist active indicative. Jesus had not spoken evilly towards Annas, though he did not here turn the other cheek, one may note. For the sake of argument, Jesus puts it as if he did speak evilly. Then prove it, that is all.</p>
<p><b>Bear witness of the evil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρησον περ του κακου</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρεω</span></span>, to testify. This is the conclusion (apodosis). Jesus is clearly entitled to proof of such a charge if there is any.</p>
<p><b>But if well </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δε καλως</span></span>). Supply the same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλησα</span></span>. The same condition, but with a challenging question as the apodosis.</p>
<p><b>Smitest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δερεις</span></span>). Old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δερω</span></span>, to flay, to skin, to beat, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:35">Matthew 21:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:63">Luke 22:63</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:20">2 Corinthians 11:20</span> (of an insulting blow in the face as here). </p>
