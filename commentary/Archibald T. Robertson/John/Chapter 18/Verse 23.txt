 If I have spoken evil  (ε κακως ελαλησα). Condition of first class (assumed to be true), with ε and aorist active indicative. Jesus had not spoken evilly towards Annas, though he did not here turn the other cheek, one may note. For the sake of argument, Jesus puts it as if he did speak evilly. Then prove it, that is all.Bear witness of the evil  (μαρτυρησον περ του κακου). First aorist active imperative of μαρτυρεω, to testify. This is the conclusion (apodosis). Jesus is clearly entitled to proof of such a charge if there is any.But if well  (ε δε καλως). Supply the same verb ελαλησα. The same condition, but with a challenging question as the apodosis.Smitest  (δερεις). Old verb δερω, to flay, to skin, to beat, as in Matthew 21:35; Luke 22:63; 2 Corinthians 11:20 (of an insulting blow in the face as here).
