<p><b> Was standing and warming himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην εστως κα θερμαινομενος</span></span>). Two periphrastic imperfects precisely as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:18">John 18:18</span>, vivid renewal of the picture drawn there. John alone gives the examination of Jesus by Annas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:19-24">John 18:19-24</span>) which he places between the first and the second denials by Peter. Each of the Four Gospels gives three denials, but it is not possible to make a clear parallel as probably several people joined in each time. This time there was an hour's interval (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:59">Luke 22:59</span>). The question and answer are almost identical with verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:17">John 18:17</span> and "put in a form which almost <i>suggested</i> that Peter should say 'No'" (Bernard), a favourite device of the devil in making temptation attractive. </p>
