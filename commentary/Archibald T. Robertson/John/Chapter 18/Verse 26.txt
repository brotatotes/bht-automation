 Did not I see thee in the garden with him?  (ουκ εγω σε ειδον εν τω κηπω μετ' αυτου;). This staggering and sudden thrust expects an affirmative answer by the use of ουκ, not μη as in verses John 18:17; John 18:25, but Peter's previous denials with the knowledge that he was observed by a kinsman of Malchus whom he had tried to kill (verse John 18:10) drove him to the third flat denial that he knew Jesus, this time with cursing and swearing (Mark 14:71; Matthew 26:73). Peter was in dire peril now of arrest himself for attempt to kill.Straightway  (ευθεως). As in Matthew 26:74 while Luke has παραχρημα (Luke 22:60). Mark (Mark 14:68; Mark 14:72) speaks of two crowings as often happens when one cock crows. See Matthew 26:34 for αλεκτωρ (cock). That was usually the close of the third watch of the night (Mark 13:35), about 3 A.M. Luke (Luke 22:61) notes that Jesus turned and looked on Peter probably as he passed from the rooms of Annas to the trial before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin (the ecclesiastical court).
