<p><b> Did not I see thee in the garden with him? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εγω σε ειδον εν τω κηπω μετ' αυτου;</span></span>). This staggering and sudden thrust expects an affirmative answer by the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> as in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:17">John 18:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:25">John 18:25</span>, but Peter's previous denials with the knowledge that he was observed by a kinsman of Malchus whom he had tried to kill (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:10">John 18:10</span>) drove him to the third flat denial that he knew Jesus, this time with cursing and swearing (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:71">Mark 14:71</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:73">Matthew 26:73</span>). Peter was in dire peril now of arrest himself for attempt to kill.</p>
<p><b>Straightway </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευθεως</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:74">Matthew 26:74</span> while Luke has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραχρημα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:60">Luke 22:60</span>). Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:68">Mark 14:68</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:72">Mark 14:72</span>) speaks of two crowings as often happens when one cock crows. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:34">Matthew 26:34</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλεκτωρ</span></span> (cock). That was usually the close of the third watch of the night (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:35">Mark 13:35</span>), about 3 A.M. Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:61">Luke 22:61</span>) notes that Jesus turned and looked on Peter probably as he passed from the rooms of Annas to the trial before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin (the ecclesiastical court).
