<p><b> They lead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγουσιν</span></span>). Dramatic historical present of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγω</span></span>, plural "they" for the Sanhedrists (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:1">Luke 23:1</span>). John gives no details of the trial before the Sanhedrin (only the fact, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:24">John 18:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:28">John 18:28</span>) when Caiaphas presided, either the informal meeting at night (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:53">Mark 14:53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:55-65">Mark 14:55-65</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:57">Matthew 26:57</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:59-68">Matthew 26:59-68</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:54">Luke 22:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:63-65">Luke 22:63-65</span>) or the formal ratification meeting after dawn (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:1">Mark 15:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:1">Matthew 27:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:66-71">Luke 22:66-71</span>), but he gives much new material of the trial before Pilate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:28-38">John 18:28-38</span>).</p>
<p><b>Into the palace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το πραιτωριον</span></span>). For the history and meaning of this interesting Latin word, <i>praetorium</i>, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:27">Matthew 27:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:35">Acts 23:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:13">Philippians 1:13</span>. Here it is probably the magnificent palace in Jerusalem built by Herod the Great for himself and occupied by the Roman Procurator (governor) when in the city. There was also one in Caesarea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:35">Acts 23:35</span>). Herod's palace in Jerusalem was on the Hill of Zion in the western part of the upper city. There is something to be said for the Castle of Antonia, north of the temple area, as the location of Pilate's residence in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><b>Early </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρω</span></span>). Technically the fourth watch (3 A.M. to 6 A.M.). There were two violations of Jewish legal procedure (holding the trial for a capital case at night, passing condemnation on the same day of the trial). Besides, the Sanhedrin no longer had the power of death. A Roman court could meet any time after sunrise. John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:14">John 19:14</span>) says it was "about the sixth hour" when Pilate condemned Jesus.</p>
<p><b>That they might not be defiled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη μιανθωσιν</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη</span></span> and first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιαινω</span></span>, to stain, to defile. For Jewish scruples about entering the house of a Gentile see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:28">Acts 10:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:3">Acts 11:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>But might eat the passover </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα φαγωσιν το πασχα</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive of the defective verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσθιω</span></span>, to eat. This phrase may mean to eat the passover meal as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:17">Matthew 27:17</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:12">Mark 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:14">Mark 14:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:11">Luke 22:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:15">Luke 22:15</span>), but it does not have to mean that. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+30:22">2 Chronicles 30:22</span> we read: "And they did eat the festival seven days" when the paschal festival is meant, not the paschal lamb or the paschal supper. There are eight other examples of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασχα</span></span> in John's Gospel and in all of them the feast is meant, not the supper. If we follow John's use of the word, it is the feast here, not the meal of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:2">John 13:2</span> which was the regular passover meal. This interpretation keeps John in harmony with the Synoptics. </p>
