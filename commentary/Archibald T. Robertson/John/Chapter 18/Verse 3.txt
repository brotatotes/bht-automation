<p><b> The band of soldiers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την σπειραν</span></span>). No word for "of soldiers" in the Greek, but the Latin <i>spira</i> (roll or ball) was used for a military cohort (Polybius 11, 23, 1) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:27">Matthew 27:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1">Acts 10:1</span>, etc., here for a small band secured from the Tower of Antonia. The Synoptics do not mention the soldiers, but only the "officers" as here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπηρετας</span></span> for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:58">Matthew 26:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:54">Mark 14:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:65">Mark 14:65</span>) or temple police from the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p><b>Cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχετα</span></span>). Dramatic historical present middle indicative.</p>
<p><b>With lanterns and torches </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα φανων κα λαμπαδων</span></span>). Both old words, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανος</span></span> only here in N.T., <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμπας</span></span>, an oil lamp (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:1">Matthew 25:1</span>). It was full moon, but Judas took no chances for it may have been cloudy and there were dark places by the walls and under the olive trees. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μετα</span></span> is accompanied with</p>
<p><b>and weapons </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα οπλων</span></span>). Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:43">Mark 14:43</span>) mentions "swords and staves." Probably the temple guard had weapons as well as the soldiers. </p>
