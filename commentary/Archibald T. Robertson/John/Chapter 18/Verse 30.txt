<p><b> If this man were not an evil-doer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη ην ουτος κακον ποιων</span></span>). Condition (negative) of second class (periphrastic imperfect indicative), assumed to be untrue, with the usual apodosis (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and aorist indicative, first aorist plural with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κ</span></span>). This is a pious pose of infallibility not in the Synoptics. They then proceeded to make the charges (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:2">Luke 23:2</span>) as indeed John implies (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:31">John 18:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:33">John 18:33</span>). Some MSS. here read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακοποιος</span></span> (malefactor) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:12">1 Peter 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:14">1 Peter 2:14</span>, with which compare Luke's <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακουργος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+23:32">John 23:32</span>; so also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:9">2 Timothy 2:9</span>), both meaning evil-doer. Here the periphrastic present participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιων</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακον</span></span> emphasizes the idea that Jesus was a habitual evil-doer (Abbott). It was an insolent reply to Pilate (Bernard). </p>
