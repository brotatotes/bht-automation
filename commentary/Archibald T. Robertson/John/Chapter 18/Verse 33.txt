<p><b> Again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν</span></span>). Back into the palace where Pilate was before.</p>
<p><b>Called </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφωνησεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνεω</span></span>. Jesus was already inside the court (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:28">John 18:28</span>). Pilate now summoned him to his presence since he saw that he had to handle the case. The charge that Jesus claimed to be a king compelled him to do so (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:2">Luke 23:2</span>).</p>
<p><b>Art thou the King of the Jews? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ ε ο βασιλευς των Ιουδαιων;</span></span>). This was the vital problem and each of the Gospels has the question (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:2">Mark 15:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:1">Matthew 27:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:3">Luke 23:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:33">John 18:33</span>), though Luke alone (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+23:2">John 23:2</span>) gives the specific accusation.</p>
<p><b>Thou </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ</span></span>). Emphatic. Jesus did claim to be the spiritual king of Israel as Nathanael said (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:49">John 1:49</span>) and as the ecstatic crowd hailed him on the Triumphal Entry (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:13">John 12:13</span>), but the Sanhedrin wish Pilate to understand this in a civil sense as a rival of Caesar as some of the Jews wanted Jesus to be (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:15">John 6:15</span>) and as the Pharisees expected the Messiah to be. </p>
