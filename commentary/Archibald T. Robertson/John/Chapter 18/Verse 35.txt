<p><b> Am I a Jew? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητ εγω Ιουδαιος ειμι;</span></span>). Proud and fine scorn on Pilate's part at the idea that he had a personal interest in the question. Vehement negation implied. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:29">John 4:29</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητ</span></span> in a question. The gulf between Jew and Gentile yawns wide here.</p>
<p><b>Nation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθνος</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:48-52">John 11:48-52</span>, rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαος</span></span>, while both in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:50">John 11:50</span>). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδωκαν</span></span> see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:30">John 18:30</span>.</p>
<p><b>What hast thou done? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ εποιησασ;</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>. Blunt and curt question. "What didst thou do?" "What is thy real crime?" John's picture of this private interview between Pilate and Jesus is told with graphic power. </p>
