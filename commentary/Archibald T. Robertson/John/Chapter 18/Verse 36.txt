 My kingdom  (η βασιλεια η εμη). Christ claims to be king to Pilate, but of a peculiar kingdom. For "world" (κοσμου) see John 17:13-18.My servants  (ο υπηρετα ο εμο). For the word see verse John 18:3 where it means the temple police or guards (literally, under-rowers). In the LXX always (Proverbs 14:35; Isaiah 32:5; Daniel 3:46) officers of a king as here. Christ then had only a small band of despised followers who could not fight against Caesar. Was he alluding also to legions of angels on his side? (Matthew 26:56).Would fight  (ηγωνιζοντο αν). Imperfect middle of αγωνιζομα common verb (only here in John, but see 1 Corinthians 9:25) from αγων (contest) with αν, a conclusion of the second-class condition (assumed as untrue). Christians should never forget the profound truth stated here by Jesus.That I should not be delivered  (ινα μη παραδοθω). Negative final clause with ινα μη and first aorist passive subjunctive of παραδιδωμ (see verses John 18:28; John 18:36). Jesus expects Pilate to surrender to the Jews.But now  (νυν δε). In contrast to the condition already stated as in John 8:40; John 9:41; John 15:22; John 15:24.
