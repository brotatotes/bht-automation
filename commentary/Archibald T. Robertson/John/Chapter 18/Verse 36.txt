<p><b> My kingdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η βασιλεια η εμη</span></span>). Christ claims to be king to Pilate, but of a peculiar kingdom. For "world" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοσμου</span></span>) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:13-18">John 17:13-18</span>.</p>
<p><b>My servants </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο υπηρετα ο εμο</span></span>). For the word see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:3">John 18:3</span> where it means the temple police or guards (literally, under-rowers). In the LXX always (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+14:35">Proverbs 14:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+32:5">Isaiah 32:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+3:46">Daniel 3:46</span>) officers of a king as here. Christ then had only a small band of despised followers who could not fight against Caesar. Was he alluding also to legions of angels on his side? (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:56">Matthew 26:56</span>).</p>
<p><b>Would fight </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγωνιζοντο αν</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγωνιζομα</span></span> common verb (only here in John, but see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:25">1 Corinthians 9:25</span>) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγων</span></span> (contest) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span>, a conclusion of the second-class condition (assumed as untrue). Christians should never forget the profound truth stated here by Jesus.</p>
<p><b>That I should not be delivered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη παραδοθω</span></span>). Negative final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη</span></span> and first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδωμ</span></span> (see verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:28">John 18:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:36">John 18:36</span>). Jesus expects Pilate to surrender to the Jews.</p>
<p><b>But now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν δε</span></span>). In contrast to the condition already stated as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:40">John 8:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:41">John 9:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:22">John 15:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:24">John 15:24</span>. </p>
