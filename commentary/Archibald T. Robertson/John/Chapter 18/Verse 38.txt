 What is truth?  (τ εστιν αληθεια;). This famous sneer of Pilate reveals his own ignorance of truth, as he stood before Incarnate Truth (John 14:6). Quid est veritas? The answer in Latin is Vir est qui adest as has been succinctly said by the use of the same letters. Pilate turned with indifference from his own great question and rendered his verdict: "I find no crime in him" (εγω ουδεμιαν ευρισκω εν αυτω αιτιαν). For this use of αιτια see Matthew 27:37; Mark 15:26. Pilate therefore should have set Jesus free at once.
