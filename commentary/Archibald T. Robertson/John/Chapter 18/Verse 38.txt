<p><b> What is truth? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ εστιν αληθεια;</span></span>). This famous sneer of Pilate reveals his own ignorance of truth, as he stood before Incarnate Truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>). <i>Quid est veritas?</i> The answer in Latin is <i>Vir est qui adest</i> as has been succinctly said by the use of the same letters. Pilate turned with indifference from his own great question and rendered his verdict: "I find no crime in him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω ουδεμιαν ευρισκω εν αυτω αιτιαν</span></span>). For this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτια</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:37">Matthew 27:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:26">Mark 15:26</span>. Pilate therefore should have set Jesus free at once. </p>
