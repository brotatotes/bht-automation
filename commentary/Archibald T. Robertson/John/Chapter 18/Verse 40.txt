<p><b> Cried out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκραυγασαν</span></span>). First aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραυγαζω</span></span>, old and rare verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραυγη</span></span>, outcry (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span>), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:19">Matthew 12:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>Not this man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη τουτον</span></span>). Contemptuous use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>. The priests put the crowd up to this choice (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:11">Mark 15:11</span>) and Pilate offered the alternative (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:17">Matthew 27:17</span>, one MS. actually gives Jesus as the name of Barabbas also). The name <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βαραββας</span></span> in Aramaic simply means son of a father.</p>
<p><b>A robber </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ληιστης</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ληιζομα</span></span>, to plunder, and so a brigand and possibly the leader of the band to which the two robbers belonged who were crucified with Jesus. Luke terms him an insurgent and murderer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:19">Luke 23:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:25">Luke 23:25</span>). They chose Barabbas in preference to Jesus and apparently Jesus died on the very cross planned for Barabbas. </p>
