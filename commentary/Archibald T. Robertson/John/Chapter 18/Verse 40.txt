 Cried out  (εκραυγασαν). First aorist active of κραυγαζω, old and rare verb from κραυγη, outcry (Matthew 25:6), as in Matthew 12:19.Not this man  (μη τουτον). Contemptuous use of ουτος. The priests put the crowd up to this choice (Mark 15:11) and Pilate offered the alternative (Matthew 27:17, one MS. actually gives Jesus as the name of Barabbas also). The name Βαραββας in Aramaic simply means son of a father.A robber  (ληιστης). Old word from ληιζομα, to plunder, and so a brigand and possibly the leader of the band to which the two robbers belonged who were crucified with Jesus. Luke terms him an insurgent and murderer (Luke 23:19; Luke 23:25). They chose Barabbas in preference to Jesus and apparently Jesus died on the very cross planned for Barabbas.
