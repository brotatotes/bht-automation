Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιπτω</span></span> with first aorist ending (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-αν</span></span>). This recoil made them stumble. But why did they step back? Was it the former claim of Jesus (<b> I am </b>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω ειμ</span></span>) to be on an equality with God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:58">John 8:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:19">John 13:19</span>) or mere embarrassment and confusion or supernatural power exerted by Jesus? B adds <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησους</span></span> which must mean simply: "I am Jesus." </p>
