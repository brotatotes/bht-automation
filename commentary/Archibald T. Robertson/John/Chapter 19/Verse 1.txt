<p><b> Took and scourged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαβεν κα εμαστιγωσεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαστιγοω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαστιξ</span></span>, whip). For this redundant use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span> see also verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:6">John 19:6</span>. It is the causative use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαστιγοω</span></span>, for Pilate did not actually scourge Jesus. He simply ordered it done, perhaps to see if the mob would be satisfied with this penalty on the alleged pretender to royalty (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:22">Luke 23:22</span>) whom Pilate had pronounced innocent (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:38">John 18:38</span>), an illegal act therefore. It was a preliminary to crucifixion, but Jesus was not yet condemned. The Sanhedrin had previously mocked Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:65">Mark 14:65</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:67">Matthew 26:67</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:63">Luke 22:63</span>) as the soldiers will do later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:16-19">Mark 15:16-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:27-30">Matthew 27:27-30</span>). This later mock coronation (Mark and Matthew) was after the condemnation.</p>
<p><b>Plaited a crown of thorns </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεξαντες στεφανον εξ ακανθων</span></span>). Old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεκω</span></span>, to weave, in the N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:17">Mark 15:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:19">Matthew 27:19</span>. Not impossible for the mock coronation to be repeated.</p>
<p><b>Arrayed him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεβαλον αυτον</span></span>). "Placed around him" (second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιβαλλω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>In a purple garment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιματιον πορφυρουν</span></span>). Old adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορφυρεος</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορφυρα</span></span>, purple cloth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:17">Mark 15:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:20">Mark 15:20</span>), dyed in purple, in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:16">Revelation 18:16</span>. Jesus had been stripped of his outer garment <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιματιον</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:28">Matthew 27:28</span>) and the scarlet cloak of one of the soldiers may have been put on him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:28">Matthew 27:28</span>). </p>
