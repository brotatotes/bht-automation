 Took and scourged  (ελαβεν κα εμαστιγωσεν). First aorist active indicative of λαμβανω and μαστιγοω (from μαστιξ, whip). For this redundant use of λαμβανω see also verse John 19:6. It is the causative use of μαστιγοω, for Pilate did not actually scourge Jesus. He simply ordered it done, perhaps to see if the mob would be satisfied with this penalty on the alleged pretender to royalty (Luke 23:22) whom Pilate had pronounced innocent (John 18:38), an illegal act therefore. It was a preliminary to crucifixion, but Jesus was not yet condemned. The Sanhedrin had previously mocked Jesus (Mark 14:65; Matthew 26:67; Luke 22:63) as the soldiers will do later (Mark 15:16-19; Matthew 27:27-30). This later mock coronation (Mark and Matthew) was after the condemnation.Plaited a crown of thorns  (πλεξαντες στεφανον εξ ακανθων). Old verb πλεκω, to weave, in the N.T. only here, Mark 15:17; Matthew 27:19. Not impossible for the mock coronation to be repeated.Arrayed him  (περιεβαλον αυτον). "Placed around him" (second aorist active indicative of περιβαλλω).In a purple garment  (ιματιον πορφυρουν). Old adjective πορφυρεος from πορφυρα, purple cloth (Mark 15:17; Mark 15:20), dyed in purple, in the N.T. only here and Revelation 18:16. Jesus had been stripped of his outer garment ιματιον (Matthew 27:28) and the scarlet cloak of one of the soldiers may have been put on him (Matthew 27:28).
