<p><b> Thou wouldest have </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ειχες</span></span>). Imperfect active indicative without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span>, but apodosis of second-class condition as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:22">John 15:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:24">John 15:24</span>.</p>
<p><b>Except it were given thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη ην δεδομενον</span></span>). Periphrastic past perfect indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span> (a permanent possession).</p>
<p><b>From above </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανωθεν</span></span>). From God (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:3">John 3:3</span>), the same doctrine of government stated by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:1">Romans 13:1</span>. Pilate did not get his "authority" from the Sanhedrin, but from Caesar. Jesus makes God the source of all real "authority."</p>
<p><b>Hath greater sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζονα αμαρτιαν εχε</span></span>). The same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:41">John 9:41</span>. Caiaphas has his authority from God also and has used Pilate for his own base end. </p>
