<p><b> Sought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζητε</span></span>). Imperfect active, "kept on seeking," "made renewed efforts to release him." He was afraid to act boldly against the will of the Jews.</p>
<p><b>If thou release this man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν τουτον απολυσηις</span></span>). Condition of third class, a direct threat to Pilate. He knew all the time that the Sanhedrin might tell Caesar on him.</p>
<p><b>Thou art not Caesar's friend </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ε φιλος του καισαρος</span></span>). Later to Vespasian this was an official title, here simply a daring threat to Pilate.</p>
<p><b>Speaketh against Caesar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιλεγε τω καισαρ</span></span>). Caesar brooks no rival. Jesus had allowed himself to be acclaimed king of Israel in the Triumphal Entry (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:13">John 12:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:10">Mark 11:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:38">Luke 19:38</span>). The Sanhedrin have caught Pilate in their toils. </p>
