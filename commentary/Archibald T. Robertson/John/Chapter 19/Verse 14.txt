<p><b> The Preparation of the passover </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρασκευη του πασχα</span></span>). That is, Friday of passover week, the preparation day before the Sabbath of passover week (or feast). See also verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:31">John 19:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:42">John 19:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:42">Mark 15:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:62">Matthew 27:62</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:54">Luke 23:54</span> for this same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρασκευη</span></span> for Friday. It is the name for Friday today in Greece.</p>
<p><b>About the sixth hour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως εκτη</span></span>). Roman time, about 6 A.M. (a little after 6 no doubt) when Pilate rendered his final decision. Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:25">Mark 15:25</span>) notes that it was the third hour (Jewish time), which is 9 A.M. Roman time, when the crucifixion began. Why should John give Jewish time writing at the close of the first century when Jerusalem and the Jewish state passed away in A.D. 70? He is writing for Greek and Roman readers.</p>
<p><b>Behold your king </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιδε ο βασιλευς υμων</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιδε</span></span> is here an exclamation with no effect on the case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλευς</span></span> just as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>. The sarcasm of Pilate is aimed at the Jews, not at Jesus. </p>
