<p><b> They took </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρελαβον</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαμβανω</span></span>, they took Jesus from Pilate. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:3">John 14:3</span>. This is after the shameful scourging between 6 A.M. and 9 A.M. when the soldiers insult Jesus <i>ad libitum</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:16-19">Mark 15:16-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:27-30">Matthew 27:27-30</span>). </p>
<p><b> Bearing the cross for himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασταζων αυτω τον σταυρον</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:27">Luke 14:27</span> for this very picture in the words of Jesus. The dative case of the reflexive pronoun <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span> "for himself" is in strict accord with Roman custom. "A criminal condemned to be crucified was required to carry his own cross" (Bernard). But apparently Jesus under the strain of the night before and the anguish of heart within him gave out so that Simon of Cyrene was impressed to carry it for Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:21">Mark 15:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:32">Matthew 27:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:26">Luke 23:26</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:22">Mark 15:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:33">Matthew 27:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:33">Luke 23:33</span> for the meaning of "place of a skull" or Calvary and Golgotha in Hebrew (Aramaic). Luke has simply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κρανιον</span></span> (Skull), a skull-looking place. </p>
