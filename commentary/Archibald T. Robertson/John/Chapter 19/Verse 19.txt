<p><b> Pilate wrote a title also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγραψεν κα τιτλον ο Πειλατος</span></span>). Only John tells us that Pilate himself wrote it and John alone uses the technical Latin word <i>titlon</i> (several times in inscriptions), for the board with the name of the criminal and the crime in which he is condemned; Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:26">Mark 15:26</span>) and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:28">Luke 23:28</span>) use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγραφη</span></span> (superscription). Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:37">Matthew 27:37</span>) has simply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτιαν</span></span> (accusation). The inscription in John is the fullest of the four and has all in any of them save the words "this is" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος εστιν</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:37">Matthew 27:37</span>. </p>
