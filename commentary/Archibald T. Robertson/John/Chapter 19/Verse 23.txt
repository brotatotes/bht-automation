 Four parts  (τεσσερα μερη). There were four soldiers, the usual quaternion (τετραδιον, Acts 12:9) besides the centurion (Mark 15:39; Matthew 27:54; Luke 23:47). The clothes (ιματια, outer clothes) of the criminal were removed before the crucifixion and belonged to the soldiers. Luke (Luke 23:34) mentions the division of the garments, but not the number four. The four pieces would be the head gear, the sandals, the girdle, the ταλλιθ (outer garment with fringes).The coat was without seam  (ο χιτων αραφος). For χιτων (the inner garment) see Matthew 5:40. Αραφος is compound of α privative and ραπτω, to sew together, and so seamless (unsewed together), only here in N.T. It occurs elsewhere in Josephus, Ant. III. 6, 4.Woven  (υφαντος). Verbal (old word) from υφαινω (some MSS. in Luke 12:27), only here in N.T.
