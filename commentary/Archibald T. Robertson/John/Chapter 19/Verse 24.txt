<p><b> Let us not rend it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη σχισωμεν αυτον</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη</span></span> with first aorist active volitive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχιζω</span></span>, to split. It was too valuable to ruin.</p>
<p><b>Cast lots </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαχωμεν</span></span>). Second aorist active volitive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαγχανω</span></span>. The usual meaning is to obtain by lot (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:9">Luke 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:17">Acts 1:17</span>). Field (<i>Ot. Norv</i>. 72) holds that no example has been found where it means "cast lots" as here, but Thayer cites <i>Isocrates</i>, p. 144b and <i>Diod</i>. 4, 63. John here quotes with the usual formula <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:18">Psalms 22:18</span> (LXX verbatim) and finds a fulfilment here. The enemies of the Lord's Anointed treated him as already dead (Westcott) and so cast lots (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαβον κληρον</span></span>, the common phrase as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:35">Matthew 27:35</span>). </p>
