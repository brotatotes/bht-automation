<p><b> Were standing by the cross of Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστηκεισαν παρα τω σταυρω του Ιησου</span></span>). Perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>, to place, used as imperfect (intransitive) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> (beside) and the locative case. Vivid contrast this to the rude gambling of the soldiers. This group of four (or three) women interests us more. Matt. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:55">Matthew 27:55</span>) spoke of women beholding from afar and names three (Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee). Mark also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:40">Mark 15:40</span>) names three (Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome). They have clearly drawn near the Cross by now. John alone mentions the mother of Jesus in the group. It is not clear whether the sister of the mother of Jesus is Salome the mother of the sons of Zebedee or the wife of Clopas. If so, two sisters have the name Mary and James and John are cousins of Jesus. The point cannot be settled with our present knowledge. </p>
