<p><b> His mother </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την μητερα</span></span>). Common Greek idiom, the article as possessive.</p>
<p><b>Standing by </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεστωτα</span></span>). Perfect active (intransitive) participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παριστημ</span></span>, vivid and picturesque scene. The dying Saviour thinks of the comfort of his mother.</p>
<p><b>Whom he loved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον ηγαπα</span></span>). Imperfect active. Surely John is justified in inserting this phrase here. If John were his cousin, that helps explain why Jesus turns the care of his mother over to him. But the brothers of Jesus are not present and disbelieved his claims. John is the only one of the apostles with courage enough to take his stand with the women by the Cross. There is no disrespect in the use of "Woman" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γυνα</span></span>) here as there was not in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:4">John 2:4</span>. This trust is to John, though Salome, John's own mother, was standing there. </p>
