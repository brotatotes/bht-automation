 Are now finished  (ηδη τετελεστα). Perfect passive indicative of τελεω. See same form in verse John 19:30. As in John 13:1, where Jesus is fully conscious (knowing, ειδως) of the meaning of his atoning death.Might be accomplished  (τελειωθη). First aorist passive subjunctive of τελειοω rather than the usual πληρωθη (verse John 19:24) with ινα. John sees the thirst of Jesus in Psalms 69:21. Jesus, of course, did not make the outcry in any mechanical way. Thirst is one of the severest agonies of crucifixion. For the "perfecting" of the Messiah by physical suffering see Hebrews 2:10; Hebrews 5:7.
