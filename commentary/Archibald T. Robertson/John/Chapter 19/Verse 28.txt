<p><b> Are now finished </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη τετελεστα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελεω</span></span>. See same form in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:30">John 19:30</span>. As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>, where Jesus is fully conscious (knowing, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδως</span></span>) of the meaning of his atoning death.</p>
<p><b>Might be accomplished </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειωθη</span></span>). First aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειοω</span></span> rather than the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρωθη</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:24">John 19:24</span>) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>. John sees the thirst of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:21">Psalms 69:21</span>. Jesus, of course, did not make the outcry in any mechanical way. Thirst is one of the severest agonies of crucifixion. For the "perfecting" of the Messiah by physical suffering see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span>. </p>
