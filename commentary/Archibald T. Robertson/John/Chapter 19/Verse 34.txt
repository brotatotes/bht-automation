<p><b>Blood and water </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιμα κα υδωρ</span></span>). Dr. W. Stroud (<i>Physical Cause of the Death of Christ</i>) argues that this fact proves that the spear pierced the left side of Jesus near the heart and that Jesus had died literally of a broken heart since blood was mixed with water. </p>
