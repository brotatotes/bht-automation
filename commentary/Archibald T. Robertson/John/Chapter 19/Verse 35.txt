<p><b> He that hath seen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εωρακως</span></span>). Perfect active articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>. John the Apostle was there and saw this fact (still sees it, in fact). This personal witness disproves the theory of the Docetic Gnostics that Jesus did not have a real human body.</p>
<p><b>He knoweth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος οιδεν</span></span>). That is John does like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:37">John 9:37</span>. It is possible that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος</span></span> may be a solemn appeal to God as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:33">John 1:33</span> or Christ as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:5">1 John 3:5</span>. Bernard argues that the final editor is distinguishing the Beloved Disciple from himself and is endorsing him. But the example of Josephus (<i>War</i>. III. 7, 16) is against this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος</span></span>. John is rather referring to himself as still alive. </p>
