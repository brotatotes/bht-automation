<p><b> I bring him out to you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγω υμιν αυτον εξω</span></span>). Vividly pictures Pilate leading Jesus out of the palace before the mob in front.</p>
<p><b>That ye may know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα γνωτε</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, "that ye may come to know," by this mockery the sincerity of Pilate's decision that Jesus is innocent (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:38">John 18:38</span>). It is a travesty on justice and dignity, but Pilate is trying by a bit of humour to turn the mob from the grip of the Sanhedrin. </p>
