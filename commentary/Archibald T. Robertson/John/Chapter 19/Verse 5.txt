<p><b> Wearing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορων</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορεω</span></span>, an early frequentative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερω</span></span>, denoting a continual wearing, though not true here (only temporary). Jesus bore the mockery with kingly dignity as part of the shame of the Cross (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>).</p>
<p><b>Behold, the man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιδου ο ανθρωπος</span></span>). <i>Ecce Homo!</i> by Pilate. This exclamatory introduction of Jesus in mock coronation robes to the mob was clearly intended to excite pity and to show how absurd the charge of the Sanhedrin was that such a pitiable figure should be guilty of treason. Pilate failed utterly in this effort and did not dream that he was calling attention to the greatest figure of history, the Man of the ages. </p>
