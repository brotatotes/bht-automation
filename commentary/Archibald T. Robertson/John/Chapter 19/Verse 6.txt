<p><b> Crucify him, crucify him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταυρωσον, σταυρωσον</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταυροω</span></span> for which verb see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+29:19">Matthew 29:19</span>, etc. Here the note of urgency (aorist imperative) with no word for "him," as they were led by the chief priests and the temple police till the whole mob takes it up (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:22">Matthew 27:22</span>).</p>
<p><b>For I find no crime in him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω γαρ ουχ ευρισκω</span></span>). This is the third time Pilate has rendered his opinion of Christ's innocence (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:38">John 18:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:4">John 19:4</span>). And here he surrenders in a fret to the mob and gives as his reason (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>, for) for his surrender the innocence of Jesus (the strangest judicial decision ever rendered). Perhaps Pilate was only franker than some judges! </p>
