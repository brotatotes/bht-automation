<p><b> Because he made himself the Son of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ υιον θεου εαυτον εποιησεν</span></span>). Here at last the Sanhedrin give the real ground for their hostility to Jesus, one of long standing for probably three years (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span>) and the one on which the Sanhedrin voted the condemnation of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:61-64">Mark 14:61-64</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:23-66">Matthew 27:23-66</span>), but even now they do not mention their own decision to Pilate, for they had no legal right to vote Christ's death before Pilate's consent which they now have secured. </p>
