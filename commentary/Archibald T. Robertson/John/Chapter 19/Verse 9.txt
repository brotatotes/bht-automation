<p><b> Whence art thou? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποθεν ε συ;</span></span>). Pilate knew that Jesus was from Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:6">Luke 23:6</span>). He is really alarmed. See a like question by the Jews in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:25">John 8:25</span>.</p>
<p><b>Gave him no answer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκρισιν ουκ εδωκεν αυτω</span></span>). See same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:22">John 1:22</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αποκρισις</span></span> (old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκρινομα</span></span>) occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:47">Luke 2:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:26">Luke 20:26</span>. The silence of Jesus, like that before Caiaphas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:61">Mark 14:61</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:63">Matthew 26:63</span>) and Herod (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:9">Luke 23:9</span>), irritates the dignity of Pilate in spite of his fears. </p>
