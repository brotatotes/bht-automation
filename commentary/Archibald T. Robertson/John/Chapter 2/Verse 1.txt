<p><b> The third day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη ημερα τη τριτη</span></span>). "On the day the third" (locative case), from the start to Galilee when Philip was found (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:43">John 1:43</span>), seven days since <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>There was a marriage </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαμος εγενετο</span></span>). "A wedding (or marriage festival) took place." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:8">Matthew 22:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>In Cana of Galilee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Κανα της Γαλιλαιας</span></span>). This town, the home of Nathanael (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:2">John 21:2</span>), is only mentioned again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:46">John 4:46</span> as the home of the nobleman. There was a Cana in Coele-Syria. It is usually located at <i>Kefr Kenna</i> (3 1/2 miles from Nazareth), though <i>Ain Kana</i> and <i>Khirbet Kana</i> are also possible. Bernard thinks that it was probably on Wednesday afternoon the fourth day of the week (usual day for marriage of virgins), when the party of Jesus arrived.</p>
<p><b>And the mother of Jesus was there </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ην η μητηρ του Ιησου εκε</span></span>). When they arrived. John does not mention her name, probably because already well known in the Synoptics. Probably Joseph was already dead. Mary may have been kin to the family where the wedding took place, an intimate friend clearly. </p>
