<p><b> This beginning of his signs did Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτην εποιησεν αρχην των σημειων ο Ιησους</span></span>). Rather, "this Jesus did as a beginning of his signs," for there is no article between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτην</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχην</span></span>. "We have now passed from the 'witness' of the Baptist to the 'witness' of the works of Jesus" (Bernard). This is John's favourite word "signs" rather than wonders (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τερατα</span></span>) or powers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμεις</span></span>) for the works (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργα</span></span>) of Jesus. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σημειον</span></span> is an old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημαινω</span></span>, to give a sign (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:33">John 12:33</span>). He selects eight in his Gospel by which to prove the deity of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:30">John 20:30</span>) of which this is the first.</p>
<p><b>Manifested his glory </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφανερωσεν την δοξαν αυτου</span></span>). First aorist (effective) active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανεροω</span></span>, that glory of which John spoke in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Believed on him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευσαν εις αυτον</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>, to believe, to put trust in, so common in John. These six disciples (learners) had already believed in Jesus as the Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:35-51">John 1:35-51</span>). Now their faith was greatly strengthened. So it will be all through this Gospel. Jesus will increasingly reveal himself while the disciples will grow in knowledge and trust and the Jews will become increasingly hostile till the culmination. </p>
