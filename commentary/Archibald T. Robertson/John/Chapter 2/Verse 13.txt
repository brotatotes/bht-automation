<p><b> The passover of the Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πασχα των Ιουδαιων</span></span>). The Synoptics do not give "of the Jews," but John is writing after the destruction of the temple and for Gentile readers. John mentions the passovers in Christ's ministry outside of the one when Christ was crucified, this one and one in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:4">John 6:4</span>. There may be another (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1">John 5:1</span>), but we do not know. But for John we should not know that Christ's ministry was much over a year in length. </p>
