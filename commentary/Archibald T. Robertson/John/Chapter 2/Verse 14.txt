<p><b> Those that sold </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους πωλουντας</span></span>). Present active articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πωλεω</span></span>, to sell. They were in the Court of the Gentiles within the temple precinct (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ιερω</span></span>), but not in the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναος</span></span> or temple proper. The sacrifices required animals (oxen, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βοας</span></span>, sheep, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προβατα</span></span>, doves, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιστερας</span></span>) and "changers of money" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερματιστας</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερματιζω</span></span>, to cut into small pieces, to change money, only here in N.T., late and rare). Probably their very presence in his Father's house angered Jesus. The Synoptics (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:15-17">Mark 11:15-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:45">Luke 10:45</span>) record a similar incident the day after the Triumphal Entry. If there was only one, it would seem more natural at the close. But why could it not occur at the beginning also? Here it is an obvious protest by Christ at the beginning of his ministry as in the Synoptics it is an indignant outcry against the desecration. The cessation was only temporary in both instances. </p>
