 Those that sold  (τους πωλουντας). Present active articular participle of πωλεω, to sell. They were in the Court of the Gentiles within the temple precinct (εν τω ιερω), but not in the ναος or temple proper. The sacrifices required animals (oxen, βοας, sheep, προβατα, doves, περιστερας) and "changers of money" (κερματιστας, from κερματιζω, to cut into small pieces, to change money, only here in N.T., late and rare). Probably their very presence in his Father's house angered Jesus. The Synoptics (Mark 11:15-17; Matthew 21:12; Luke 10:45) record a similar incident the day after the Triumphal Entry. If there was only one, it would seem more natural at the close. But why could it not occur at the beginning also? Here it is an obvious protest by Christ at the beginning of his ministry as in the Synoptics it is an indignant outcry against the desecration. The cessation was only temporary in both instances.
