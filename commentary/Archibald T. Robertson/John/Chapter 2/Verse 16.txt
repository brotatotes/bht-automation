<p><b> Take these things hence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αρατε ταυτα εντευθεν</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρω</span></span>. Probably the doves were in baskets or cages and so had to be taken out by the traders.</p>
<p><b>Make not my Father's house a house of merchandise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ποιειτε τον οικον του πατρος μου οικον εμποριου</span></span>). "Stop making," it means, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the present active imperative. They had made it a market-house (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμποριου</span></span>, here only in N.T., old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπορος</span></span>, merchant, one who goes on a journey for traffic, a drummer). Note the clear-cut Messianic claim here (My Father as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:49">Luke 2:49</span>). Jerome says: "A certain fiery and starry light shone from his eyes and the majesty of Godhead gleamed in His face." </p>
