First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμνησκω</span></span>, to remind, "were reminded." Westcott notes the double effect of this act as is true of Christ's words and deeds all through John's Gospel. The disciples are helped, the traders are angered.</p>

<p><b>The zeal of thine house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ζηλος του οικου σου</span></span>). Objective genitive. "The zeal for thy house."</p>
<p><b>Shall eat me up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταφαγετα με</span></span>). Future middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεσθιω</span></span>, defective verb, to eat down ("up" we say), perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα-</span></span>. This future <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαγομα</span></span> is from the second aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφαγον</span></span>. It is a quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:9">Psalms 69:9</span>, frequently quoted in the N.T. </p>
