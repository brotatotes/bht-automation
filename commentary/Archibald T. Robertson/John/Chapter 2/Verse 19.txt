<p><b> Destroy this temple </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυσατε τον ναον τουτον</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυω</span></span>, to loosen or destroy. It is the permissive imperative, not a command to do it. Note also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναος</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερον</span></span>, the sanctuary, symbol of God's <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναος</span></span>, in our hearts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>). There is much confusion about this language since Jesus added: "And in three days I will raise it up" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εν τρισιν ημεραις εγερω αυτον</span></span>). Those who heard Jesus, including the disciples till after the resurrection (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:22">John 2:22</span>), understood the reference to be to Herod's temple. Certainly that is the obvious way to take it. But Jesus often spoke in parables and even in enigmas. He may have spoken of the literal temple as a parable for his own body which of course they would not understand, least of all the resurrection in three days. </p>
