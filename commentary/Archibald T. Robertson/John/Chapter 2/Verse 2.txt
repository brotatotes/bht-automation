 Jesus also was bidden  (εκληθη κα ο Ιησους). First aorist passive indicative of καλεω, "was also invited" as well as his mother and because of her presence, possibly at her suggestion.And his disciples  (κα ο μαθητα). Included in the invitation and probably all of them acquaintances of the family. See on John 1:35 for this word applied to John's followers. This group of six already won form the nucleus of the great host of "learners" through the ages who will follow Jesus as Teacher and Lord and Saviour. The term is sometimes restricted to the twelve apostles, but more often has a wider circle in view as in John 6:61; John 6:66; John 20:30.
