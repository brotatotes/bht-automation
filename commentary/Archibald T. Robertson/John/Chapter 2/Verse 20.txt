 Forty and six years was this temple in building  (Τεσσερακοντα κα εξ ετεσιν οικοδομηθη ο ναος ουτος). "Within forty and six years (associative instrumental case) was built (first aorist passive indicative, constative or summary use of the aorist, of οικοδομεω, without augment) this temple." As a matter of fact, it was not yet finished, so distrustful had the Jews been of Herod.And wilt thou?  (κα συ;). An evident sneer in the use of συ (thou, an unknown upstart from Galilee, of the peasant class, not one of the Sanhedrin, not one of the ecclesiastics or even architects).
