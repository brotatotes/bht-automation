<p><b> Forty and six years was this temple in building </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τεσσερακοντα κα εξ ετεσιν οικοδομηθη ο ναος ουτος</span></span>). "Within forty and six years (associative instrumental case) was built (first aorist passive indicative, constative or summary use of the aorist, of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδομεω</span></span>, without augment) this temple." As a matter of fact, it was not yet finished, so distrustful had the Jews been of Herod.</p>
<p><b>And wilt thou? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα συ;</span></span>). An evident sneer in the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ</span></span> (thou, an unknown upstart from Galilee, of the peasant class, not one of the Sanhedrin, not one of the ecclesiastics or even architects). </p>
