<p><b> But he spake of the temple of his body </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος δε ελεγεν περ του ναου του σωματος αυτου</span></span>). Emphatic he (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος</span></span>) and imperfect tense (he had been speaking). This is John's view as he looks back at it, not what he understood when Jesus spoke the words. </p>
