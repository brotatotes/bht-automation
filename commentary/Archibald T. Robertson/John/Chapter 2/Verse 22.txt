<p><b> When therefore he was raised from the dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hοτε ουν ηγερθη εκ νεκρων</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγειρω</span></span>, to raise up. And not at first then, but only slowly after the disciples themselves were convinced. Then "they believed the Scripture" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευσαν τη γραφη</span></span>). They "believed" again. Dative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφη</span></span>. Probably <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:10">Psalms 16:10</span> is meant (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:31">Acts 2:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:35">Acts 13:35</span>).</p>
<p><b>And the word which Jesus had said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τω λογω ον ειπεν</span></span>). Dative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογω</span></span> also, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον</span></span> (relative) is not attracted to the dative. Clearly then John interprets Jesus to have a parabolic reference to his death and resurrection by his language in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span>. There are those who bluntly say that John was mistaken. I prefer to say that these scholars are mistaken. Even Bernard considers it "hardly possible" that John interprets Jesus rightly in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:21">John 1:21</span>. "Had he meant that, He would have spoken with less ambiguity." But how do we know that Jesus wished to be understood clearly at this time? Certainly no one understood Christ when he spoke the words. The language of Jesus is recalled and perverted at his trial as "I will destroy" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:58">Mark 14:58</span>), "I can destroy" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:61">Matthew 26:61</span>), neither of which he said. </p>
