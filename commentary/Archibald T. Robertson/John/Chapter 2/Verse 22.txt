 When therefore he was raised from the dead  (Hοτε ουν ηγερθη εκ νεκρων). First aorist passive indicative of εγειρω, to raise up. And not at first then, but only slowly after the disciples themselves were convinced. Then "they believed the Scripture" (επιστευσαν τη γραφη). They "believed" again. Dative case γραφη. Probably Psalms 16:10 is meant (Acts 2:31; Acts 13:35).And the word which Jesus had said  (κα τω λογω ον ειπεν). Dative case λογω also, but ον (relative) is not attracted to the dative. Clearly then John interprets Jesus to have a parabolic reference to his death and resurrection by his language in John 2:19. There are those who bluntly say that John was mistaken. I prefer to say that these scholars are mistaken. Even Bernard considers it "hardly possible" that John interprets Jesus rightly in John 1:21. "Had he meant that, He would have spoken with less ambiguity." But how do we know that Jesus wished to be understood clearly at this time? Certainly no one understood Christ when he spoke the words. The language of Jesus is recalled and perverted at his trial as "I will destroy" (Mark 14:58), "I can destroy" (Matthew 26:61), neither of which he said.
