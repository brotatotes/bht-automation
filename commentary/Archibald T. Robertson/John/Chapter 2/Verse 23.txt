<p><b> In Jerusalem </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις Ιεροσολυμοις</span></span>). The form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιεροσολυμα</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:13">John 2:13</span> always in this Gospel and in Mark, and usually in Matthew, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιερουσαλημ</span></span> only in Revelation, and both forms by Luke and Paul.</p>
<p><b>During the feast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη εορτη</span></span>). The feast of unleavened bread followed for seven days right after the passover (one day strictly), though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πασχα</span></span> is used either for the passover meal or for the whole eight days.</p>
<p><b>Believed on his name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευσαν εις το ονομα αυτου</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:12">John 1:12</span> for this phrase. Only one has to watch for the real import of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>.</p>

<p><b>Which he did </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α εποιε</span></span>). "Which he was doing" (imperfect tense). He did his first sign in Cana, but now he was doing many in Jerusalem. Already Jesus had become the cynosure of all eyes in Jerusalem at this first visit in his ministry. </p>
