<p><b> But Jesus did not trust himself to them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος δε Ιησους ουκ επιστευεν αυτον αυτοις</span></span>). "But Jesus himself kept on refusing (negative imperfect) to trust himself to them." The double use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span> here is shown by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:13">Acts 8:13</span> where Simon Magus "believed" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευσεν</span></span>) and was baptized, but was unsaved. He merely believed that he wanted what Philip had.</p>
<p><b>For that he knew all men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το αυτον γινωσκειν παντας</span></span>). Causal use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> and the accusative case of the articular infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το γινωσκειν</span></span> (because of the knowing) with the object of the infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντας</span></span>, all men) and the accusative of general reference (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον</span></span>, as to himself). </p>
