<p><b> When the wine failed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υστερησαντος οινου</span></span>). Genitive absolute with first aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υστερεω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υστερος</span></span>, late or lacking. See same use in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:21">Mark 10:21</span>. A longer Western paraphrase occurs in some manuscripts. It was an embarrassing circumstance, especially to Mary, if partly due to the arrival of the seven guests.</p>
<p><b>They have no wine </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Οινον ουκ εχουσιν</span></span>). The statement of the fact was in itself a hint and a request. But why made by the mother of Jesus and why to Jesus? She would not, of course, make it to the host. Mary feels some kind of responsibility and exercises some kind of authority for reasons not known to us. Mary had treasured in her heart the wonders connected with the birth of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:19">Luke 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:51">Luke 2:51</span>). The ministry of the Baptist had stirred her hopes afresh. Had she not told Jesus all that she knew before he went to the Jordan to be baptized of John? This group of disciples meant to her that Jesus had begun his Messianic work. So she dares propose the miracle to him. </p>
