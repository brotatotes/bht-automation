<p><b> Woman </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυνα</span></span>). Vocative case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυνη</span></span>, and with no idea of censure as is plain from its use by Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:26">John 19:26</span>. But the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυνα</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητερ</span></span> (Mother) does show her she can no longer exercise maternal authority and not at all in his Messianic work. That is always a difficult lesson for mothers and fathers to learn, when to let go.</p>
<p><b>What have I to do with thee? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ εμο κα σοι;</span></span>). There are a number of examples of this ethical dative in the LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+11:12">Judges 11:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2sa+16:10">2 Samuel 16:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:18">1 Kings 17:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+3:13">2 Kings 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+35:21">2 Chronicles 35:21</span>) and in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:24">Mark 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:7">Mark 5:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:19">Matthew 27:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:28">Luke 8:28</span>). Some divergence of thought is usually indicated. Literally the phrase means, "What is it to me and to thee?" In this instance F.C. Burkitt (<i>Journal of Theol. Studies</i>, July, 1912) interprets it to mean, "What is it to us?" That is certainly possible and suits the next clause also.</p>
<p><b>Mine hour is not yet come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουπω ηκε η ωρα μου</span></span>). This phrase marks a crisis whenever it occurs, especially of his death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:30">John 7:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:20">John 8:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:23">John 12:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span>). Here apparently it means the hour for public manifestation of the Messiahship, though a narrower sense would be for Christ's intervention about the failure of the wine. The Fourth Gospel is written on the plane of eternity (W. M. Ramsay) and that standpoint exists here in this first sign of the Messiah. </p>
