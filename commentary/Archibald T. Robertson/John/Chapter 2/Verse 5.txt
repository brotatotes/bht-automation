 Unto the servants  (τοις διακονοις). See on Matthew 20:26 for this word (our "deacon," but not that sense here).Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it  (Hοτ αν λεγη υμιν ποιησατε). Indefinite relative sentence (οτ αν and present active subjunctive, general statement) with aorist active imperative of ποιεω for instant execution. Mary took comfort in the "not yet" (ουπω) and recognized the right of Jesus as Messiah to independence of her, but evidently expected him to carry out her suggestion ultimately as he did. This mother knew her Son.
