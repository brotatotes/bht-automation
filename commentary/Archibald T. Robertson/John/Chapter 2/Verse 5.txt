<p><b> Unto the servants </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις διακονοις</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:26">Matthew 20:26</span> for this word (our "deacon," but not that sense here).</p>
<p><b>Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hοτ αν λεγη υμιν ποιησατε</span></span>). Indefinite relative sentence (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ αν</span></span> and present active subjunctive, general statement) with aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span> for instant execution. Mary took comfort in the "not yet" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουπω</span></span>) and recognized the right of Jesus as Messiah to independence of her, but evidently expected him to carry out her suggestion ultimately as he did. This mother knew her Son. </p>
