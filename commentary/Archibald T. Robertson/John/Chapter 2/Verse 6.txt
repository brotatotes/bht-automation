 Waterpots  (υδρια). Old word from υδωρ (water) and used in papyri for pots or pans for holding money or bread as well as water. These stone (λιθινα as in 2 Corinthians 3:3) jars full of water were kept handy ( set there , κειμενα, present middle participle of κειμα) at a feast for ceremonial cleansing of the hands (2 Kings 3:11; Mark 7:3), "after the Jews' manner of purifying" (κατα τον καθαρισμον των Ιουδαιων). See Mark 1:44; Luke 2:22 for the word καθαρισμος (from καθαριζω) which fact also raised a controversy with disciples of John because of his baptizing (John 3:25).Containing  (χωρουσα). Present active participle feminine plural of χωρεω, old verb from χωρος, place, space, having space or room for.Two or three firkins apiece  (ανα μετρητας δυο η τρεις). The word μετρητης, from μετρεω, to measure, simply means "measurer," an amphora for measuring liquids (in Demosthenes, Aristotle, Polybius), the Hebrew bath (2 Chronicles 4:5), here only in N.T., about 8 1/2 English gallons. Each υδρια thus held about 20 gallons. This common distributive use of ανα occurs here only in this Gospel, but is in Revelation 4:8. In John 4:28 a much smaller υδρια was used for carrying water.
