<p><b> Draw out now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αντλησατε νυν</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντλεω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αντλος</span></span>, bilge water, or the hold where the bilge water settles (so in Homer). The verb occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:7">John 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:15">John 4:15</span>, for drawing water from the well, and Westcott so interprets it here, but needlessly so, since the servants seem bidden to draw from the large water-jars now full of water. Apparently the water was still water when it came out of the jars (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:9">John 2:9</span>), but was changed to wine before reaching the guests. The water in the jars remained water.</p>
<p><b>Unto the ruler of the feast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω αρχιτρικλινω</span></span>). Dative case. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρικλινος</span></span> was a room (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικος</span></span>) with three couches (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλινη</span></span>) for the feast. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχιτρικλινος</span></span> was originally the superintendent of the dining-room who arranged the couches and tasted the food, not the toast-master (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμποσιαρχης</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>And they bare it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε ηνεγκαν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερω</span></span>. Apparently not knowing at first that they bore wine. </p>
