 Tasted  (εγευσατο). First aorist middle indicative of γευομα. As it was his function to do.The water now become wine  (το υδωρ οινον γεγενημενον). Accusative case, though the genitive also occurs with γευομα. Perfect passive participle of γινομα and οινον, predicative accusative. The tablemaster knew nothing of the miracle, "whence it was" (ποθεν εστιν, indirect question retaining present indicative). The servants knew the source of the water, but not the power that made the wine.Calleth the bridegroom  (φωνε τον νυμφιον). As apparently responsible for the supply of the wine ( thou hast kept  τετηρηκας). See Matthew 9:15 for νυμφιος. When men have drunk freely (οταν μεθυσθωσιν). Indefinite temporal clause with οταν and first aorist passive subjunctive of μεθυσκω. The verb does not mean that these guests are now drunk, but that this is a common custom to put "the worse" (τον ελασσω, the less, the inferior) wine last. It is real wine that is meant by οινος here. Unlike the Baptist Jesus mingled in the social life of the time, was even abused for it (Matthew 11:19; Luke 7:34). But this fact does not mean that today Jesus would approve the modern liquor trade with its damnable influences. The law of love expounded by Paul in John 2:1 and in John 2:14; John 2:15 teaches modern Christians to be willing gladly to give up what they see causes so many to stumble into sin.
