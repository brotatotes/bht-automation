<p><b> Unto their own home </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς αυτους</span></span>). "To themselves." Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:12">Luke 24:12</span>) has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς αυτον</span></span> about Peter ("to his home"). This use of the reflective pronoun for home (literally, "to themselves"), like the French <i>chez eux</i>, occurs in Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. VII. 4, 6). John had taken the mother of Jesus to his home (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:27">John 19:27</span>) and so he now hurried home to tell her the glorious news as he believed. </p>
