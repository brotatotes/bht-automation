<p><b> Beholdeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεωρε</span></span>). Vivid historical present again as in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:6">John 20:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:14">John 20:14</span>. Peter and John had not seen the two angels. Westcott suggests an "economy" in such manifestations as the explanations. Better our own ignorance as to the reason why only the women saw them. Angels were commonly believed to be clad in white. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:5">Mark 16:5</span> (a young man in a white robe), <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:5">Matthew 28:5</span> (the angel), <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:4">Luke 24:4</span> (two men in dazzling apparel). For other angels in John's Gospel see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:41">John 1:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:29">John 12:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:12">John 20:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>Had lain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκειτο</span></span>). Imperfect in progressive sense, "had been lying," though not there now. </p>
