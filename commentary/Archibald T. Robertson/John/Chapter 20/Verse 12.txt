 Beholdeth  (θεωρε). Vivid historical present again as in verses John 20:6; John 20:14. Peter and John had not seen the two angels. Westcott suggests an "economy" in such manifestations as the explanations. Better our own ignorance as to the reason why only the women saw them. Angels were commonly believed to be clad in white. See Mark 16:5 (a young man in a white robe), Matthew 28:5 (the angel), Luke 24:4 (two men in dazzling apparel). For other angels in John's Gospel see John 1:41; John 12:29; John 20:12.Had lain  (εκειτο). Imperfect in progressive sense, "had been lying," though not there now.
