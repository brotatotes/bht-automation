<p><b> I do not know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ οιδα</span></span>). Singular here, not plural as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:2">John 20:2</span>, because clearly Mary is alone here. But the problem is the same. She did not see Peter and John at the tomb. </p>
