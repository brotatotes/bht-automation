<p><b> Sir </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριε</span></span>). Clearly not "Lord" here, for she thought him to be "the gardener" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κηπουρος</span></span>), old word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηποσ, ουρος</span></span>), keeper of the garden, only here in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>If thou hast borne him hence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε συ εβαστασος αυτον</span></span>). Condition of the first class. Note emphasis on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ</span></span> (thou). A new idea struck Mary as mistaken as the other one. Jesus had repeated the question of the angels, but she did not recognize him.</p>
<p><b>And I </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καγω</span></span>). Emphasis and crasis. </p>
