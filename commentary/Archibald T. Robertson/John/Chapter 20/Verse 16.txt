<p><b> Mary </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μαριαμ</span></span>). Aramaic form in Aleph B W, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μαρια</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:25">John 19:25</span>. Clearly the old familiar tone of Jesus was in the pronunciation of her name.</p>
<p><b>Rabboni </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ραββουνε</span></span>). Aramaic again for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διδασκαλε</span></span> (Teacher), "my Teacher." In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:51">Mark 10:51</span> though practically the same as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ραββ</span></span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:28">John 11:28</span> for "the Teacher" (Rabbi). These two simple words tell the great fact that Christ is risen and Mary has seen him. One says little in really great moments. </p>
