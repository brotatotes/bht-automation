<p><b> Touch me not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη μου απτου</span></span>). Present middle imperative in prohibition with genitive case, meaning "cease clinging to me" rather than "Do not touch me." Jesus allowed the women to take hold of his feet (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκρατησαν</span></span>) and worship (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεκυνησαν</span></span>) as we read in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:9">Matthew 28:9</span>. The prohibition here reminds Mary that the previous personal fellowship by sight, sound, and touch no longer exists and that the final state of glory was not yet begun. Jesus checks Mary's impulsive eagerness.</p>
<p><b>For I am not yet ascended </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουπω γαρ αναβεβηκα</span></span>). Perfect active indicative. Jesus is here at all only because he has not yet gone home. He had said (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span>) that it was good for them that he should go to the Father when the Holy Spirit will come through whom they will have fellowship with the Father and Christ.</p>
<p><b>My God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεου μου</span></span>). Jesus had said "My God" on the Cross (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:34">Mark 15:34</span>). Note it also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:2">Revelation 3:2</span>. So Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:6">Romans 15:6</span>, etc., has "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." </p>
