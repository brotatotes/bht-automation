 Touch me not  (μη μου απτου). Present middle imperative in prohibition with genitive case, meaning "cease clinging to me" rather than "Do not touch me." Jesus allowed the women to take hold of his feet (εκρατησαν) and worship (προσεκυνησαν) as we read in Matthew 28:9. The prohibition here reminds Mary that the previous personal fellowship by sight, sound, and touch no longer exists and that the final state of glory was not yet begun. Jesus checks Mary's impulsive eagerness.For I am not yet ascended  (ουπω γαρ αναβεβηκα). Perfect active indicative. Jesus is here at all only because he has not yet gone home. He had said (John 16:7) that it was good for them that he should go to the Father when the Holy Spirit will come through whom they will have fellowship with the Father and Christ.My God  (θεου μου). Jesus had said "My God" on the Cross (Mark 15:34). Note it also in Revelation 3:2. So Paul in Romans 15:6, etc., has "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
