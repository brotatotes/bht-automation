<p><b> And telleth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελλουσα</span></span>). Present active participle, "announcing."</p>
<p><b>I have seen the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hεωρακα τον κυριον</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>. She will always carry in her heart that vision (picture) of the Risen Christ. She tells this fact before she delivers Christ's message to the brethren of Christ.</p>
<p><b>How that </b>. No word in the Greek, but a conjunction like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> is implied. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hοτ</span></span> here is recitative. The disciples (brethren) did not believe Mary's story nor that of the other women (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:11">Luke 24:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:11">Mark 16:11</span>). Paul does not mention the vision to Mary or the women in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:5-7">1 Corinthians 15:5-7</span>. But Mary Magdalene was the first one to see the Risen Lord. </p>
