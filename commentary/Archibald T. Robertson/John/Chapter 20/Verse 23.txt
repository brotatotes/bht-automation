<p><b> Whosesoever sins ye forgive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν τινων αφητε τας αμαρτιας</span></span>). "If the sins of any ye forgive" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφητε</span></span>, second aorist active subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> in the sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span>), a condition of the third class. Precisely so with "retain" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατητε</span></span>, present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατεω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>They are forgiven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεωντα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιημ</span></span>, Doric perfect for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφειντα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Are retained </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεκρατηντα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατεω</span></span>. The power to forgive sin belongs only to God, but Jesus claimed to have this power and right (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:5-7">Mark 2:5-7</span>). What he commits to the disciples and to us is the power and privilege of giving assurance of the forgiveness of sins by God by correctly announcing the terms of forgiveness. There is no proof that he actually transferred to the apostles or their successors the power in and of themselves to forgive sins. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:18">Matthew 18:18</span> we have a similar use of the rabbinical metaphor of binding and loosing by proclaiming and teaching. Jesus put into the hands of Peter and of all believers the keys of the Kingdom which we should use to open the door for those who wish to enter. This glorious promise applies to all believers who will tell the story of Christ's love for men. </p>
