<p><b> We have seen the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εωρακαμεν τον κυριον</span></span>). The very language in the plural that Mary Magdalene had used (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:18">John 20:18</span>) when no one believed her.</p>
<p><b>Except I shall see </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη ιδω</span></span>). Negative condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and second aorist active subjunctive and so as to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλω</span></span>) "and put."</p>
<p><b>The print </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον τυπον</span></span>). The mark or stamp made by the nails, here the original idea. Various terms as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:44">Acts 7:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span>. Finally our "type" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:14">Romans 5:14</span>. Clearly the disciples had told Thomas that they had seen the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπον</span></span> of the nails in his hands and the spear in his side.</p>
<p><b>I will not believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη πιστευσω</span></span>). Strong refusal with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span> (doubtful negative) and first aorist active subjunctive (or future indicative). </p>
