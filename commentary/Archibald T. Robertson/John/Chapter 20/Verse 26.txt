<p><b> After eight days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθ' ημερας οκτω</span></span>). That is the next Sunday evening, on the eighth day in reality just like "after three days" and "on the third day."</p>
<p><b>Within </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσω</span></span>). Apparently in the same room as before.</p>
<p><b>Cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχετα</span></span>). Vivid dramatic present. The other items precisely as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:19">John 20:19</span> save Thomas was with them. </p>
