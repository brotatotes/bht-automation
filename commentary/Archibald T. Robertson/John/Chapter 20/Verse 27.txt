<p><b> Then saith he to Thomas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειτα λεγε τω Θομα</span></span>). Jesus turns directly to Thomas as if he had come expressly for his sake. He reveals his knowledge of the doubt in the mind of Thomas and mentions the very tests that he had named (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:25">John 20:25</span>).</p>
<p><b>Be not faithless </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη γινου απιστος</span></span>). Present middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span> in prohibition, "stop becoming disbelieving." The doubt of Thomas in the face of the witness of the others was not a proof of his superior intelligence. Sceptics usually pose as persons of unusual mentality. The medium who won Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to spiritualism has confessed that it was all humbug, but he deceived the gullible novelist. But Thomas had carried his incredulity too far. Note play on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιστος</span></span> (disbelieving) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστος</span></span> (believing). </p>
