<p><b> My Lord and my God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hο κυριος μου κα ο θεος μου</span></span>). Not exclamation, but address, the vocative case though the form of the nominative, a very common thing in the <i>Koine</i>. Thomas was wholly convinced and did not hesitate to address the Risen Christ as Lord and God. And Jesus accepts the words and praises Thomas for so doing. </p>
