<p><b> Thou hast believed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπιστευκας</span></span>). Perfect active indicative. Probably interrogative, but "it was <i>sight</i>, not <i>touch</i> that convinced Thomas" (Bernard).</p>
<p><b>And yet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>). Clear use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> in the adversative sense. Thomas made a noble confession, but he missed the highest form of faith without the evidence of the senses. Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:8">1 Peter 1:8</span>) uses language that seems like a reminiscence of the words of Jesus to Thomas which Peter heard. </p>
