<p><b> Many other signs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλα αλλα σημεια</span></span>). Not only those described in the Synoptic Gospels or referred to in general statements, but many alluded to in John's Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:45">John 4:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:37">John 12:37</span>).</p>
<p><b>Are not written </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν γεγραμμενα</span></span>). Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span>, do not stand written, are not described "in this book." John has made a selection of the vast number wrought by Jesus "in the presence of the disciples" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωπιον των μαθητων</span></span>), common idiom in Luke, not in Mark and Matthew, and by John elsewhere only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:22">1 John 3:22</span>. John's book is written with a purpose which he states. </p>
