<p><b> Are written </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγραπτα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span>, "have been written" by John.</p>
<p><b>That ye may believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα πιστευητε</span></span>). Purpose with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>, "that you may keep on believing." The book has had precisely this effect of continuous and successive confirmation of faith in Jesus Christ through the ages.</p>
<p><b>Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησους εστιν ο Χριστος ο υιος του θεου</span></span>). The man named Jesus is identical with the Messiah (the Anointed One) as opposed to the Cerinthian separation of the Jesus of history and the Christ (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αεον</span></span>) of theology. And the Docetic notion of a phantom body for Jesus with no actual human body is also false. Jesus is the Son of God with all that this high term implies, the Logos of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1-18">John 1:1-18</span> (the Prologue). "Very God of very God," Incarnate Revealer of God. But there is a further purpose.</p>
<p><b>And that believing ye may have life in his name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ινα πιστευοντες ζωην εχητε εν τω ονοματ αυτου</span></span>). Note present participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευοντες</span></span> (continuing to believe) and the present active subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχητε</span></span> (keep on having). "Life" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωην</span></span>) is eternal life so often mentioned in this Gospel, life to be found only in the name (and power) of Jesus Christ the Son of God. This verse constitutes a fitting close for this wonderful book and John may at first have intended to stop here. But before he published the work he added the Epilogue (Chapter XXI) which is written in the same style and gives a beautiful picture of the Risen Christ with a side-light on John and Peter (restored to fellowship). </p>
