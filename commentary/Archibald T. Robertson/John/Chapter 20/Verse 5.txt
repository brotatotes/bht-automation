<p><b> Stooping and looking in </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακυψας</span></span>). Originally to stoop and look, but in the LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+26:8">Genesis 26:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+5:28">Judges 5:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+6:4">1 Kings 6:4</span>, etc.) and the papyri rather just to peep in and so Field (<i>Ot. Norv</i>.) urges here. See also verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:11">John 20:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:12">Luke 24:12</span> (the verse bracketed by Westcott and Hort). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οθονια</span></span> (linen cloth) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:40">John 19:40</span>.</p>
<p><b>Lying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κειμενα</span></span>). Present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κειμα</span></span>, predicative accusative. John notices this fact at once. If the body had been removed, these clothes would have gone also. John's timid nature made him pause (yet, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεντο</span></span>, however). </p>
