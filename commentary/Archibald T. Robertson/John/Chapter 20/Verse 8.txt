<p><b> Then therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε ουν</span></span>). After Peter in time and influenced by the boldness of Peter.</p>
<p><b>And he saw and believed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ειδεν κα επιστευσεν</span></span>). Both aorist active indicative (second and first). Peter saw more after he entered than John did in his first glance, but John saw into the meaning of it all better than Peter. Peter had more sight, John more insight. John was the first to believe that Jesus was risen from the tomb even before he saw him. According to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:12">Luke 24:12</span> Peter went away "wondering" still. The Sinaitic Syriac and 69 and 124 wrongly read here "they believed." John was evidently proud to be able to record this great moment when he believed without seeing in contrast to Thomas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:29">John 20:29</span>). Peter and John did not see the angels. </p>
