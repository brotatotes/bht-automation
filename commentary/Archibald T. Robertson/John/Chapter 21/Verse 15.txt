<p><b> Lovest thou me more than these? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαις με πλεον τουτων;</span></span>). Ablative case of comparison <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span> (disciples) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεον</span></span>. Peter had even boasted that he would stand by Christ though all men forsook him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:29">Mark 14:29</span>). We do not know what passed between Jesus and Peter when Jesus first appeared to him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:34">Luke 24:34</span>). But here Christ probes the inmost recesses of Peter's heart to secure the humility necessary for service.</p>
<p><b>I love thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλω συ</span></span>). Peter makes no claim here to superior love and passes by the "more than these" and does not even use Christ's word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαω</span></span> for high and devoted love, but the humbler word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλεω</span></span> for love as a friend. He insists that Christ knows this in spite of his conduct.</p>
<p><b>Feed my lambs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βοσκε τα αρνια μου</span></span>). For the old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βοσκω</span></span> (to feed as a herdsman) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:33">Matthew 8:33</span>. Present active imperative here. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αρνια</span></span> is a diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρνος</span></span> (lamb). </p>
