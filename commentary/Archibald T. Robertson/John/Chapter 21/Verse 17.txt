<p><b> Lovest thou me? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλεις με;</span></span>). This time Jesus picks up the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλεω</span></span> used by Peter and challenges that. These two words are often interchanged in the N.T., but here the distinction is preserved. Peter was cut to the heart (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελυπηθη</span></span>, first aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυπεω</span></span>, to grieve) because Jesus challenges this very verb, and no doubt the third question vividly reminds him of the three denials in the early morning by the fire. He repeats his love for Jesus with the plea: "Thou knowest all things."</p>
<p><b>Feed my sheep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βοσκε τα προβατια</span></span>). Many MSS. both here and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:16">John 21:16</span> read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προβατα</span></span> (sheep) instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προβατια</span></span> (little sheep or lambs). </p>
