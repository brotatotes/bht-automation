<p><b> By what manner of death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιω θανατω</span></span>). Undoubtedly John, who is writing long after Peter's death, seems to mean that Peter was to die (and did die) a martyr's death. "Whither thou wouldest not." There is a tradition that Peter met death by crucifixion and asked to be crucified head downwards, but that is not made plain here. </p>
