<p><b> There were together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν ομου</span></span>). These seven (Peter, Thomas, Nathanael, the sons of Zebedee, and two others). We know that the sons of Zebedee were James and John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:21">Matthew 4:21</span>), mentioned by name nowhere in John's Gospel, apparently because John is the author. We do not know who the "two others of his disciples" were, possibly Andrew and Philip. It seems to me to be crass criticism in spite of Harnack and Bernard to identify the incident here with that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:1-11">Luke 5:1-11</span>. There are a few points of similarity, but the differences are too great for such identification even with a hypothetical common source. </p>
