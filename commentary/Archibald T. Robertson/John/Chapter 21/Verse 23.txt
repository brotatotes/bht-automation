<p><b> That that disciple should not die </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ο μαθητης εκεινος ουκ αποθνησκε</span></span>) (present active indicative), because Peter or others misunderstood what Jesus meant as John now carefully explains. He was rebuking Peter's curiosity, not affirming that John would live on till the Master returned. John is anxious to set this matter right. </p>
