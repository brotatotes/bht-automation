<p><b> That is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος εστιν</span></span>). The one just mentioned in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:20">John 21:20</span>, "the disciple whom Jesus loved."</p>
<p><b>And wrote these things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο γραψας ταυτα</span></span>). Here there is a definite statement that the Beloved Disciple wrote this book.</p>
<p><b>We know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδαμεν</span></span>). The plural here seems intentional as the identification and endorsement of a group of disciples who know the author and wish to vouch for his identity and for the truthfulness of his witness. Probably we see here a verse added by a group of elders in Ephesus where John had long laboured. </p>
