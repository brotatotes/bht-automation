<p><b> If they should be written every one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν γραφητα καθ' εν</span></span>). Condition of the third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and present passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span>, "If they should be written one by one" (in full detail).</p>
<p><b>I suppose </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιμα</span></span>). Note change back to the first person singular by the author.</p>
<p><b>Would not contain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδ' αυτον τον κοσμον χωρησειν</span></span>). Future active infinitive in indirect discourse after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιμα</span></span>. This is, of course, natural hyperbole, but graphically pictures for us the vastness of the work and words of Jesus from which the author has made a small selection (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:30">John 20:30</span>) and by which he has produced what is, all things considered, the greatest of all the books produced by man, the eternal gospel from the eagle who soars to the very heavens and gives us a glimpse of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. </p>
