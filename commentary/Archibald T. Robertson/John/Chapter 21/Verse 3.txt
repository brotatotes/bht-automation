<p><b> I go a fishing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαγω αλιευειν</span></span>). The present active infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλιευειν</span></span> expresses purpose as often. It is a late verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλιευς</span></span> (fisherman) and occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+16:16">Jeremiah 16:16</span>, in Philo, Plutarch, and one papyrus. Peter's proposal was a natural one. He had been a fisherman by practice and they were probably waiting in Galilee for the appointed meeting with Christ on the mountain. Andrew and Peter, James and John were fishermen also. Peter's proposition met a ready response from all.</p>
