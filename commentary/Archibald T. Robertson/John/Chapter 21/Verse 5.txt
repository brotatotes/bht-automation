 Children  (Παιδια). Diminutive of παις and used here alone by Jesus in addressing his disciples. It is a colloquial expression like "my boys." The aged Apostle John uses it in 1 John 2:13; 1 John 2:18.Have ye aught to eat?  (μη τ προσφαγιον εχετε;). The negative answer is expected by this polite inquiry as in John 4:29. The rare and late word προσφαγιον from the root φαγ (εσθιω, to eat) and προς (in addition) was used for a relish with bread and then for fish as here. So in the papyri. Nowhere else in the N.T.
