<p><b> Children </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παιδια</span></span>). Diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παις</span></span> and used here alone by Jesus in addressing his disciples. It is a colloquial expression like "my boys." The aged Apostle John uses it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13">1 John 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span>.</p>
<p><b>Have ye aught to eat? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη τ προσφαγιον εχετε;</span></span>). The negative answer is expected by this polite inquiry as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:29">John 4:29</span>. The rare and late word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσφαγιον</span></span> from the root <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαγ</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσθιω</span></span>, to eat) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> (in addition) was used for a relish with bread and then for fish as here. So in the papyri. Nowhere else in the N.T. </p>
