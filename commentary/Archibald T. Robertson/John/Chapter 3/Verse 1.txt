Nicodemus is an instance of Christ's knowledge of men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:25">John 2:25</span>) and of one to whom he did trust himself unlike those in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:24">John 2:24</span>.

<p><b>Named Nicodemus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Νικοδημος ονομα</span></span>).
