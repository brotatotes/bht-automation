<p><b> The teacher of Israel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο διδασκαλος του Ισραηλ</span></span>). The well-known or the authorized (the accepted) teacher of the Israel of God. Note both articles.</p>
<p><b>And understandest not these things? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ταυτα ου γινωσκεισ;</span></span>). After being told by Jesus and after so propitious a start. His Pharisaic theology had made him almost proof against spiritual apprehension. It was outside of his groove (rote, rut, rot, the three terrible r's of mere traditionalism). </p>
