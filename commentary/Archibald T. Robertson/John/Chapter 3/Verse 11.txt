<p><b> We speak that we do know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο οιδαμεν λαλουμεν</span></span>). Jesus simply claims knowledge of what he has tried to make plain to the famous Rabbi without success. John uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span> some 60 times, half of them by Jesus, very little distinction existing between the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span> in John. Originally <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span> referred to the chatter of birds. Note John's frequent use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμην αμην</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span> (double emphasis).</p>
<p><b>And bear witness of that we have seen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο εωρακαμεν μαρτυρουμεν</span></span>). The same use of neuter singular relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> as before. Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>. He is not a dreamer, guesser, or speculator. He is bearing witness from personal knowledge, strange as this may seem to Nicodemus.</p>
<p><b>And ye receive not our witness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα την μαρτυριαν ημων ου λαμβανετε</span></span>). This is the tragedy of the matter as John has shown (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:26">John 1:26</span>) and as will continue to be true even today. Jesus probably associates here with himself ("we") those who have personal experience of grace and so are qualified as witnesses. Note the plural in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>. Bernard thinks that John has here read into the words of Jesus the convictions of a later age, a serious charge to make. </p>
