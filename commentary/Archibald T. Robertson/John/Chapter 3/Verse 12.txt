<p><b> If I told </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε ειπον</span></span>). Condition of the first class, assumed to be true.</p>
<p><b>Earthly things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα επιγεια</span></span>). Things upon the earth like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα επ της γης</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:2">Colossians 3:2</span>), not things of an earthly nature or worldly or sinful. The work of the kingdom of God including the new birth which Nicodemus did not understand belongs to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα επιγεια</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>If I tell you heavenly things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ειπω υμιν τα επουρανια</span></span>). Condition of the third class, undetermined. What will Nicodemus do in that case? By <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα επουρανια</span></span> Jesus means the things that take place in heaven like the deep secrets of the purpose of God in the matter of redemption such as the necessity of the lifting up of Christ as shown in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14">John 3:14</span>. Both Godet and Westcott note that the two types of teaching here pointed out by Jesus (the earthly, the heavenly) correspond in general to the difference between the Synoptics (the earthly) and the Fourth Gospel (the heavenly), a difference noted here in the Fourth Gospel as shown by Jesus himself. Hence the one should not be pitted against the other. There are specimens of the heavenly in the Synoptics as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:18">Luke 10:18</span>. </p>
