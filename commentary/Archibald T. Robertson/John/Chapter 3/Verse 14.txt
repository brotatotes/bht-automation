<p><b> Moses lifted up the serpent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μωυσης υψωσεν τον οφιν</span></span>). Reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+21:7">Numbers 21:7</span> where Moses set the brazen serpent upon the standard that those who believed might look and live. Jesus draws a vivid parallel between the act of Moses and the Cross on which he himself (the Son of man) "must" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>, one of the heavenly things) "be lifted up" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υψωθηνα</span></span>, first aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υψοω</span></span>, a word not used about the brazen serpent). In John <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υψοω</span></span> always refers to the Cross (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:28">John 8:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:32">John 12:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:34">John 12:34</span>), though to the Ascension in Acts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:33">Acts 2:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:31">Acts 5:31</span>). Jesus is complimenting the standing and intelligence of Nicodemus as "the teacher of Israel" by telling him this great truth and fact that lies at the basis of the work of the kingdom of God (the atoning death of Christ on the Cross). </p>
