<p><b> That whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα πας ο πιστευων εν αυτω εχη ζωην αιωνιον</span></span>). Final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> with present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>, that he may keep on having eternal life (a frequent phrase in John, always in John <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιωνιος</span></span> occurs with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωη</span></span>, 16 times in the Gospel, 6 in 1John, ageless or endless life, beginning now and lasting forever). It is more than endless, for it is sharing in the life of God in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:26">John 5:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:12">1 John 5:12</span>). So here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτω</span></span> (in him) is taken with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχη</span></span> rather than with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευων</span></span>. The interview with Nicodemus apparently closes with verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:15">John 3:15</span>. In verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16-21">John 3:16-21</span> we have past tenses constantly as is natural for the reflection of John, but unnatural for Jesus speaking. There are phrases like the Prologue (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9-11">John 1:9-11</span>). "Only begotten" does not occur elsewhere in the words of Jesus, but is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9">1 John 4:9</span>. John often puts in explanatory comments (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16-18">John 1:16-18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:37-41">John 12:37-41</span>). </p>
