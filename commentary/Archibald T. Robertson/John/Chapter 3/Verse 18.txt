<p><b> Is not judged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου κρινετα</span></span>). Present passive indicative. Trust in Christ prevents condemnation, for he takes our place and pays the penalty for sin for all who put their case in his hands (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:32">Romans 8:32</span>). The believer in Christ as Saviour does not come into judgment (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>).</p>
<p><b>Hath been judged already </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη κεκριτα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>. Judgment has already been passed on the one who refuses to believe in Christ as the Saviour sent by the Father, the man who is not willing to come to Christ for life (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:40">John 5:40</span>).</p>
<p><b>Because he hath not believed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ μη πεπιστευκεν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>, has taken a permanent attitude of refusal. Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ μη</span></span> states the reason subjectively as the judgment of the Judge in any such case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μη πιστευων</span></span> already mentioned) while in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:10">1 John 5:10</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ου πεπιστευκεν</span></span> gives the reason objectively (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>) conceived as an actual case and no longer hypothetical. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:12">John 1:12</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ονομα</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span> (believing on the name) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονογενους</span></span> (only begotten) and also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>. </p>
