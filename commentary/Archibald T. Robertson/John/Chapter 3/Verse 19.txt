<p><b> And this is the judgment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτη δε εστιν η κρισις</span></span>). A thoroughly Johannine phrase for sequence of thought (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:12">John 15:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:11">1 John 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:14">1 John 5:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:6">3 John 1:6</span>). It is more precisely the process of judging (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρι-σις</span></span>) rather than the result (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρι-μα</span></span>) of the judgment. "It is no arbitrary sentence, but the working out of a moral law" (Bernard).</p>
<p><b>The light is come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το φως εληλυθεν</span></span>). Second perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, a permanent result as already explained in the Prologue concerning the Incarnation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:5">John 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span>). Jesus is the Light of the world.</p>
<p><b>Loved darkness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγαπησαν το σκοτος</span></span>). Job (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+24:13">Job 24:13</span>) spoke of men rebelling against the light. Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το σκοτος</span></span>, common word for moral and spiritual darkness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:5">1 Thessalonians 5:5</span>), though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η σκοτια</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:5">John 1:5</span>. "Darkness" is common in John as a metaphor for the state of sinners (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:35">John 12:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:46">John 12:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:6">1 John 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:8">1 John 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:9">1 John 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:11">1 John 2:11</span>). Jesus himself is the only moral and spiritual light of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>) as he dared claim to his enemies. The pathos of it all is that men fall in love with the darkness of sin and rebel against the light like denizens of the underworld, "for their works were evil (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονηρα</span></span>)." When the light appears, they scatter to their holes and dens. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πονηρος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονος</span></span>, toil, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονεω</span></span>, to toil) is used of the deeds of the world by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:7">John 7:7</span>). In the end the god of this world blinds men's eyes so that they do not see the light (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>). The fish in the Mammoth Cave have no longer eyes, but only sockets where eyes used to be. The evil one has a powerful grip on the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:19">1 John 5:19</span>). </p>
