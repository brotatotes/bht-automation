<p><b> The same </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>). "This one."</p>
<p><b>By night </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυκτος</span></span>). Genitive of time. That he came at all is remarkable, not because there was any danger as was true at a later period, but because of his own prominence. He wished to avoid comment by other members of the Sanhedrin and others. Jesus had already provoked the opposition of the ecclesiastics by his assumption of Messianic authority over the temple. There is no ground for assigning this incident to a later period, for it suits perfectly here. Jesus was already in the public eye (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>) and the interest of Nicodemus was real and yet he wished to be cautious.</p>
<p><b>Rabbi </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ραββε</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:38">John 1:38</span>. Technically Jesus was not an acknowledged Rabbi of the schools, but Nicodemus does recognize him as such and calls him "My Master" just as Andrew and John did (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:38">John 1:38</span>). It was a long step for Nicodemus as a Pharisee to take, for the Pharisees had closely scrutinized the credentials of the Baptist in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19-24">John 1:19-24</span> (Milligan and Moulton's <i>Comm</i>.).</p>
<p><b>We know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδαμεν</span></span>). Second perfect indicative first person plural. He seems to speak for others of his class as the blind man does in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:31">John 9:31</span>. Westcott thinks that Nicodemus has been influenced partly by the report of the commission sent to the Baptist (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19-27">John 1:19-27</span>).</p>
<p><b>Thou art a teacher come from God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο θεου εληλυθας διδασκαλος</span></span>). "Thou hast come from God as a teacher." Second perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span> and predicative nominative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκαλος</span></span>. This is the explanation of Nicodemus for coming to Jesus, obscure Galilean peasant as he seemed, evidence that satisfied one of the leaders in Pharisaism.</p>
<p><b>Can do </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνατα ποιειν</span></span>). "Can go on doing" (present active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span> and so linear).</p>
<p><b>These signs that thou doest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτα τα σημεια α συ ποιεις</span></span>). Those mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span> that convinced so many in the crowd and that now appeal to the scholar. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ</span></span> (thou) as quite out of the ordinary. The scorn of Jesus by the rulers held many back to the end (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:42">John 12:42</span>), but Nicodemus dares to feel his way.</p>
<p><b>Except God be with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη η ο θεος μετ' αυτου</span></span>). Condition of the third class, presented as a probability, not as a definite fact. He wanted to know more of the teaching accredited thus by God. Jesus went about doing good because God was with him, Peter says (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:38">Acts 10:38</span>). </p>
