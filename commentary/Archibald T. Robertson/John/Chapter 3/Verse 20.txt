<p><b> That doeth ill </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο φαυλα πρασσων</span></span>). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαυλος</span></span> means first worthless and then wicked (usually so in N.T.) and both senses occur in the papyri. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span> see contrast between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθα ποιεω</span></span> (doing good things) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαυλα πρασσω</span></span> (practising evil things).</p>
<p><b>Hateth the light </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισε το φως</span></span>). Hence talks against it, ridicules Christ, Christianity, churches, preachers, etc. Does it in talk, magazines, books, in a supercilious tone of sheer ignorance.</p>
<p><b>Cometh not to the light </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ερχετα προς το φως</span></span>). The light hurts his eyes, reveals his own wickedness, makes him thoroughly uncomfortable. Hence he does not read the Bible, he does not come to church, he does not pray. He goes on in deeper darkness.</p>
<p><b>Lest his works should be reproved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη ελεγχθη τα εργα αυτου</span></span>). Negative final clause (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη</span></span>) with first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγχω</span></span>, old word to correct a fault, to reprove, to convict. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:46">John 8:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:8">John 16:8</span>. To escape this unpleasant process the evil man cuts out Christ. </p>
