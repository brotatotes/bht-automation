<p><b> John was also baptizing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην δε κα ο Ιωανης βαπτιζων</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect picturing the continued activity of the Baptist simultaneous with the growing work of Jesus. There was no real rivalry except in people's minds.</p>
<p><b>In Aenon near to Salim </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Αινων εγγυς του Σαλειμ</span></span>). It is not clearly known where this place was. Eusebius locates it in the Jordan valley south of Beisan west of the river where are many springs (fountains, eyes). There is a place called Salim east of Shechem in Samaria with a village called 'Aimen, but with no water there. There may have been water there then, of course.</p>
<p><b>Because there was much water there </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ υδατα πολλα ην εκε</span></span>). "Because many waters were there." Not for drinking, but for baptizing. "Therefore even in summer baptism by immersion could be continued" (Marcus Dods).</p>
<p><b>And they came, and were baptized </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα παρεγινοντο κα εβαπτιζοντο</span></span>). Imperfects both, one middle and the other passive, graphically picturing the long procession of pilgrims who came to John confessing their sins and receiving baptism at his hands. </p>
