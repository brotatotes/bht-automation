<p><b> A questioning </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητησις</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητεω</span></span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:2">Acts 15:2</span> for the word where also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητημα</span></span> (question) occurs. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ζητησις</span></span> (process of inquiry) means a meticulous dispute (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:4">1 Timothy 6:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>With a Jew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα Ιουδαιου</span></span>). So correct text, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιουδαιων</span></span> (Jews). Probably some Jew resented John's baptism of Jesus as implying impurity or that they were like Gentiles (cf. proselyte baptism).</p>
<p><b>About purifying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ καθαρισμου</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:6">John 2:6</span> for the word. The committee from the Sanhedrin had challenged John's right to baptize (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:25">John 1:25</span>). The Jews had various kinds of baptisms or dippings (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:2">Hebrews 6:2</span>), "baptisms of cups and pots and brazen vessels" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:4">Mark 6:4</span>). The disciples of John came to him with the dispute (the first known baptismal controversy, on the meaning of the ceremony) and with a complaint. </p>
