<p><b> Rabbi </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ραββε</span></span>). Greeting John just like Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:38">John 1:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:2">John 3:2</span>).</p>
<p><b>Beyond Jordan </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περαν του Ιορδανου</span></span>). Evident reference to John's witness to Jesus told in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29-34">John 1:29-34</span>.</p>
<p><b>To whom thou hast borne witness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω συ μεμαρτυρηκας</span></span>). Note avoidance of calling the name of Jesus. Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρεω</span></span> so common in John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:7">John 1:7</span>, etc.). These disciples of John are clearly jealous of Jesus as a rival of John and they distinctly blame John for his endorsement of one who is already eclipsing him in popularity.</p>
<p><b>The same baptizeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος βαπτιζε</span></span>). "This one is baptizing." Not personally (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:2">John 4:2</span>), as John did, but through his six disciples.</p>
<p><b>And all men come to him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα παντες ερχοντα προς αυτον</span></span>). Linear present middle indicative, "are coming." The sight of the growing crowds with Jesus and the dwindling crowds with John stirred John's followers to keenest jealousy. What a life-like picture of ministerial jealousy in all ages. </p>
