<p><b> Except it have been given him from heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη η δεδομενον αυτω εκ του ουρανου</span></span>). See the same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:65">John 6:65</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:11">John 19:11</span>). Condition of third class, undetermined with prospect of determination, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη</span></span> with the periphrastic perfect passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>. The perfect tense is rare in the subjunctive and an exact rendering into English is awkward, "unless it be granted him from heaven." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:7">1 Corinthians 4:7</span> where Paul says the same thing. </p>
