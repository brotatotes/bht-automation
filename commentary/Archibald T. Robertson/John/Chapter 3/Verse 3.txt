<p><b> Except a man be born anew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη τις γεννηθη ανωθεν</span></span>). Another condition of the third class, undetermined but with prospect of determination. First aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενναω</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ανωθεν</span></span>. Originally "from above" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:38">Mark 15:38</span>), then "from heaven" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:31">John 3:31</span>), then "from the first" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:3">Luke 1:3</span>), and then "again" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν ανωθεν</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:9">Galatians 4:9</span>). Which is the meaning here? The puzzle of Nicodemus shows (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευτερον</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:4">John 3:4</span>) that he took it as "again," a second birth from the womb. The Vulgate translates it by <i>renatus fuerit denuo</i>. But the misapprehension of Nicodemus does not prove the meaning of Jesus. In the other passages in John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:31">John 3:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:11">John 19:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:23">John 19:23</span>) the meaning is "from above" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεσυπερ</span></span>) and usually so in the Synoptics. It is a second birth, to be sure, regeneration, but a birth from above by the Spirit.</p>
<p><b>He cannot see the kingdom of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου δυνατα ιδειν την βασιλειαν του θεου</span></span>). To participate in it as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:27">Luke 9:27</span>. For this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδειν</span></span> (second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:51">John 8:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:7">Revelation 18:7</span>. </p>
