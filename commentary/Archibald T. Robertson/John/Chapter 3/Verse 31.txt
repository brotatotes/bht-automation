<p><b> Is above all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επανω παντων</span></span>). Ablative case with the compound preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επανω</span></span>. See the same idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>. Here we have the comments of Evangelist (John) concerning the last words of John in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:30">John 3:30</span> which place Jesus above himself. He is above all men, not alone above the Baptist. Bernard follows those who treat verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:31-36">John 3:31-36</span> as dislocated and put them after verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:21">John 3:21</span> (the interview with Nicodemus), but they suit better here.</p>
<p><b>Of the earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ της γης</span></span>). John is fond of this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> for origin and source of character as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:46">John 1:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:5">1 John 4:5</span>. Jesus is the one that comes out of heaven (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εκ του ουρανου ερχομενος</span></span>) as he has shown in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1-18">John 1:1-18</span>. Hence he is "above all." </p>
