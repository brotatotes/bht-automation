 Is above all  (επανω παντων). Ablative case with the compound preposition επανω. See the same idea in Romans 9:5. Here we have the comments of Evangelist (John) concerning the last words of John in verse John 3:30 which place Jesus above himself. He is above all men, not alone above the Baptist. Bernard follows those who treat verses John 3:31-36 as dislocated and put them after verse John 3:21 (the interview with Nicodemus), but they suit better here.Of the earth  (εκ της γης). John is fond of this use of εκ for origin and source of character as in John 1:46; 1 John 4:5. Jesus is the one that comes out of heaven (ο εκ του ουρανου ερχομενος) as he has shown in John 1:1-18. Hence he is "above all."
