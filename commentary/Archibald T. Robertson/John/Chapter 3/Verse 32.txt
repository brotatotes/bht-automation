<p><b> What he hath seen and heard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εωρακεν κα ηκουσεν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative followed by aorist active indicative, because, as Westcott shows, the first belongs to the very existence of the Son and the latter to his mission. There is no confusion of tenses here.</p>
<p><b>No man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεις</span></span>). There were crowds coming to Jesus, but they do not really accept him as Saviour and Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:24">John 2:24</span>). It is superficial as time will show. But "no one" is not to be pressed too far, for it is the rhetorical use. </p>
