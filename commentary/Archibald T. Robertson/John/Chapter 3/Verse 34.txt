<p><b> The words of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα ρηματα του θεου</span></span>). God sent his Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:17">John 3:17</span>) and he speaks God's words.</p>
<p><b>By measure </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ μετρου</span></span>). That is God has put no limit to the Spirit's relation to the Son. God has given the Holy Spirit in his fulness to Christ and to no one else in that sense. </p>
