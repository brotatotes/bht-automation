<p><b> Hath eternal life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχε ζωην αιωνιον</span></span>). Has it here and now and for eternity.</p>
<p><b>That obeyeth not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο απειθων</span></span>). "He that is disobedient to the Son." Jesus is the test of human life as Simeon said he would be (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34">Luke 2:34</span>). This verb does not occur again in John's Gospel. </p>
