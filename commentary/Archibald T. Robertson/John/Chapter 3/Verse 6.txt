<p><b> That which is born </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το γεγεννημενον</span></span>). Perfect passive articular participle. The sharp contrast between flesh (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρξ</span></span>) and Spirit (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span>), drawn already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:13">John 1:13</span>, serves to remind Nicodemus of the crudity of his question in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:4">John 3:4</span> about a second physical birth. </p>
