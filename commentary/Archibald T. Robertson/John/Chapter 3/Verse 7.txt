 Marvel not  (μη θαυμασηις). "Do not begin to wonder" (ingressive first aorist active subjunctive with μη), as clearly Nicodemus had done. In John the word θαυμαζω usually means "unintelligent wonder" (Bernard).Ye must be born anew  (δε υμας γεννηθηνα ανωθεν). Jesus repeats the point in verse John 3:3 (δε and the infinitive instead of εαν μη and the subjunctive) with ανωθεν (from above) only and not εξ υδατος.
