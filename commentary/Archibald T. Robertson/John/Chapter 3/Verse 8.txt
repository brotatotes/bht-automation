<p><b> The wind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πνευμα</span></span>). In Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span> means either wind or spirit as <i>spiritus</i> does in Latin (so also in Hebrew and Syriac). Wycliff follows the Latin and keeps spirit here and Marcus Dods argues for it. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span> occurs 370 times in the N.T. and never means wind elsewhere except in a quotation from the O.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:7">Hebrews 1:7</span> from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+104:4">Psalms 104:4</span>), though common in the LXX. On the other hand <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνεω</span></span> (bloweth, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνε</span></span>) occurs five times elsewhere in the N.T. and always of the wind (like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:18">John 6:18</span>). So <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνη</span></span> can be either sound (as of wind) or voice (as of the Spirit). In simple truth either sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span> can be taken here as one wills. Tholuck thinks that the night-wind swept through the narrow street as Jesus spoke. In either case the etymology of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span> is "wind" from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνεω</span></span>, to blow. The Spirit is the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span> as metaphor. Certainly the conclusion "of the Spirit" is a direct reference to the Holy Spirit who works his own way beyond our comprehension even as men even yet do not know the law of the wind. </p>
