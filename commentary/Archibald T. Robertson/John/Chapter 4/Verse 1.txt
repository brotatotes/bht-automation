<p><b> When therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hως ουν</span></span>). Reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:22">John 3:22</span>. the work of the Baptist and the jealousy of his disciples. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ουν</span></span> is very common in John's Gospel in such transitions.</p>
<p><b>The Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Κυριος</span></span>). So the best manuscripts (Neutral Alexandrian), though the Western class has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Ιησους</span></span>. Mark usually has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Ιησους</span></span> and Luke often <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Κυριος</span></span>. In the narrative portion of John we have usually <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Ιησους</span></span>, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Κυριος</span></span> in five passages (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:1">John 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:23">John 6:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:2">John 11:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:20">John 20:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:12">John 21:12</span>). There is no reason why John should not apply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Κυριος</span></span> to Jesus in the narrative sections as well as Luke. Bernard argues that these are "explanatory glosses," not in the first draft of the Gospel. But why? When John wrote his Gospel he certainly held Jesus to be <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span> (Lord) as Luke did earlier when he wrote both Gospel and Acts This is hypercriticism.</p>
<p><b>Knew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγνω</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>. The Pharisees knew this obvious fact. It was easy for Jesus to know the attitude of the Pharisees about it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:24">John 2:24</span>). Already the Pharisees are suspicious of Jesus.</p>
<p><b>How that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). Declarative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> (indirect assertion).</p>
<p><b>Was making and baptizing more disciples than John </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλειονας μαθητας ποιε κα βαπτιζε η Ιωανης</span></span>). Present active indicative in both verbs retained in indirect discourse. Recall the tremendous success of John's early ministry (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:5">Mark 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:5">Matthew 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:7">Luke 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:15">Luke 3:15</span>) in order to see the significance of this statement that Jesus had forged ahead of him in popular favour. Already the Pharisees had turned violently against John who had called them broods of vipers. It is most likely that they drew John out about the marriage of Herod Antipas and got him involved directly with the tetrarch so as to have him cast into prison (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:19">Luke 3:19</span>). Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. XVIII. v. 2) gives a public reason for this act of Herod Antipas, the fear that John would "raise a rebellion," probably the public reason for his private vengeance as given by Luke. Apparently John was cast into prison, though recently still free (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:24">John 3:24</span>), before Jesus left for Galilee. The Pharisees, with John out of the way, turn to Jesus with envy and hate. </p>
