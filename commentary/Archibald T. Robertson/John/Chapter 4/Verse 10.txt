<p><b> Answered and said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκριθη κα ειπεν</span></span>). As often (redundant) in John. The first aorist passive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκριθη</span></span>) is deponent, no longer passive in sense.</p>
<p><b>If thou knewest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε ηιδεις</span></span>). Condition of second class, determined as unfulfilled, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and past perfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηιδεις</span></span> (used as imperfect) in condition and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and aorist active indicative in conclusion (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν ηιτησας κα αν εδωκεν</span></span>, note repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span>, not always done).</p>
<p><b>The gift of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την δωρεαν του θεου</span></span>). Naturally the gift mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span> (Westcott), the inexpressible gift (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:15">2 Corinthians 9:15</span>). Some take it to refer to the living water below, but that is another allusion (metaphor) to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:7">Ephesians 4:7</span> for Paul's use of both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωρεα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>, to give).</p>
<p><b>Who it is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις εστιν</span></span>). She only knew that he was a Jew. This Messianic self-consciousness of Jesus is plain in John, but it is early in the Synoptics also.</p>
<p><b>Living water </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υδωρ ζων</span></span>). Running water like a spring or well supplied by springs. This Jacob's Well was filled by water from rains percolating through, a sort of cistern, good water, but not equal to a real spring which was always preferred (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+26:19">Genesis 26:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+14:5">Leviticus 14:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:17">Numbers 19:17</span>). Jesus, of course, is symbolically referring to himself as the Living Water though he does not say it in plain words as he does about the Living Bread (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span>). The phrase "the fountain of life" occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:14">Proverbs 13:14</span>. Jesus supplies the water of life (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:17">Revelation 7:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span>. </p>
