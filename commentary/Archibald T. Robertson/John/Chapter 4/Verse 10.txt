 Answered and said  (απεκριθη κα ειπεν). As often (redundant) in John. The first aorist passive (απεκριθη) is deponent, no longer passive in sense.If thou knewest  (ε ηιδεις). Condition of second class, determined as unfulfilled, ε and past perfect ηιδεις (used as imperfect) in condition and αν and aorist active indicative in conclusion (αν ηιτησας κα αν εδωκεν, note repetition of αν, not always done).The gift of God  (την δωρεαν του θεου). Naturally the gift mentioned in John 3:16 (Westcott), the inexpressible gift (2 Corinthians 9:15). Some take it to refer to the living water below, but that is another allusion (metaphor) to John 3:16. See Ephesians 4:7 for Paul's use of both χαρις and δωρεα (from διδωμ, to give).Who it is  (τις εστιν). She only knew that he was a Jew. This Messianic self-consciousness of Jesus is plain in John, but it is early in the Synoptics also.Living water  (υδωρ ζων). Running water like a spring or well supplied by springs. This Jacob's Well was filled by water from rains percolating through, a sort of cistern, good water, but not equal to a real spring which was always preferred (Genesis 26:19; Leviticus 14:5; Numbers 19:17). Jesus, of course, is symbolically referring to himself as the Living Water though he does not say it in plain words as he does about the Living Bread (John 6:51). The phrase "the fountain of life" occurs in Proverbs 13:14. Jesus supplies the water of life (John 7:39). Cf. Revelation 7:17; Revelation 22:1.
