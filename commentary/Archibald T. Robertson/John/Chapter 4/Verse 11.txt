<p><b> Sir </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριε</span></span>). So it has to mean here in the mouth of the Samaritan woman, not Lord.</p>
<p><b>Thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτε αντλημα εχεις κα το φρεαρ εστιν βαθυ</span></span>). This broken construction of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτε-κα</span></span> (neither--and) occurs in N.T. elsewhere only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:10">3 John 1:10</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αντλημα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντλεω</span></span>, to draw) is a late word for that which is drawn, then (Plutarch) for the act of drawing, and then for the rope as here to draw with. This well (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρεαρ</span></span>) is 100 feet deep and Jesus had no rope. The bucket of skin ("with three cross sticks at the mouth to keep it open," Vincent) was kept at the well to be let down by a goat's hair rope.</p>
<p><b>That living water </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το υδωρ το ζων</span></span>). "The water the living," with the article referring to the language of Jesus in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:10">John 4:10</span>. She is still thinking only of literal water. </p>
