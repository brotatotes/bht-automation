<p><b> Sir </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριε</span></span>). Not yet "Lord" for her. See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:11">John 4:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>This water </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο το υδωρ</span></span>). This peculiar kind of water. She did not grasp the last phrase "unto life eternal," and speaks half ironically of "this water."</p>
<p><b>That I thirst not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη διψω</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>, alluding to the words of Jesus, water that will prevent thirst.</p>
<p><b>Neither come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδε διερχωμα</span></span>). Carrying on the negative purpose with present middle subjunctive, "nor keep on coming" as she has to do once or twice every day. She is evidently puzzled and yet attracted. </p>
