<p><b> Go, call thy husband </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυπαγε φωνησον σου τον ανδρα</span></span>). Two imperatives (present active, first aorist active). Had she started to leave after her perplexed reply? Her frequent trips to the well were partly for her husband. We may not have all the conversation preserved, but clearly Jesus by this sudden sharp turn gives the woman a conviction of sin and guilt without which she cannot understand his use of water as a metaphor for eternal life. </p>
