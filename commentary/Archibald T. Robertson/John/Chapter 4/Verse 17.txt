<p><b> I have no husband </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εχω ανδρα</span></span>). The Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηρ</span></span> means either "man" or "husband." She had her "man," but he was not a legal "husband." Her language veils her deceit.</p>
<p><b>Thou saidst well </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλως ειπες</span></span>). Jesus saw through the double sense of her language and read her heart as he only can do, a supernatural gift of which John often speaks (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:48">John 1:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:24">John 2:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:20">John 5:20</span>).</p>
<p><b>For thou hast had five husbands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεντε γαρ ανδρας εσχες</span></span>). "For thou didst have five men." Second aorist (constative) active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Is not thy husband </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν σου ανηρ</span></span>). In the full and legal sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηρ</span></span>, not a mere "man."</p>
<p><b>This hast thou said truly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο αληθες ειρηκας</span></span>). "This a true thing thou hast said." Note absence of article with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθες</span></span> (predicate accusative). Perfect active indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρηκας</span></span> here, not aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπες</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:17">John 4:17</span>). </p>
