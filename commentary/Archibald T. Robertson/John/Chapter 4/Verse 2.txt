<p><b> Although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιτοιγε Ιησους αυτος ουκ εβαπτιζεν αλλ' ο μαθητα αυτου</span></span>). Parenthetical explanation that applies also to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:22">John 3:22</span>. Imperfect tense means that it was not the habit of Jesus. This is the only N.T. instance of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιτοιγε</span></span> (and yet indeed), compound conjunction (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιτο</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:17">Acts 14:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:3">Hebrews 4:3</span>) with intensive particle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γε</span></span> added. This is the last mention of baptism under the direction of Jesus till the Great Commission (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>). It is possible that Jesus stopped the baptizing because of the excitement and the issue raised about his Messianic claims till after his resurrection when he enjoined it upon his disciples as a rite of public enlistment in his service. </p>
