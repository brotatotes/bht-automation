<p><b> In this mountain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ορε τουτω</span></span>). Jacob's Well is at the foot of Mount Gerizim toward which she pointed. Sanballat erected a temple on this mountain which was destroyed by John Hyrcanus B.C. 129. Abraham (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:7">Genesis 12:7</span>) and Jacob (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:20">Genesis 33:20</span>) set up altars at Shechem. On Gerizim were proclaimed the blessings recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:28">John 4:28</span>. The Samaritan Pentateuch records an altar set up on Gerizim that is on Ebal (over 200 feet higher than Gerizim) in the Hebrew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+27:4">Deuteronomy 27:4</span>). The Samaritans held that Abraham offered up Isaac on Gerizim. The Samaritans kept up this worship on this mountain and a handful do it still.</p>
<p><b>And ye say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υμεις λεγετε</span></span>). Emphasis on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις</span></span> (ye). Ye Jews.</p>
<p><b>Ought to worship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνειν δε</span></span>). "Must worship," as of necessity (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>). The woman felt that by raising this theological wrangle she would turn the attention of Jesus away from herself and perhaps get some light on the famous controversy. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προσκυνεω</span></span> in John is always worship, not just respect. </p>
