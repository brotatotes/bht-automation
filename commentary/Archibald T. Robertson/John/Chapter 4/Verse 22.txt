<p><b> That which ye know not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ουκ οιδατε</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:23">Acts 17:23</span>. "You know whom to worship, but you do not know him" (Westcott). The Samaritans rejected the prophets and the Psalms and so cut themselves off from the fuller knowledge of God.</p>
<p><b>We </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις</span></span>). We Jews. Jesus is a Jew as he fully recognizes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:24">Matthew 15:24</span>).</p>
<p><b>That which we know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο οιδαμεν</span></span>). Neuter singular relative as before. The Jews, as the chosen people, had fuller revelations of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+147:19">Psalms 147:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:3-5">Romans 9:3-5</span>). But even so the Jews as a whole failed to recognize God in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:26">John 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:28">John 7:28</span>).</p>
<p><b>For salvation is from the Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ η σωτηρια εκ των Ιουδαιων εστιν</span></span>). "The salvation," the Messianic salvation which had long been the hope and guiding star of the chosen people (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:69">Luke 1:69</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:71">Luke 1:71</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:77">Luke 1:77</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:26">Acts 13:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:47">Acts 13:47</span>). It was for the whole world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:17">John 3:17</span>), but it comes "out of" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>) the Jews. This tremendous fact should never be forgotten, however unworthy the Jews may have proved of their privilege. The Messiah, God's Son, was a Jew. </p>
