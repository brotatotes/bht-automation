<p><b> And now is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα νυν εστιν</span></span>). See this same phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>. This item could not be added in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:21">John 4:21</span> for local worship was not abolished, but spiritual independence of place was called for at once. So contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28">John 5:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:25">John 16:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:32">John 16:32</span>.</p>
<p><b>The true worshippers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αληθινο προσκυνητα</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθινος</span></span> (genuine). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προσκυνητης</span></span> is a late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνεω</span></span>, to bow the knee, to worship, occurs here only in N.T., but is found in one pre-Christian inscription (Deissmann, <i>Light</i>, etc., p. 101) and in one of the 3rd century A.D. (Moulton Milligan, <i>Vocabulary</i>).</p>
<p><b>In spirit and truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πνευματ κα αληθεια</span></span>). This is what matters, not where, but how (in reality, in the spirit of man, the highest part of man, and so in truth). All this is according to the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5">Romans 8:5</span>) who is the Spirit of truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:13">John 16:13</span>). Here Jesus has said the final word on worship, one needed today.</p>
<p><b>Seeketh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητε</span></span>). The Father has revealed himself in the Son who is the truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9">John 14:9</span>). It does matter whether we have a true conception of God whom we worship.</p>
<p><b>To be his worshippers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους προσκυνουντας αυτον</span></span>). Rather, "seeks such as those who worship him" (predicate accusative articular participle in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοιουτους</span></span> (such). John pictures the Father as seeking worshippers, a doctrine running all through the Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44">John 6:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:16">John 15:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:10">1 John 4:10</span>). </p>
