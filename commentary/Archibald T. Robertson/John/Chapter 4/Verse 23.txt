 And now is  (κα νυν εστιν). See this same phrase in John 5:25. This item could not be added in verse John 4:21 for local worship was not abolished, but spiritual independence of place was called for at once. So contrast John 5:25; John 5:28; John 16:25; John 16:32.The true worshippers  (ο αληθινο προσκυνητα). See John 1:9 for αληθινος (genuine). Προσκυνητης is a late word from προσκυνεω, to bow the knee, to worship, occurs here only in N.T., but is found in one pre-Christian inscription (Deissmann, Light, etc., p. 101) and in one of the 3rd century A.D. (Moulton Milligan, Vocabulary).In spirit and truth  (εν πνευματ κα αληθεια). This is what matters, not where, but how (in reality, in the spirit of man, the highest part of man, and so in truth). All this is according to the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:5) who is the Spirit of truth (John 16:13). Here Jesus has said the final word on worship, one needed today.Seeketh  (ζητε). The Father has revealed himself in the Son who is the truth (John 14:6 John 14:9). It does matter whether we have a true conception of God whom we worship.To be his worshippers  (τους προσκυνουντας αυτον). Rather, "seeks such as those who worship him" (predicate accusative articular participle in apposition with τοιουτους (such). John pictures the Father as seeking worshippers, a doctrine running all through the Gospel (John 3:16; John 6:44; John 15:16; 1 John 4:10).
