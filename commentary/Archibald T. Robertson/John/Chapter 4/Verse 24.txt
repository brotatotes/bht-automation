<p><b> God is a Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα ο θεος</span></span>). More precisely, "God is Spirit" as "God is Light" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>), "God is Love" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:8">1 John 4:8</span>). In neither case can we read Spirit is God, Light is God, Love is God. The non-corporeality of God is clearly stated and the personality of God also. All this is put in three words for the first time.</p>
<p><b>Must </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>). Here is the real necessity (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>), not the one used by the woman about the right place of worship (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:20">John 4:20</span>). </p>
