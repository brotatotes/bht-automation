 Messiah cometh  (Μεσσιας ερχετα). Hebrew word in N.T. only here and John 1:41 and explained by Χριστος in both places. The Samaritans looked for a Messiah, a prophet like Moses (Deuteronomy 18:18). Simon Magus gave himself out in Samaria as some great one and had a large following (Acts 8:9). Pilate quelled an uprising in Samaria over a fanatical Messianic claimant (Josephus, Ant. XVIII. iv. 1).When he is come  (οταν ελθη εκεινος). "Whenever that one comes." Indefinite temporal clause with οταν (οτε, αν) and the second aorist active subjunctive. Wistfully she turns to this dim hope as a bare possibility about this strange "prophet."He will declare unto us all things  (αναγγελε ημιν απαντα). Future active indicative of αναγγελλω, old and common verb to announce fully (ανα, up and down). See also John 16:13. Perhaps here is light on the knowledge of her life by Jesus as well as about the way to worship God.
