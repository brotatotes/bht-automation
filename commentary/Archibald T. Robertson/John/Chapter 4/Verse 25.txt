<p><b> Messiah cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μεσσιας ερχετα</span></span>). Hebrew word in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:41">John 1:41</span> and explained by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος</span></span> in both places. The Samaritans looked for a Messiah, a prophet like Moses (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+18:18">Deuteronomy 18:18</span>). Simon Magus gave himself out in Samaria as some great one and had a large following (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:9">Acts 8:9</span>). Pilate quelled an uprising in Samaria over a fanatical Messianic claimant (Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. XVIII. iv. 1).</p>
<p><b>When he is come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν ελθη εκεινος</span></span>). "Whenever that one comes." Indefinite temporal clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span>) and the second aorist active subjunctive. Wistfully she turns to this dim hope as a bare possibility about this strange "prophet."</p>
<p><b>He will declare unto us all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγγελε ημιν απαντα</span></span>). Future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγγελλω</span></span>, old and common verb to announce fully (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα</span></span>, up and down). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:13">John 16:13</span>. Perhaps here is light on the knowledge of her life by Jesus as well as about the way to worship God. </p>
