<p><b> Upon this </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τουτω</span></span>). This idiom only here in N.T. At this juncture. Apparently the woman left at once when the disciples came.</p>
<p><b>They marvelled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθαυμαζον</span></span>). Imperfect active describing the astonishment of the disciples as they watched Jesus talking with a woman.</p>
<p><b>Was speaking </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλε</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:25">John 2:25</span>, so here the tense is changed in indirect discourse from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλε</span></span> to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλε</span></span>, an unusual idiom in Greek. However, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> here may be "because" and then the imperfect is regular. It is not "with the woman" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα της γυναικος</span></span>), but simply "with a woman" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα γυναικος</span></span>). There was a rabbinical precept: "Let no one talk with a woman in the street, no, not with his own wife" (Lightfoot, <i>Hor, Hebr</i>. iii. 287). The disciples held Jesus to be a rabbi and felt that he was acting in a way beneath his dignity.</p>
<p><b>Yet no man said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεις μεντο ειπεν</span></span>). John remembers through the years their amazement and also their reverence for Jesus and unwillingness to reflect upon him. </p>
