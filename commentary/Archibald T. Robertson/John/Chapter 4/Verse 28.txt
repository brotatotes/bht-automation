<p><b> Left her waterpot </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφηκεν την υδριαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιημ</span></span>, ingressive aorist, in her excitement and embarrassment. It was too large for speed anyhow (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:6">John 2:6</span>). And says (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα λεγε</span></span>). Graphic historic present indicative again. </p>
