<p><b> All things that ever I did </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα α εποιησα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Ha </b>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσα</span></span> (as many as), no "ever" in the Greek. But a guilty conscience (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:18">John 4:18</span>) led her to exaggerate a bit.</p>
<p><b>Can this be the Christ? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητ ουτος εστιν ο Χριστοσ;</span></span>). She is already convinced herself (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:26">John 4:26</span>), but she puts the question in a hesitant form to avoid arousing opposition. With a woman's intuition she avoided <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span> and uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητ</span></span>. She does not take sides, but piques their curiosity. </p>
