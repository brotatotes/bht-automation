<p><b> Left Judea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφηκεν την Ιουδαιαν</span></span>). Unusual use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιημ</span></span>. First (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Καππα</span></span>) aorist active indicative. Originally the word means to send away, to dismiss, to forsake, to forgive, to allow. Jesus uses it in this sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:28">John 16:28</span>. Evidently because Jesus did not wish to bring the coming conflict with the Pharisees to an issue yet. So he mainly avoids Jerusalem and Judea now till the end. Each time hereafter that Jesus appears in Jerusalem and Judea before the last visit there is an open breach with the Pharisees who attack him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1-47">John 5:1-47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:14-10">John 7:14-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:22-42">John 10:22-42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:17-53">John 11:17-53</span>).</p>
<p><b>Again into Galilee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν εις την Γαλιλαιαν</span></span>). Reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:1-12">John 2:1-12</span>. The Synoptics tell nothing of this early work in Perea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19-51">John 1:19-51</span>), Galilee, or Judea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:13-4">John 2:13-4</span>). John supplements their records purposely. </p>
