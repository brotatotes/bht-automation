 Hath any man brought him aught to eat?  (Μη τις ηνεγκεν αυτω φαγειν;). Negative answer expected (μη). "Did any one bring him (something) to eat?" During our absence, they mean. Second aorist active indicative of φερω (ηνεγκεν) and second aorist active infinitive of εσθιω (φαγειν), defective verbs both of them. See John 4:7 for like infinitive construction (δος πειν).
