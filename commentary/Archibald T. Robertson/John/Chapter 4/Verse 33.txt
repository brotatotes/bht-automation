<p><b> Hath any man brought him aught to eat? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη τις ηνεγκεν αυτω φαγειν;</span></span>). Negative answer expected (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>). "Did any one bring him (something) to eat?" During our absence, they mean. Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηνεγκεν</span></span>) and second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσθιω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαγειν</span></span>), defective verbs both of them.
