 To do the will  (ινα ποιησω το θελημα). Non-final use of ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive as subject or predicate nominative as in John 6:29; John 15:8; John 17:3. The Messianic consciousness of Jesus is clear and steady (John 5:30; John 6:38). He never doubted that the Father sent him.And to accomplish his work  (κα τελειωσω αυτου το εργον). Hινα understood with τελειωσω in like idiom, first aorist active subjunctive of τελειοω (from τελειος), to bring to an end. See John 5:36. In John 17:4 (the Intercessory Prayer) he will say that he has done (τελειωσας) this task which the Father gave him to do. On the Cross Jesus will cry Τετελεστα (It is finished). He will carry through the Father's programme (John 3:16). That is his "food." He had been doing that in winning the woman to God.
