<p><b> To do the will </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ποιησω το θελημα</span></span>). Non-final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist active subjunctive as subject or predicate nominative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:29">John 6:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:8">John 15:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>. The Messianic consciousness of Jesus is clear and steady (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:30">John 5:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:38">John 6:38</span>). He never doubted that the Father sent him.</p>
<p><b>And to accomplish his work </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τελειωσω αυτου το εργον</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hινα</span></span> understood with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειωσω</span></span> in like idiom, first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειοω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειος</span></span>), to bring to an end. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:36">John 5:36</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:4">John 17:4</span> (the Intercessory Prayer) he will say that he has done (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειωσας</span></span>) this task which the Father gave him to do. On the Cross Jesus will cry <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τετελεστα</span></span> (It is finished). He will carry through the Father's programme (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>). That is his "food." He had been doing that in winning the woman to God. </p>
