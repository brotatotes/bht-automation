<p><b> Say not ye? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ουχ υμεις λεγετε;</span></span>). It is not possible to tell whether Jesus is alluding to a rural proverb of which nothing is known about there being four months from seedtime to harvest (a longer time than four months in fact) or whether he means that it was then actually four months to harvest. In the latter sense, since harvest began about the middle of April, it would be December when Jesus spoke.</p>
<p><b>There are yet four months </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετ τετραμηνος εστιν</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετ</span></span> (yet) and the fact that the space between seedtime and harvest is longer than four months (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετρα</span></span>, Aeolic for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεσσαρα</span></span>, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μην</span></span>, month) argue against the proverb idea.</p>
<p><b>And then cometh the harvest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο θερισμος ερχετα</span></span>). "And the harvest (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θερισμος</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεριζω</span></span>, rare in Greek writers) comes." The possible Iambic verse here is purely accidental as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:14">John 5:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Lift up your eyes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαρατε τους οφθαλμους υμων</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαιρω</span></span>. Deliberate looking as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:5">John 6:5</span> where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεαομα</span></span> also is used as here.</p>
<p><b>Fields </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρας</span></span>). Cultivated or ploughed ground as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:21">Luke 21:21</span>.</p>
<p><b>White </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λευκα</span></span>). Ripened grain like grey hair (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:36">Matthew 5:36</span>).</p>
<p><b>Already unto harvest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς θερισμον ηδη</span></span>). Probably <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη</span></span> (already) goes with verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:36">John 4:36</span>. The Samaritans could already be seen approaching and they were the field "white for harvest." This is the meaning of Christ's parable. If it is the spring of the year and Christ can point to the ripened grain, the parable is all the plainer, but it is not dependent on this detail. Recall the parable of the sower in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:13">John 4:13</span>. </p>
