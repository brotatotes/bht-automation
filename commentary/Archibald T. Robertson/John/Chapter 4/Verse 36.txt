<p><b> Already he that reapeth receiveth wages </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη ο θεριζων μισθον λαμβανε</span></span>). The spiritual harvester can gather his harvest without waiting four months. Jesus is reaping a harvest right now by the conversion of this woman. The labourer is worthy of his hire (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:7">Luke 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:6">2 Timothy 2:6</span>). John does not use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθος</span></span> (reward) again, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρπος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:2-16">John 15:2-16</span>), "fruit for life eternal" (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:14">John 4:14</span>).</p>
<p><b>That he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ο σπειρων ομου χαιρη κα ο θεριζων</span></span>). Final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> with present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρω</span></span>, to rejoice, in the singular with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο σπειρων</span></span> (the sower) and to be repeated with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεριζων</span></span> (the reaper). The adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομου</span></span> (together) elsewhere in N.T. only <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:4">John 20:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:2">John 21:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:1">Acts 2:1</span>. Usually considerable time passes between the sowing and the reaping as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:35">John 4:35</span>. Amos (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="am+9:13">Amos 9:13</span>) spoke of the time when "the ploughman shall overtake the reaper" and that has happened here with the joy of the harvest time (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:3">Isaiah 9:3</span>). Jesus the Sower and the disciples as the reapers are here rejoicing simultaneously. </p>
