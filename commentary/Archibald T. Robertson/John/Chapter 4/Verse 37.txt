 For herein  (εν γαρ τουτω). In this relation between the sower and the reaper.The saying  (ο λογος). Like 1 Timothy 1:15; 1 Timothy 3:1, etc. Probably a proverb that is particularly true (αληθινος for which see John 1:9) in the spiritual realm.One soweth, and another reapeth  (αλλος εστιν ο σπειρων κα αλλος ο θεριζων). "One is the sower and another the reaper." It is sad when the sower misses the joy of reaping (Job 31:8) and has only the sowing in tears (Psalms 126:5). This may be the punishment for sin (Deuteronomy 28:30; Micah 6:15). Sometimes one reaps where he has not sown (Deuteronomy 6:11; Joshua 24:13). It is the prerogative of the Master to reap (Matthew 25:26), but Jesus here lets the disciples share his joy.
