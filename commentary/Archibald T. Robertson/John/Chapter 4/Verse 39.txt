<p><b> Because of the saying of the woman who testified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τον λογον της γυναικος μαρτυρουσης</span></span>). She bore her witness clearly and with discretion. She told enough to bring her neighbours to Christ. They knew her evil life and she frankly confessed Christ's rebuke to her. She had her share in this harvest. How timid and cowardly we often are today in not giving our testimony for Christ to our neighbour. </p>
