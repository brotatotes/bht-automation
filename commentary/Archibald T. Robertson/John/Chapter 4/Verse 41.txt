<p><b> Many more </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλω πλειους</span></span>). "More by much" (instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλω</span></span>) in comparison with just "many" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλο</span></span>) of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:39">John 4:39</span>. Jesus was reaping more rapidly than the woman did. But all were rejoicing that so many "believed" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευσαν</span></span>, really believed). </p>
