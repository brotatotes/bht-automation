<p><b> Again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν</span></span>). A second time.</p>
<p><b>Unto Cana </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την Κανα</span></span>). Note article, "the Cana of Galilee" already mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:1">John 2:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Where he made the water wine </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου εποιησεν το υδωρ οινον</span></span>). That outstanding first miracle would still be remembered in Cana and would indicate that Jesus had some friends there.</p>
<p><b>Nobleman </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλικος</span></span>). One connected with the king (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλευς</span></span>), whether by blood or by office. Probably here it is one of the courtiers of Herod the tetrarch of Galilee, Chuzas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:3">Luke 8:3</span>), Manaen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>), or some one else. Some of the manuscripts used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλισκος</span></span>, a petty king, a diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλευς</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Was sick </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησθενε</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασθενεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σθενος</span></span>, without strength, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:36">Matthew 25:36</span>), continued sick.</p>
<p><b>At Capernaum </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Καφαρναουμ</span></span>). Some miles from Cana near where the Jordan enters the Sea of Galilee. </p>
