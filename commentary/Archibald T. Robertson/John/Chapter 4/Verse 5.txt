<p><b> So he cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχετα ουν</span></span>). Vivid present middle indicative and transitional <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Sychar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συχαρ</span></span>). There is a dispute whether this is just a variation of Shechem as meaning "drunken-town" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:1">Isaiah 28:1</span>) or "lying-town" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:18">Habakkuk 2:18</span>) or is a separate village near Shechem (Neapolis, Nablous) as the Talmud and Eusebius indicate. Apparently the present village Askar corresponds well with the site. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολιν</span></span> (city) does not mean that it was a large town. Mark and John use it freely for small places.</p>
<p><b>Parcel of ground </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωριου</span></span>). Old use of this diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρος</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρα</span></span>, a piece of ground.</p>
<p><b>That Jacob gave to his son Joseph </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εδωκεν Ιακωβ τω Ιωσηφ τω υιω αυτου</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:19">Genesis 33:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:22">Genesis 48:22</span>. Relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> is not attracted to case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωριου</span></span>. First aorist active indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκεν</span></span>. </p>
