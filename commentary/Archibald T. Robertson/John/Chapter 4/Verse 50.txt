<p><b> Thy son liveth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο υιος σου ζη</span></span>). "Thy son is living," and will not now die, Jesus means. Words too good and gracious to be true. His son is healed without Jesus even going to Capernaum, "absent treatment" so to speak, but without the cure being absent.</p>
<p><b>Believed the word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευσεν τω λογω</span></span>). Instantaneous faith (aorist active indicative), trusted the word (dative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Went his way </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επορευετο</span></span>). Inchoative imperfect middle, "started on his way," acted on his faith. </p>
