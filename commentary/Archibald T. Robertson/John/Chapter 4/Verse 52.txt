<p><b> Inquired </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επυθετο</span></span>). Second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυνθανομα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Began to mend </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κομψοτερον εσχεν</span></span>). Second aorist ingressive active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span> (took a turn, got better) and comparative of adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κομψως</span></span>. Arrian (_Epictetus iii. 10.13) has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κομψως εχεις</span></span> from a physician, "Thou hast it fine," "Thou art doing finely." The papyri give several similar examples. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κομψως</span></span> (neat) is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κομεω</span></span>, to take care of.</p>
<p><b>At the seventh hour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωραν εβδομην</span></span>). The accusative case without a preposition as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:3">Revelation 3:3</span>, though we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ ωραν ενατην</span></span> (about the ninth hour) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:3">Acts 10:3</span>. See the accusative also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+9:18">Exodus 9:18</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτην την ωραν αυριον</span></span> (tomorrow about this hour). The accusative has the notion of extension and can be thus loosely used. It can even mean here "during the seventh hour." In verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:53">John 4:53</span> the locative is more exact, "at that hour" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εκεινη τη ωρα</span></span>). The seventh hour would be (Roman time) seven P.M. </p>
