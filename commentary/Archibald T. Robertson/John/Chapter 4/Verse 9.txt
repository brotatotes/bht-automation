<p><b> The Samaritan woman </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η γυνη η Σαμαρειτις</span></span>). Different idiom from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:7">John 4:7</span>, "the woman the Samaritan." The Samaritans were a mixture by intermarriage of the Jews left in the land (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+30:6">2 Chronicles 30:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+30:10">2 Chronicles 30:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+34:9">2 Chronicles 34:9</span>) with colonists from Babylon and other regions sent by Shalmaneser. They had had a temple of their own on Mt. Gerizim and still worshipped there.</p>
<p><b>Thou being a Jew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ Ιουδαιος ων</span></span>). Race antipathy was all the keener because the Samaritans were half Jews.</p>
<p><b>Drink </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειν</span></span>). Same infinitive form as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:7">John 4:7</span> and the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτεις</span></span> (askest).</p>
<p><b>Of me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ' εμου</span></span>). "From me," ablative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γαρ συνχρωντα Ιουδαιο Σαμαρειταις</span></span>). Explanatory (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>) parenthesis of the woman's astonishment. Associative instrumental case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνχρωντα</span></span> (present middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνχραομα</span></span>, compound in literary <i>Koine</i>, here only in N.T.). The woman's astonishment is ironical according to Bernard. At any rate the disciples had to buy food in a Samaritan village and they were travelling through Samaria. Perhaps she was surprised that Jesus would drink out of her waterpot. The Western class omit this explanatory parenthesis of the author. </p>
