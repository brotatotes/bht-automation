<p><b> After these things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα ταυτα</span></span>). John is fond of this vague phrase (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:22">John 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:1">John 6:1</span>). He does not mean that this incident follows immediately. He is supplementing the Synoptic Gospels and does not attempt a full story of the work of Jesus. Some scholars needlessly put chapter 5 after chapter 6 because in chapter 6 Jesus is in Galilee as at the end of chapter 4. But surely it is not incongruous to think of Jesus making a visit to Jerusalem before the events in chapter 6 which undoubtedly come within a year of the end (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:4">John 6:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>A feast of the Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εορτη των Ιουδαιων</span></span>). Some manuscripts have the article (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span>) "the feast" which would naturally mean the passover. As a matter of fact there is no way of telling what feast it was which Jesus here attended. Even if it was not the passover, there may well be another passover not mentioned besides the three named by John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:13">John 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:4">John 6:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>Went up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεβη</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινω</span></span>. It was up towards Jerusalem from every direction save from Hebron. </p>
