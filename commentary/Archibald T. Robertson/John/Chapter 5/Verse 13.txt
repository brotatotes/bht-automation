 He that was healed  (ο ιαθεις). First aorist passive articular participle of ιαομα (John's usual word).Who it was  (τις εστιν). Present tense preserved in indirect question.Had conveyed himself away  (εξενευσεν). First aorist active indicative of εκνεω, old verb to swim out, to slip out, or from εκνευω, to turn out, to turn the head to one side (to one side with which compare ενενευον, they nodded, Luke 1:62). Either of these verbs can explain the form here. The aorist tense simply states an antecedent action without being a pastperfect.A multitude being in the place  (οχλου οντος εν τω τοπω). Genitive absolute and the reason for Christ's departure.
