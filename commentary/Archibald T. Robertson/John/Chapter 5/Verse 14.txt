<p><b> Findeth him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκε αυτον</span></span>). Dramatic present as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:45">John 1:45</span>, possibly after search as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:35">John 9:35</span>.</p>
<p><b>Sin no more </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηκετ αμαρτανε</span></span>). "No longer go on sinning." Present active imperative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηκετ</span></span>, a clear implication that disease was due to personal sin as is so often the case. Jesus used the same words to the woman taken in adultery in the spurious passage (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:11">John 8:11</span>). He had suffered for 38 years. All sickness is not due to personal sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:3">John 9:3</span>), but much is and nature is a hard paymaster. Jesus is here living up to his name (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>).</p>
<p><b>Lest a worse thing befall thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη χειρον σο τ γενητα</span></span>). Negative final clause with second aorist middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χειρον</span></span> is comparative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακος</span></span>, bad. Worse than the illness of 38 years, bad as that is. He will now be sinning against knowledge. </p>
