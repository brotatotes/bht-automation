<p><b> Went away and told </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηλθεν κα ειπεν</span></span>). Both aorist active indicatives. Instead of giving heed to the warning of Jesus about his own sins he went off and told the Jews that now he knew who the man was who had commanded him to take up his bed on the Sabbath Day, to clear himself with the ecclesiastics and escape a possible stoning.</p>
<p><b>That it was Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ Ιησους εστιν</span></span>). Present indicative preserved in indirect discourse. The man was either ungrateful and wilfully betrayed Jesus or he was incompetent and did not know that he was bringing trouble on his benefactor. In either case one has small respect for him. </p>
