<p><b> Answered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκρινατο</span></span>). Regular aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκρινομα</span></span>, in John here only and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span>, elsewhere <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκριθη</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:11">John 5:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>My Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πατερ μου</span></span>). Not "our Father," claim to peculiar relation to the Father.</p>
<p><b>Worketh even until now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως αρτ εργαζετα</span></span>). Linear present middle indicative, "keeps on working until now" without a break on the Sabbath. Philo points out this fact of the continuous activity of God. Justin Martyr, Origen and others note this fact about God. He made the Sabbath for man's blessing, but cannot observe it himself.</p>
<p><b>And I work </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καγω εργαζομα</span></span>). Jesus puts himself on a par with God's activity and thus justifies his healing on the Sabbath. </p>
