<p><b> Sought the more </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλλον εζητουν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητεω</span></span>, graphic picture of increased and untiring effort "to kill him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον αποκτεινα</span></span>, first aorist active, to kill him off and be done with him). John repeats this clause "they sought to kill him" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:1">John 7:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:19">John 7:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:25">John 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:37">John 8:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:40">John 8:40</span>. Their own blood was up on this Sabbath issue and they bend every energy to put Jesus to death. If this is a passover, this bitter anger, murderous wrath, will go on and grow for two years.</p>
<p><b>Not only brake the Sabbath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μονον ελυε το σαββατον</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυω</span></span>. He was now a common and regular Sabbath-breaker. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λυω</span></span> means to loosen, to set at naught. The papyri give examples of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυω</span></span> in this sense like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυειν τα πενθη</span></span> (to break the period of mourning). This was the first grudge against Jesus, but his defence had made the offence worse and had given them a far graver charge.</p>
<p><b>But also called God his own Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα κα πατερα ιδιον ελεγε τον θεον</span></span>). "His own" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιον</span></span>) in a sense not true of others. That is precisely what Jesus meant by "My Father." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:32">Romans 8:32</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ιδιος υιος</span></span>, "his own Son."</p>
<p><b>Making himself equal with God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισον εαυτον ποιων τω θεω</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ισος</span></span> is an old common adjective (in papyri also) and means</p>
<p><b>equal </b>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span> Paul calls the Pre-incarnate Christ <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισα θεω</span></span>, "equal to God" (plural <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισα</span></span>, attributes of God). Bernard thinks that Jesus would not claim to be <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισος θεω</span></span> because in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:28">John 14:28</span> he says: "The Father is greater than I." And yet he says in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:7">John 14:7</span> that the one who sees him sees in him the Father. Certainly the Jews understood Jesus to claim equality with the Father in nature and privilege and power as also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:33">John 10:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:7">John 19:7</span>. Besides, if the Jews misunderstood Jesus on this point, it was open and easy for him to deny it and to clear up the misapprehension. This is precisely what he does not do. On the contrary Jesus gives a powerful apologetic in defence of his claim to equality with the Father (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19-47">John 5:19-47</span>). </p>
