 The Son  (ο υιος). The absolute use of the Son in relation to the Father admitting the charge in verse John 5:18 and defending his equality with the Father.Can do nothing by himself  (ου δυνατα ποιειν αφ'εαυτου ουδεν). True in a sense of every man, but in a much deeper sense of Christ because of the intimate relation between him and the Father. See this same point in John 5:30; John 7:28; John 8:28; John 14:10. Jesus had already made it in John 5:17. Now he repeats and defends it.But what he seeth the Father doing  (αν μη τ βλεπη τον πατερα ποιουντα). Rather, "unless he sees the Father doing something." Negative condition (αν μη=εαν μη, if not, unless) of third class with present (habit) subjunctive (βλεπη) and present active participle (ποιουντα). It is a supreme example of a son copying the spirit and work of a father. In his work on earth the Son sees continually what the Father is doing. In healing this poor man he was doing what the Father wishes him to do.For what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner  (α γαρ αν εκεινος ποιη ταυτα κα ο υιος ομοιως ποιε). Indefinite relative clause with αν and the present active subjunctive (ποιη). Note εκεινος, emphatic demonstrative, that one, referring to the Father. This sublime claim on the part of Jesus will exasperate his enemies still more.
