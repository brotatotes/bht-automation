<p><b> The Son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο υιος</span></span>). The absolute use of the Son in relation to the Father admitting the charge in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span> and defending his equality with the Father.</p>
<p><b>Can do nothing by himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου δυνατα ποιειν αφ'εαυτου ουδεν</span></span>). True in a sense of every man, but in a much deeper sense of Christ because of the intimate relation between him and the Father. See this same point in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:30">John 5:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:28">John 7:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:28">John 8:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:10">John 14:10</span>. Jesus had already made it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:17">John 5:17</span>. Now he repeats and defends it.</p>
<p><b>But what he seeth the Father doing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν μη τ βλεπη τον πατερα ποιουντα</span></span>). Rather, "unless he sees the Father doing something." Negative condition (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν μη</span></span>=<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη</span></span>, if not, unless) of third class with present (habit) subjunctive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπη</span></span>) and present active participle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιουντα</span></span>). It is a supreme example of a son copying the spirit and work of a father. In his work on earth the Son sees continually what the Father is doing. In healing this poor man he was doing what the Father wishes him to do.</p>
<p><b>For what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α γαρ αν εκεινος ποιη ταυτα κα ο υιος ομοιως ποιε</span></span>). Indefinite relative clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and the present active subjunctive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιη</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος</span></span>, emphatic demonstrative, that one, referring to the Father. This sublime claim on the part of Jesus will exasperate his enemies still more. </p>
