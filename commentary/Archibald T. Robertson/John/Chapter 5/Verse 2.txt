Schick in 1888 found twin pools north of the temple near the fortress of Antonia one of which has five porches. It is not, however, certain that this pool existed before A.D. 70 when the temple was destroyed (Sanday, <i>Sacred Sites of the Gospels</i>, p. 55). Some have identified it with the Pool of Siloam (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:7">John 9:7</span>), though John distinguishes them. There is also the Virgin's Well, called the Gusher, because it periodically bubbles over from a natural spring, a kind of natural siphon. This is south of the temple in the Valley of Kedron and quite possibly the real site. </p>
