 There is  (εστιν). Bengel argues that this proves a date before the destruction of Jerusalem, but it is probably only John's vivid memory.By the sheep gate  (επ τη προβατικη). Supply πυλη (gate) which occurs with the adjective προβατικη (pertaining to sheep, προβατα) in Nehemiah 3:1; Nehemiah 3:22.A pool  (κολυμβηθρα). A diving or swimming pool (from κολυμβαω, to swim, Acts 27:43), old word, only here in N.T.Which is called  (η επιλεγομενη).

Στοα was a covered colonnade where people can gather from which Stoic comes (Acts 17:18). See John 10:23; Acts 3:11. Schick in 1888 found twin pools north of the temple near the fortress of Antonia one of which has five porches. It is not, however, certain that this pool existed before A.D. 70 when the temple was destroyed (Sanday, Sacred Sites of the Gospels, p. 55). Some have identified it with the Pool of Siloam (John 9:7), though John distinguishes them. There is also the Virgin's Well, called the Gusher, because it periodically bubbles over from a natural spring, a kind of natural siphon. This is south of the temple in the Valley of Kedron and quite possibly the real site.
