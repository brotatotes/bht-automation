<p><b> Loveth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλε</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:35">John 3:35</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαω</span></span>, evidently one verb expressing as noble a love as the other. Sometimes a distinction (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:17">John 21:17</span>) is made, but not here, unless <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλεω</span></span> presents the notion of intimate friendship (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλος</span></span>, friend), fellowship, the affectionate side, while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαω</span></span> (Latin <i>diligo</i>) is more the intelligent choice. But John uses both verbs for the mystery of love of the Father for the Son.</p>
<p><b>Greater works than these </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζονα τουτων εργα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τουτων</span></span> is ablative case after the comparative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζονα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγας</span></span>, great). John often uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργα</span></span> for the miracles of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:36">John 5:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:3">John 7:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:21">John 7:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:25">John 10:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:32">John 10:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:38">John 10:38</span>, etc.). It is the Father who does these works (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:10">John 14:10</span>). There is more to follow. Even the disciples will surpass what Christ is doing in the extent of the work (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:12">John 14:12</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δειξε</span></span> is future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεικνυμ</span></span>, to show. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:32">John 10:32</span>.</p>
<p><b>That ye may marvel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα υμεις θαυμαζητε</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαυμαζω</span></span>. Wonder belongs to childhood and to men of knowledge. Modern science has increased the occasion for wonder. Clement of Alexandria has a saying of Jesus: "He that wonders shall reign, and he that reigns shall rest." </p>
