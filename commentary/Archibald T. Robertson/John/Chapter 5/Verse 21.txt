<p><b> Quickeneth whom he will </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ους θελε ζωοποιε</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωοποιεω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωοποιος</span></span>, making alive), common in Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span>, etc.). As yet, so far as we know, Jesus had not raised the dead, but he claims the power to do it on a par with the power of the Father. The raising of the son of the widow of Nain (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:11-17">Luke 7:11-17</span>) is not far ahead, followed by the message to the Baptist which speaks of this same power (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:22">Luke 7:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:5">Matthew 11:5</span>), and the raising of Jairus' daughter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:18">Matthew 9:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:22-26">Matthew 9:22-26</span>). Jesus exercises this power on those "whom he wills." Christ has power to quicken both body and soul. </p>
