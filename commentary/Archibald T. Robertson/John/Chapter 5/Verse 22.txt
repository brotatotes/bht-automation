 He hath given all judgement unto the Son  (την κρισιν πασαν δεδωκεν τω υιω). Perfect active indicative of διδωμ, state of completion (as in John 3:35; John 6:27; John 6:29; John 10:29, etc.). See this prerogative claimed for Christ already in John 3:17. See the picture of Christ as Judge of men in Matthew 25:31-46.
