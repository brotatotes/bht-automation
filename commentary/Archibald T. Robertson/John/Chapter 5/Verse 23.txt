<p><b> That all may honour the Son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα παντες τιμωσιν τον υιον</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμαω</span></span> (may keep on honouring the Son).</p>
<p><b>He that honoureth not the Son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μη τιμων τον υιον</span></span>). Articular present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμαω</span></span> with negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>. Jesus claims here the same right to worship from men that the Father has. Dishonouring Jesus is dishonouring the Father who sent him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:49">John 8:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:26">John 12:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:23">John 15:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:23">1 John 2:23</span>). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:16">Luke 10:16</span>. There is small comfort here for those who praise Jesus as teacher and yet deny his claims to worship. The Gospel of John carries this high place for Christ throughout, but so do the other Gospels (even Q, the Logia of Jesus) and the rest of the New Testament. </p>
