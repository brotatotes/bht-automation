<p><b> In himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εαυτω</span></span>). The Living God possesses life wholly in himself and so he has bestowed this power of life to the Son as already stated in the Prologue of the Logos (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>). For "gave" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκεν</span></span>, timeless aorist active indicative) see also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:35">John 3:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span>. The particles "as" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωσπερ</span></span>) and "so" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως</span></span>) mark here the fact, not the degree (Westcott). </p>
