 Because he is the Son of man  (οτ υιος ανθρωπου εστιν). Rather, "because he is a son of man" (note absence of articles and so not as the Messiah), because the judge of men must partake of human nature himself (Westcott). Bernard insists that John is here giving his own reflections rather than the words of Jesus and uses υιος ανθρωπου in the same sense as ο υιος του ανθρωπου (always in the Gospels used by Jesus of himself). But that in my opinion is a wrong view since we have here ostensibly certainly the words of Jesus himself. So in Revelation 1:13; Revelation 4:14 υιον ανθρωπου means "a son of man."
