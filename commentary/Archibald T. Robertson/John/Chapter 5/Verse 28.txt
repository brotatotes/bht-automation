 In the tombs  (εν τοις μνημειοις). Ταφος (grave) presents the notion of burial (θαπτω, to bury) as in Matthew 23:27, μνημειον (from μναομα, μιμνησκω, to remind) is a memorial (sepulchre as a monument). Jesus claims not only the power of life (spiritual) and of judgement, but of power to quicken the actual dead at the Last Day. They will hear his voice and come out (εκπορευσοντα, future middle indicative of εκπορευομα). A general judgement and a general bodily resurrection we have here for both good and bad as in Matthew 25:46; Acts 24:15; 2 Corinthians 5:10 and as often implied in the words of Jesus (Matthew 5:29; Matthew 10:28; Luke 11:32). In John 6:39 Jesus asserts that he will raise up the righteous.
