<p><b> In the tombs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις μνημειοις</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ταφος</span></span> (grave) presents the notion of burial (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαπτω</span></span>, to bury) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:27">Matthew 23:27</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνημειον</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μναομα</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμνησκω</span></span>, to remind) is a memorial (sepulchre as a monument). Jesus claims not only the power of life (spiritual) and of judgement, but of power to quicken the actual dead at the Last Day. They will hear his voice and come out (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπορευσοντα</span></span>, future middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπορευομα</span></span>). A general judgement and a general bodily resurrection we have here for both good and bad as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46">Matthew 25:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:15">Acts 24:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span> and as often implied in the words of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29">Matthew 5:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:28">Matthew 10:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:32">Luke 11:32</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39">John 6:39</span> Jesus asserts that he will raise up the righteous. </p>
