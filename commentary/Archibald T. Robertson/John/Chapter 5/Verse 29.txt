<p><b> Unto the resurrection of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις αναστασιν ζωης</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αναστασις</span></span> is an old word (Aeschylus) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανιστημ</span></span>, to raise up, to arise. This combination occurs nowhere else in the N.T. nor does "the resurrection of judgement" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις αναστασιν κρισεως</span></span>), but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:14">Luke 14:14</span> there is the similar phrase "in the resurrection of the just" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη αναστασε των δικαιων</span></span>). Only there note both articles. Here without the articles it can mean "to a resurrection of life" and "to a resurrection of judgement," though the result is practically the same. There are two resurrections as to result, one to life, one to judgement. See both in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+12:2">Daniel 12:2</span>. </p>
