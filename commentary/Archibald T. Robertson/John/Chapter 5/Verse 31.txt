<p><b> If I bear witness of myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εαν εγω μαρτυρω περ εμαυτου</span></span>). Condition of third class, undetermined with prospect of determination (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρεω</span></span>). The emphasis is on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω</span></span> (I alone with no other witness).</p>
<p><b>Is not true </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν αληθης</span></span>). In law the testimony of a witness is not received in his own case (Jewish, Greek, Roman law). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+19:15">Deuteronomy 19:15</span> and the allusion to it by Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:16">Matthew 18:16</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1">2 Corinthians 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:19">1 Timothy 5:19</span>. And yet in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12-19">John 8:12-19</span> Jesus claims that his witness concerning himself is true because the Father gives confirmation of his message. The Father and the Son are the two witnesses (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:17">John 8:17</span>). It is a paradox and yet true. But here Jesus yields to the rabbinical demand for proof outside of himself. He has the witness of another (the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:32">John 5:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:37">John 5:37</span>), the witness of the Baptist (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:33">John 5:33</span>), the witness of the works of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:36">John 5:36</span>), the witness of the Scriptures (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:39">John 5:39</span>), the witness of Moses in particular (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:45">John 5:45</span>). </p>
