 Ye have sent  (υμεις απεσταλκατε). Emphatic use of υμεις (ye) and perfect active indicative of αποστελλω, official and permanent fact and so the witness of the Baptist has to be recognized as trustworthy by the Sanhedrin. The reference is to the committee in John 1:19-28.He hath borne witness  (μεμαρτυρηκεν). Perfect active indicative of μαρτυρεω showing the permanent and abiding value of John's testimony to Christ as in John 1:34; John 3:26; John 5:37. So also John 19:35 of the testimony concerning Christ's death. This was the purpose of the Baptist's mission (John 1:7).
