<p><b> He </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος</span></span>). "That one" (John of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:33">John 5:33</span>). Common demonstrative (that one) in John to point out the subject. Used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:8">John 1:8</span> of the Baptist as here. John was now in prison and so Christ uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> (was). His active ministry is over.</p>
<p><b>The lamp </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λυχνος</span></span>). The lamp in the room (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:21">Mark 4:21</span>). Old word for lamp or candle as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:15">Matthew 5:15</span>. Used of Christ (the Lamb) as the Lamp of the New Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:23">Revelation 21:23</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λαμπας</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:1">Matthew 25:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:3">Matthew 25:3</span>, etc.) is a torch whose wick is fed with oil. The Baptist was not the Light (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το φως</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:8">John 1:8</span>), but a lamp shining in the darkness. "When the Light comes, the lamp is no longer needed" (Bernard). "<i>Non Lux iste, sed lucerna</i>." Jesus by his own claim is the Light of the World (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:5">John 9:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:46">John 12:46</span>). And yet all believers are in a sense "the light of the world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:14">Matthew 5:14</span>) since the world gets the Light of Christ through us.</p>
<p><b>That burneth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο καιομενος</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:15">Matthew 5:15</span> for this verb used with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυχνος</span></span> (lighting a candle or lamp). The lamp that is lit and is burning (present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιω</span></span>, and so is consumed).</p>
<p><b>And shineth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα φαινων</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span> for this verb used of the Logos shining in the darkness. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:8">1 John 2:8</span>. John was giving light as he burned for those in darkness like these Jews.</p>
<p><b>And ye were willing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις δε ηθελησατε</span></span>). "But ye became willing." Ingressive aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω</span></span>. Reference again to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>. Cf. also for the temporary popularity of the Baptist <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:5">Mark 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:5">Matthew 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:7">Matthew 11:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:26">Matthew 21:26</span>. The Jews were attracted to John "like moths to a candle" (Bernard).</p>
<p><b>To rejoice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαλλιαθηνα</span></span>). First aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαλλιαομα</span></span>, late word for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαλλομα</span></span> for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:12">Matthew 5:12</span>. "They were attracted by his brightness, not by his warmth" (Bengel). Even so the brightness of John's shining did not really enlighten their minds. "The interest in the Baptist was a frivolous, superficial, and short-lived excitement" (Vincent). It was only "for an hour" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς ωραν</span></span>) when they turned against him. </p>
