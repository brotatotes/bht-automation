 But the witness which I have is greater than that of John  (Εγω δε εχω την μαρτυριαν μειζω του Ιωανου). Literally, "But I have the witness greater than John's." Μειζω (μειζονα) is predicate accusative and Ιωανου is ablative of comparison after μειζω. Good as the witness of John is, Christ has superior testimony.To accomplish  (ινα τελειωσω). Final clause with ινα and first aorist active subjunctive of τελειοω, the same idiom in John 4:34. Jesus felt keenly the task laid on him by the Father (cf. John 3:35) and claimed at the end that he had performed it (John 17:4; John 19:30). Jesus held that the highest form of faith did not require these "works" (εργα) as in John 2:23; John 10:38; John 14:11. But these "works" bear the seal of the Father's approval (John 5:20; John 5:36; John 10:25) and to reject their witness is wrong (John 10:25; John 10:37; John 15:24).The very works  (αυτα τα εργα). "The works themselves," repeating τα εργα just before for vernacular emphasis.Hath sent me  (με απεσταλκεν). Perfect active indicative of αποστελλω, the permanence of the mission. Cf. John 3:17. The continuance of the witness is emphasized in John 5:32; John 8:18.
