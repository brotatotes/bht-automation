<p><b> He hath borne witness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος μεμαρτυρηκεν</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εκεινος</span></span> (that one; cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:35">John 5:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:38">John 5:38</span>), not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος</span></span>. Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρεω</span></span>, the direct witness of the Father, besides the indirect witness of the works. Jesus is not speaking of the voice of the Father at his baptism (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:11">Mark 1:11</span>), the transfiguration (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:7">Mark 9:7</span>), nor even at the time of the visit of the Greeks (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:28">John 12:28</span>). This last voice was heard by many who thought it was thunder or an angel. The language of Jesus refers to the witness of the Father in the heart of the believers as is made plain in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:9">1 John 5:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:10">1 John 5:10</span>. God's witness does not come by audible "voice" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνην</span></span>) nor visible "form" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδος</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:46">John 6:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:12">1 John 4:12</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ακηκοατε</span></span> is perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span>, to hear, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εωρακατε</span></span> is perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>, to see. It is a permanent state of failure to hear and see God. The experience of Jacob in Peniel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+32:30">Genesis 32:30</span>) was unusual, but Jesus will say that those who have seen him have seen the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9">John 14:9</span>), but here he means the Father's "voice" and "form" as distinct from the Son. </p>
