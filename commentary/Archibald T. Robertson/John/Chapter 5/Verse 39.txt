<p><b> Ye search </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εραυνατε</span></span>). Proper spelling as the papyri show rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερευνατε</span></span>, the old form (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερευνα</span></span>, search) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:52">John 7:52</span>. The form here can be either present active indicative second person plural or the present active imperative second person plural. Only the context can decide. Either makes sense here, but the reason given "because ye think" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ υμεις δοκειτε</span></span>, clearly indicative), supports the indicative rather than the imperative. Besides, Jesus is arguing on the basis of their use of "the Scriptures" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας γραφας</span></span>). The plural with the article refers to the well-known collection in the Old Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:27">Luke 24:27</span>). Elsewhere in John the singular refers to a particular passage (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:22">John 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:38">John 7:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:35">John 10:35</span>).</p>
<p><b>In them ye have eternal life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυταις ζωην αιωνιον εχειν</span></span>). Indirect assertion after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκειτε</span></span> without "ye" expressed either as nominative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις</span></span>) or accusative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμας</span></span>). Bernard holds that in John <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκεω</span></span> always indicates a mistaken opinion (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:45">John 5:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:13">John 11:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:31">John 11:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:29">John 13:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:20">John 16:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:15">John 20:15</span>). Certainly the rabbis did make a mechanical use of the letter of Scripture as a means of salvation.</p>
<p><b>These are they </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινα εισιν α</span></span>). The true value of the Scriptures is in their witness to Christ (of me, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ εμου</span></span>). Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+24:27">John 24:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+24:45">John 24:45</span>) gives this same claim of Jesus, and yet some critics fail to find the Messiah in the Old Testament. But Jesus did. </p>
