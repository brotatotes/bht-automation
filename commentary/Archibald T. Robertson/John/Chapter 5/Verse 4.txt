<p>All of this verse is wanting in the oldest and best manuscripts like Aleph B C D W 33 Old Syriac, Coptic versions, Latin Vulgate. It is undoubtedly added, like the clause in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:3">John 5:3</span>, to make clearer the statement in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:7">John 5:7</span>. Tertullian is the earliest writer to mention it. The Jews explained the healing virtues of the intermittent spring by the ministry of angels. But the periodicity of such angelic visits makes it difficult to believe. It is a relief to many to know that the verse is spurious. </p>
