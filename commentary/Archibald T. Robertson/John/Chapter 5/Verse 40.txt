 And ye will not come to me  (κα ου θελετε ελθειν προς με). "And yet" (κα) as often in John. "This is the tragedy of the rejection of Messiah by the Messianic race" (Bernard). See John 1:11; Matthew 23:37 (κα ουκ ηθελησατε, and ye would not). Men loved darkness rather than light (John 3:19).That ye may have life  (ινα ζωην εχητε). Life in its simplest form as in John 3:36 (cf. John 3:16). This is the purpose of John in writing the Fourth Gospel (John 20:31). There is life only in Christ Jesus.
