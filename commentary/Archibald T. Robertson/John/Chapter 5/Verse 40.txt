<p><b> And ye will not come to me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ου θελετε ελθειν προς με</span></span>). "And yet" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>) as often in John. "This is the tragedy of the rejection of Messiah by the Messianic race" (Bernard). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:37">Matthew 23:37</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκ ηθελησατε</span></span>, and ye would not). Men loved darkness rather than light (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span>).</p>
<p><b>That ye may have life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ζωην εχητε</span></span>). Life in its simplest form as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>). This is the purpose of John in writing the Fourth Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:31">John 20:31</span>). There is life only in Christ Jesus. </p>
