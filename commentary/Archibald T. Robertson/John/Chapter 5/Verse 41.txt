<p><b> Glory from men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαν παρα ανθρωπων</span></span>). Mere honour and praise Jesus does not expect from men (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:34">John 5:34</span>). This is not wounded pride, for ambition is not Christ's motive. He is unlike the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:44">John 5:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:43">John 12:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1">Matthew 6:1</span>) and seeks not his own glory, but the glory and fellowship of the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:18">John 7:18</span>). Paul did not seek glory from men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:6">1 Thessalonians 2:6</span>). </p>
