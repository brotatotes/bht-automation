 Glory from men  (δοξαν παρα ανθρωπων). Mere honour and praise Jesus does not expect from men (verse John 5:34). This is not wounded pride, for ambition is not Christ's motive. He is unlike the Jews (John 5:44; John 12:43; Matthew 6:1) and seeks not his own glory, but the glory and fellowship of the Father (John 1:14; John 2:11; John 7:18). Paul did not seek glory from men (1 Thessalonians 2:6).
