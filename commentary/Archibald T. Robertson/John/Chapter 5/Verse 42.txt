Perfect active indicative of γινωσκω, "I have come to know and still know," the knowledge of personal experience (John 2:24).The love o' God  (την αγαπην του θεου). Objective genitive, "the love toward God." See Luke 11:42 for this phrase in the same sense (only other instance in the Gospels, but common in 1John (1 John 2:5; 1 John 3:17; 1 John 4:7; 1 John 4:9; 1 John 5:3) and in 2 Thessalonians 3:5; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Romans 5:5. The sense of God's love for man occurs in 1 John 3:1; 1 John 4:9; 1 John 4:10; 1 John 4:16; John 15:9 of Christ's love for man. These rabbis did not love God and hence did not love Christ.
