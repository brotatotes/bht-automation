 In my Father's name  (εν τω ονοματ του πατρος μου). Seven times Jesus in John speaks of the "Name" of the Father (John 5:43; John 10:25; John 12:28; John 17:6; John 17:11; John 17:12; John 17:26). See John 1:12 for use of ονομα (Luke 1:49).And ye receive me not  (κα ου λαμβανετε με). "And yet ye do not receive me," as in verse John 5:40, "the Gospel of the Rejection" (John 1:11; John 3:11; John 3:32; John 12:37) often applied to the Fourth Gospel.If another come  (εαν αλλος ελθη). Condition of third class (εαν and second aorist active subjunctive of ερχομα). Note αλλος, not ετερος, like αλλον Ιησουν in 2 Corinthians 11:4. Similar prophecies occur in Mark 13:6; Mark 13:22 (Matthew 24:5; Matthew 24:24), all general in character like Antichrist in 2 Thessalonians 2:8-12. There is no occasion for a reference to any individual like Barcochba (about A.D. 134) as Pfleiderer and Schmiedel hold. These Messianic upstarts all come "in their own name" and always find a following.Him ye will receive  (εκεινον λημψεσθε). "That one," whoever he is, as Jesus said. Future active indicative of λαμβανω. Credulous about the false Messiahs, incredulous about Christ.
