<p><b> Knew that he had been a long time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνους οτ πολυν ηδη χρονον εχε</span></span>). How Jesus "knew" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνους</span></span>, second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>) we are not told, whether supernatural knowledge (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:24">John 2:24</span>) or observation or overhearing people's comments. In <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη εχε</span></span> we have a progressive present active indicative, "he has already been having much time" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρονον</span></span>, accusative of extent of time).</p>
<p><b>Wouldest thou be made whole? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θελεις υγιης γενεσθαι;</span></span>). "Dost thou wish to become whole?" Predicate nominative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υγιης</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσθα</span></span> (second aorist middle infinitive). It was a pertinent and sympathetic question. </p>
