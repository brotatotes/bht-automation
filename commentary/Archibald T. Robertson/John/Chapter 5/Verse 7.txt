 When the water is troubled  (οταν ταραχθη το υδωρ). Indefinite temporal clause with οταν and the first aorist passive subjunctive of ταρασσω, old verb to agitate (Matthew 2:3). The popular belief was that, at each outflow of this intermittent spring, there was healing power in the water for the first one getting in.To put me into the pool  (ινα βαλη με εις την κολυμβηθραν). Final use of ινα and the second aorist active subjunctive of βαλλω, "that he throw me in" quickly before any one else. For this use of βαλλω see Mark 7:30; Luke 16:20.But while I am coming  (εν ω δε ερχομα). Temporal use of the relative, "in which time" (χρονω or καιρω understood). Εγω (I) is emphatic.
