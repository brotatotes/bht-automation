 Arise, take up thy bed, and walk  (Εγειρε, αρον τον κραβαττον σου κα περιπατε). Present active imperative of εγειρω, a sort of exclamation, like our "Get up." The first active imperative (αρον of αιρω) means to pick up the pallet, and then "go on walking" (present active imperative of περιπατεω). For κραβαττον (pallet) see Mark 2:2-12; Mark 6:55; Acts 5:15; Acts 9:33.
