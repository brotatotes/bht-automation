<p><b> Took up his bed and walked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρε τον κραβαττον αυτου κα περιεπατε</span></span>). The same distinction in tenses in the same verbs preserved, punctiliar action in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρε</span></span> (first aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρω</span></span>, took it up at once) and linear act (imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιπατεω</span></span>, went on walking).</p>
<p><b>The sabbath on that day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαββατον εν εκεινη τη ημερα</span></span>). The first of the violations of the Sabbath rules of the Jews by Jesus in Jerusalem that led to so much bitterness (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:14">John 9:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:16">John 9:16</span>). This controversy will spread to Galilee on Christ's return there (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:23-3">Mark 2:23-3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:1-14">Matthew 12:1-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:1-11">Luke 6:1-11</span>). </p>
