<p><b> After these things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα ταυτα</span></span>). A common, but indefinite, note of time in John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:22">John 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1">John 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:1">John 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:1">John 7:1</span>). The phrase does not mean immediate sequence of events. As a matter of fact, a whole year may intervene between the events of chapter 5 in Jerusalem and those in chapter 6 in Galilee. There is no sufficient reason for believing that chapter 6 originally preceded chapter 5. The feeding of the five thousand is the only event before the last visit to Jerusalem recorded in all Four Gospels (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:30-44">Mark 6:30-44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:13-21">Matthew 14:13-21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10-17">Luke 9:10-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:1-13">John 6:1-13</span>). The disciples have returned from the tour of Galilee and report to Jesus. It was the passover time (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:4">John 6:4</span>) just a year before the end.</p>
<p><b>To the other side of the Sea of Galilee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περαν της θαλασσης της Γαλιλαιας</span></span>). The name given in Mark and Matthew. It is called Gennesaret in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:1">Luke 5:1</span> and "Sea of Tiberias" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:1">John 21:1</span>. Here "of Tiberias" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της Τιβεριαδος</span></span>) is added as further description. Herod Antipas A.D. 22 built Tiberias to the west of the Sea of Galilee and made it his capital. See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:23">John 6:23</span> for this city. Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10">Luke 9:10</span>) explains that it was the eastern Bethsaida (Julias) to which Jesus took the disciples, not the western Bethsaida of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45">Mark 6:45</span> in Galilee. </p>
