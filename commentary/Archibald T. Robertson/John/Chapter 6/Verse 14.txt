<p><b> Saw the sign which he did </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδοντες α εποιησεν σημεια</span></span>). "Signs" oldest MSS. have. This sign added to those already wrought (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:2">John 6:2</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:2">John 3:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>They said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγον</span></span>). Inchoative imperfect, began to say.</p>
<p><b>Of a truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθως</span></span>). Common adverb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθης</span></span>) in John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:40">John 7:40</span>).</p>
<p><b>The prophet that cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο προφητης ο ερχομενος</span></span>). There was a popular expectation about the prophet of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span> as being the Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:21">John 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:27">John 11:27</span>). The phrase is peculiar to John, but the idea is in Acts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:22">John 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span>). The people are on the tiptoe of expectation and believe that Jesus is the political Messiah of Pharisaic hope. </p>
