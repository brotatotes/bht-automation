<p><b> When evening came </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως οψια εγενετο</span></span>). "The late hour" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωρα</span></span> understood), and so in late Greek the adjective is used as a substantive. It is late evening (real evening), not the early evening in mid-afternoon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:15">Matthew 14:15</span>). The disciples were in no hurry to start back to Bethsaida in Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45">Mark 6:45</span>), Capernaum in John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:17">John 6:17</span>). </p>
