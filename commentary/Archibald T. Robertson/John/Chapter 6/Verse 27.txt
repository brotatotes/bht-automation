The act of eating (Romans 14:17), corrosion (Matthew 6:19), the thing eaten as here (2 Corinthians 9:10). See on John 4:32.Which perisheth  (την απολλυμενην). Present middle participle of απολλυμ. They were already hungry again.Unto eternal life  (εις ζωην αιωνιον). Mystical metaphor quite beyond this crowd hungry only for more loaves and fishes.

Literally, "For this one the Father sealed, God." First aorist active indicative of σφραγιζω, to seal. See elsewhere in John 3:33 (attestation by man). Sealing by God is rare in N.T. (2 Corinthians 1:22; Ephesians 1:13; Ephesians 4:30). It is not clear to what item, if any single one, John refers when the Father set his seal of approval on the Son. It was done at his baptism when the Holy Spirit came upon him and the Father spoke to him. Cf. John 5:37.
