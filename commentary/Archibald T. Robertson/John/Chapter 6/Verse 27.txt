<p><b> Work not for </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη εργαζεσθε</span></span>). Prohibition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and present middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργαζομα</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργον</span></span>, work.</p>
<p><b>The meat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την βρωσιν</span></span>). The act of eating (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>), corrosion (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19">Matthew 6:19</span>), the thing eaten as here (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:10">2 Corinthians 9:10</span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:32">John 4:32</span>.</p>

<p><b>Unto eternal life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ζωην αιωνιον</span></span>). Mystical metaphor quite beyond this crowd hungry only for more loaves and fishes. Bernard thinks that John has here put together various sayings of Christ to make one discourse, a gratuitous interpretation.</p>
<p><b>Will give </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωσε</span></span>). Future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>.

<p><b>For him the Father, even God, hath sealed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτον γαρ ο πατηρ εσφραγισεν ο θεος</span></span>). Literally, "For this one the Father sealed, God." First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφραγιζω</span></span>, to seal. See elsewhere in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:33">John 3:33</span> (attestation by man). Sealing by God is rare in N.T.

It is not clear to what item, if any single one, John refers when the Father set his seal of approval on the Son. It was done at his baptism when the Holy Spirit came upon him and the Father spoke to him. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:37">John 5:37</span>. </p>
