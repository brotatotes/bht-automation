<p><b> What must we do? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ ποιωμεν;</span></span>). Present active deliberative subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>, "What are we to do as a habit?" For the aorist subjunctive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησωμεν</span></span>) in a like question for a single act see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:10">Luke 3:10</span>. For the present indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιουμεν</span></span>) of inquiry concerning actual conduct see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:47">John 11:47</span> (what are we doing?).</p>
<p><b>That we may work the works of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα εργαζωμεθα τα εργα του θεου</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the present middle subjunctive, "that we may go on working the works of God." There may have been an element of vague sincerity in this question in spite of their supercilious attitude. </p>
