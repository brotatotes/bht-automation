 What must we do?  (Τ ποιωμεν;). Present active deliberative subjunctive of ποιεω, "What are we to do as a habit?" For the aorist subjunctive (ποιησωμεν) in a like question for a single act see Luke 3:10. For the present indicative (ποιουμεν) of inquiry concerning actual conduct see John 11:47 (what are we doing?).That we may work the works of God  (ινα εργαζωμεθα τα εργα του θεου). Final clause with ινα and the present middle subjunctive, "that we may go on working the works of God." There may have been an element of vague sincerity in this question in spite of their supercilious attitude.
