 The work of God that ye believe  (το εργον του θεου ινα πιστευητε). In 1 Thessalonians 1:3 Paul speaks of "your work of faith" (υμων του εργου της πιστεως). So here Jesus terms belief in him as the work of God. These Jews were thinking of various deeds of the Pharisaic type and rules. Jesus turns their minds to the central fact. "This simple formula contains the complete solution of the relation of faith and works" (Westcott). Note the present active subjunctive πιστευητε, "that ye may keep on believing."On him whom he hath sent  (εις ον απεστειλεν εκεινος). The pronominal antecedent (εις τουτον ον) is omitted and the preposition εις is retained with the relative ον really the direct object of απεστειλεν (sent). Note εκεινος for God (emphatic he).
