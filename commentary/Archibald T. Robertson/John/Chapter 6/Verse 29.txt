<p><b> The work of God that ye believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το εργον του θεου ινα πιστευητε</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:3">1 Thessalonians 1:3</span> Paul speaks of "your work of faith" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμων του εργου της πιστεως</span></span>). So here Jesus terms belief in him as the work of God. These Jews were thinking of various deeds of the Pharisaic type and rules. Jesus turns their minds to the central fact. "This simple formula contains the complete solution of the relation of faith and works" (Westcott). Note the present active subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευητε</span></span>, "that ye may keep on believing."</p>
<p><b>On him whom he hath sent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ον απεστειλεν εκεινος</span></span>). The pronominal antecedent (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τουτον ον</span></span>) is omitted and the preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> is retained with the relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον</span></span> really the direct object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστειλεν</span></span> (sent). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος</span></span> for God (emphatic he). </p>
