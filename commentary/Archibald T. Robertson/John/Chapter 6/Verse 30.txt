<p><b> For a sign </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον</span></span>). Predicate accusative, as a sign, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span> (what). As if the sign of the day before was without value. Jesus had said that they did not understand his signs (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:26">John 6:26</span>).</p>
<p><b>That we may see, and believe thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ιδωμεν κα πιστευσωμεν</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the second aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span> and the first aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>, "that we may come to see and come to have faith in thee." It is hard to have patience with this superficial and almost sneering mob.</p>
<p><b>What workest thou? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ εργαζηι;</span></span>). They not simply depreciate the miracle of the day before, but set up a standard for Jesus. </p>
