<p><b> Ate the manna </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μαννα εφαγον</span></span>). The rabbis quoted <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+72:16">Psalms 72:16</span> to prove that the Messiah, when he comes, will outdo Moses with manna from heaven. Jesus was claiming to be the Messiah and able to give bread for eternal life (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:27">John 6:27</span>). Lightfoot (<i>Biblical Essays</i>, p. 152) says: "The key to the understanding of the whole situation is an acquaintance with the national expectation of the greater Moses." They quote to Jesus <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:15">Exodus 16:15</span> (of. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:7">Numbers 11:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+21:5">Numbers 21:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+8:3">Deuteronomy 8:3</span>). Their plea is that Moses gave us bread "from heaven" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του ουρανου</span></span>). Can Jesus equal that deed of Moses? </p>
