<p><b> It was not Moses that gave you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου Μωυσης εδωκεν υμιν</span></span>). "Not Moses gave you." Blunt and pointed denial (aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>) that Moses was the giver of the bread from heaven (the manna). Moses was not superior to Christ on this score.</p>
<p><b>But my Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ ο πατηρ μου</span></span>). Not "our Father," but same claim as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:17">John 5:17</span>. Which caused so much anger in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><b>Gives </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωσιν</span></span>). Present active indicative, not aorist (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκεν</span></span>). Continual process.</p>
<p><b>The true bread out of heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αρτον εκ του ουρανου τον αληθινον</span></span>). "The bread out of heaven" as the manna and more "the genuine bread" of which that was merely a type. On <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθινος</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:23">John 4:23</span>. </p>
