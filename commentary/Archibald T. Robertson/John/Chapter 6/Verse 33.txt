 The bread of God  (ο αρτος του θεου). All bread is of God (Matthew 6:11). The manna came down from heaven (Numbers 11:9) as does this bread (ο καταβαινων). Refers to the bread (ο αρτος, masculine). Bernard notes that this phrase (coming down) is used seven times in this discourse (John 6:33; John 6:38; John 6:41; John 6:42; John 6:50; John 6:51; John 6:58).Giveth life  (ζωην διδους). Chrysostom observes that the manna gave nourishment (τροφη), but not life (ζωη). This is a most astounding statement to the crowd.
