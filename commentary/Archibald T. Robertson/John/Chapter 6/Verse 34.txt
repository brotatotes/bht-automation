<p><b> Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριε</span></span>). Used now instead of <i>Rabbi</i> (25) though how much the people meant by it is not clear.</p>
<p><b>Evermore give us this bread </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντοτε δος ημιν τον αρτον τουτον</span></span>). Second aorist active imperative second singular like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:11">Matthew 6:11</span> (urgent petition). What kind of bread do they mean? The Jewish commentaries and Philo speak of the manna as typifying heavenly bread for the soul. Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:3">1 Corinthians 10:3</span> seems to refer to the manna as "spiritual food." Like the woman at the well (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:15">John 4:15</span>) they long "always" to have "this bread," a perpetual supply. It is probably to this crowd as the water in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:15">John 4:15</span> was to the woman. </p>
