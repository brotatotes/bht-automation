 I am the bread of life  (Εγω ειμ ο αρτος της ζωης). This sublime sentence was startling in the extreme to the crowd. Philo does compare the manna to the θειος λογος in an allegorical sense, but this language is far removed from Philo's vagueness. In the Synoptics (Mark 14:22; Matthew 26:26; Luke 22:19) Jesus uses bread (αρτος) as the symbol of his body in the Lord's Supper, but here Jesus offers himself in place of the loaves and fishes which they had come to seek (John 6:24; John 6:26). He is the bread of life in two senses: it has life in itself, the living bread (John 6:51), and it gives life to others like the water of life, the tree of life. John often has Jesus saying "I am" (εγω ειμ). As also in John 6:41; John 6:48; John 6:51; John 8:12; John 10:7; John 10:9; John 10:11; John 10:14; John 11:25; John 14:6; John 15:1; John 15:5.He that cometh to me  (ο ερχομενος προς εμε). The first act of the soul in approaching Jesus. See also verse John 6:37.Shall not hunger  (ου μη πειναση). Strong double negative ου με with first aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive, "shall not become hungry."He that believeth on me  (ο πιστευων εις εμε). The continuous relation of trust after coming like πιστευητε (present tense) in verse John 6:29. See both verbs used together also in John 7:37.Shall never thirst  (ου μη διψησε πωποτε). So the old MSS. the future active indicative instead of the aorist subjunctive as above, an even stronger form of negation with πωποτε (John 1:18) added.
