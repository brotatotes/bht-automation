<p><b> I am the bread of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω ειμ ο αρτος της ζωης</span></span>). This sublime sentence was startling in the extreme to the crowd. Philo does compare the manna to the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θειος λογος</span></span> in an allegorical sense, but this language is far removed from Philo's vagueness. In the Synoptics (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:22">Mark 14:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:26">Matthew 26:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19">Luke 22:19</span>) Jesus uses bread (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτος</span></span>) as the symbol of his body in the Lord's Supper, but here Jesus offers himself in place of the loaves and fishes which they had come to seek (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:24">John 6:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:26">John 6:26</span>). He is the bread of life in two senses: it has life in itself, the living bread (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span>), and it gives life to others like the water of life, the tree of life. John often has Jesus saying "I am" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω ειμ</span></span>). As also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:41">John 6:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:48">John 6:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:7">John 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:9">John 10:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:14">John 10:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25">John 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:1">John 15:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:5">John 15:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>He that cometh to me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ερχομενος προς εμε</span></span>). The first act of the soul in approaching Jesus. See also verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:37">John 6:37</span>.</p>
<p><b>Shall not hunger </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη πειναση</span></span>). Strong double negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου με</span></span> with first aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive, "shall not become hungry."</p>
<p><b>He that believeth on me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πιστευων εις εμε</span></span>). The continuous relation of trust after coming like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευητε</span></span> (present tense) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:29">John 6:29</span>. See both verbs used together also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span>.</p>
<p><b>Shall never thirst </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη διψησε πωποτε</span></span>). So the old MSS. the future active indicative instead of the aorist subjunctive as above, an even stronger form of negation with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πωποτε</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>) added. </p>
