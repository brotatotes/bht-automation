<p><b> That ye have seen me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ κα εωρακατε με</span></span>). It is not certain that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span> is genuine. If not, Jesus may refer to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:26">John 6:26</span>. If genuine, some other saying is referred to that we do not have. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> (also or even).</p>
<p><b>And yet believe not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ου πιστευετε</span></span>). Use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> = and yet. </p>
