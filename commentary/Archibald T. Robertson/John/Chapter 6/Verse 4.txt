<p><b> The feast of the Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η εορτη των Ιουδαιων</span></span>). Here used of the passover (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πασχα</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:2">John 7:2</span> of the tabernacles. This is probably the third passover in Christ's ministry (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:13">John 2:13</span> and one unmentioned unless <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1">John 5:1</span> be it). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:13">John 2:13</span>, here, and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:55">John 11:55</span> (the last one) the adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγγυς</span></span> (near) is used. John is fond of notes of time. Jesus failed to go to this passover because of the hostility in Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:1">John 7:1</span>). </p>
