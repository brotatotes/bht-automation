 Except the Father draw him  (εαν μη ελκυση αυτον). Negative condition of third class with εαν μη and first aorist active subjunctive of ελκυω, older form ελκω, to drag like a net (John 21:6), or sword (John 18:10), or men (Acts 16:19), to draw by moral power (John 12:32), as in Jeremiah 31:3. Συρω, the other word to drag (Acts 8:3; Acts 14:19) is not used of Christ's drawing power. The same point is repeated in verse John 6:65. The approach of the soul to God is initiated by God, the other side of verse John 6:37. See Romans 8:7 for the same doctrine and use of ουδε δυνατα like ουδεις δυνατα here.
