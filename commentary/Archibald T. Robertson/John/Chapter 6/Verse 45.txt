<p><b> Taught of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδακτο θεου</span></span>). A free quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:13">Isaiah 54:13</span> with this phrase in the LXX. There is here the ablative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεου</span></span> with the passive verbal adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδακτο</span></span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 516). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:9">1 Thessalonians 4:9</span> we have the compound verbal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεοδιδακτο</span></span>. The same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδακτος</span></span> with the ablative occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:13">1 Corinthians 2:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>And hath learned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μαθων</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μανθανω</span></span>. It is not enough to hear God's voice. He must heed it and learn it and do it. This is a voluntary response. This one inevitably comes to Christ. </p>
