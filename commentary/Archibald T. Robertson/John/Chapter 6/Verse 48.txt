<p><b> I am the bread of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω ειμ ο αρτος της ζωης</span></span>). Jesus repeats the astounding words of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:35">John 6:35</span> after fuller explanation. The believer in Christ has eternal life because he gives himself to him. </p>
