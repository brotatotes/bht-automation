<p><b> Strove </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμαχοντο</span></span>). Imperfect (inchoative) middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαχομα</span></span>, to fight in armed combat (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:26">Acts 7:26</span>), then to wage a war of words as here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:24">2 Timothy 2:24</span>. They were already murmuring (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:41">John 6:41</span>), now they began bitter strife with one another over the last words of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:43-51">John 6:43-51</span>), some probably seeing a spiritual meaning in them. There was division of opinion about Jesus in Jerusalem also later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:12">John 7:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:40">John 7:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:16">John 9:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:19">John 10:19</span>).</p>
<p><b>How can? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πως δυναται;</span></span>). The very idiom used by Nicodemus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:4">John 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:9">John 3:9</span>. Here scornful disbelief.</p>
<p><b>This man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>). Contemptuous use pictured in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:42">John 6:42</span>.</p>
<p><b>His flesh to eat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την σαρκα αυτου φαγειν</span></span>). As if we were cannibals! Some MSS. do not have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span>, but the meaning is clear. The mystical appropriation of Christ by the believer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:17">Ephesians 3:17</span>) they could not comprehend, though some apparently were against this literal interpretation of "flesh" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρξ</span></span>). </p>
