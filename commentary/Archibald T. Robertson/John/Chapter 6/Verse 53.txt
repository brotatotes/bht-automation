<p><b> Except ye eat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη φαγητε</span></span>). Negative condition of third class with second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσθιω</span></span>. Jesus repeats the statement in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:50">John 6:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span>. Note change of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μου</span></span> (my) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span> to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του υιου του ανθρωπου</span></span> with same idea.</p>
<p><b>And drink his blood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα πιητε αυτου το αιμα</span></span>). Same condition with second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πινω</span></span>. This addition makes the demand of Jesus seem to these Jews more impossible than before if taken in a baldly literal sense. The only possible meaning is the spiritual appropriation of Jesus Christ by faith (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:47">John 6:47</span>), for "ye have not life in yourselves" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εχετε ζωην εν εαυτοις</span></span>). Life is found only in Christ. </p>
