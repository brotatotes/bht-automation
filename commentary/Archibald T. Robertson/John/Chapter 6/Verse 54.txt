<p><b> He that eateth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο τρωγων</span></span>). Present active participle for continual or habitual eating like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευετε</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:29">John 6:29</span>. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρωγω</span></span> is an old one for eating fruit or vegetables and the feeding of animals. In the N.T. it occurs only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:54">John 6:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:56">John 6:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:58">John 6:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:18">John 13:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:38">Matthew 24:38</span>. Elsewhere in the Gospels always <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσθιω</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφαγον</span></span> (defective verb with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσθιω</span></span>). No distinction is made here between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφαγον</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:48">John 6:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:50">John 6:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:52">John 6:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:53">John 6:53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:58">John 6:58</span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρωγω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:54">John 6:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:56">John 6:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:57">John 6:57</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:58">John 6:58</span>). Some men understand Jesus here to be speaking of the Lord's Supper by prophetic forecast or rather they think that John has put into the mouth of Jesus the sacramental conception of Christianity by making participation in the bread and wine the means of securing eternal life. To me that is a violent misinterpretation of the Gospel and an utter misrepresentation of Christ. It is a grossly literal interpretation of the mystical symbolism of the language of Jesus which these Jews also misunderstood. Christ uses bold imagery to picture spiritual appropriation of himself who is to give his life-blood for the life of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span>). It would have been hopeless confusion for these Jews if Jesus had used the symbolism of the Lord's Supper. It would be real dishonesty for John to use this discourse as a propaganda for sacramentalism. The language of Jesus can only have a spiritual meaning as he unfolds himself as the true manna. </p>
