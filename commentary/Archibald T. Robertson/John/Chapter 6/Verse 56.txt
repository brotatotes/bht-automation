 Abideth in me and I in him  (εν εμο μενε καγω εν αυτω). Added to the phrase in John 6:54 in the place of εχε ζωην αιωνιον (has eternal life). The verb μενω (to abide) expresses continual mystical fellowship between Christ and the believer as in John 15:4-7; 1 John 2:6; 1 John 2:27; 1 John 2:28; 1 John 3:6; 1 John 3:24; 1 John 4:12; 1 John 4:16. There is, of course, no reference to the Lord's Supper (Eucharist), but simply to mystical fellowship with Christ.
