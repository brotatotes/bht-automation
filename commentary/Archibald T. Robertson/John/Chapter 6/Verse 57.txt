<p><b> The living Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ζων πατηρ</span></span>). Nowhere else in the N.T., but see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:26">John 5:26</span> and "the living God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:16">Matthew 16:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:16">2 Corinthians 6:16</span>). The Father is the source of life and so "I live because of the Father" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καγω ζω δια τον πατερα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>He that eateth me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο τρωγων με</span></span>). Still bolder putting of the mystical appropriation of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:53">John 6:53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:54">John 6:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:56">John 6:56</span>).</p>
<p><b>Because of me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' εμε</span></span>). The same idea appears in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:19">John 14:19</span>: "Because I live ye shall live also." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25">John 11:25</span>. Jesus Christ is our ground of hope and guarantee of immortality. Life is in Christ. There is no real difficulty in this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> with the accusative as with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τον πατερα</span></span> just before. It occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:3">John 15:3</span>. As the Father is the fount of life to Christ, so Christ is the fount of life to us. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9">1 John 4:9</span> where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> is used with the genitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' αυτου</span></span>) as the intermediate agent, not the ground or reason as here. </p>
