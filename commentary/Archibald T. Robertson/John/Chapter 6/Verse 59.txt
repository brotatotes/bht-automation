<p><b> In the synagogue </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν συναγωγη</span></span>). Definite like our in church, though article absent. Only use of the word in John except <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:20">John 18:20</span>. "Among the ruins at <i>Tell Hum</i>, the probable site of Capernaum, have been found among the remains of a synagogue a block of stone perhaps the lintel, carved with a pot of manna, and with a pattern of vine leaves and clusters of grapes" (Vincent). </p>
