<p><b> To prove him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζων αυτον</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζω</span></span>, testing him, not here in bad sense of tempting as so often (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:1">Matthew 4:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>What he would do </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ημελλεν ποιειν</span></span>). Indirect question with change of tense to imperfect. As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:25">John 2:25</span> so here John explains why Jesus put the question to Philip. </p>
