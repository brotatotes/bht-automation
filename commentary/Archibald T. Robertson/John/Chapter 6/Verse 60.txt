<p><b> A hard saying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκληρος</span></span>). "This saying is a hard one." Old adjective, rough, harsh, dried hard (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκελλω</span></span>, to dry), probably the last saying of Jesus that he was the bread of life come down from heaven and they were to eat him. It is to be hoped that none of the twelve joined the many disciples in this complaint.</p>
<p><b>Hear it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου ακουειν</span></span>). Or "hear him," hear with acceptation. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span> with the genitive see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:3">John 10:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:16">John 10:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:27">John 10:27</span>. </p>
