<p><b> That believe not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ου πιστευουσιν</span></span>). Failure to believe kills the life in the words of Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Knew from the beginning </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηιδε εξ αρχης</span></span>). In the N.T. we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ αρχης</span></span> only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:4">John 16:4</span>, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' αρχης</span></span> in apparently the same sense as here in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:27">John 15:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:7">1 John 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:24">1 John 2:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:11">1 John 3:11</span> and see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:2">Luke 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>. From the first Jesus distinguished between real trust in him and mere lip service (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:24">John 2:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:31">John 8:31</span>), two senses of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Were </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισιν</span></span>). Present active indicative retained in indirect discourse.</p>
<p><b>And who it was that should betray him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τις εστιν ο παραδωσων</span></span>). Same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> and note article and future active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδωμ</span></span>, to hand over, to betray. John does not say here that Jesus knew that Judas would betray him when he chose him as one of the twelve, least of all that he chose him for that purpose. What he does say is that Jesus was not taken by surprise and soon saw signs of treason in Judas. The same verb is used of John's arrest in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:12">Matthew 4:12</span>. Once Judas is termed traitor (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προδοτης</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:16">Luke 6:16</span>. Judas had gifts and was given his opportunity. He did not have to betray Jesus. </p>
