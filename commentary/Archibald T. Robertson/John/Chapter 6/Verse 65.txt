<p><b> Except it be given him of the Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη η δεδομενον αυτω εκ του πατρος</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη</span></span> and periphrastic perfect passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>. Precisely the same point as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44">John 6:44</span> where we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελκυση</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η δεδομενον</span></span>. The impulse to faith comes from God. Jesus does not expect all to believe and seems to imply that Judas did not truly believe. </p>
