<p><b> Upon this </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ τουτου</span></span>). Same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:12">John 19:12</span>. "Out of this saying or circumstance." Jesus drew the line of cleavage between the true and the false believers.</p>
<p><b>Went back </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηλθον εις τα οπισω</span></span>). Aorist (ingressive) active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απερχομα</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τα οπισω</span></span>, "to the rear" (the behind things) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:6">John 18:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>Walked no more with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκετ μετ' αυτου περιεπατουν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιπατεω</span></span>. The crisis had come. These half-hearted seekers after the loaves and fishes and political power turned abruptly from Jesus, walked out of the synagogue with a deal of bluster and were walking with Jesus no more. Jesus had completely disillusioned these hungry camp-followers who did not care for spiritual manna that consisted in intimate appropriation of the life of Jesus as God's Son. </p>
