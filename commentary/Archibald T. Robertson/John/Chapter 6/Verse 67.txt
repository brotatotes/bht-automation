<p><b> Would ye also go away? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη κα υμεις θελετε υπαγειν;</span></span>). Jesus puts it with the negative answer (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>) expected. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:5">John 21:5</span> where Jesus also uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> in a question. Judas must have shown some sympathy with the disappointed and disappearing crowds. But he kept still. There was possibly restlessness on the part of the other apostles. </p>
