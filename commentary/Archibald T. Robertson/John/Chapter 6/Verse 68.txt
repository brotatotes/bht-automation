<p><b> Lord, to whom shall we go? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριε, προς τινα απελευσομεθα;</span></span>). Peter is the spokesman as usual and his words mean that, if such a thought as desertion crossed their minds when the crowd left, they dismissed it instantly. They had made their choice. They accepted these very words of Jesus that had caused the defection as "the words of eternal life." </p>
