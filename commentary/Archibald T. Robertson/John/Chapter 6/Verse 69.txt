<p><b> We have believed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις πεπιστευκαμεν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>, "We have come to believe and still believe" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:29">John 6:29</span>).</p>
<p><b>And know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εγνωκαμεν</span></span>). Same tense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, "We have come to know and still know."</p>
<p><b>Thou art the Holy One of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ ε ο αγιος του θεου</span></span>). Bernard follows those who believe that this is John's report of the same confession given by the Synoptics (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:27">Mark 8:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:13-20">Matthew 16:13-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:18">Luke 9:18</span>), an utterly unjustifiable conclusion. The details are wholly different. Here in the synagogue in Capernaum, there on Mt. Hermon near Caesarea Philippi. What earthly difficulty is there in supposing that Peter could make a noble confession twice? That is to my mind a wooden conception of the apostles in their growing apprehension of Christ. </p>
