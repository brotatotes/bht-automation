 And one of you is a devil  (κα εξ υμων εις διαβολος εστιν). Jesus does not say that Judas was a devil when he chose him, but that he is one now. In John 13:2; John 13:27 John speaks of the devil entering Judas. How soon the plan to betray Jesus first entered the heart of Judas we do not know (John 12:4). One wonders if the words of Jesus here did not cut Judas to the quick.
