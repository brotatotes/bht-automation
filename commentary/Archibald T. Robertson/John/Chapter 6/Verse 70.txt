<p><b> And one of you is a devil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εξ υμων εις διαβολος εστιν</span></span>). Jesus does not say that Judas was a devil when he chose him, but that he is one now. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:2">John 13:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:27">John 13:27</span> John speaks of the devil entering Judas. How soon the plan to betray Jesus first entered the heart of Judas we do not know (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:4">John 12:4</span>). One wonders if the words of Jesus here did not cut Judas to the quick. </p>
