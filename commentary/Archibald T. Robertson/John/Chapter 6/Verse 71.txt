 Of Simon Iscariot  (Σιμωνος Ισκαριωτου). So his father was named Iscariot also, a man of Kerioth (possibly in Judah, Joshua 15:25, possibly in Moab, Jeremiah 48:24), not in Galilee. Judas was the only one of the twelve not a Galilean. The rest of the verse is like John 12:4.One of the twelve  (εις εκ των δωδεκα). The eternal horror of the thing.
