<p><b> Of Simon Iscariot </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σιμωνος Ισκαριωτου</span></span>). So his father was named Iscariot also, a man of Kerioth (possibly in Judah, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jos+15:25">Joshua 15:25</span>, possibly in Moab, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+48:24">Jeremiah 48:24</span>), not in Galilee. Judas was the only one of the twelve not a Galilean. The rest of the verse is like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:4">John 12:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>One of the twelve </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις εκ των δωδεκα</span></span>). The eternal horror of the thing. </p>
