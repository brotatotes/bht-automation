<p><b> After these things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα ταυτα</span></span>). John's favourite general note of the order of events. Bernard conceives that the events in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:1-14">John 7:1-14</span> follow <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:15-24">John 7:15-24</span> and both follow chapter 5, not chapter 6, a wholly needless readjustment of the narrative to suit a preconceived theory. John simply supplements the narrative in the Synoptics at points deemed important. He now skips the period of withdrawal from Galilee of about six months (from passover to tabernacles).</p>
<p><b>Walked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεπατε</span></span>). Imperfect active, a literal picture of the itinerant ministry of Jesus. He has returned to Galilee from the region of Caesarea Philippi. He had been avoiding Galilee as well as Judea for six months.</p>
<p><b>For he would not walk in Judea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γαρ ηθελεν εν τη Ιουδαια</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω</span></span> picturing the attitude of refusal to work in Judea after the events in chapter 5 (perhaps a year and a half before).</p>
<p><b>Sought to kill </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζητουν αποκτεινα</span></span>). Imperfect active again, progressive attitude, had been seeking to kill him as shown in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span> where the same words occur. </p>
