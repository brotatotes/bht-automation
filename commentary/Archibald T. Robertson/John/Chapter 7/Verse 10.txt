<p><b> Were gone up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεβησαν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινω</span></span>, not past perfect though the action is antecedent in fact to the following <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε ανεβη</span></span>. The Greek does not always draw the precise distinction between the merely punctiliar (aorist) antecedent action and the past perfect (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:9">John 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:45">John 4:45</span>).</p>
<p><b>He also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε αυτος</span></span>). As well as the brothers.</p>
<p><b>Not publicly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου φανερως</span></span>). Against their advice in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:4">John 7:4</span>, using <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανερωσον</span></span> (the very same word stem).</p>
<p><b>But as it were in secret </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα ως εν κρυπτω</span></span>). "Not with the usual caravan of pilgrims" (Bernard). Just the opposite of their advice in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:4">John 7:4</span> with the same phrase <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν φανερω</span></span>. Plainly Jesus purposely went contrary to the insincere counsel of his brothers as to the manner of his Messianic manifestation. This secrecy concerned solely the journey to Jerusalem, not his public teaching there after his arrival (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:26">John 7:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:28">John 7:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:20">John 18:20</span>). </p>
