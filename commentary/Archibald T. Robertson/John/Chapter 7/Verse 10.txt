 Were gone up  (ανεβησαν). Second aorist active indicative of αναβαινω, not past perfect though the action is antecedent in fact to the following τοτε ανεβη. The Greek does not always draw the precise distinction between the merely punctiliar (aorist) antecedent action and the past perfect (John 2:9; John 4:45).He also  (τοτε αυτος). As well as the brothers.Not publicly  (ου φανερως). Against their advice in verse John 7:4, using φανερωσον (the very same word stem).But as it were in secret  (αλλα ως εν κρυπτω). "Not with the usual caravan of pilgrims" (Bernard). Just the opposite of their advice in verse John 7:4 with the same phrase εν φανερω. Plainly Jesus purposely went contrary to the insincere counsel of his brothers as to the manner of his Messianic manifestation. This secrecy concerned solely the journey to Jerusalem, not his public teaching there after his arrival (John 7:26; John 7:28; John 18:20).
