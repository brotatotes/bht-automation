 But when it was now in the midst of the feast  (ηδη δε της εορτης μεσουσης). Literally, "But feast being already midway." Genitive absolute, present active participle, of μεσοω, old verb from μεσος, in LXX, here only in N.T. The feast of tabernacles was originally seven days, but a last day (verse John 7:37; Leviticus 23:36) was added, making eight in all.And taught  (κα εδιδασκεν). Imperfect active of διδασκω, probably inchoative, "began to teach." He went up (ανεβη, effective aorist, arrived). The leaders had asked (verse John 7:11) where Jesus was. There he was now before their very eyes.
