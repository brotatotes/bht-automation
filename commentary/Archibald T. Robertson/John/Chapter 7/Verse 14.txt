Genitive absolute, present active participle, of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεσοω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεσος</span></span>, in LXX, here only in N.T. The feast of tabernacles was originally seven days, but a last day (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+23:36">Leviticus 23:36</span>) was added, making eight in all.</p>
<p><b>And taught </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εδιδασκεν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκω</span></span>, probably inchoative, "began to teach." He went up (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεβη</span></span>, effective aorist, arrived). The leaders had asked (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:11">John 7:11</span>) where Jesus was. There he was now before their very eyes. </p>
