<p><b> Marvelled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθαυμαζον</span></span>). Picturesque imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαυμαζω</span></span>, "were wondering." After all the bluster of the rulers (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:13">John 7:13</span>) here was Jesus teaching without interruption.</p>
<p><b>Knoweth letters </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραμματα οιδεν</span></span>). Second perfect active indicative used as present. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γραμματα</span></span>, old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span>, to write, is originally the letters formed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:11">Galatians 6:11</span>), then a letter or epistle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:21">Acts 28:21</span>), then the sacred Scriptures (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:47">John 5:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:15">2 Timothy 3:15</span>), then learning like Latin <i>litterae</i> and English letters (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:24">Acts 26:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:15">John 7:15</span>). "The marvel was that Jesus showed Himself familiar with the literary methods of the time, which were supposed to be confined to the scholars of the popular teachers" (Westcott).</p>
<p><b>Having never learned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη μεμαθηκως</span></span>). Perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μανθανω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>, the usual negative (subjective) with the participle. It is not the wisdom of Jesus that disconcerted the Jewish leaders, but his learning (Marcus Dods). And yet Jesus had not attended either of the rabbinical theological schools in Jerusalem (Hillel, Shammai). He was not a rabbi in the technical sense, only a carpenter, and yet he surpassed the professional rabbis in the use of their own methods of debate. It is sometimes true today that unschooled men in various walks of life forge ahead of men of lesser gifts with school training. See the like puzzle of the Sanhedrin concerning Peter and John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:13">Acts 4:13</span>). This is not an argument against education, but it takes more than education to make a real man. Probably this sneer at Jesus came from some of the teachers in the Jerusalem seminaries. "Christ was in the eyes of the Jews a merely self-taught enthusiast" (Westcott). </p>
