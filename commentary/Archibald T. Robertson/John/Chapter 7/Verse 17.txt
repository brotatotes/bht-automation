<p><b> If any man willeth to do </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν τις θελη ποιειν</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and present active subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελη</span></span> not used as a mere auxiliary verb for the future "will do," but with full force of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω</span></span>, to will, to wish. See the same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:40">John 5:40</span> "and yet ye are not willing to come" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ου θελετε ελθειν</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>He shall know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωσετα</span></span>). Future middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>. Experimental knowledge from willingness to do God's will. See this same point by Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:46">John 5:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:37">John 18:37</span>. There must be moral harmony between man's purpose and God's will. "If there be no sympathy there can be no understanding" (Westcott). Atheists of all types have no point of contact for approach to the knowledge of Christ. This fact does not prove the non-existence of God, but simply their own isolation. They are out of tune with the Infinite. For those who love God it is also true that obedience to God's will brings richer knowledge of God. Agnostic and atheistic critics are disqualified by Jesus as witnesses to his claims.</p>
<p><b>Of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του θεου</span></span>). Out of God as source.</p>
<p><b>From myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' εμαυτου</span></span>). Instead of from God. </p>
