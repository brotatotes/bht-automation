<p><b> From himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφ' εαυτου</span></span>). This kind of teacher is self-taught, pushes his own ideas, presses his own claims for position and glory, "blows his own horn" as we say. Jesus is the other type of teacher, seeks the glory of the one who sent him, whose herald and ambassador he is.</p>
<p><b>The same </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>). "This one."</p>
<p><b>Unrighteousness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικια</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικη</span></span>). Here in contrast with "true" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθης</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:10">2 Thessalonians 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:6">1 Corinthians 13:6</span> for the deceit of unrighteousness in contrast with truth as here. </p>
