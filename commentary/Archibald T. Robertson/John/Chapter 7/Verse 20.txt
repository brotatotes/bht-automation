<p><b> The multitude </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο οχλος</span></span>). Outside of Jerusalem (the Galilean crowd as in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:11">John 7:11</span>) and so unfamiliar with the effort to kill Jesus recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span>. It is important in this chapter to distinguish clearly the several groups like the Jewish leaders (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:13">John 7:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:15">John 7:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:25">John 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:26">John 7:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:30">John 7:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:32">John 7:32</span>, etc.), the multitude from Galilee and elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:10-13">John 7:10-13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:20">John 7:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:31">John 7:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:40">John 7:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:49">John 7:49</span>), the common people of Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:25">John 7:25</span>), the Roman soldiers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:45">John 7:45</span>).</p>
<p><b>Thou hast a devil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονιον εχεις</span></span>). "Demon," of course, as always in the Gospels. These pilgrims make the same charge against Jesus made long ago by the Pharisees in Jerusalem in explanation of the difference between John and Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:18">Matthew 11:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:33">Luke 7:33</span>). It is an easy way to make a fling like that. "He is a monomaniac labouring under a hallucination that people wish to kill him" (Dods). </p>
