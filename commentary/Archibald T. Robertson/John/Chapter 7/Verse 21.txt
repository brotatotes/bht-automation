<p><b> One work </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εργον</span></span>). Direct allusion to the healing of the impotent man when in Jerusalem before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1">John 5:1</span>). He had wrought others before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:45">John 4:45</span>), but this one on the Sabbath caused the rulers to try to kill Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span>). Some wondered then, others had murder in their hearts. This crowd here is ignorant. </p>
