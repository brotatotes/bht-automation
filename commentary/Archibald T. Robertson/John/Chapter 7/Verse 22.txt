<p><b> For this cause </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τουτο</span></span>). Some would take this phrase with the preceding verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαυμαζετε</span></span> (ye marvel for this cause).</p>
<p><b>Hath given </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεδωκεν</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span> (permanent state).</p>
<p><b>Not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ οτ εκ του Μωυσεως εστιν αλλ' εκ των πατερων</span></span>). A parenthesis to explain that circumcision is older in origin than Moses.</p>
<p><b>And on the sabbath ye circumcise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εν σαββατω περιτεμνετε</span></span>). Adversative use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>=and yet as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:19">John 7:19</span>. That is to say, the Jews keep one law (circumcision) by violating another (on the Sabbath, the charge against him in chapter 5, healing on the Sabbath). </p>
