<p><b> Some therefore of them of Jerusalem </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν τινες εκ των Ιεροσολυμειτων</span></span>). The people of the city in contrast to the multitude of pilgrims at the feast. They form a separate group. The word is made from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιεροσολυμα</span></span> and occurs in Josephus and IV Maccabees. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:5">Mark 1:5</span>. These Jerusalem people knew better than the pilgrims the designs of the rulers (Vincent).</p>
<p><b>Is not this? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ ουτος εστιν;</span></span>). Expecting affirmative answer. Clearly they were not as familiar with the appearance of Jesus as the Galilean multitude (Dods).</p>
<p><b>They seek </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητουσιν</span></span>). The plural refers to the group of leaders already present (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:15">John 7:15</span>) to whom the Jerusalem crowd probably pointed. They knew of their threats to kill Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span>). </p>
