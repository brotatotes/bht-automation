<p><b> They say nothing unto him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν αυτο λεγουσιν</span></span>). But only make sneering comments about him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:16">John 7:16</span>) in spite of his speaking "openly" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησια</span></span>, for which word see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:13">John 7:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:20">John 18:20</span>) before all. lt was sarcasm about the leaders, though an element of surprise on the part of "these shrewd townsmen" (Bernard) may have existed also.</p>
<p><b>Can it be that the rulers indeed know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ποτε αληθως εγνωσιν ο αρχοντες</span></span>). Negative answer expected by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ποτε</span></span> and yet there is ridicule of the rulers in the form of the question. See a like use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ποτε</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:15">Luke 3:15</span>, though nowhere else in John. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγνωσαν</span></span> (second aorist ingressive active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>) may refer to the examination of Jesus by these rulers in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span> and means, "Did they come to know or find out" (and so hold now)?</p>
<p><b>That this is the Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ουτος εστιν ο Χριστος</span></span>). The Messiah of Jewish hope. </p>
