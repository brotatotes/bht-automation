 They say nothing unto him  (ουδεν αυτο λεγουσιν). But only make sneering comments about him (John 7:16) in spite of his speaking "openly" (παρρησια, for which word see John 7:13; John 18:20) before all. lt was sarcasm about the leaders, though an element of surprise on the part of "these shrewd townsmen" (Bernard) may have existed also.Can it be that the rulers indeed know  (μη ποτε αληθως εγνωσιν ο αρχοντες). Negative answer expected by μη ποτε and yet there is ridicule of the rulers in the form of the question. See a like use of μη ποτε in Luke 3:15, though nowhere else in John. Εγνωσαν (second aorist ingressive active indicative of γινωσκω) may refer to the examination of Jesus by these rulers in John 5:19 and means, "Did they come to know or find out" (and so hold now)?That this is the Christ  (οτ ουτος εστιν ο Χριστος). The Messiah of Jewish hope.
