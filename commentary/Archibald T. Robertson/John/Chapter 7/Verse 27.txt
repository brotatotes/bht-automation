<p><b> Howbeit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span>). Clearly adversative here.</p>
<p><b>This man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτον</span></span>). Possibly contemptuous use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span> as may be true in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:25">John 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:26">John 7:26</span>.</p>
<p><b>Whence he is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποθεν εστιν</span></span>). The Galilean Jews knew the family of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:42">John 6:42</span>), but they knew Jesus only as from Nazareth, not as born in Bethlehem (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:42">John 7:42</span>).</p>
<p><b>When the Christ cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Χριστος οταν ερχητα</span></span>). Prolepsis of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Χριστος</span></span> and indefinite temporal clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> and the present middle subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχητα</span></span> rather than the more usual second aorist active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελθη</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:31">John 7:31</span>, a trifle more picturesque. This is a piece of popular theology. "Three things come wholly unexpected--Messiah, a godsend, and a scorpion" (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 97a). The rulers knew the birthplace to be Bethlehem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:42">John 7:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:5">Matthew 2:5</span>), but some even expected the Messiah to drop suddenly from the skies as Satan proposed to Jesus to fall down from the pinnacle of the temple. The Jews generally expected a sudden emergence of the Messiah from concealment with an anointing by Elijah (<i>Apoc. of Bar</i>. XXIX. 3; 2Esdr. 7:28; 13:32; Justin Martyr, <i>Tryph</i>. 110). </p>
