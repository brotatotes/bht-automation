<p><b> And I am not come of myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα απ' εμαυτου ουκ εληλυθα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κα</span></span> here="and yet." Jesus repeats the claim of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:17">John 7:17</span> and also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:30">John 5:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:28">John 8:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:49">John 12:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:10">John 14:10</span>.</p>
<p><b>Whom ye know not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον υμεις ουκ οιδατε</span></span>). Jesus passes by a controversy over the piece of popular theology to point out their ignorance of God the Father who sent him. He tersely agrees that they know something of him. Jesus says of these Jews that they know not God as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:19">John 8:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:55">John 8:55</span>. </p>
