<p><b> I know him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω οιδα αυτον</span></span>). In contrast to the ignorance of these people. See the same words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:55">John 8:55</span> and the same claim in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:25">John 17:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:22">Luke 10:22</span> (the Johannine aerolite). "These three words contain the unique claim of Jesus, which is pressed all through the chapters of controversy with the Jews" (Bernard). Jesus is the Interpreter of God to men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>And he sent me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακεινος με απεστειλεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστελλω</span></span>, the very verb used of Jesus when he sent forth the twelve (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:5">Matthew 10:5</span>) and used by Jesus again of himself in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>. He is the Father's Apostle to men. </p>
