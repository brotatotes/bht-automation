<p><b> His brethren </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αδελφο αυτου</span></span>). "His brothers" (half-brothers actually), who "were not believing on him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε επιστευον εις αυτον</span></span>) as stated in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:5">John 7:5</span>. They were hostile to the Messianic assumptions of Jesus, a natural attitude as one can well see, though at first they were friendly (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:12">John 2:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>Depart hence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταβηθ εντευθεν</span></span>). Second aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταβαινω</span></span>, to pass to another place (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>). It was impertinence on their part.</p>
<p><b>That thy disciples also may behold </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα κα ο μαθητα σου θεωρησουσιν</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεωρεω</span></span>. Jesus had many disciples in Judea at the start (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:23">John 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:1">John 4:1</span>) and had left it because of the jealousy of the Pharisees over his success (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:3">John 4:3</span>). The brothers may have heard of the great defection in the synagogue in Capernaum (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:66">John 6:66</span>), but the advice is clearly ironical.</p>
<p><b>Which thou doest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α ποιεις</span></span>). To what works they refer by this language we do not know. But Jesus had been away from Galilee for some months and from Judea for a year and a half. Perhaps the brothers of Jesus may actually have been eager to rush Jesus into the hostile atmosphere of Jerusalem again. </p>
