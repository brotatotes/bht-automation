<p><b> They sought therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζητουν ουν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητεω</span></span>, inchoative or conative, they began to seek. Either makes sense. The subject is naturally some of the Jerusalemites (Westcott) rather than some of the leaders (Bernard).</p>
<p><b>To take him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον πιασα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive, Doric form from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιαζω</span></span>, from the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιεζω</span></span>, occasionally so in the papyri, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιαζω</span></span> always in N.T. except <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:38">Luke 6:38</span>.</p>
<p><b>And </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>). Here = "but."</p>
<p><b>Laid his hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεβαλεν την χειρα</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιβαλλω</span></span>, to cast upon. Old and common idiom for arresting one to make him a prisoner (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:50">Matthew 26:50</span>). See repetition in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:44">John 7:44</span>.</p>
<p><b>His hour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ωρα αυτου</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span> we read that "the hour" had come, but that was "not yet" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουπω</span></span>). "John is at pains to point out at every point that the persecution and death of Jesus followed a predestined course" (Bernard), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:4">John 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:6">John 7:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:8">John 7:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:10">John 8:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:39">John 10:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>, etc.</p>
<p><b>Was not yet come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουπω εληλυθε</span></span>). Past perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, as John looks back on the story. </p>
