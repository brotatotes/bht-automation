<p><b> When the Christ shall come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Χριστος οταν ελθη</span></span>). Proleptic position of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Χριστος</span></span> again as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:27">John 7:27</span>, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελθη</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχητα</span></span>, calling more attention to the consummation (whenever he does come).</p>
<p><b>Will he do? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ποιησει;</span></span>). Future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> (negative answer expected). Jesus had won a large portion of the pilgrims (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του οχλου πολλο</span></span>) either before this day or during this controversy. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευσαν</span></span> (ingressive aorist active) looks as if many came to believe at this point. These pilgrims had watched closely the proceedings.</p>
<p><b>Than those which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span>). One must supply the unexpressed antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span> in the ablative case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλειονα</span></span> (more). Then the neuter plural accusative relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> (referring to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημεια</span></span> signs) is attracted to the ablative case of the pronominal antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span> (now dropped out).</p>
<p><b>Hath done </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποιησεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>, a timeless constative aorist summing up all the miracles of Jesus so far. </p>
