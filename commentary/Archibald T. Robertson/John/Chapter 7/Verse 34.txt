<p><b> And shall not find me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουχ ευρησετε με</span></span>). Future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκω</span></span>. Jesus had said: "Seek and ye shall find" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7">Matthew 7:7</span>), but this will be too late. Now they were seeking (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:30">John 7:30</span>) to kill Jesus, then they will seek deliverance, but too late.</p>
<p><b>Where I am </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου ειμ εγω</span></span>). No conflict with verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:33">John 7:33</span>, but the essential eternal spiritual home of Christ "in absolute, eternal being and fellowship with the Father" (Vincent).</p>
<p><b>Ye cannot come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις ου δυνασθε ελθειν</span></span>). This fellowship was beyond the comprehension of these hostile Jews. See the same idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:36">John 7:36</span> by the Jews; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:21">John 8:21</span> to the Jews and then to the disciples with the addition of "now" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτ</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:33">John 13:33</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:36">John 13:36</span>). </p>
