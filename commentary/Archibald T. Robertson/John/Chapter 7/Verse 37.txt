<p><b> Now on the last day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν δε τη εσχατη ημερα</span></span>). The eighth day which was "an holy convocation," kept as a Sabbath (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+33:36">Leviticus 33:36</span>), apparently observed as a memorial of the entrance into Canaan, hence "the great day of the feast" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη μεγαλη της εορτης</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Stood and cried </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστηκε κα εκρασεν</span></span>). Past perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span> used as imperfect and intransitive and first aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραζω</span></span>. Picture Jesus standing (linear) and suddenly crying out (punctiliar).</p>
<p><b>If any man thirst </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν τις διψα</span></span>). Third class condition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διψαω</span></span>, "if any one is thirsty." On each of the seven preceding days water was drawn in a golden pitcher from the pool of Siloam and carried in procession to the temple and offered by the priests as the singers chanted <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+12:3">Isaiah 12:3</span>: "With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation." "It is uncertain whether the libations were made upon the eighth day. If they were not made, the significant cessation of the striking rite on this one day of the feast would give a still more fitting occasion for the words" (Westcott). </p>
