<p><b> He that believeth on me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πιστευων εις εμε</span></span>). Nominative absolute as is not uncommon.</p>
<p><b>The scripture </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η γραφη</span></span>). No precise passage can be quoted, though similar idea in several (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:1">Isaiah 55:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:11">Isaiah 58:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:1">Zechariah 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:8">Zechariah 14:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+47:1">Ezekiel 47:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joe+3:18">Joel 3:18</span>). Chrysostom confines it to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span> by punctuation (only the nominative absolute as the Scripture).</p>
<p><b>Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποταμο εκ της κοιλιας αυτου ρευσουσιν υδατος ζωντος</span></span>). Some ancient Western writers connect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πινετω</span></span> of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πιστευων</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:38">John 7:38</span>. By this arrangement <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> (his) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοιλιας</span></span> is made to refer to Christ, not to the believer. Burney argues that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοιλια</span></span> is a mistranslation of the Aramaic (fountain, not belly) and that the reference is to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+47:1">Ezekiel 47:1</span>. C.C. Torrey refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:8">Zechariah 14:8</span>. But the Eastern writers refer <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> (his) to the believer who not only quenches in Christ his own thirst, but becomes a source of new streams for others (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:14">John 4:14</span>). It is a difficult question and Westcott finally changed his view and held <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> to refer to Christ. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ρευσουσιν</span></span> is future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρεω</span></span>, old verb, to flow, here only in the N.T. </p>
