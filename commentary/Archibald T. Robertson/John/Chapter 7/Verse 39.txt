<p><b> Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span>). Genitive by attraction of the relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> (accusative singular object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανειν</span></span>) to the case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του πνευματος</span></span> (the Spirit) the antecedent. But it is purely grammatical gender (neuter <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> because of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span>) which we do not have in English. Even here one should say "whom," not which, of the Spirit of God.</p>
<p><b>Were to receive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμελλον λαμβανειν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλω</span></span> with the present active infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανειν</span></span>, to receive, one of the three constructions with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλω</span></span> (present, aorist, or future infinitive). Literally, "whom they were about to receive," a clear reference to the great pentecost.</p>
<p><b>For the Spirit was not yet given </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουπω γαρ ην πνευμα</span></span>). No verb for "given" in the Greek. The reference is not to the existence of the Spirit, but to the dispensation of the Spirit. This same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρειμ</span></span> (to be present) appears in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:2">Acts 19:2</span> of the Spirit's activity. John, writing at the close of the century, inserts this comment and interpretation of the language of Jesus as an allusion to the coming of the Holy Spirit at pentecost (the Promise of the Father).</p>
<p><b>Because Jesus was not yet glorified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ Ιησους ουπω εδοξασθη</span></span>). Reason for the previous statement, the pentecostal outpouring following the death of Jesus here called "glorified" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοξασθη</span></span>, first aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαζω</span></span>), used later of the death of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:16">John 12:16</span>), even by Jesus himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:23">John 12:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:31">John 13:31</span>). </p>
