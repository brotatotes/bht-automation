<p><b> This is the Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος εστιν ο Χριστος</span></span>). These went further and dared to call Jesus the Messiah and not merely the prophet who might not be the Messiah. They said it openly.</p>
<p><b>What </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>). These denied that Jesus was the Messiah and gave as their reason (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>, for) the fact that he came from Galilee. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> expects a negative answer. </p>
