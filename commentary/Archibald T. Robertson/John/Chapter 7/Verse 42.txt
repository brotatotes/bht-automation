<p><b> The scripture </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η γραφη</span></span>). The reference is to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:2">Micah 5:2</span>, the very passage quoted by the chief priests and scribes in response to Herod's inquiry (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:6">Matthew 2:6</span>). This ignorance of the fact that Jesus was actually born in Bethlehem belongs to the Jews, not to John the author of the Gospel. </p>
