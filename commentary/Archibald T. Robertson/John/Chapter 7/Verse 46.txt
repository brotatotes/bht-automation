<p><b> Never man so spake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεποτε ελαλησεν ουτως ανθρωπος</span></span>). Police officers are not usually carried away by public speech. They had fallen under the power of Jesus "as the Galilean peasants had been impressed" (Bernard) in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:28">John 7:28</span>. It was the words of Jesus that had so gripped these officers, not his works (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:24">John 15:24</span>). It was most disconcerting to the Sanhedrin. </p>
