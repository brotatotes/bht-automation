<p><b> Are ye also led astray? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη κα υμεις πεπλανησθε;</span></span>). The Pharisees took the lead in this scornful sneer at the officers. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> formally expects a negative answer as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:29">John 4:29</span>, but the Pharisees really believed it. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:67">John 6:67</span>. The verb form is perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλαναω</span></span>, for which see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:12">John 7:12</span> with perhaps an allusion to that phase of opinion. </p>
