 Hath any of the rulers believed on him?  (Μη τις εκ των αρχοντων επιστευσεν εις αυτον;). Negative answer sharply expected. First aorist active indicative of πιστευω. "Did any one of the rulers believe on him?" "What right have subordinates to have a mind of their own?" (Dods). These police were employed by the temple authorities (rulers). "Power was slipping through their fingers" (Dods) and that was the secret of their hostility to Jesus.Or of the Pharisees  (η εκ των Φαρισαιων). A wider circle and the most orthodox of all.
