<p><b> This multitude </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο οχλος ουτος</span></span>). The Pharisees had a scorn for the <i>amhaaretz</i> or "people of the earth" (cf. our "clod-hoppers") as is seen in rabbinic literature. It was some of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλος</span></span> (multitude at the feast especially from Galilee) who had shown sympathy with Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:12">John 7:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:28">John 7:28</span>).</p>

No wonder the common people (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλος</span></span>) heard Jesus gladly (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:37">Mark 12:37</span>). The rabbis scouted and scorned them.</p>
