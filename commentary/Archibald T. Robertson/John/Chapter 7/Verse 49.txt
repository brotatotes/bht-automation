 This multitude  (ο οχλος ουτος). The Pharisees had a scorn for the amhaaretz or "people of the earth" (cf. our "clod-hoppers") as is seen in rabbinic literature. It was some of the οχλος (multitude at the feast especially from Galilee) who had shown sympathy with Jesus (John 7:12; John 7:28).Which knoweth not the law  (ο μη γινοσκων). Present active articular participle of γινωσκω with μη usual negative of the participle in the Koine. "No brutish man is sin-fearing, nor is one of the people of the earth pious" (Aboth, II. 6). See the amazement of the Sanhedrin at Peter and John in Acts 4:13 as "unlettered and private men" (αγραμματο κα ιδιωτα). No wonder the common people (οχλος) heard Jesus gladly (Mark 12:37). The rabbis scouted and scorned them.Are accursed  (επαρατο εισιν). Construction according to sense (plural verb and adjective with collective singular οχλος). Επαρατο is old verbal adjective from επαραομα, to call down curses upon, here only in the N.T.
