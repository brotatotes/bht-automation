<p><b> For even his brethren did not believe on him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε γαρ ο αδελφο αυτου επιστευον εις αυτον</span></span>). Literally, "For not even were his brothers believing on him." Imperfect tense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span> with sad picture of the persistent refusal of the brothers of Jesus to believe in his Messianic assumptions, after the two rejections in Capernaum (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:16-31">Luke 4:16-31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:1-6">Mark 6:1-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:54-58">Matthew 13:54-58</span>), and also after the blasphemous accusation of being in league with Beelzebub when the mother and brothers came to take Jesus home (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:31-35">Mark 3:31-35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46-50">Matthew 12:46-50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:19-21">Luke 8:19-21</span>). The brothers here are sarcastic. </p>
