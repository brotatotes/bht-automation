<p><b> Nicodemus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Νικοδημος</span></span>). Not heard from since chapter 3 when he timidly came to Jesus by night. Now he boldly protests against the injustice of condemning Jesus unheard. He appears once more (and only in John) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:39">John 19:39</span> with Joseph of Arimathea as a secret disciple of Jesus. He is a Pharisee and a member of the Sanhedrin and his present act is courageous.</p>
<p><b>Saith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγε</span></span>). Dramatic present active indicative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:3">John 2:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Before </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προτερον</span></span>). This is genuine, a reference to the visit in chapter 3, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυκτος</span></span> (by night) is not genuine here.</p>
<p><b>Being one of them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ων εξ αυτων</span></span>). As a member of the Sanhedrin he takes up the challenge in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:48">John 7:48</span>. He is both ruler and Pharisee. </p>
