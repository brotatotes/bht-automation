 Nicodemus  (Νικοδημος). Not heard from since chapter 3 when he timidly came to Jesus by night. Now he boldly protests against the injustice of condemning Jesus unheard. He appears once more (and only in John) in John 19:39 with Joseph of Arimathea as a secret disciple of Jesus. He is a Pharisee and a member of the Sanhedrin and his present act is courageous.Saith  (λεγε). Dramatic present active indicative as in John 2:3.Before  (προτερον). This is genuine, a reference to the visit in chapter 3, but νυκτος (by night) is not genuine here.Being one of them  (εις ων εξ αυτων). As a member of the Sanhedrin he takes up the challenge in verse John 7:48. He is both ruler and Pharisee.
