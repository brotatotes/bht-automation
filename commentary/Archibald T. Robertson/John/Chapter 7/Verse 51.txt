<p><b> Doth our law judge a man? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ο νομος ημων κρινε τον ανθρωπον;</span></span>). Negative answer expected and "the man," not "a man." These exponents of the law (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:49">John 7:49</span>) were really violating the law of criminal procedure (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:1">Exodus 23:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+1:16">Deuteronomy 1:16</span>). Probably Nicodemus knew that his protest was useless, but he could at least show his colours and score the point of justice in Christ's behalf.</p>
<p><b>Except it first hear from himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη ακουση πρωτον παρ' αυτου</span></span>). Third-class negative condition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη</span></span> and first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span>. That is common justice in all law, to hear a man's side of the case ("from him," <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ' αυτου</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>And know what he doeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα γνω τ ποιε</span></span>). Continuation of the same condition with second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span> with indirect question and present active indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ποιε</span></span>). There was no legal answer to the point of Nicodemus. </p>
