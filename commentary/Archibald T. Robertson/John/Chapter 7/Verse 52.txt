<p><b> Art thou also of Galilee? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη κα συ εκ της Γαλιλαιας ει;</span></span>). Formally negative answer expected by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>, but really they mean to imply that Nicodemus from local feeling or prejudice has lined himself up with this Galilean mob (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλος</span></span>) of sympathizers with Jesus and is like Jesus himself a Galilean. "These aristocrats of Jerusalem had a scornful contempt for the rural Galileans" (Bernard).</p>
<p><b>That out of Galilee ariseth no prophet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ εκ της Γαλιλαιας προφητης ουκ εγειρετα</span></span>). As a matter of fact Jonah, Hosea, Nahum, possibly also Elijah, Elisha, and Amos were from Galilee. It was simply the rage of the Sanhedrin against Jesus regardless of the facts. Westcott suggests that they may have reference to the future, but that is a mere excuse for them. </p>
