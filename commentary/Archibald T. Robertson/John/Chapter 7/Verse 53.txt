<p>This verse and through <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span> (the passage concerning the woman taken in adultery) is certainly not a genuine part of John's Gospel. The oldest and best MSS. (Aleph A B C L W) do not have it. It first appears in Codex Bezae. Some MSS. put it at the close of John's Gospel and some place it in Luke. It is probably a true story for it is like Jesus, but it does not belong to John's Gospel. The Canterbury Version on which we are commenting puts the passage in brackets. Westcott and Hort place it at the end of the Gospel. With this explanation we shall proceed.</p>
<p><b>They went </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επορευθησαν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορευομα</span></span> used as a deponent verb without passive idea. In this context the verb has to refer to the Sanhedrin with a rather pointless contrast to Jesus. </p>
