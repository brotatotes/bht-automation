 Go ye up to the feast  (υμεις αναβητε εις την εορτην). The emphatic word by position is υμεις (ye) in contrast with εγω (I). Second aorist active imperative of αναβαινω, old and common verb for going up to the feast (John 2:13) or anywhere. Take your own advice (John 7:3).I go not up yet  (εγω ουπω αναβαινω). So Westcott and Hort after B W L (Neutral) while ου (not) is read by Aleph D, African Latin, Vulgate, Coptic (Western). Some of the early Greek Fathers were puzzled over the reading ουκ (I go not up) as contradictory to verse John 7:10 wherein it is stated that Jesus did go up. Almost certainly ουκ (not) is correct and is not really contradictory when one notes in verse John 7:10 that the manner of Christ's going up is precisely the opposite of the advice of the brothers in verses John 7:3; John 7:4. "Not yet" (ουπω) is genuine before "fulfilled" (πεπληρωτα, perfect passive indicative of πληροω). One may think, if he will, that Jesus changed his plans after these words, but that is unnecessary. He simply refused to fall in with his brothers' sneering proposal for a grand Messianic procession with the caravan on the way to the feast. He will do that on the journey to the last passover.
