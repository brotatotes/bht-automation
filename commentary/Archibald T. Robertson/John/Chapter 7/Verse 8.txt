<p><b> Go ye up to the feast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις αναβητε εις την εορτην</span></span>). The emphatic word by position is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις</span></span> (ye) in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω</span></span> (I). Second aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινω</span></span>, old and common verb for going up to the feast (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:13">John 2:13</span>) or anywhere. Take your own advice (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:3">John 7:3</span>).</p>
<p><b>I go not up yet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω ουπω αναβαινω</span></span>). So Westcott and Hort after B W L (Neutral) while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> (not) is read by Aleph D, African Latin, Vulgate, Coptic (Western). Some of the early Greek Fathers were puzzled over the reading <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span> (I go not up) as contradictory to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:10">John 7:10</span> wherein it is stated that Jesus did go up. Almost certainly <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span> (not) is correct and is not really contradictory when one notes in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:10">John 7:10</span> that the manner of Christ's going up is precisely the opposite of the advice of the brothers in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:3">John 7:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:4">John 7:4</span>. "Not yet" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουπω</span></span>) is genuine before "fulfilled" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπληρωτα</span></span>, perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span>). One may think, if he will, that Jesus changed his plans after these words, but that is unnecessary. He simply refused to fall in with his brothers' sneering proposal for a grand Messianic procession with the caravan on the way to the feast. He will do that on the journey to the last passover. </p>
