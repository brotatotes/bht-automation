 No man, Lord  (Ουδεισ, Κυριε). "No one, Sir." She makes no excuse for her sin. Does she recognize Jesus as "Lord"?Neither do I condemn thee  (Ουδε εγω σε κατακρινω). Jesus does not condone her sin. See John 8:15 for "I do not judge (condemn) any one." But he does give the poor woman another chance.Henceforth sin no more  (απο του νυν μηκετ αμαρτανε). See also John 5:14 where this same language is used to the impotent man. It literally means (prohibition with present active imperative): "Henceforth no longer go on sinning." One can only hope that the woman was really changed in heart and life. Jesus clearly felt that even a wicked woman can be saved.
