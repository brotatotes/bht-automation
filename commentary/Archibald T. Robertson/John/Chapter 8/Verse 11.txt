<p><b> No man, Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ουδεισ, Κυριε</span></span>). "No one, Sir." She makes no excuse for her sin. Does she recognize Jesus as "Lord"?</p>
<p><b>Neither do I condemn thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ουδε εγω σε κατακρινω</span></span>). Jesus does not condone her sin. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:15">John 8:15</span> for "I do not judge (condemn) any one." But he does give the poor woman another chance.</p>
<p><b>Henceforth sin no more </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο του νυν μηκετ αμαρτανε</span></span>). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:14">John 5:14</span> where this same language is used to the impotent man. It literally means (prohibition with present active imperative): "Henceforth no longer go on sinning." One can only hope that the woman was really changed in heart and life. Jesus clearly felt that even a wicked woman can be saved. </p>
