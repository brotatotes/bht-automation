<p><b> Again therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν ουν</span></span>). This language fits in better with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:52">John 7:52</span> than with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:11">John 8:11</span>. Just suppose Jesus is in the temple on the following day.</p>
<p><b>Unto them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοις</span></span>). The Pharisees and crowds in the temple after the feast was past.</p>
<p><b>I am the light of the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω ειμ το φως του κοσμου</span></span>). Jesus had called his followers "the light of the world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:14">Matthew 5:14</span>), but that was light reflected from him. Already Jesus (the Logos) had been called the true light of men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span>). The Psalmist calls God his Light (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+27:1">John 27:1</span>). So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:19">Isaiah 60:19</span>. At the feast of tabernacles in the Court of the Women where Jesus was on this day (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:20">John 8:20</span>) there were brilliant candelabra and there was the memory of the pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night. But with all this background this supreme and exclusive claim of Jesus (repeated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:5">John 9:5</span>) to being the light of the whole world (of Gentiles as well as of Jews) startled the Pharisees and challenged their opposition.</p>
<p><b>Shall have the light of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξε το φως της ζωης</span></span>). The light which springs from and issues in life (Westcott). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:33">John 6:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span> about Jesus being the Bread of Life. In this sublime claim we come to a decisive place. It will not do to praise Jesus and deny his deity. Only as the Son of God can we justify and accept this language which otherwise is mere conceit and froth. </p>
