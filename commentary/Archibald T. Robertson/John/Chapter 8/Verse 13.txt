<p><b> Of thyself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ σεαυτου</span></span>). This technical objection was according to the rules of evidence among the rabbis. "No man can give witness for himself" (<i>Mishnah, Ketub</i>. 11. 9). Hence, they say, "not true" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ αληθες</span></span>), not pertinent. "They were still in the region of pedantic rules and external tests." In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:31">John 5:31</span> Jesus acknowledged this technical need of further witness outside of his own claims (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:19-30">John 8:19-30</span>) and proceeded to give it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:32-47">John 8:32-47</span>) in the testimony of the Baptist, of the Father, of his works, of the Scriptures, and of Moses in particular. </p>
