<p><b> Even if </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καν</span></span>). That is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εαν</span></span>, a condition of the third class with the present active subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρω</span></span>. Jesus means that his own witness concerning himself is true (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθες</span></span>) even if it contravenes their technical rules of evidence. He can and does tell the truth all by himself concerning himself.</p>
<p><b>For I know whence I came and whither I go </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ οιδα ποθεν ηλθον κα που υπαγω</span></span>). In this terse sentence with two indirect questions Jesus alludes to his pre-existence with the Father before his Incarnation as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span> and to the return to the Father after the death and resurrection as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:3">John 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:2">John 14:2</span>. He again puts both ideas together in one crisp clause in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:28">John 16:28</span> for the apostles who profess to understand him then. But here these Pharisees are blind to the words of Jesus. "But ye know not whence I come nor whither I go" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις δε ουκ οιδατε ποθεν ερχομα η που υπαγω</span></span>). He had spoken of his heavenly destiny (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:33">John 7:33</span>). Jesus alone knew his personal consciousness of his coming from, fellowship with, and return to the Father. Stier (<i>Words of the Lord Jesus</i>) argues that one might as well say to the sun, if claiming to be the sun, that it was night, because it bore witness of itself. The answer is the shining of the sun. </p>
