<p><b> Yea and if I judge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εαν κρινω δε εγω</span></span>). "And even if I pass judgment." Condition of third class again.</p>
<p><b>True </b> (althin). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθινος</span></span>, genuine, soundly based (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαια</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:30">John 5:30</span>), "satisfying our perfect conception" (Westcott), not merely true (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθες</span></span>) in the particular facts (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:14">John 8:14</span>).</p>
<p><b>For I am not alone </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ μονος ουκ ειμ</span></span>). Jesus now takes up the technical criticism in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:13">John 8:13</span> after justifying his right to speak concerning himself.</p>
<p><b>But I and the Father that sent me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ εγω κα ο πεμψας με πατηρ</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:32">John 16:32</span> for a like statement about the Father being with Christ. It is not certain that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατηρ</span></span> is genuine here (omitted by Aleph D, but in B L W), but the Father is clearly meant as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:18">John 7:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:33">John 7:33</span>. Jesus gives the Father as the second witness. </p>
