 Yea and if I judge  (κα εαν κρινω δε εγω). "And even if I pass judgment." Condition of third class again.True  (althin). See John 1:9 for αληθινος, genuine, soundly based (cf. δικαια in John 5:30), "satisfying our perfect conception" (Westcott), not merely true (αληθες) in the particular facts (verse John 8:14).For I am not alone  (οτ μονος ουκ ειμ). Jesus now takes up the technical criticism in verse John 8:13 after justifying his right to speak concerning himself.But I and the Father that sent me  (αλλ εγω κα ο πεμψας με πατηρ). See John 16:32 for a like statement about the Father being with Christ. It is not certain that πατηρ is genuine here (omitted by Aleph D, but in B L W), but the Father is clearly meant as in John 7:18; John 7:33. Jesus gives the Father as the second witness.
