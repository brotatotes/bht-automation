<p><b> Yea and in your law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εν τω νομω δε τω υμετερω</span></span>). Same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και--δε</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:16">John 8:16</span>. They claimed possession of the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:49">John 7:49</span>) and so Jesus takes this turn in answer to the charge of single witness in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:13">John 8:13</span>. He will use similar language (your law) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:34">John 10:34</span> in an <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> as here in controversy with the Jews. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:24">John 15:24</span> to the apostles Jesus even says "in their law" in speaking of the hostile Jews plotting his death. He does not mean in either case to separate himself wholly from the Jews and the law, though in Matthew 5 he does show the superiority of his teaching to that of the law. For the Mosaic regulation about two witnesses see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+17:6">Deuteronomy 17:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+19:15">Deuteronomy 19:15</span>. This combined witness of two is not true just because they agree, unless true in fact separately. But if they disagree, the testimony falls to the ground. In this case the Father confirms the witness of the Son as Jesus had already shown (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:37">John 5:37</span>). </p>
