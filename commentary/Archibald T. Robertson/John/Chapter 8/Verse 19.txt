<p><b> Where is thy Father? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">που εστιν ο πατηρ σου;</span></span>). "The testimony of an unseen and unheard witness would not satisfy them" (Vincent). Bernard understands the Pharisees to see that Jesus claims God the Father as his second witness and so ask "where," not "who" he is. Augustine has it: <i>Patrem Christi carnaliter acceperunt</i>, Christ's human father, as if the Pharisees were "misled perhaps by the Lord's use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπον</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:17">John 8:17</span>)" (Dods). Cyril even took it to be a coarse allusion to the birth of Jesus as a bastard according to the Talmud. Perhaps the Pharisees used the question with <i>double entendre</i>, even with all three ideas dancing in their hostile minds.</p>
<p><b>Ye would know my Father also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τον πατερα μου αν ηιδειτε</span></span>). Conclusion of second-class condition determined as unfulfilled with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and second perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span> used as imperfect in both condition and conclusion. See this same point made to Philip in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9">John 14:9</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:7">John 14:7</span> Jesus will use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span> in the condition and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span> in the conclusion. The ignorance of the Pharisees about Jesus proves it and is due to their ignorance of the Father. See this point more fully stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:36-38">John 5:36-38</span> when Jesus had his previous controversy in Jerusalem. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:28">John 7:28</span> Jesus said that they knew his home in Nazareth, but he denied then that they knew the Father who sent him. Jesus will again on this occasion (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:55">John 8:55</span>) deny their knowledge of the Father. Later he will deny their knowledge of the Father and of the Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:3">John 16:3</span>). The Pharisees are silenced for the moment. </p>
