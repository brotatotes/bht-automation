<p><b> Early in the morning </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορθρου</span></span>). Genitive of time, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορθρος</span></span> meaning daybreak, old word, not in John, though in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:1">Luke 24:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:21">Acts 5:21</span>. John uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:28">John 18:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:1">John 20:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:4">John 21:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>He came again into the temple </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν παρεγενετο εις το ιερον</span></span>). If the paragraph is genuine, the time is the next day after the eighth and last day of the feast. If not genuine, there is no way of telling the time of this apparently true incident.</p>
<p><b>And all the people came unto him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα πας ο λαος ηρχετο προς αυτον</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span> picturing the enthusiasm of the whole (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πας</span></span>) crowd now as opposed to the divisions in chapter 7.</p>
<p><b>Taught </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιδασκεν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκω</span></span>. He took his seat (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθισας</span></span>, ingressive active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθιζω</span></span>) as was customary for Jesus and began to teach (inchoative imperfect). So the picture. </p>
