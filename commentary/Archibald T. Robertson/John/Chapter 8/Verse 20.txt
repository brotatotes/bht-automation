<p><b> In the treasury </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω γαζοφυλακιω</span></span>). See already <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:41">Mark 12:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:1">Luke 21:1</span> for this word for the treasure-chambers of the temple. "It abutted on the Court of the Women, and against its walls were placed chests, trumpet-like in form, as receptacles for the offerings of the worshippers" (Bernard). The Persian word <i>gaza</i> (treasure) occurs only once in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:27">Acts 8:27</span>) and the compound (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλακη</span></span>, guard) only here in John. Jesus hardly taught within a treasure-chamber. It probably means "at the treasury in the temple." This court was probably the most public part of the temple (Vincent).</p>
<p><b>And </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>)="and yet" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:10">John 1:10</span>, etc.</p>
<p><b>Because his hour was not yet come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ουπω εληλυθε η ωρα αυτου</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Reason </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>) given why no one seized (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιασεν</span></span>, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:30">John 7:30</span>) him. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εληλυθε</span></span> is past perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, "had not yet come." This very use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωρα</span></span> appears in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:4">John 2:4</span> and the very clause in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:30">John 7:30</span> which see. </p>
