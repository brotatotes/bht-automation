<p><b> Will he kill himself? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητ αποκτενε εαυτον;</span></span>). Negative answer formally expected, but there is a manifest sneer in the query. "The mockery in these words is alike subtle and bitter" (Vincent). It was a different group of Jews in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:31">John 7:31</span> who cynically suggested that he was going to work among the Greeks in the Dispersion. Here they infer that Jesus refers to the next world. They suggest the depths of Gehenna for him as the abode of suicides (Josephus, <i>War</i> III. viii. 5). Of course the rabbis could not join Jesus there! Edersheim argues against this view. </p>
