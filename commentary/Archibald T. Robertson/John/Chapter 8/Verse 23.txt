<p><b> Ye are from beneath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις εκ των κατω</span></span>). This language, peculiar to John, could take up the idea in Josephus that these rabbis came from Gehenna whence they will go as children of the devil (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>), but the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του κοσμου τουτου</span></span> ("of this world" in origin) as parallel to what we have here seems to prove that the contrast between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανω</span></span> here is between the earthly (sensual) and the heavenly as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:15-17">James 3:15-17</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:1">Colossians 3:1</span>. This is the only use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατω</span></span> in John (except <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:6">John 8:6</span>). These proud rabbis had their origin in this world of darkness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span>) with all its limitations.</p>
<p><b>I am from above </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω εκ των ανω ειμ</span></span>). The contrast is complete in origin and character, already stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:31">John 3:31</span>, and calculated to intensify their anger. </p>
