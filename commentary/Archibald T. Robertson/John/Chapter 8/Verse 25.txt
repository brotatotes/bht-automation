<p><b> Who art thou? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συ τις ει;</span></span>). Proleptic use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ</span></span> before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις</span></span>, "Thou, who art thou?" Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span>. He had virtually claimed to be the Messiah and on a par with God as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:15">John 5:15</span>. They wish to pin him down and to charge him with blasphemy.</p>
<p><b>Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αρχην οτ κα λαλω υμιν</span></span>). A difficult sentence. It is not clear whether it is an affirmation or a question. The Latin and Syriac versions treat it as affirmative. Westcott and Hort follow Meyer and take it as interrogative. The Greek fathers take it as an exclamation. It seems clear that the adverbial accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αρχην</span></span> cannot mean "from the beginning" like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' αρχης</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:27">John 15:27</span>) or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ αρχης</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:4">John 16:4</span>). The LXX has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αρχην</span></span> for "at the beginning" or "at the first" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+43:20">Genesis 43:20</span>). There are examples in Greek, chiefly negative, where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αρχην</span></span> means "at all," "essentially," "primarily." Vincent and Bernard so take it here, "Primarily what I am telling you." Jesus avoids the term Messiah with its political connotations. He stands by his high claims already made. </p>
