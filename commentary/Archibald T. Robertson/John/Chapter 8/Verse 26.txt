<p><b> I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλα εχω περ υμων λαλειν κα κρινειν</span></span>). Instead of further talk about his own claims (already plain enough) Jesus turns to speak and to judge concerning them and their attitude towards him (cf. verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:16">John 8:16</span>). Whatever they think of Jesus the Father who sent him is true (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθης</span></span>). They cannot evade responsibility for the message heard. So Jesus goes on speaking it from the Father. </p>
