<p><b>Are ye truly my disciples </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθως μαθητα μου εστε</span></span>).

We accept church members on <i>profession</i> of trust in Christ. Continuance in the word (teaching) proves the sincerity or insincerity of the profession. It is the acid test of life. </p>
