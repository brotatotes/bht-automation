 And ye shall know the truth  (κα γνωσεσθε την αληθειαν). Truth is one of the marks of Christ (John 1:14) and Jesus will claim to Thomas to be the personification of truth (John 14:6). But it will be for them knowledge to be learned by doing God's will (John 7:17). The word is from αληθης (α privative and ληθω, to conceal, unsealed, open). See also verses John 8:40; John 8:44; John 8:45.And the truth shall make you free  (κα η αληθεια ελευθερωσε υμας). Future active indicative of ελευθεροω, old verb from ελευθερος (from ερχομα, to go where one wishes and so free). One of Paul's great words for freedom from the bondage of the law (Romans 6:18; Galatians 5:1). The freedom of which Jesus here speaks is freedom from the slavery of sin as Paul in Romans 8:2. See John 8:36. This freedom is won alone by Christ (John 8:36) and we are sanctified in truth (John 17:19). In John 1:17 truth is mentioned with grace as one of the marks of the gospel through Christ. Freedom (intellectual, moral, spiritual) is only attainable when we are set free from darkness, sin, ignorance, superstition and let the Light of the World shine on us and in us.
