<p><b> And ye shall know the truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα γνωσεσθε την αληθειαν</span></span>). Truth is one of the marks of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>) and Jesus will claim to Thomas to be the personification of truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:6">John 14:6</span>). But it will be for them knowledge to be learned by doing God's will (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:17">John 7:17</span>). The word is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθης</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ληθω</span></span>, to conceal, unsealed, open). See also verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:40">John 8:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:45">John 8:45</span>.</p>
<p><b>And the truth shall make you free </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα η αληθεια ελευθερωσε υμας</span></span>). Future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελευθεροω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελευθερος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, to go where one wishes and so free). One of Paul's great words for freedom from the bondage of the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:18">Romans 6:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>). The freedom of which Jesus here speaks is freedom from the slavery of sin as Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:2">Romans 8:2</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:36">John 8:36</span>. This freedom is won alone by Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:36">John 8:36</span>) and we are sanctified in truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19">John 17:19</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span> truth is mentioned with grace as one of the marks of the gospel through Christ. Freedom (intellectual, moral, spiritual) is only attainable when we are set free from darkness, sin, ignorance, superstition and let the Light of the World shine on us and in us. </p>
