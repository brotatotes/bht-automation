<p><b> We be Abraham's seed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σπερμα Αβρααμ εσμεν</span></span>). "We are Abraham's seed," the proudest boast of the Jews, of Sarah the freewoman and not of Hagar the bondwoman (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:22">Galatians 4:22</span>). Yes, but the Jews came to rely solely on mere physical descent (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span>) and so God made Gentiles the spiritual children of Abraham by faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:7">Matthew 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:6">Matthew 9:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>And have never yet been in bondage to any man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουδεν δεδουλευκαμεν πωποτε</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλευω</span></span>, to be slaves. This was a palpable untruth uttered in the heat of controversy. At that very moment the Jews wore the Roman yoke as they had worn that of Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Alexander, the Ptolemies, the Syrian (Seleucid) kings. They had liberty for a while under the Maccabees. "These poor believers soon come to the end of their faith" (Stier). But even so they had completely missed the point in the words of Jesus about freedom by truth. </p>
