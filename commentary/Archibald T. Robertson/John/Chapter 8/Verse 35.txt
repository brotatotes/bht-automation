<p><b> The bondservant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δουλος</span></span>) ...</p>
<p><b>the son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο υιος</span></span>). There is a change in the metaphor by this contrast between the positions of the son and the slave in the house. The slave has no footing or tenure and may be cast out at any moment while the son is the heir and has a permanent place. Cf. Ishmael and Isaac (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:10">Genesis 21:10</span>) and Paul's use of it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:30">Galatians 4:30</span>. We do not know that there is any reference here to Hagar and Ishmael. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:5">Hebrews 3:5</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:7">Numbers 12:7</span>) for a like contrast between Moses as servant (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεραπων</span></span>) in God's house and Christ as Son (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος</span></span>) over God's house. </p>
