 If therefore the son shall make you free  (εαν ουν ο υιος υμας ελευθερωση). Condition of third class with εαν and first aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive. "If therefore the Son set you free," as he has the power to do.Ye shall be free indeed  (οντως ελευθερο εσεσθε). Old and common adverb from participle οντων, actually, really (cf. Luke 24:34). But this spiritual freedom was beyond the concept or wish of these Jews.
