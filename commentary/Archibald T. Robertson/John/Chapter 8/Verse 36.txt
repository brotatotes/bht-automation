<p><b> If therefore the son shall make you free </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ουν ο υιος υμας ελευθερωση</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and first aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive. "If therefore the Son set you free," as he has the power to do.</p>
<p><b>Ye shall be free indeed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οντως ελευθερο εσεσθε</span></span>). Old and common adverb from participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οντων</span></span>, actually, really (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:34">Luke 24:34</span>). But this spiritual freedom was beyond the concept or wish of these Jews. </p>
