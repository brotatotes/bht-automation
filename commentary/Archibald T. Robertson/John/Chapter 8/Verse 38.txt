<p><b> With my Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα τω πατρ</span></span>). Locative case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατηρ</span></span> and article used as possessive (common idiom), "by the side of my Father," picture of intimate fellowship like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τον θεον</span></span> (face to face with God) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>From your father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα του πατρος</span></span>). Ablative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> (from the side of) and same possessive use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του</span></span> in each instance, though "the" will really answer both times. But <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πατηρ</span></span> does not mean the same person. Christ's Father by contrast is not their father. </p>
