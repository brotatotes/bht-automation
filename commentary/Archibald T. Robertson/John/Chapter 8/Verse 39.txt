<p><b> Our father is Abraham </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πατηρ ημων Αβρααμ εστιν</span></span>). They saw the implication and tried to counter it by repeating their claim in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:33">John 8:33</span> which was true so far as physical descent went as Jesus had admitted (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:37">John 8:37</span>).</p>
<p><b>If ye were </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε εστε</span></span>). Strictly, "if ye are" as ye claim, a condition of the first class assumed to be true.</p>

Read by C L N and a corrector of Aleph while W omits <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span>. This makes a mixed condition (protasis of the first class, apodosis of the second. See Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1022). But B reads <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιειτε</span></span> like the Sin. Syriac which has to be treated as imperative (so Westcott and Hort). </p>
