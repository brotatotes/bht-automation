<p><b> But now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν δε</span></span>). Clear statement that they are not doing "the works of Abraham" in seeking to kill him. See this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν δε</span></span> after a condition of second class without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:22">John 16:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:24">John 16:24</span>.</p>
<p><b>This did not Abraham </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο Αβρααμ ουκ εποιησεν</span></span>). Blunt and pointed of their unlikeness to Abraham.</p>
<p><b>A man that hath told you the truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπον ος τεν αληθειαν υμιν λελαληκα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ανθρωπον</span></span> (here=person, one) is accusative case in apposition with</p>
<p><b>me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span>) just before. The perfect active indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λελαληκα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span> is in the first person singular because the relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span> has the person of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span>, an idiom not retained in the English</p>
<p><b>that hath </b> (that have or who have) though it is retained in the English of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:9">1 Corinthians 15:9</span> "that am" for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος ειμ</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Which I heard from God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην ηκουσα παρα του θεου</span></span>). Here we have "I" in the English. "God" here is equal to "My Father" in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:38">John 8:38</span>. The only crime of Jesus is telling the truth directly from God. </p>
