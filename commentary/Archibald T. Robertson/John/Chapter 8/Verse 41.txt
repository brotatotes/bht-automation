<p><b> Ye do the works of your father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις ποιειτε τα εργα του πατρος υμων</span></span>). Who is not Abraham and not God as Jesus plainly indicates.</p>
<p><b>We were not born of fornication </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις εκ πορνειας εγεννηθημεν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενναω</span></span>. This they said as a proud boast. Jesus had admitted that they were physical (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+23:2">Deuteronomy 23:2</span>) descendants of Abraham (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:37">John 8:37</span>), but now denies that they are spiritual children of Abraham (like Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:7">Romans 9:7</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πορνεια</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορνος</span></span> (harlot) and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περνημ</span></span>, to sell, a woman who sells her body for sexual uses. It is vaguely possible that in this stern denial the Pharisees may have an indirect fling at Jesus as the bastard son of Mary (so Talmud).</p>
<p><b>We have one Father, even God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενα πατερα εχομεν τον θεον</span></span>). No "even" in the Greek, "One Father we have, God." This in direct reply to the implication of Jesus (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:38">John 8:38</span>) that God was not their spiritual Father. </p>
