<p><b> Ye would love me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγαπατε αν εμε</span></span>). Conclusion of second-class condition with distinct implication that their failure to love Jesus is proof that God is not their Father (protasis).</p>
<p><b>For I came forth from God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω γαρ εκ του θεου εξηλθον</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξερχομα</span></span>, definite historical event (the Incarnation). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:30">John 4:30</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηλθον εκ</span></span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:3">John 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:30">John 16:30</span> Jesus is said to have come from (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>) God. The distinction is not to be pressed. Note the definite consciousness of pre-existence with God as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>And am come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ηκω</span></span>). Present active indicative with perfect sense in the verb stem (state of completion) before rise of the tense and here retained. "I am here," Jesus means.</p>
<p><b>Of myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' εμαυτου</span></span>). His coming was not self-initiated nor independent of the Father. "But he (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινος</span></span>, emphatic demonstrative pronoun) sent me" and here I am. </p>
