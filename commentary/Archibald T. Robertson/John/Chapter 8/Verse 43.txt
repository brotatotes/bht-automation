<p><b> My speech </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την λαλιαν την εμην</span></span>) and</p>
<p><b>my word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον λογον τον εμον</span></span>). Perhaps <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλια</span></span>, old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλος</span></span> (talk), means here more manner of speech than just story (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:42">John 4:42</span>), while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span> refers rather to the subject matter. They will not listen (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου δυνασθε ακουειν</span></span>) to the substance of Christ's teaching and hence they are impatient with the way that he talks. How often that is true. </p>
