<p><b> Ye are of your father the devil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις εκ του πατρος του διαβολου</span></span>). Certainly they can "understand" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκετε</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:43">John 8:43</span>) this "talk" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλιαν</span></span>) though they will be greatly angered. But they had to hear it (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουειν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:43">John 8:43</span>). It was like a bombshell in spite of the preliminary preparation.</p>
<p><b>Your will to do </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελετε ποιειν</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω</span></span> and present active infinitive, "Ye wish to go on doing." This same idea Jesus presents in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:38">Matthew 13:38</span> (the sons of the evil one, the devil) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+23:15">John 23:15</span> (twofold more a son of Gehenna than you). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:8">1 John 3:8</span> for "of the devil" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του διαβολου</span></span>) for the one who persists in sinning. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span> the devil is one who leads all the world astray. The Gnostic view that Jesus means "the father of the devil" is grotesque. Jesus does not, of course, here deny that the Jews, like all men, are children of God the Creator, like Paul's offspring of God for all men in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:28">Acts 17:28</span>. What he denies to these Pharisees is that they are spiritual children of God who do his will. They do the lusts and will of the devil. The Baptist had denied this same spiritual fatherhood to the merely physical descendants of Abraham (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span>). He even called them "broods of vipers" as Jesus did later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:34">Matthew 12:34</span>).</p>
<p><b>A murderer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωποκτονος</span></span>). Old and rare word (Euripides) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπος</span></span>, man, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτεινω</span></span>, to kill. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:15">1 John 3:15</span>. The Jews were seeking to kill Jesus and so like their father the devil.</p>
<p><b>Stood not in the truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη αληθεια ουκ εστηκεν</span></span>). Since <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ</span></span>, is genuine, the form of the verb is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστεκεν</span></span> the imperfect of the late present stem <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηκω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:25">Mark 11:25</span>) from the perfect active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστηκα</span></span> (intransitive) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>, to place.</p>
<p><b>No truth in him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν αληθεια εν αυτω</span></span>). Inside him or outside (environment). The devil and truth have no contact.</p>
<p><b>When he speaketh a lie </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν λαλη το ψευδος</span></span>). Indefinite temporal clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> and the present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span>. But note the article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το</span></span>: "Whenever he speaks the lie," as he is sure to do because it is his nature. Hence "he speaks out of his own" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ των ιδιων λαλε</span></span>) like a fountain bubbling up (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:34">Matthew 12:34</span>).</p>
<p><b>For he is a liar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ψευστης εστιν</span></span>). Old word for the agent in a conscious falsehood (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψευδος</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:10">1 John 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:4">Romans 3:4</span>. Common word in John because of the emphasis on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθεια</span></span> (truth).</p>
<p><b>And the father thereof </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο πατηρ αυτου</span></span>). Either the father of the lie or of the liar, both of which are true as already shown by Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Autou </b> in the genitive can be either neuter or masculine. Westcott takes it thus, "because he is a liar and his father (the devil) is a liar," making "one," not the devil, the subject of "whenever he speaks," a very doubtful expression. </p>
