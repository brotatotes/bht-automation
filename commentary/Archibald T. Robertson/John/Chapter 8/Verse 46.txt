<p><b> Which of you convicteth me of sin? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τις εξ υμων ελεγχε με περ αμαριτασ;</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:20">John 3:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:8">John 16:8</span> (the work of the Holy Spirit) for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγχω</span></span> for charge and proof. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτια</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span> means sin in general, not particular sins. The rhetorical question which receives no answer involves sinlessness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>) without specifically saying so. Bernard suggests that Jesus paused after this pungent question before going on.</p>
<p><b>Why do ye not believe me? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δια τ υμεις ου πιστευετε μοι;</span></span>). This question drives home the irrationality of their hostility to Jesus. It was based on prejudice and predilection. </p>
