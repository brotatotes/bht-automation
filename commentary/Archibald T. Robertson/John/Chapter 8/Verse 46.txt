 Which of you convicteth me of sin?  (Τις εξ υμων ελεγχε με περ αμαριτασ;). See on John 3:20; John 16:8 (the work of the Holy Spirit) for ελεγχω for charge and proof. The use of αμαρτια as in John 1:29 means sin in general, not particular sins. The rhetorical question which receives no answer involves sinlessness (Hebrews 4:15) without specifically saying so. Bernard suggests that Jesus paused after this pungent question before going on.Why do ye not believe me?  (Δια τ υμεις ου πιστευετε μοι;). This question drives home the irrationality of their hostility to Jesus. It was based on prejudice and predilection.
