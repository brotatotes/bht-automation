<p><b> Thou art a Samaritan and hast a demon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σαμαρειτης ε συ κα δαιμονιον εχεις</span></span>). On the spur of the moment in their rage and fury they can think of no meaner things to say. They know, of course, that Jesus was not a Samaritan, but he had acted like a Samaritan in challenging their peculiar spiritual privileges (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:9">John 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:39">John 4:39</span>). The charge of having a demon was an old one by the Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:24">Matthew 12:24</span>) and it is repeated later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:20">John 10:20</span>). </p>
