<p><b>My Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον πατερα μου</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:16">John 2:16</span>. He is not mad in claiming to honour God (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:18">John 7:18</span>). They were insulting the Father in insulting him (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:23">John 5:23</span>). On <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατιμαζω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμαω</span></span>, to dishonour) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:11">Luke 20:11</span>. </p>
