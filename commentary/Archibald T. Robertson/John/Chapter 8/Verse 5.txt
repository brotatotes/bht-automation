<p><b> Commanded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενετειλατο</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντελλω</span></span>, old verb to enjoin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:6">Matthew 4:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>To stone such </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας τοιαυτας λιθαζειν</span></span>). Present active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθαζω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθος</span></span>), from Aristotle on. Stoning was specified for the case of a betrothed woman guilty of adultery (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+22:23">Deuteronomy 22:23</span>) and for a priest's daughter if guilty. In other cases just death was commanded (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+20:10">Leviticus 20:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+22:22">Deuteronomy 22:22</span>). The Talmud prescribes strangulation. This case may have strictly come within the regulation as a betrothed virgin.</p>
<p><b>What then sayest thou of her? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ ουν τ λεγεισ;</span></span>). "Thou then, what dost thou say?" This was the whole point, to catch Jesus, not to punish the woman. </p>
