 Commanded  (ενετειλατο). First aorist middle indicative of εντελλω, old verb to enjoin (Matthew 4:6).To stone such  (τας τοιαυτας λιθαζειν). Present active infinitive of λιθαζω (from λιθος), from Aristotle on. Stoning was specified for the case of a betrothed woman guilty of adultery (Deuteronomy 22:23) and for a priest's daughter if guilty. In other cases just death was commanded (Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22). The Talmud prescribes strangulation. This case may have strictly come within the regulation as a betrothed virgin.What then sayest thou of her?  (συ ουν τ λεγεισ;). "Thou then, what dost thou say?" This was the whole point, to catch Jesus, not to punish the woman.
