<p><b> But I seek not mine own glory </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω δε ου ζητω την δοξαν μου</span></span>). As they did not seek the glory of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:44">John 5:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:4">John 8:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>And judgeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα κρινων</span></span>). The Father judges between you and me, though the Son is the Judge of mankind (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22">John 5:22</span>). "It is only the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξα</span></span> (glory) that comes from God that is worth having" (Bernard). </p>
