 Now we know  (νυν εγνωκαμεν). Perfect active indicative of γινωσκω, state of completion, "Now since such talk we have come to certain knowledge that thou hast a demon" (verse John 8:48).Is dead  (απεθανεν). Second aorist active indicative of αποθνησκω. "Abraham died."And thou sayest  (κα συ λεγεις). Adversative use of κα, "and yet." Emphatic position of συ (thou). Same condition quoted as in verse John 8:51.He shall never taste of death  (ου με γευσητα θανατου εις τον αιονα). Same emphatic negative with subjunctive as in verse John 8:51, but γευσητα (first aorist middle subjunctive of γευω with genitive case θανατου (death). Another Hebraism for dying like θεωρηση (see) in verse John 8:51. Used in Hebrews 2:9 of the death of Jesus and in Synoptics (Matthew 16:28; Mark 9:1; Luke 9:27). It occurs in the Talmud, but not in the O.T. The Pharisees thus did not misquote Jesus, though they misunderstood him.
