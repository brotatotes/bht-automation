 Art thou greater than our father Abraham?  (Μη συ μειζων ε του πατρος ημων Αβρααμ;). Negative answer expected by μη with ablative case of comparison in πατρος after μειζων. The question was designed to put Jesus in a difficult position, for Abraham and the prophets all "died." They do not see that Jesus uses death in a different sense.Whom makest thou thyself?  (τινα σεαυτον ποιεισ;). Σεαυτον is predicate accusative with ποιεις. They suspect that Jesus is guilty of blasphemy as they charged in John 5:18 in making himself equal with God. Later they will make it specifically (John 10:33; John 19:7). They set a trap for Jesus for this purpose.
