<p><b> Art thou greater than our father Abraham? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη συ μειζων ε του πατρος ημων Αβρααμ;</span></span>). Negative answer expected by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> with ablative case of comparison in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατρος</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζων</span></span>. The question was designed to put Jesus in a difficult position, for Abraham and the prophets all "died." They do not see that Jesus uses death in a different sense.</p>
<p><b>Whom makest thou thyself? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινα σεαυτον ποιεισ;</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σεαυτον</span></span> is predicate accusative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεις</span></span>. They suspect that Jesus is guilty of blasphemy as they charged in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span> in making himself equal with God. Later they will make it specifically (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:33">John 10:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:7">John 19:7</span>). They set a trap for Jesus for this purpose. </p>
