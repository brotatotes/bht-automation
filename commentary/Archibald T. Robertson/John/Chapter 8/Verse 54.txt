<p><b> If I glorify myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν εγω δοξασω εμαυτον</span></span>). Third-class condition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and first aorist active subjunctive (or future active indicative) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαζω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>It is my Father that glorifieth me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν ο πατηρ μου ο δοξαζων με</span></span>). The position and accent of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> mean: "Actually my Father is the one," etc.</p>
<p><b>Of whom ye say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον υμεις λεγετε</span></span>). The accusative of the person (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον</span></span>) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγετε</span></span> is regular (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:36">John 10:36</span>).</p>
<p><b>Your God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος υμων</span></span>). So Aleph B D and apparently correct, though A C L W Delta Theta have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημων</span></span> (our God). The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> can be taken as recitative (direct quotation, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημων</span></span>, our) or declarative (indirect, that, and so <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμων</span></span>). The Jews claimed God as their peculiar national God as they had said in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:41">John 8:41</span>. So Jesus turns this confession and claim against them. </p>
