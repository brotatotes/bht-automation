<p><b> And ye have not known him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκ εγνωκατε αυτον</span></span>). Adversative use again of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>="and yet." Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, the verb for experiential knowledge. This was true of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοσμος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:10">John 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:25">John 17:25</span>) and of the hostile Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:3">John 16:3</span>). Jesus prays that the world may know (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:23">John 17:23</span>) and the handful of disciples had come to know (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:25">John 17:25</span>).</p>
<p><b>But I know him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω δε οιδα αυτον</span></span>). Equipped by eternal fellowship to reveal the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1-18">John 1:1-18</span>). This peculiar intimate knowledge Jesus had already claimed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:29">John 7:29</span>). Jesus used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:19">John 8:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:21">John 15:21</span>) or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:23">John 17:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:25">John 17:25</span>) for the knowledge of the Father. No undue distinction can be drawn here.</p>
<p><b>And if I should say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καν ειπω</span></span>). Third-class condition (concession), "even if I say," with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εαν</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καν</span></span>) and second aorist active subjunctive. "Suppose I say."</p>
<p><b>I shall be like you a liar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσομα ομοιος υμιν ψευστης</span></span>). Apodosis of the condition. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hομοιος</span></span> (like) is followed by the associative-instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν</span></span>. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψευστης</span></span> (liar), in spite of the statement that they are the children of the devil, the father of lying (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>), comes with a sudden jolt because it is a direct charge. This word liar is not considered polite today in public speech when hurled at definite individuals. There is a rather free use of the word in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:4">1 John 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:22">1 John 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:20">1 John 4:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:10">1 John 5:10</span>. It is not hard to imagine the quick anger of these Pharisees. </p>
