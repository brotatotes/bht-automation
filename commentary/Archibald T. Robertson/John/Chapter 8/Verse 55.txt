 And ye have not known him  (κα ουκ εγνωκατε αυτον). Adversative use again of κα="and yet." Perfect active indicative of γινωσκω, the verb for experiential knowledge. This was true of the κοσμος (John 1:10; John 17:25) and of the hostile Jews (John 16:3). Jesus prays that the world may know (John 17:23) and the handful of disciples had come to know (John 17:25).But I know him  (εγω δε οιδα αυτον). Equipped by eternal fellowship to reveal the Father (John 1:1-18). This peculiar intimate knowledge Jesus had already claimed (John 7:29). Jesus used οιδα (John 8:19; John 15:21) or γινωσκω (John 17:23; John 17:25) for the knowledge of the Father. No undue distinction can be drawn here.And if I should say  (καν ειπω). Third-class condition (concession), "even if I say," with κα εαν (καν) and second aorist active subjunctive. "Suppose I say."I shall be like you a liar  (εσομα ομοιος υμιν ψευστης). Apodosis of the condition. Hομοιος (like) is followed by the associative-instrumental case υμιν. The word ψευστης (liar), in spite of the statement that they are the children of the devil, the father of lying (John 8:44), comes with a sudden jolt because it is a direct charge. This word liar is not considered polite today in public speech when hurled at definite individuals. There is a rather free use of the word in 1 John 2:4; 1 John 2:22; 1 John 4:20; 1 John 5:10. It is not hard to imagine the quick anger of these Pharisees.
