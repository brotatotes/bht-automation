<p><b> Thou art not yet fifty years old </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεντηκοντα ετ ουπω εχεις</span></span>). Literally, "Thou hast not yet fifty years." Not meaning that Jesus was near that age at all. It was the crisis of completed manhood (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+4:3">Numbers 4:3</span>) and a round number. Jesus was about thirty to thirty-three.</p>
<p><b>And hast thou seen Abraham? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κα Αβρααμ εωρακασ;</span></span>). So A C D and B W Theta have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εωρακες</span></span>, both second person singular of the perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>. But Aleph, Sin-syr., Coptic versions (accepted by Bernard) have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα Αβρααμ εωρακε σε?</span></span> "Has Abraam seen thee?" Either makes sense here. </p>
