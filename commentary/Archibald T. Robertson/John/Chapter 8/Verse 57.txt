 Thou art not yet fifty years old  (πεντηκοντα ετ ουπω εχεις). Literally, "Thou hast not yet fifty years." Not meaning that Jesus was near that age at all. It was the crisis of completed manhood (Numbers 4:3) and a round number. Jesus was about thirty to thirty-three.And hast thou seen Abraham?  (Κα Αβρααμ εωρακασ;). So A C D and B W Theta have εωρακες, both second person singular of the perfect active indicative of οραω. But Aleph, Sin-syr., Coptic versions (accepted by Bernard) have κα Αβρααμ εωρακε σε? "Has Abraam seen thee?" Either makes sense here.
