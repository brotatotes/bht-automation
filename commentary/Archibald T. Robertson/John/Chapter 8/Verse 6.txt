<p><b> Tempting him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζοντες αυτον</span></span>). Evil sense of this present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζω</span></span>, as so often (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:11">Mark 8:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:2">Mark 10:2</span>, etc.).</p>
<p><b>That they might have whereof to accuse him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα εχωσιν κατηγορειν αυτου</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>. This laying of traps for Jesus was a common practice of his enemies (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:16">Luke 11:16</span>, etc.). Note present active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηγορεω</span></span> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:10">Matthew 12:10</span> for the verb) to go on accusing (with genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span>). It was now a habit with these rabbis.</p>
<p><b>Stooped down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατω κυψας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυπτω</span></span>, old verb to bow the head, to bend forward, in N.T. only here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:8">John 8:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:7">Mark 1:7</span>. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατω</span></span> (down) gives a vivid touch to the picture.</p>
<p><b>With his finger </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω δακτυλω</span></span>). Instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δακτυλος</span></span> for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:4">Matthew 23:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>Wrote on the ground </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεγραφεν εις την γην</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταγραφω</span></span>, old compound, here only in N.T., to draw, to delineate, to write down, apparently inchoative, began to write on the sand as every one has done sometimes. The only mention of writing by Jesus and the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταγραφω</span></span> leaves it uncertain whether he was writing words or drawing pictures or making signs. If we only knew what he wrote! Certainly Jesus knew how to write. And yet more books have been written about this one who wrote nothing that is preserved than any other person or subject in human history. There is a tradition that Jesus wrote down the names and sins of these accusers. That is not likely. They were written on their hearts. Jesus alone on this occasion showed embarrassment over this woman's sin. </p>
