 When they continued asking  (ως επεμενον ερωτωντες). Imperfect active indicative of επιμενω (waiting in addition or still, επ, old verb) with supplementary active participle of ερωταω, to question.

They saw that Jesus seemed embarrassed, but did not know that it was as much because of "the brazen hardness of the prosecutors" as because of the shame of the deed.He lifted himself up  (ανεκυψεν). First aorist active indicative of ανακυπτω, the opposite of κατακυπτω, to bend down (verse John 8:8) or of κατω κυπτω (verse John 8:6).He that is without sin  (ο αναμαρτητος). Verbal adjective (αν privative and αμαρτητος from αμαρτανω), old word, either one who has not sinned as here and Deuteronomy 29:19 or one who cannot sin, not in the N.T.Among you  (υμων). Objective genitive.First cast  (πρωτος βαλετω). The nominative πρωτος means first before others, be the first to cast, not cast before he does something else. See John 20:4. The verb is second aorist imperative of βαλλω, old verb to fling or cast. Jesus thus picks out the executioner in the case.
