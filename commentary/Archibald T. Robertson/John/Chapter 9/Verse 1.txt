<p><b> As he passed by </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραγων</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραγω</span></span>, old verb to go along, by, or past (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:30">Matthew 20:30</span>). Only example in this Gospel, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:8">1 John 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:17">1 John 2:17</span>. The day was after the stirring scenes in chapter 8, but not at the feast of dedication as Westcott argues. That comes three months later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:22">John 10:22</span>).</p>
<p><b>From his birth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ γενετης</span></span>). Ablative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> of old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενω, γινομα</span></span>. Here alone in N.T., but the phrase <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυφλος εκ γενετης</span></span> is common in Greek writers. Probably a well-known character with his stand as a beggar (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:5">John 9:5</span>). </p>
