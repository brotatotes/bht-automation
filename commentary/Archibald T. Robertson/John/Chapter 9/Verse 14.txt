<p><b> Now it was the sabbath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην δε σαββατον</span></span>). Literally, "Now it was a sabbath" (no article). To the Pharisees this fact was a far more important matter than whether or how the thing was done. See Volumes I and II for discussions of the minute Sabbath regulations of the rabbis. </p>
