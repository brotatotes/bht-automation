<p><b> Because he keepeth not the sabbath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ το σαββατον ου τηρε</span></span>). This is reason (causal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>) enough. He violates our rules about the Sabbath and therefore is a Sabbath-breaker as charged when here before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:10">John 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:16">John 5:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span>). Hence he is not "from God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα θεου</span></span>). So some.</p>
<p><b>How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πως δυνατα ανθρωπος αμαρτωλος τοιαυτα σημεια ποιειν;</span></span>). This was the argument of Nicodemus, himself a Pharisee and one of the Sanhedrin, long ago (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:2">John 3:2</span>). It was a conundrum for the Pharisees. No wonder there was "a division" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχισμα</span></span>, schism, split, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχιζω</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:43">John 7:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:19">John 10:19</span>. </p>
