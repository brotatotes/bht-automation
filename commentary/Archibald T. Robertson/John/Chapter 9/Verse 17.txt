<p><b> Unto the blind man again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω τυφλω παλιν</span></span>). The doctors disagree and they ask the patient whose story they had already heard (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:15">John 9:15</span>).</p>
<p><b>In that he opened thine eyes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ηνεωιξεν σου τους οφθαλμους</span></span>). Causal use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> and triple augment in the first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιγω</span></span>.

<p><b>He is a prophet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητης εστιν</span></span>). The man will go that far anyhow. </p>
