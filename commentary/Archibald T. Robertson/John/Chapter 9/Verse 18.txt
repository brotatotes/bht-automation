<p><b> The Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Ιουδαιο</span></span>). Probably the incredulous and hostile section of the Pharisees in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:16">John 9:16</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:10">John 5:10</span>).</p>
<p><b>Did not believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ επιστευσαν</span></span>). The facts told by the man, "that he had been blind and had received his sight" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ην τυφλος κα ανεβλεψεν</span></span>), conflicted with their theological views of God and the Sabbath. So they refused belief "until they called the parents" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως οτου εφωνησαν τους γονεις</span></span>). Usual construction of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως οτου</span></span> ( = until which time, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως</span></span> alone) with aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνεω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνη</span></span> (voice, sound). They called out loud for his parents to throw light on this grave problem to cover up their own stupidity. </p>
