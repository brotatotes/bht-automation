 Because they feared the Jews  (οτ εφοβουντο τους Ιουδαιους). Imperfect middle, a continuing fear and not without reason. See already the whispers about Jesus because of fear of the Jews (John 7:13).Had agreed already  (ηδη συνετεθειντο). Past perfect middle of συντιθημ, to put together, to form a compact (John 7:32; John 7:47-49).If any man should confess him to be Christ  (εαν τις αυτον ομολογηση Χριστον). Condition of third class with εαν and first aorist active subjunctive of ομολογεω and predicate accusative Χριστον. Jesus had made confession of himself before men the test of discipleship and denial the disproof (Matthew 10:32; Luke 12:8). We know that many of the rulers nominally believed on Jesus (John 12:42) and yet "did not confess him because of the Pharisees" (αλλα δια τους Φαρισαιους ουχ ωμολογουν), for the very reason given here, "that they might not be put out of the synagogue" (ινα μη αποσυναγωγο γενωντα). Small wonder then that here the parents cowered a bit.That he should be put out of the synagogue  (ινα αποσυναγωγος γενητα). Sub-final use of ινα with second aorist middle subjunctive of γινομα. Αποσυναγωγος (απο and συναγωγη) is found in N.T. only here and John 12:42; John 16:2. A purely Jewish word naturally. There were three kinds of excommunication (for thirty days, for thirty more, indefinitely).
