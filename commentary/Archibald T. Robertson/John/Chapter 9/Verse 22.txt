<p><b> Because they feared the Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ εφοβουντο τους Ιουδαιους</span></span>). Imperfect middle, a continuing fear and not without reason. See already the whispers about Jesus because of fear of the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:13">John 7:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>Had agreed already </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη συνετεθειντο</span></span>). Past perfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συντιθημ</span></span>, to put together, to form a compact (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:32">John 7:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:47-49">John 7:47-49</span>).</p>
<p><b>If any man should confess him to be Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν τις αυτον ομολογηση Χριστον</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογεω</span></span> and predicate accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστον</span></span>. Jesus had made confession of himself before men the test of discipleship and denial the disproof (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:32">Matthew 10:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:8">Luke 12:8</span>). We know that many of the rulers nominally believed on Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:42">John 12:42</span>) and yet "did not confess him because of the Pharisees" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα δια τους Φαρισαιους ουχ ωμολογουν</span></span>), for the very reason given here, "that they might not be put out of the synagogue" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη αποσυναγωγο γενωντα</span></span>). Small wonder then that here the parents cowered a bit.</p>
<p><b>That he should be put out of the synagogue </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα αποσυναγωγος γενητα</span></span>). Sub-final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> with second aorist middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αποσυναγωγος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγωγη</span></span>) is found in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:42">John 12:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:2">John 16:2</span>. A purely Jewish word naturally. There were three kinds of excommunication (for thirty days, for thirty more, indefinitely). </p>
