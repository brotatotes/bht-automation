<p><b> A second time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ δευτερου</span></span>). He had given the Pharisees the facts the first time (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:15">John 9:15</span>). It was really the third time (see <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:17">John 9:17</span>). Now it was like a joke unless the Pharisees meant to imply that his previous story was untrue.</p>
<p><b>Give glory to God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δος δοξαν τω θεω</span></span>). Second aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span> (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχεσ, ες</span></span>). This phrase does not mean gratitude to God as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:18">Luke 17:18</span>. It is rather an adjuration to speak the truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jos+7:19">Joshua 7:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+6:5">1 Samuel 6:5</span>) as if he had not done it before. Augustine says: "<i>Quid est Da gloriam Deo? Nega quod accepisti.</i>" Is a sinner (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτωλος εστιν</span></span>). They can no longer deny the fact of the cure since the testimony of the parents (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:19">John 9:19</span>) and now wish the man to admit that he was lying in saying that Jesus healed him. He must accept their ecclesiastical authority as proving that Jesus had nothing to do with the cure since Jesus is a sinner. They wish to decide the fact by logic and authority like all persecutors through the ages. Recall the Pharisaic distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιος</span></span> (righteous) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτωλος</span></span> (sinner). </p>
