 A second time  (εκ δευτερου). He had given the Pharisees the facts the first time (John 9:15). It was really the third time (see παλιν in John 9:17). Now it was like a joke unless the Pharisees meant to imply that his previous story was untrue.Give glory to God  (δος δοξαν τω θεω). Second aorist active imperative of διδωμ (cf. σχεσ, ες). This phrase does not mean gratitude to God as in Luke 17:18. It is rather an adjuration to speak the truth (Joshua 7:19; 1 Samuel 6:5) as if he had not done it before. Augustine says: "Quid est Da gloriam Deo? Nega quod accepisti." Is a sinner (αμαρτωλος εστιν). They can no longer deny the fact of the cure since the testimony of the parents (John 9:19) and now wish the man to admit that he was lying in saying that Jesus healed him. He must accept their ecclesiastical authority as proving that Jesus had nothing to do with the cure since Jesus is a sinner. They wish to decide the fact by logic and authority like all persecutors through the ages. Recall the Pharisaic distinction between δικαιος (righteous) and αμαρτωλος (sinner).
