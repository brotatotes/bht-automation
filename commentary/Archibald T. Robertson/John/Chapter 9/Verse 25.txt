 One thing I know  (εν οιδα). This man is keen and quick and refuses to fall into the trap set for him. He passes by their quibbling about Jesus being a "sinner" (αμαρτωλος) and clings to the one fact of his own experience.Whereas I was blind, now I see  (τυφλος ων αρτ βλεπω). Literally, "Being blind I now see." The present active participle ων of ειμ by implication in contrast with αρτ (just now, at this moment) points to previous and so past time. It must be borne in mind that the man did not at this stage know who Jesus was and so had not yet taken him as Saviour (John 9:36-38).
