<p><b> One thing I know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν οιδα</span></span>). This man is keen and quick and refuses to fall into the trap set for him. He passes by their quibbling about Jesus being a "sinner" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτωλος</span></span>) and clings to the one fact of his own experience.</p>
<p><b>Whereas I was blind, now I see </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυφλος ων αρτ βλεπω</span></span>). Literally, "Being blind I now see." The present active participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span> of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span> by implication in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτ</span></span> (just now, at this moment) points to previous and so past time. It must be borne in mind that the man did not at this stage know who Jesus was and so had not yet taken him as Saviour (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:36-38">John 9:36-38</span>). </p>
