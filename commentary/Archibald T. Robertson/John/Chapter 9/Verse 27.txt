<p><b> I told you even now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον υμιν ηδη</span></span>). In verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:15">John 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:17">John 9:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:25">John 9:25</span>.</p>
<p><b>Would ye also become his disciples? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη κα υμεις θελετε αυτου μαθητα γενεσθαι;</span></span>). Negative answer formally expected, but the keenest irony in this gibe. Clearly the healed man knew from the use of "also" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>) that Jesus had some "disciples" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαθητα</span></span>, predicate nominative with the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσθα</span></span>) and that the Pharisees knew that fact. "Do ye also (like the Galilean mob) wish, etc." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:45-52">John 7:45-52</span>. It cut to the bone. </p>
