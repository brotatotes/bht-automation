<p><b> They reviled him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελοιδορησαν αυτον</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λοιδορεω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λοιδορος</span></span> (reviler, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:11">1 Corinthians 5:11</span>), in N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:4">Acts 23:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:12">1 Corinthians 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:23">1 Peter 2:23</span>.</p>
<p><b>Thou art his disciple </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ μαθητης ε εκεινου</span></span>). Probably a fling in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινου</span></span> (of that fellow). He had called him a prophet (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:17">John 9:17</span>) and became a joyful follower later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:36-38">John 9:36-38</span>).</p>
<p><b>But we are disciples of Moses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις δε του Μωυσεως εσμεν μαθητα</span></span>). This they said with proud scorn of the healed beggar. All orthodox rabbis so claimed. </p>
