<p><b> We know that God hath spoken unto Moses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις οιδαμεν οτ Μωυσε λελαληκεν ο θεος</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span>, so still on record. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:11">Exodus 33:11</span>. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span> used of God speaking see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1">Hebrews 1:1</span>. They are proud to be disciples of Moses.</p>
<p><b>But as for this man, we do not know whence he is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτον δε ουκ οιδαμεν ποθεν εστιν</span></span>). "This fellow" they mean by "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτον</span></span>" in emphatic position, we do not even know whence he is. Some of the people did (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:27">John 7:27</span>), but in the higher sense none of the Jews knew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:14">John 8:14</span>). These Pharisees neither knew nor cared. </p>
