<p><b> But that the works of God should be made manifest in him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ινα φανερωθη τα εργα του θεου εν αυτω</span></span>). Jesus denies both alternatives, and puts God's purpose (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ινα</span></span> with first aorist subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανεροω</span></span>) as the true solution. It is sometimes true that disease is the result of personal sin as in the man in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:14">John 5:14</span> and parents can hand on the effects of sin to the third and fourth generations, but there are cases free from blame like this. There is comfort for many sufferers in the words of Jesus here. </p>
