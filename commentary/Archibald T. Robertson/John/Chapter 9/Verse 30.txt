<p><b> Why, herein is the marvel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τουτω γαρ το θαυμαστον εστιν</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γε + αρα</span></span>, accordingly indeed) to bring out an affirmation from the previous words is common enough. "Why in this very point is the wonder" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαυμαστον</span></span>, old verbal adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαυμαζω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>). The man is angry now and quick in his insight and reply. You confess your ignorance of whence he is, ye who know everything, "and yet (adversative use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> again) he opened my eyes" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ηνοιξεν μου τους οφθαλμους</span></span>). That stubborn fact stands. </p>
