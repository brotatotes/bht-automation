 God does not hear sinners  (ο θεος αμαρτωλων ουκ ακουε). Note genitive case with ακουε. This was the argument of the Pharisees in John 9:16. It is frequent in the O.T.

Condition of third class with εαν and present active subjunctive η. Θεοσεβης (θεος, God, σεβομα, to worship) is an old compound adjective, here alone in the N.T.And do his will  (κα το θελημα αυτου ποιε). Same condition with present active subjunctive of ποιεω, "keep on doing his will."
