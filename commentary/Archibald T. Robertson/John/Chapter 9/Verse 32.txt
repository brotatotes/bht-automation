<p><b> Since the world began </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του αιωνος</span></span>). Literally, "from the age," "from of old." Elsewhere in the N.T. we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο του αιωνος</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ 'αιωνος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:70">Luke 1:70</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:31">Acts 3:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:18">Acts 15:18</span>) as is common in the LXX.</p>
<p><b>Of a man born blind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυφλου γεγεννημενου</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενναω</span></span>. This is the chief point and the man will not let it be overlooked, almost rubs it in, in fact. It was congenital blindness. </p>
