<p><b> If this man were not from God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη ην ουτος παρα θεου</span></span>). Negative condition of second class with imperfect indicative. Assuming that Jesus is not "from God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα θεου</span></span>) as some argued in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:16">John 9:16</span>, "he could do nothing" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ηδυνατο ποιειν ουδεν</span></span>). Conclusion of the second-class condition with imperfect indicative (double augment in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδυνατο</span></span>) without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> as is usual in conditions of possibility, propriety, obligation (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 920,1014). The man has scored with terrific power in his use of Scripture and logic. </p>
