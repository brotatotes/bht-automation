 Thou wast altogether born in sin  (εν αμαρτιαις συ εγεννηθης ολος). First aorist passive indicative of γενναω. "In sins thou wast begotten (or born) all of thee." Hολος is predicate nominative and teaches total depravity in this case beyond controversy, the Pharisees being judges.And dost thou teach us?  (κα συ διδασκεις ημασ;). The audacity of it all. Note emphasis on συ (thou). It was insufferable. He had not only taught the rabbis, but had utterly routed them in argument.And they cast him out  (κα εξεβαλον αυτον εξω). Effective second aorist active indicative of εκβαλλω intensified by the addition of εξω. Probably not yet expulsion from the synagogue (John 9:22) which required a formal meeting of the Sanhedrin, but certainly forcible driving of the gifted upstart from their presence. See John 6:37 for another use of εκβαλλω εξω besides John 9:35.
