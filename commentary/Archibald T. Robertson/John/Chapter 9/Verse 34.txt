<p><b> Thou wast altogether born in sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αμαρτιαις συ εγεννηθης ολος</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενναω</span></span>. "In sins thou wast begotten (or born) all of thee." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hολος</span></span> is predicate nominative and teaches total depravity in this case beyond controversy, the Pharisees being judges.</p>
<p><b>And dost thou teach us? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα συ διδασκεις ημασ;</span></span>). The audacity of it all. Note emphasis on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ</span></span> (thou). It was insufferable. He had not only taught the rabbis, but had utterly routed them in argument.</p>
<p><b>And they cast him out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εξεβαλον αυτον εξω</span></span>). Effective second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλλω</span></span> intensified by the addition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξω</span></span>. Probably not yet expulsion from the synagogue (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:22">John 9:22</span>) which required a formal meeting of the Sanhedrin, but certainly forcible driving of the gifted upstart from their presence. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:37">John 6:37</span> for another use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλλω εξω</span></span> besides <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:35">John 9:35</span>. </p>
