 Finding him  (ευρων αυτον). Second aorist active participle of ευρισκω, after search because of what he had heard (ηκουσεν).Dost thou believe on the Son of God?  (Συ πιστευεις εις τον υιον του θεου;). So A L Theta and most versions, but Aleph B D W Syr-sin read του ανθρωπου (the Son of Man), almost certainly correct. In either case it is a distinct Messianic claim quite beyond the range of this man's limited knowledge, keen as he is.
