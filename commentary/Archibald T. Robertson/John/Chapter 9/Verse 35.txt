<p><b> Finding him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρων αυτον</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκω</span></span>, after search because of what he had heard (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσεν</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Dost thou believe on the Son of God? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συ πιστευεις εις τον υιον του θεου;</span></span>). So A L Theta and most versions, but Aleph B D W Syr-sin read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ανθρωπου</span></span> (the Son of Man), almost certainly correct. In either case it is a distinct Messianic claim quite beyond the range of this man's limited knowledge, keen as he is. </p>
