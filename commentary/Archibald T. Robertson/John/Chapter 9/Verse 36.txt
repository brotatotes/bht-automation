<p><b> And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κα τις εστιν, κυριε;</span></span>). The initial <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> (and) is common (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:26">Mark 10:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:29">Luke 10:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:26">Luke 18:26</span>). Probably by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριε</span></span> he means only "Sir." It usually comes at the beginning of the sentence, not at the end as here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:38">John 9:38</span>.</p>
<p><b>That I may believe on him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα πιστευσω εις αυτον</span></span>). Ellipsis to be supplied before this final clause. He catches up the words of Jesus in the preceding verse, though he does not yet know who the Son of Man (or Son of God) is, but he trusts Jesus. </p>
