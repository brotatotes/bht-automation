<p><b> Lord, I believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πιστευω, κυριε</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριε</span></span> here = Lord (reverence, no longer respect as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:36">John 9:36</span>). A short creed, but to the point.</p>
<p><b>And he worshipped him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα προσεκυνησεν αυτω</span></span>). Ingressive first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνεω</span></span>, old verb to fall down in reverence, to worship. Sometimes of men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:26">Matthew 18:26</span>). In John (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:20">John 4:20</span>) this verb "is always used to express divine worship" (Bernard). It is tragic to hear men today deny that Jesus should be worshipped. He accepted worship from this new convert as he later did from Thomas who called him "God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:28">John 20:28</span>). Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:25">Acts 10:25</span>) refused worship from Cornelius as Paul and Barnabas did at Lystra (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:18">Acts 14:18</span>), but Jesus made no protest here. </p>
