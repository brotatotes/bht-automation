<p><b> For judgement </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις κριμα</span></span>). The Father had sent the Son for this purpose (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:17">John 3:17</span>). This world (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοσμος</span></span>) is not the home of Jesus. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριμα</span></span> (judgement), a word nowhere else in John, is the result of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρισις</span></span> (sifting) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>, to separate. The Father has turned over this process of sifting (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρισις</span></span>) to the Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22">John 5:22</span>). He is engaged in that very work by this miracle.</p>
<p><b>They which see not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μη βλεποντες</span></span>). The spiritually blind as well as the physically blind (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:18">Luke 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:18">Isaiah 42:18</span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and present active subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπωσιν</span></span> (may keep on seeing). This man now sees physically and spiritually.</p>
<p><b>And that they which see may become blind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο βλεποντες τυφλο γενωντα</span></span>). Another part of God's purpose, seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span>, is the curse on those who blaspheme and reject the Son. Note ingressive aorist middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span> and predicate nominative. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hο βλεποντες</span></span> are those who profess to see like these Pharisees, but are really blind. Blind guides they were (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:16">Matthew 23:16</span>). Complacent satisfaction with their dim light. </p>
