<p><b> We must work the works of him that sent me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημας δε εργαζεσθα τα εργα του πεμψαντος με</span></span>). This is undoubtedly the correct text (supported by the Neutral and Western classes) and not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμε</span></span> (I) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span> (me) of the Syrian class nor <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημας</span></span> (we) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημας</span></span> (us) of the Alexandrian class. Jesus associates us with him in the task committed to him by the Father. Bernard argues vigorously, but vainly, for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμε</span></span> me. We are not able to fathom the depth of the necessity (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>) here involved in each life as in this poor blind man and in each of us.</p>
<p><b>While it is day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως ημερα εστιν</span></span>). This clause gives the note of urgency upon us all.</p>
<p><b>The night cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχετα νυξ</span></span>). "Night is coming on," and rapidly. Night was coming for Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:33">John 7:33</span>) and for each of us. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:9">John 11:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:35">John 12:35</span>. Even electric lights do not turn night into day. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hεως</span></span> with the present indicative (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:22">John 21:22</span>) means "while," not until as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:38">John 13:38</span>. </p>
