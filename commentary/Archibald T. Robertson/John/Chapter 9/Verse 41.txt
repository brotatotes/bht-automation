<p><b> If ye were blind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τυφλο ητε</span></span>). Condition of second class with imperfect indicative in the protasis. The old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυφλος</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυφω</span></span>, to raise a smoke, to blind by smoke (literally and metaphorically). Here, of course, it is moral blindness. If the Pharisees were born morally blind, they would, like idiots, be without responsibility.</p>
<p><b>Ye would not have sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ αν ειχετε αμαρτιαν</span></span>). Regular form for conclusion of second-class condition, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> with imperfect.</p>
<p><b>But now ye say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν δε λεγετε</span></span>). In contrast to the previous condition. See like contrast in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:22">John 15:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:24">John 15:24</span>. They arrogantly asserted superior knowledge.</p>
<p><b>We see </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπομεν</span></span>). The ignorant mob do not (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:49">John 7:49</span>). It is sin against light and is hopeless (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:29">Mark 3:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:31">Matthew 12:31</span>). "Ye are witnesses against yourselves" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαρτυρειτε εαυτοις</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:31">Matthew 23:31</span>). </p>
