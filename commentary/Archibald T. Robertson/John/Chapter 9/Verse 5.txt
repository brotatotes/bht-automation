<p><b> When I am in the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν εν τω κοσμω ω</span></span>). Indefinite relative clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> and present active subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω</span></span>, "whenever I am in the world." The Latin Vulgate renders here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> by <i>quamdiu</i> so long as or while as if it were <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως</span></span>. But clearly Jesus here refers to the historic Incarnation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:11">John 17:11</span>) and to any previous visitations in the time of the patriarchs, prophets, etc. Jesus as God's Son is always the Light of the World (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:10">John 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>), but here the reference is limited to his manifestation "in the world."</p>
<p><b>I am the light of the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φως ειμ του κοσμου</span></span>). The absence of the definite article (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το φως</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>) is to be noted (Westcott). Literally, "I am light to the world, whenever I am in the world." "The display of the character varies with the occasion" (Westcott). </p>
