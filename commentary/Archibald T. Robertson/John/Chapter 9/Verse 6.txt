 He spat on the ground  (επτυσεν χαμα). First aorist active indicative of the old verb πτυω for which see Mark 7:33. Χαμα is an old adverb either in the dative or locative (sense suits locative), in N.T. only here and John 18:6. Jesus was not asked to cure this man. The curative effects of saliva are held in many places. The Jews held saliva efficacious for eye-trouble, but it was forbidden on the Sabbath. "That Jesus supposed some virtue lay in the application of the clay is contradicted by the fact that in other cases of blindness He did not use it" (Dods). Cf. Mark 8:23. Why he here accommodated himself to current belief we do not know unless it was to encourage the man to believe.He made clay  (εποιησεν πηλον). Only use of πηλος, old word for clay, in N.T. in this chapter and Romans 9:21. The kneading of the clay and spittle added another offence against the Sabbath rules of the rabbis.Anointed his eyes with the clay  (επεχρισεν αυτου τον πηλον επ τους οφθαλμους). First aorist active indicative of επιχριω, old verb, to spread on, anoint, here only and verse John 9:11 in N.T. "He spread the clay upon his eyes." B C read επεθηκεν (first aorist active indicative of επιτιθημ, to put on).
