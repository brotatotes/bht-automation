Adverbial accusative, "the former time," formerly.That he was a beggar  (οτ προσαιτης ην). See John 4:19; John 12:19 for declarative οτ after θεωρεω. But it is entirely possible that οτ here is "because" (Westcott). Προσαιτης is a late word for beggar, in N.T. only here and Mark 10:46. It is from προσαιτεω, to ask in addition (see προσαιτων below), a thing that beggars know how to do.Is not this he that sat and begged?  (Ουχ ουτος εστιν ο καθημενος κα προσαιτων;). He had his regular place and was a familiar figure. But now his eyes are wide open.
