<p><b> Neighbours </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γειτονες</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γη</span></span> (land), of the same land, old word. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:2">Luke 14:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>Saw him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεωρουντες</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεωρεω</span></span>, who used to observe him.</p>
<p><b>Aforetime </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το προτερον</span></span>). Adverbial accusative, "the former time," formerly.</p>
<p><b>That he was a beggar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ προσαιτης ην</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:19">John 4:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:19">John 12:19</span> for declarative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεωρεω</span></span>. But it is entirely possible that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> here is "because" (Westcott). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προσαιτης</span></span> is a late word for beggar, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:46">Mark 10:46</span>. It is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσαιτεω</span></span>, to ask in addition (see <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσαιτων</span></span> below), a thing that beggars know how to do.</p>
<p><b>Is not this he that sat and begged? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ουχ ουτος εστιν ο καθημενος κα προσαιτων;</span></span>). He had his regular place and was a familiar figure. But now his eyes are wide open. </p>
