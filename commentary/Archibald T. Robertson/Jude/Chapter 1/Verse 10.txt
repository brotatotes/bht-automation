 Whatsoever things they know not  (οσα ουκ οιδασιν). Here 2 Peter 2:12 has εν οις αγνοουσιν. The rest of the sentence is smoother than 2 Peter 2:12.Naturally  (φυσικως). Here only in N.T. 2 Peter 2:12 has γεγεννημενα φυσικα. Jude has the article τα with αλογα ζωα and the present passive φθειροντα instead of the future passive φθαρησοντα.
