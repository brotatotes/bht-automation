<p><b> Remember ye </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις μνησθητε</span></span>). First aorist passive (deponent) imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμνησκω</span></span> with genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρηματων</span></span> (words). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:2">2 Peter 3:2</span> we have the indirect form (infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μνησθηνα</span></span>). The rest as in II Peter, but in simpler and more exact structure and with the absence of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των αγιων προφητων</span></span> (the holy prophets). </p>
