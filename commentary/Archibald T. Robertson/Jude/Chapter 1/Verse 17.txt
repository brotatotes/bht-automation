 Remember ye  (υμεις μνησθητε). First aorist passive (deponent) imperative of μιμνησκω with genitive ρηματων (words). In 2 Peter 3:2 we have the indirect form (infinitive μνησθηνα). The rest as in II Peter, but in simpler and more exact structure and with the absence of των αγιων προφητων (the holy prophets).
