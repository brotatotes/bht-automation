 From stumbling  (απταιστους). Verbal from πταιω, to stumble (James 3:2; 2 Peter 1:10), sure-footed as of a horse that does not stumble (Xenophon), and so of a good man (Epictetus, Marcus Antoninus).Before the presence of his glory  (κατενωπιον της δοξης αυτου). Late compound preposition (κατα, εν, ωπς), right down before the eye of his glory as in Ephesians 1:4. Cf. Matthew 25:31-33; Colossians 1:22, where Paul has παραστησα like στησα here (first aorist active infinitive) and also αμωμους as here, but αμωμητος in 2 Peter 3:14.In exceeding joy  (εν αγαλλιασε). See Luke 1:14.
