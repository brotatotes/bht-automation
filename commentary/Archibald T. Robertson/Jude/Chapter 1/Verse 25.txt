 To the only God our Saviour  (μονω θεω σωτηρ ημων). Dative in the noble doxology. See Romans 16:27, μονω σοφω θεω (to the alone wise God), where also we have δια Ιησου Χριστου, but without του κυριου ημων (our Lord) as here. Σωτηρ is used of God eight times in the N.T., six of them in the Pastoral Epistles. Δοξα (glory) to God or Christ in all the doxologies except 1 Timothy 6:16. Μεγαλοσυνη (Majesty) is a late LXX word, in N.T. only here and Hebrews 1:3; Hebrews 8:1.Before all time  (προ παντος του αιωνος). Eternity behind us. See same idea in 1 Corinthians 2:7 προ των αιωνων.Now  (νυν). The present.For ever more  (εις παντας τους αιωνας). "Unto all the ages." All the future. As complete a statement of eternity as can be made in human language.
