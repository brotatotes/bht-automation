<p><b> Appeared </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative. It is the form used by Paul of the resurrection appearances of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:5-8">1 Corinthians 15:5-8</span>). There is no use in trying to explain away the reality of the angel. We must choose between admitting an objective appearance and a myth (Plummer). </p>
