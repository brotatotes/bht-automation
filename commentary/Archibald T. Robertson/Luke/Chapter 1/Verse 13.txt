<p><b> Is heard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισηκουσθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative. A sort of timeless aorist, "was heard" when made, and so "is heard" now. Probably the prayer was for a son in spite of the great age of Elisabeth, though the Messianic redemption is possible also.</p>
<p><b>John </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιωανην</span></span>). The word means that God is gracious. The mention of the name should have helped Zacharias to believe. The message of the angel (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:13-17">Luke 1:13-17</span>) takes on a metrical form when turned into Hebrew (Ragg) and it is a prose poem in Greek and English like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:30-33">Luke 1:30-33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:35-37">Luke 1:35-37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:42-45">Luke 1:42-45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:46-55">Luke 1:46-55</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:68-70">Luke 1:68-70</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:10-12">Luke 2:10-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:14">Luke 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:29-32">Luke 2:29-32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34-35">Luke 2:34-35</span>. Certainly Luke has preserved the earliest Christian hymns in their oldest sources. He is the first critic of the sources of the Gospels and a scholarly one. </p>
