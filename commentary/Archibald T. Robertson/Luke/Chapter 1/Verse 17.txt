<p><b> Before his face </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωπιον αυτου</span></span>). Not in the ancient Greek, but common in the papyri as in LXX and N.T. It is a vernacular <i>Koine</i> word, adverb used as preposition from adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωπιος</span></span>, and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εν ωπ ων</span></span> (the one who is in sight).</p>
<p><b>Autou </b> here seems to be "the Lord their God" in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:16">Luke 1:16</span> since the Messiah has not yet been mentioned, though he was to be actually the Forerunner of the Messiah.</p>
<p><b>In the spirit and power of Elijah </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πνευματ κα δυναμε Ελεια</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:1-11">Isaiah 40:1-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:1-5">Malachi 3:1-5</span>. John will deny that he is actually Elijah in person, as they expected (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:21">John 1:21</span>), but Jesus will call him Elijah in spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:12">Mark 9:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:12">Matthew 17:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>Hearts of fathers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρδιας πατερων</span></span>). Paternal love had died out. This is one of the first results of conversion, the revival of love in the home.</p>
<p><b>Wisdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρονησε</span></span>). Not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφια</span></span>, but a word for practical intelligence.</p>
<p><b>Prepared </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεσκευασμενον</span></span>). Perfect passive participle, state of readiness for Christ. This John did. This is a marvellous forecast of the character and career of John the Baptist, one that should have caught the faith of Zacharias. </p>
