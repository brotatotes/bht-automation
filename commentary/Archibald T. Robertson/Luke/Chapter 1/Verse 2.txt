<p><b> Even as </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως</span></span>). This particle was condemned by the Atticists though occurring occasionally from Aristotle on. It is in the papyri. Luke asserts that the previous narratives had their sound basis.</p>
<p><b>Delivered unto us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδωσαν ημιν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδωμ</span></span>. Luke received this tradition along with those who are mentioned above (the many). That is he was not one of the "eyewitnesses." He was a secondary, not a primary, witness of the events. Tradition has come to have a meaning of unreliability with us, but that is not the idea here. Luke means to say that the handing down was dependable, not mere wives' fables. Those who drew up the narratives had as sources of knowledge those who handed down the data. Here we have both written and oral sources. Luke had access to both kinds.</p>
<p><b>Which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο απ' αρχης αυτοπτα κα υπηρετα γενομενο του λογου</span></span>). "Who" is better than "which" for the article here. The word for</p>
<p><b>eyewitnesses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοπτα</span></span>) is an old Greek word and appears in the papyri also. It means seeing with one's own eyes. It occurs here only in the N.T. We have the very word in the medical term <i>autopsy</i>. Greek medical writers often had the word. It is a different word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποπτα</span></span> (eyewitness) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16">2 Peter 1:16</span>, a word used of those who beheld heavenly mysteries. The word for "ministers" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπηρετα</span></span>), under rowers or servants we have had already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:25">Matthew 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:58">Matthew 26:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:54">Mark 14:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:65">Mark 14:65</span>, which see. We shall see it again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:20">Luke 4:20</span> of the attendant in the synagogue. In the sense of a preacher of the gospel as here, it occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:16">Acts 26:16</span>. Here "the word" means the gospel message, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:4">Acts 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:4">Acts 8:4</span>, etc.</p>
<p><b>From the beginning </b> apparently refers to the beginning of the ministry of Jesus as was true of the apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span>) and of the early apostolic preaching (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:37-43">Acts 10:37-43</span>). The Gospel of Mark follows this plan. The Gospel of Luke goes behind this in chapters 1 and 2 as does Matthew in chapters 1 and 2. But Luke is not here referring to himself. The matters about the childhood of Jesus Christ would not form part of the traditional preaching for obvious reasons. </p>
