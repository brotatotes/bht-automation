 Ministration  (λειτουργιας). Our word liturgy. A common word in ancient Greek for public service, work for the people (λεως εργον). It is common in the papyri for the service of the Egyptian priesthood as we see it in the LXX of Hebrew priests (see also Hebrews 8:6; Hebrews 9:21; 2 Corinthians 9:12; Philippians 2:17; Philippians 2:30).
