<p><b> Favour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριν</span></span>). Grace. Same root as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρω</span></span> (rejoice) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριτοω</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:28">Luke 1:28</span>. To find favour is a common O.T. phrase. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χαρις</span></span> is a very ancient and common word with a variety of applied meanings. They all come from the notion of sweetness, charm, loveliness, joy, delight, like words of grace, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:22">Luke 4:22</span>, growing grace, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:29">Ephesians 4:29</span>, with grace, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:6">Colossians 4:6</span>. The notion of kindness is in it also, especially of God towards men as here. It is a favourite word for Christianity, the Gospel of the grace of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span>) in contrast with law or works (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span>). Gratitude is expressed also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:32">Luke 6:32</span>), especially to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:17">Romans 6:17</span>).</p>
