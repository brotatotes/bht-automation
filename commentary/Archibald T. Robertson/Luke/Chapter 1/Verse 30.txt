 Favour  (χαριν). Grace. Same root as χαιρω (rejoice) and χαριτοω in verse Luke 1:28. To find favour is a common O.T. phrase. Χαρις is a very ancient and common word with a variety of applied meanings. They all come from the notion of sweetness, charm, loveliness, joy, delight, like words of grace, Luke 4:22, growing grace, Ephesians 4:29, with grace, Colossians 4:6. The notion of kindness is in it also, especially of God towards men as here. It is a favourite word for Christianity, the Gospel of the grace of God (Acts 20:24) in contrast with law or works (John 1:16). Gratitude is expressed also (Luke 6:32), especially to God (Romans 6:17).With God  (παρα τω θεω). Beside God.
