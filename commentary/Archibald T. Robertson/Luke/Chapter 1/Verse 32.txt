<p><b> The Son of the Most High </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος Hυψιστου</span></span>). There is no article in the Greek, but the use of Most High in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:35">Luke 1:35</span> clearly of God as here. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:35">Luke 6:35</span> we find "sons of the Most High" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιο Hυψιστου</span></span>) so that we cannot insist on deity here, though that is possible. The language of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:14">2 Samuel 7:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:7">Isaiah 9:7</span> is combined here. </p>
