 The Son of the Most High  (υιος Hυψιστου). There is no article in the Greek, but the use of Most High in verse Luke 1:35 clearly of God as here. In Luke 6:35 we find "sons of the Most High" (υιο Hυψιστου) so that we cannot insist on deity here, though that is possible. The language of 2 Samuel 7:14; Isaiah 9:7 is combined here.
