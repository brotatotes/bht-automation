<p><b> Shall overshadow thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισκιασε</span></span>). A figure of a cloud coming upon her. Common in ancient Greek in the sense of obscuring and with accusative as of Peter's shadow in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:15">Acts 5:15</span>. But we have seen it used of the shining bright cloud at the Transfiguration of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:5">Matthew 17:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:7">Mark 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:34">Luke 9:34</span>). Here it is like the Shekinah glory which suggests it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+40:38">Exodus 40:38</span>) where the cloud of glory represents the presence and power of God.</p>
<p><b>Holy, the Son of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hαγιον υιος θεου</span></span>). Here again the absence of the article makes it possible for it to mean "Son of God." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:9">Matthew 5:9</span>. But this title, like the Son of Man (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hο υιος του ανθρωπου</span></span>) was a recognized designation of the Messiah. Jesus did not often call himself Son of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:43">Matthew 27:43</span>), but it is assumed in his frequent use of the Father, the Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span>). It is the title used by the Father at the baptism (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:22">Luke 3:22</span>) and on the Mount of Transfiguration (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:35">Luke 9:35</span>). The wonder of Mary would increase at these words. The Miraculous Conception or Virgin Birth of Jesus is thus plainly set forth in Luke as in Matthew. The fact that Luke was a physician gives added interest to his report. </p>
