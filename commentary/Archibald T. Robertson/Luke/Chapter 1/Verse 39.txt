<p><b> Arose </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστασα</span></span>). Luke is very fond of this word, sixty times against twenty-two in the rest of the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Into the hill country </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την ορινην</span></span>). Luke uses this adjective twice in this context (here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:65">Luke 1:65</span>) instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ορος</span></span>, the mountains. It is an old word and is in the LXX, but nowhere else in the N.T. The name of the city where Zacharias lived is not given unless Judah here means Juttah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jos+15:55">Joshua 15:55</span>). Hebron was the chief city of this part of Judea. </p>
