 Arose  (αναστασα). Luke is very fond of this word, sixty times against twenty-two in the rest of the N.T.Into the hill country  (εις την ορινην). Luke uses this adjective twice in this context (here and Luke 1:65) instead of το ορος, the mountains. It is an old word and is in the LXX, but nowhere else in the N.T. The name of the city where Zacharias lived is not given unless Judah here means Juttah (Joshua 15:55). Hebron was the chief city of this part of Judea.
