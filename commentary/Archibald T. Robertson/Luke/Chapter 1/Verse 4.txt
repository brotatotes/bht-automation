<p><b> Mightest know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγνωις</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγινωσκω</span></span>. Full knowledge (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>-), in addition to what he already has.</p>
<p><b>The certainty </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ασφαλειαν</span></span>). Make no slip (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφαλλω</span></span>, to totter or fall, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative). Luke promises a reliable narrative. "Theophilus shall know that the faith which he has embraced has an impregnable historical foundation" (Plummer).</p>
<p><b>The things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογων</span></span>). Literally "words," the details of the words in the instruction.</p>
<p><b>Wast instructed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηχηθης</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative. Not in O.T. and rare in ancient Greek. Occurs in the papyri. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηχεω</span></span> is our word echo (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:8">1 Thessalonians 1:8</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηχητα</span></span>, has sounded forth). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κατηχεω</span></span> is to sound down, to din, to instruct, to give oral instruction. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:9">1 Corinthians 14:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:21">Acts 21:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:24">Acts 21:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:25">Acts 18:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:6">Galatians 6:6</span>. Those men doing the teaching were called <i>catechists</i> and those receiving it were called <i>catechumens</i>. Whether Theophilus was still a catechumen is not known. This Preface by Luke is in splendid literary <i>Koine</i> and is not surpassed by those in any Greek writer (Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius). It is entirely possible that Luke was familiar with this habit of Greek historians to write prefaces since he was a man of culture. </p>
