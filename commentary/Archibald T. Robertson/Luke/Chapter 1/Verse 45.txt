<p><b> For </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). It is not certain whether <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> here is "that" or "because." It makes good sense either way. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:16">Luke 7:16</span>. This is the first beatitude in the New Testament and it is similar to the last one in the Gospels spoken to Thomas to discourage his doubt (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:29">John 20:29</span>). Elisabeth wishes Mary to have full faith in the prophecy of the angel. This song of Elisabeth is as real poetry as is that of Mary (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:47-55">Luke 1:47-55</span>) and Zacharias (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:68-70">Luke 1:68-70</span>). All three spoke under the power of the Holy Spirit. These are the first New Testament hymns and they are very beautiful. Plummer notes four strophes in Mary's Magnificat (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:46-48">Luke 1:46-48</span>,<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:49">Luke 1:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:50">Luke 1:50</span>,<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:51-53">Luke 1:51-53</span>,<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:54">Luke 1:54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:55">Luke 1:55</span>). Every idea here occurs in the Old Testament, showing that Mary's mind was full of the spiritual message of God's word. </p>
