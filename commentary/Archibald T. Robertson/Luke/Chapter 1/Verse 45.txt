 For  (οτ). It is not certain whether οτ here is "that" or "because." It makes good sense either way. See also Luke 7:16. This is the first beatitude in the New Testament and it is similar to the last one in the Gospels spoken to Thomas to discourage his doubt (John 20:29). Elisabeth wishes Mary to have full faith in the prophecy of the angel. This song of Elisabeth is as real poetry as is that of Mary (Luke 1:47-55) and Zacharias (Luke 1:68-70). All three spoke under the power of the Holy Spirit. These are the first New Testament hymns and they are very beautiful. Plummer notes four strophes in Mary's Magnificat (Luke 1:46-48,Luke 1:49; Luke 1:50,Luke 1:51-53,Luke 1:54; Luke 1:55). Every idea here occurs in the Old Testament, showing that Mary's mind was full of the spiritual message of God's word.
