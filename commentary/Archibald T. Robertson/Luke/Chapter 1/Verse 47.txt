<p><b> Hath rejoiced </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγαλλιασεν</span></span>). This is aorist active indicative. Greek tenses do not correspond to those in English. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαλλιαω</span></span> is a Hellenistic word from the old Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαλλω</span></span>. It means to exult. See the substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαλλιασις</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:14">Luke 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:44">Luke 1:44</span>. Mary is not excited like Elisabeth, but breathes a spirit of composed rapture.</p>
<p><b>My spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πνευμα μου</span></span>). One need not press unduly the difference between "soul" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span>) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:46">Luke 1:46</span> and "spirit" here. Bruce calls them synonyms in parallel clauses. Vincent argues that the soul is the principle of individuality while the spirit is the point of contact between God and man. It is doubtful, however, if the trichotomous theory of man (body, soul, and spirit) is to be insisted on. It is certain that we have an inner spiritual nature for which various words are used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:30">Mark 12:30</span>. Even the distinction between intellect, emotions, and will is challenged by some psychologists.</p>
<p><b>God my Saviour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω θεω τω σοτηρ μου</span></span>). Article with each substantive. God is called Saviour in the O.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+32:15">Deuteronomy 32:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+24:5">Psalms 24:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:1">Psalms 95:1</span>). </p>
