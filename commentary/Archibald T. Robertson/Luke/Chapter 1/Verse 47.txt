 Hath rejoiced  (ηγαλλιασεν). This is aorist active indicative. Greek tenses do not correspond to those in English. The verb αγαλλιαω is a Hellenistic word from the old Greek αγαλλω. It means to exult. See the substantive αγαλλιασις in Luke 1:14; Luke 1:44. Mary is not excited like Elisabeth, but breathes a spirit of composed rapture.My spirit  (το πνευμα μου). One need not press unduly the difference between "soul" (ψυχη) in verse Luke 1:46 and "spirit" here. Bruce calls them synonyms in parallel clauses. Vincent argues that the soul is the principle of individuality while the spirit is the point of contact between God and man. It is doubtful, however, if the trichotomous theory of man (body, soul, and spirit) is to be insisted on. It is certain that we have an inner spiritual nature for which various words are used in Mark 12:30. Even the distinction between intellect, emotions, and will is challenged by some psychologists.God my Saviour  (τω θεω τω σοτηρ μου). Article with each substantive. God is called Saviour in the O.T. (Deuteronomy 32:15; Psalms 24:5; Psalms 95:1).
