<p><b> The low estate </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ταπεινωσιν</span></span>). The bride of a carpenter and yet to be the mother of the Messiah. Literal sense here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:52">Luke 1:52</span>.</p>
<p><b>Shall call me blessed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακαριουσιν με</span></span>). So-called Attic future of an old verb, to felicitate. Elisabeth had already given her a beatitude (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακαρια</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:45">Luke 1:45</span>). Another occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:27">Luke 11:27</span>. But this is a very different thing from the worship of Mary (Mariolatry) by Roman Catholics.
