 Made signs  (ενενευον). Imperfect tense, repeated action as usual when making signs. In Luke 1:22 the verb used of Zacharias is διανευων.What he would have him called  (το τ αν θελο καλεισθα αυτο). Note article το with the indirect question, accusative of general reference. The optative with αν is here because it was used in the direct question (cf. Acts 17:18), and is simply retained in the indirect.What would he wish him to be called?  (if he could speak), a conclusion of the fourth-class condition.
