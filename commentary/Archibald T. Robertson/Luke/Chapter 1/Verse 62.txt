<p><b> Made signs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενενευον</span></span>). Imperfect tense, repeated action as usual when making signs. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:22">Luke 1:22</span> the verb used of Zacharias is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διανευων</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>What he would have him called </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το τ αν θελο καλεισθα αυτο</span></span>). Note article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το</span></span> with the indirect question, accusative of general reference. The optative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> is here because it was used in the direct question (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span>), and is simply retained in the indirect.</p>
<p><b>What would he wish him to be called? </b> (<b>if he could speak</b>), a conclusion of the fourth-class condition. </p>
