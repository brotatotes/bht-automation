<p><b> Immediately </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραχρημα</span></span>). Nineteen times in the N.T., seventeen in Luke.</p>
<p><b>Opened </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεωιχθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative with double augment. The verb suits "mouth," but not "tongue" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γλωσσα</span></span>). It is thus a zeugma with tongue. Loosed or some such verb to be supplied. </p>
