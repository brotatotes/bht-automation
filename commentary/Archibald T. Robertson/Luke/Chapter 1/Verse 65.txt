<p><b> Fear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβος</span></span>). Not terror, but religious awe because of contact with the supernatural as in the case of Zacharias (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:12">Luke 1:12</span>). Were noised abroad (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διελαλειτο</span></span>). Imperfect passive. Occurs in Polybius.
