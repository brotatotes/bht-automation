 Prophesied  (επροφητευσεν). Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This Benedictus (Ευλογητος,Blessed ) of Zacharias (Luke 1:68-79) may be what is referred to in verse Luke 1:64 "he began to speak blessing God" (ευλογων). Nearly every phrase here is found in the O.T. (Psalms and Prophets). He, like Mary, was full of the Holy Spirit and had caught the Messianic message in its highest meaning.
