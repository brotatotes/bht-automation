 Hath visited  (επεσκεψατο). An old Greek word with a Hebraic colouring to look into with a view to help. The papyri have plenty of examples of the verb in the sense of inspecting, examining.Redemption  (λυτρωσιν) here originally referred to political redemption, but with a moral and spiritual basis (verses Luke 1:75; Luke 1:77).
