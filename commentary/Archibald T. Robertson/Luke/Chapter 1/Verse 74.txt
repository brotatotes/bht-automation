<p><b> Delivered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυσθεντας</span></span>). First aorist passive participle of an old verb, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυομα</span></span>. The accusative case appears, where the dative could have been used to agree with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημιν</span></span>, because of the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λατρευειν</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:74">Luke 1:74</span>)</p>
<p><b>to serve </b> (from <b>latros </b>, for hire). But Plato uses the word of service for God so that the bad sense does not always exist. </p>
