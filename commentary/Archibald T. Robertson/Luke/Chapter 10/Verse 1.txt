<p><b> Appointed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεδειξεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναδεικνυμ</span></span>, an old verb, not only common, but in LXX. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:24">Acts 1:24</span>. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναδειξις</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:80">Luke 1:80</span>. To show forth, display, proclaim, appoint.</p>
<p><b>Seventy others </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερους εβδομηκοντα κα</span></span>). The "also" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>) and the "others" point back to the mission of the Twelve in Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:1-6">Luke 9:1-6</span>). Some critics think that Luke has confused this report of a mission in Judea with that in Galilee, but needlessly so. What earthly objection can there be to two similar missions? B D Syr. Cur. and Syr. Sin. have "seventy-two." The seventy elders were counted both ways and the Sanhedrin likewise and the nations of the earth. It is an evenly balanced point.</p>
<p><b>Two and two </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα δυο</span></span>). For companionship as with the Twelve though <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:7">Mark 6:7</span> has it <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυο</span></span> (vernacular idiom). B K have here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα δυο</span></span>, a combination of the idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:7">Mark 6:7</span> and that here.</p>
<p><b>He himself was about to come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημελλεν αυτος ερχεσθα</span></span>). Imperfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλω</span></span> with present infinitive and note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος</span></span>. Jesus was to follow after and investigate the work done. This was only a temporary appointment and no names are given, but they could cover a deal of territory. </p>
