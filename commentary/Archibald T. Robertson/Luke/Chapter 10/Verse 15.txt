<p><b> Shalt thou be exalted? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη υψωθησηι;</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη</span></span> expects the answer No. The verb is future passive indicative second singular of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υψοω</span></span>, to lift up, a late verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υψος</span></span>, height. It is used by Jesus of the Cross (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:32">John 12:32</span>).</p>
<p><b>Unto Hades </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως Hαιδου</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> for this word which is here in contrast to Heaven as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:13-15">Isaiah 14:13-15</span>. Hades is not Gehenna. "The desolation of the whole neighbourhood, and the difficulty of identifying even the site of these flourishing towns, is part of the fulfilment of this prophecy" (Plummer). Ragg notes the omission of Nazareth from this list of cities of neglected privilege and opportunity. "Is it the tender memories of boyhood that keep from His lips the name of the arch-rejector (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:28">Luke 4:28</span> sqq.) Nazareth?" </p>
