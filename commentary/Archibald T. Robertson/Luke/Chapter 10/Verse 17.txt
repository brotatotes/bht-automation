<p><b>Even the demons </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τα δαιμονια</span></span>). This was a real test. The Twelve had been expressly endowed with this power when they were sent out (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:1">Luke 9:1</span>), but the Seventy were only told to heal the sick (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:9">Luke 10:9</span>). It was better than they expected. The Gospel worked wonders and they were happy. The demons were merely one sign of the conflict between Christ and Satan. Every preacher has to grapple with demons in his work.</p>
<p><b>Are subject </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσετα</span></span>). Present passive indicative (repetition). </p>
