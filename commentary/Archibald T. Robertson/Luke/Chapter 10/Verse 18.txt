 I beheld Satan fallen  (εθεωρουν τον Σαταναν πεσοντα). Imperfect active (I was beholding) and second aorist (constative) active participle of πιπτω (notfallen , πεπτωκοτα, perfect active participle, norfalling , πιπτοντα, present active participle, butfall , πεσοντα). As a flash of lightning out of heaven, quick and startling, so the victory of the Seventy over the demons, the agents of Satan, forecast his downfall and Jesus in vision pictured it as a flash of lightning.
