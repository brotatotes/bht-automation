<p><b> And over all the power of the enemy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα επ πασαν την δυναμιν του εχθρου</span></span>). This is the heart of "the authority" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την εξουσιαν</span></span>) here given by Jesus which is far beyond their expectations. The victory over demons was one phase of it. The power to tread upon serpents is repeated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:18">Mark 16:18</span> (the Appendix) and exemplified in Paul's case in Malta (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:3-5">Acts 28:3-5</span>). But protection from physical harm is not the main point in this struggle with Satan "the enemy" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:25">Matthew 13:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:20">Romans 16:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:8">1 Peter 5:8</span>).</p>
<p><b>Nothing shall in any wise hurt you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν υμας ου μη αδικησε</span></span>). Text has future active indicative, while some MSS. read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικηση</span></span>, aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικεω</span></span>, common verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικος</span></span>), to suffer wrong, to do wrong. The triple negative here is very strong. Certainly Jesus does not mean this promise to create presumption or foolhardiness for he repelled the enemy's suggestion on the pinnacle of the temple. </p>
