 Harvest  (θερισμος). Late word for the older θερος, summer, harvest. The language in this verse is verbatim what we have in Matthew 9:37; Matthew 9:38 to the Twelve. Why not? The need is the same and prayer is the answer in each case. Prayer for preachers is Christ's method for increasing the supply.
