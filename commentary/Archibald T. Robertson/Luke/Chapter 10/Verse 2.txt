<p><b> Harvest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θερισμος</span></span>). Late word for the older <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θερος</span></span>, summer, harvest. The language in this verse is verbatim what we have in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:37">Matthew 9:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:38">Matthew 9:38</span> to the Twelve. Why not? The need is the same and prayer is the answer in each case. Prayer for preachers is Christ's method for increasing the supply. </p>
