<p><b> In that same hour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτη τη ωρα</span></span>). Literally, "at the hour itself," almost a demonstrative use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος</span></span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 686) and in Luke alone in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:38">Luke 2:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:12">Luke 12:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:19">Luke 20:19</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span> uses the demonstrative here, "at that time" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εκεινω τω καιρω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Rejoiced in the Holy Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγαλλιασατο τω πνευματ τω αγιω</span></span>). First aorist middle of the late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαλλιαω</span></span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαλλω</span></span>, to exult. Always in the middle in the N.T. save <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:47">Luke 1:47</span> in Mary's <i>Magnificat</i>. This holy joy of Jesus was directly due to the Holy Spirit. It is joy in the work of his followers, their victories over Satan, and is akin to the joy felt by Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:32-38">John 4:32-38</span> when the vision of the harvest of the world stirred his heart. The rest of this verse is precisely like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span>, a peculiarly Johannine passage in Matthew and Luke, but not in Mark, and so from Q (the Logia of Jesus). It has disturbed critics who are unwilling to admit the Johannine style and type of teaching as genuine, but here it is. See on Matthew for discussion. "That God had proved his independence of the human intellect is a matter for thankfulness. Intellectual gifts, so far from being necessary, are often a hindrance" (Plummer). </p>
