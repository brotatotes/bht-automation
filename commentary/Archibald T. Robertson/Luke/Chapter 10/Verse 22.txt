<p><b> Knoweth who the Son is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκε τις εστιν ο υιος</span></span>). Knows by experience, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκε</span></span>. Here <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγινωσκε</span></span> (fully knows) and simply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον υιον</span></span> (the Son) instead of the "who" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις</span></span>) clause. So also in "who the Father is" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις εστιν ο πατερ</span></span>). But the same use and contrast of "the Father," "the Son." in both Matthew and Luke, "an aerolite from the Johannean heaven" (Hase). No sane criticism can get rid of this Johannine bit in these Gospels written long before the Fourth Gospel was composed. We are dealing here with the oldest known document about Christ (the Logia) and the picture is that drawn in the Fourth Gospel (see my <i>The Christ of the Logia</i>). It is idle to try to whittle away by fantastic exegesis the high claims made by Jesus in this passage. It is an ecstatic prayer in the presence of the Seventy under the rapture of the Holy Spirit on terms of perfect equality and understanding between the Father and the Son in the tone of the priestly prayer in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:17">Luke 10:17</span>. We are justified in saying that this prayer of supreme Fellowship with the Father in contemplation of final victory over Satan gives us a glimpse of the prayers with the Father when the Son spent whole nights on the mountain alone with the Father. Here is the Messianic consciousness in complete control and with perfect confidence in the outcome. Here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span> by the use of</p>
<p><b>willeth to reveal him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλητα αποκαλυψα</span></span>). The Son claims the power to reveal the Father "to whomsoever he wills" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω αν βουλητα</span></span>, indefinite relative and present subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομα</span></span>, to will, not the future indicative). This is divine sovereignty most assuredly. Human free agency is also true, but it is full divine sovereignty in salvation that is here claimed along with possession (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδοθη</span></span>, timeless aorist passive indicative) of all power from the Father. Let that supreme claim stand. </p>
