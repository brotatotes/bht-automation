<p><b> Turning to the disciples </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στραφεις προς τους μαθητας</span></span>). Second aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρεφω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:55">Luke 9:55</span>. The prayer was a soliloquy though uttered in the presence of the Seventy on their return. Now Jesus turned and spoke "privately" or to the disciples (the Twelve, apparently), whether on this same occasion or a bit later.</p>
<p><b>Blessed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακαριο</span></span>). A beatitude, the same adjective as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3-11">Matthew 5:3-11</span>. A beatitude of privilege very much like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:13-16">Matthew 5:13-16</span>. Jesus often repeated his sayings. </p>
