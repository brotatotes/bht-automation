 Turning to the disciples  (στραφεις προς τους μαθητας). Second aorist passive of στρεφω as in Luke 9:55. The prayer was a soliloquy though uttered in the presence of the Seventy on their return. Now Jesus turned and spoke "privately" or to the disciples (the Twelve, apparently), whether on this same occasion or a bit later.Blessed  (μακαριο). A beatitude, the same adjective as in Matthew 5:3-11. A beatitude of privilege very much like that in Matthew 5:13-16. Jesus often repeated his sayings.
