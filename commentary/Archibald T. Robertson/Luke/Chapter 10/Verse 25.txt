<p><b> And tempted him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπειραζων αυτον</span></span>). Present active participle, conative idea, trying to tempt him. There is no "and" in the Greek. He "stood up (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεστη</span></span>, ingressive second aorist active) trying to tempt him." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πειραζω</span></span> is a late form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπειραζω</span></span> apparently only in the LXX, and N.T. (quoted by Jesus from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+6:16">Deuteronomy 6:16</span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:7">Matthew 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:12">Luke 4:12</span> against Satan). Here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:9">1 Corinthians 10:9</span>. The spirit of this lawyer was evil. He wanted to entrap Jesus if possible.</p>
<p><b>What shall I do to inherit eternal life? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ ποιησας ζωην αιωνιου κληρονομησω;</span></span>). Literally, "By doing what shall I inherit eternal life?" Note the emphasis on "doing" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησας</span></span>). The form of his question shows a wrong idea as to how to get it.</p>
<p><b>Eternal life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωην αιωνιον</span></span>) is endless life as in John's Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:9">John 16:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:18">John 18:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:30">John 18:30</span>) and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46">Matthew 25:46</span>, which see. </p>
