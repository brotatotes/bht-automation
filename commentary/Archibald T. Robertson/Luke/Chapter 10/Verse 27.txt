<p><b> And he answering </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε αποκριθεις</span></span>). First aorist participle, no longer passive in idea. The lawyer's answer is first from the <i>Shema</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+6:3">Deuteronomy 6:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+11:13">Deuteronomy 11:13</span>) which was written on the phylacteries. The second part is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+19:18">Leviticus 19:18</span> and shows that the lawyer knew the law. At a later time Jesus himself in the temple gives a like summary of the law to a lawyer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:28-34">Mark 12:28-34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:34-40">Matthew 22:34-40</span>) who wanted to catch Jesus by his question. There is no difficulty in the two incidents. God is to be loved with all of man's four powers (heart, soul, strength, mind) here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:30">Mark 12:30</span>. </p>
