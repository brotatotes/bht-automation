<p><b> Desiring to justify himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελων δικαιωσα εαυτον</span></span>). The lawyer saw at once that he had convicted himself of asking a question that he already knew. In his embarrassment he asks another question to show that he did have some point at first:</p>
<p><b>And who is my neighbour? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τις εστιν μου πλησιον;</span></span>). The Jews split hairs over this question and excluded from "neighbour" Gentiles and especially Samaritans. So here was his loop-hole. A neighbour is a nigh dweller to one, but the Jews made racial exceptions as many, alas, do today. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλησιον</span></span> here is an adverb (neuter of the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλησιος</span></span>) meaning <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πλησιον ων</span></span> (the one who is near), but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span> was usually not expressed and the adverb is here used as if a substantive. </p>
