<p><b> As lambs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως αρνας</span></span>). Here again the same language as that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:16">Matthew 10:16</span> except that there "sheep" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προβατα</span></span>) appears instead of "lambs." Pathetic picture of the risks of missionaries for Christ. They take their life in their hands. </p>
