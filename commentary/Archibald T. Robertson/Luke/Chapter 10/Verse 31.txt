<p><b> By chance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα συγκυριαν</span></span>). Here only in the N.T., meaning rather, "by way of coincidence." It is a rare word elsewhere and in late writers like Hippocrates. It is from the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συγκυρεω</span></span>, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συγκυρησις</span></span> is more common.</p>
<p><b>Was going down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεβαινεν</span></span>). Imperfect active as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:30">Luke 10:30</span>. Passed by on the other side (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιπαρηλθεν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιπαρερχομα</span></span>, a late double compound here (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:31">Luke 10:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:32">Luke 10:32</span>) only in the N.T., but in the papyri and late writers. It is the ingressive aorist (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλθεν</span></span>), came alongside (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>), and then he stepped over to the opposite side (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span>) of the road to avoid ceremonial contamination with a stranger. A vivid and powerful picture of the vice of Jewish ceremonial cleanliness at the cost of moral principle and duty. The Levite in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:32">Luke 10:32</span> behaved precisely as the priest had done and for the same reason. </p>
