<p><b> A certain Samaritan </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σαμαρειτης δε τις</span></span>). Of all men in the world to do a neighbourly act!</p>
<p><b>As he journeyed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδευων</span></span>). Making his way.</p>
<p><b>Came where he was </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλθεν κατ' αυτον</span></span>). Literally, "came down upon him." He did not sidestep or dodge him, but had compassion on him. </p>
