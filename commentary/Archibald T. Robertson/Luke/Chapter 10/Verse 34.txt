<p><b> Bound up his wounds </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεδησεν τα τραυματα</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταδεω</span></span>, old verb, but here only in the N.T. The verb means "bound down." We say "bind up." Medical detail that interested Luke. The word for "wounds" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τραυματα</span></span>) here only in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Pouring on them oil and wine </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιχεων ελαιον κα οινον</span></span>). Old verb again, but here only in the N.T. Oil and wine were household remedies even for wounds (soothing oil, antiseptic alcohol). Hippocrates prescribed for ulcers: "Bind with soft wool, and sprinkle with wine and oil."</p>
<p><b>Set him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιβιβασας</span></span>). An old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιβιβαζω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιβαζω</span></span>), to cause to mount. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:35">Acts 19:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:24">Acts 23:24</span>, common in LXX.</p>
<p><b>Beast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτηνος</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κταομα</span></span>, to acquire, and so property (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτημα</span></span>) especially cattle or any beast of burden.</p>
<p><b>An inn </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πανδοχειον</span></span>). The old Attic form was <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πανδοκειον</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν</span></span>, all, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεχομα</span></span>, to receive). A public place for receiving all comers and a more pretentious caravanserai than a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλυμα</span></span> like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:7">Luke 2:7</span>. Here only in the N.T. There are ruins of two inns about halfway between Bethany and Jericho. </p>
