<p><b> On him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετ' αυτου</span></span>). With him, more exactly. The lawyer saw the point and gave the correct answer, but he gulped at the word "Samaritan" and refused to say that.</p>
<p><b>Do thou </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ ποιε</span></span>). Emphasis on "thou." Would this Jewish lawyer act the neighbour to a Samaritan? This parable of the Good Samaritan has built the world's hospitals and, if understood and practised, will remove race prejudice, national hatred and war, class jealousy. </p>
