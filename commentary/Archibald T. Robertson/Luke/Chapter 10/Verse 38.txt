<p><b> Now as they went on their way </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην δε τω πορευεσθα αυτους</span></span>). Luke's favourite temporal clause again as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:35">Luke 10:35</span>.</p>
<p><b>Received him into her house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεδεξατο αυτον εις την οικιαν</span></span>). Aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποδεχομα</span></span>, an old verb to welcome as a guest (in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:6">Luke 19:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:7">Acts 17:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:25">James 2:25</span>). Martha is clearly the mistress of the home and is probably the elder sister. There is no evidence that she was the wife of Simon the leper (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span>). It is curious that in an old cemetery at Bethany the names of Martha, Eleazar, and Simon have been found. </p>
