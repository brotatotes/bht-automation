<p><b> Purse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλαντιον</span></span>). Old word for money-bag, sometimes a javelin as if from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλω</span></span>. Only in Luke in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:4">Luke 10:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:33">Luke 12:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:35">Luke 22:35</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:3">Luke 9:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:7">Mark 6:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:9">Matthew 10:9</span> for the other similar items.</p>
<p><b>Salute no man on the way </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδενα κατα την οδον ασπασησθε</span></span>). First aorist (ingressive) middle subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδενα</span></span>. The peril of such wayside salutations was palaver and delay. The King's business required haste. Elisha's servant was not to tarry for salutations or salaams (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+4:29">2 Kings 4:29</span>). These oriental greetings were tedious, complicated, and often meddlesome if others were present or engaged in a bargain. </p>
