 Purse  (βαλλαντιον). Old word for money-bag, sometimes a javelin as if from βαλλω. Only in Luke in the N.T. (Luke 10:4; Luke 12:33; Luke 22:35). See Luke 9:3; Mark 6:7; Matthew 10:9 for the other similar items.Salute no man on the way  (μηδενα κατα την οδον ασπασησθε). First aorist (ingressive) middle subjunctive with μηδενα. The peril of such wayside salutations was palaver and delay. The King's business required haste. Elisha's servant was not to tarry for salutations or salaams (2 Kings 4:29). These oriental greetings were tedious, complicated, and often meddlesome if others were present or engaged in a bargain.
