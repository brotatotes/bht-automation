<p><b> Was cumbered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιεσπατο</span></span>).

<p><b>She came up to him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστασα</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφιστημ</span></span>, an old verb to place upon, but in the N.T. only in the middle voice or the intransitive tenses of the active (perfect and second aorist as here). It is the ingressive aorist here and really means. stepping up to or bursting in or upon Jesus. It is an explosive act as is the speech of Martha.</p>
<p><b>Dost thou not care </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μελε σο</span></span>). This was a reproach to Jesus for monopolizing Mary to Martha's hurt.</p>
<p><b>Did leave me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με κατελειπεν</span></span>). Imperfect active, she kept on leaving me.</p>
<p><b>Bid her </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον αυτη</span></span>). Late form instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπε</span></span>, second aorist active imperative, common in the papyri. Martha feels that Jesus is the key to Mary's help.</p>
<p><b>That she help me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μο συναντιλαβητα</span></span>). Sub-final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> with second aorist middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναντιλαμβανομα</span></span>, a double compound verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span>, with, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span>, at her end of the line, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανομα</span></span>, middle voice of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>, to take hold), a late compound appearing in the LXX, Diodorus and Josephus. Deissmann (<i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 87) finds it in many widely scattered inscriptions "throughout the whole extent of the Hellenistic world of the Mediterranean." It appears only twice in the N.T. (here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span>). It is a beautiful word, to take hold oneself (middle voice) at his end of the task (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span>) together with (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span>) one. </p>
