<p><b> Art anxious </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεριμναις</span></span>). An old verb for worry and anxiety from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεριζω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μερις</span></span>, part) to be divided, distracted. Jesus had warned against this in the Sermon on the Mount (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:25">Matthew 6:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:28">Matthew 6:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:31">Matthew 6:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:34">Matthew 6:34</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:11">Luke 12:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:22">Luke 12:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:26">Luke 12:26</span>).</p>
<p><b>And troubled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα θορυβαζη</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θορυβαζομα</span></span>, a verb found nowhere else so far. Many MSS. here have the usual form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυρβαζη</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυρβαζω</span></span>. Apparently from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θορυβος</span></span>, a common enough word for tumult. Martha had both inward anxiety and outward agitation.</p>
<p><b>But one thing is needful </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενος δε εστιν χρεια</span></span>). This is the reading of A C and may be correct. A few manuscripts have: "There is need of few things." Aleph B L (and Westcott and Hort) have: "There is need of few things or one," which seems like a conflate reading though the readings are all old. See Robertson, <i>Introduction to Textual Criticism of the N.T.</i>, p. 190. Jesus seems to say to Martha that only one dish was really necessary for the meal instead of the "many" about which she was so anxious. </p>
