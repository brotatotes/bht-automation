<p><b> In that same house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτη τη οικια</span></span>). Literally, in the house itself, not "in the same house" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη αυτη οικια</span></span>), a different construction. A free rendering of the common Lukan idiom is, "in that very house."</p>
<p><b>Eating </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσθοντες</span></span>). An old poetic verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσθω</span></span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσθιω</span></span> that survives in late Greek.</p>
<p><b>Such things as they give </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα παρ' αυτων</span></span>). "The things from them."</p>
<p><b>For the labourer is worthy of his hire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιος γαρ ο εργατης του μισθου αυτου</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:10">Matthew 10:10</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της τροφης αυτου</span></span> (his food). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:18">1 Timothy 5:18</span> has this saying quoted as scripture. That is not impossible if Luke wrote by A.D. 62. Paul there however may quote only <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+25:4">Deuteronomy 25:4</span> as scripture and get this quotation either from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:7">Luke 10:7</span> or from a proverbial saying of Jesus. It is certainly not a real objection against the Pauline authorship of First Timothy.</p>
<p><b>Go not from house to house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη μεταβαινετε εξ οικιας εις οικιαν</span></span>). As a habit, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the present imperative, and so avoid waste of time with such rounds of invitations as would come. </p>
