<p><b> As he was praying in a certain place </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω εινα αυτον εν τοπω τιν προσευχομενον</span></span>). Characteristically Lukan idiom: <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> with articular periphrastic infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα προσευχομενον</span></span>) with accusative of general reference (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>That </b>. Not in the Greek, asyndeton (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εγενετο ειπεν</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>When he ceased </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως επαυσατο</span></span>). Supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευχομενος</span></span> (praying), complementary or supplementary participle.</p>
<p><b>Teach us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδαξον ημας</span></span>). Jesus had taught them by precept (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:7-15">Matthew 6:7-15</span>) and example (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:29">Luke 9:29</span>). Somehow the example of Jesus on this occasion stirred them to fresh interest in the subject and to revival of interest in John's teachings (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:33">Luke 5:33</span>). So Jesus gave them the substance of the Model Prayer in Matthew, but in shorter form. Some of the MSS. have one or all of the phrases in Matthew, but the oldest documents have it in the simplest form. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:7-15">Matthew 6:7-15</span> for discussion of these details (Father, hallowed, kingdom, daily bread, forgiveness, bringing us into temptation). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:11">Matthew 6:11</span> "give" is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δος</span></span> (second aorist active imperative second singular, a single act) while here <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:3">Luke 11:3</span> "give" is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδου</span></span> (present active imperative, both from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>) and means, "keep on giving." So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:4">Luke 11:4</span> we have "For we ourselves also forgive" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα γαρ αυτο αφιομεν</span></span>), present active indicative of the late <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω</span></span> verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιω</span></span> while <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span> has "as we also forgave" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως κα ημεις αφηκαμεν</span></span>), first aorist (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κ</span></span> aorist) active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιημ</span></span>. So also where <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span> has "debts" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα οφειληματα</span></span>) <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:4">Luke 11:4</span> has "sins" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας αμαρτιας</span></span>). But the spirit of each prayer is the same. There is no evidence that Jesus meant either form to be a ritual. In both <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:13">Matthew 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:4">Luke 11:4</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη εισενεγκηις</span></span> occurs (second aorist subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> in prohibition, ingressive aorist). "Bring us not" is a better translation than "lead us not." There is no such thing as God enticing one to sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:13">James 1:13</span>). Jesus urges us to pray not to be tempted as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:40">Luke 22:40</span> in Gethsemane. </p>
