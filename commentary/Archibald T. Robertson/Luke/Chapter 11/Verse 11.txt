<p><b> Of which of you that is a father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινα δε εξ υμων τον πατερα</span></span>). There is a decided anacoluthon here. The MSS. differ a great deal. The text of Westcott and Hort makes <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον πατερα</span></span> (the father) in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινα</span></span> (of whom) and in the accusative the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτησε</span></span> (shall ask) which has also another accusative (both person and thing) "a loaf." So far so good. But the rest of the sentence is,</p>
<p><b>will ye give him a stone? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη λιθον επιδωσε αυτωι;</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη</span></span> shows that the answer No is expected, but the trouble is that the interrogative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινα</span></span> in the first clause is in the accusative the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτησε</span></span> while here the same man (he) is the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιδωσε</span></span>. It is a very awkward piece of Greek and yet it is intelligible. Some of the old MSS. do not have the part about "loaf" and "stone," but only the two remaining parts about "fish" and "serpent," "egg" and "scorpion." The same difficult construction is carried over into these questions also. </p>
