<p><b> Know how to give </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδατε διδονα</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:11">Matthew 7:11</span> for this same saying. Only here Jesus adds the Holy Spirit (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα αγιον</span></span>) as the great gift (the <i>summum bonum</i>) that the Father is ready to bestow. Jesus is fond of "how much more" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποσω μαλλον</span></span>, by how much more, instrumental case). </p>
