<p><b> Dumb </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωφον</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:32">Matthew 9:32</span>.</p>
<p><b>By Beelzebub </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Βεεζεβουλ</span></span>). Blasphemous accusation here in Judea as in Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:22">Mark 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:24">Matthew 12:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:27">Matthew 12:27</span>). See on Matthew for discussion of the form of this name and the various items in the sin against the Holy Spirit involved in the charge. It was useless to deny the fact of the miracles. So they were explained as wrought by Satan himself, a most absurd explanation. </p>
