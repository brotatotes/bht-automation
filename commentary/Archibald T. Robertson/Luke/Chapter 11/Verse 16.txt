These "others" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερο</span></span>) apparently realized the futility of the charge of being in league with Beelzebub. Hence they put up to Jesus the demand for "a sign from heaven" just as had been done in Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:38">Matthew 12:38</span>). By "sign" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον</span></span>) they meant a great spectacular display of heavenly power such as they expected the Messiah to give and such as the devil suggested to Jesus on the pinnacle of the temple.</p>
