<p><b> But he </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος δε</span></span>). In contrast with them.</p>
<p><b>Knowing their thoughts </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδως αυτων τα διανοηματα</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διανοεω</span></span>, to think through or distinguish. This substantive is common in Plato, but occurs nowhere else in the N.T. It means intent, purpose. Jesus knew that they were trying to tempt him.</p>
<p><b>And a house divided against a house falleth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα οικος επ οικον πιπτε</span></span>). It is not certain that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαμερισθεισα</span></span> (divided) is to be repeated here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:25">Matthew 12:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:25">Mark 3:25</span>. It may mean,</p>
<p><b>and house falls upon house </b>, "one tumbling house knocking down its neighbour, a graphic picture of what happens when a kingdom is divided against itself" (Bruce). </p>
