<p><b> Were gathering together unto him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαθροιζομενων</span></span>). Genitive absolute present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαθροιζω</span></span>, a rare verb, Plutarch and here only in the N.T., from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αθροιζω</span></span> (a common enough verb). It means to throng together (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αθροος</span></span>, in throngs). Vivid picture of the crowds around Jesus.</p>
<p><b>But the sign of Jonah </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη το σημειον Ιωνα</span></span>). Luke does not give here the burial and resurrection of Jesus of which Jonah's experience in the big fish was a type (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:39">Matthew 12:39</span>), but that is really implied (Plummer argues) by the use here of "shall be given" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοθησετα</span></span>) and "shall be" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστα</span></span>), for the resurrection of Jesus is still future. The preaching of Jesus ought to have been sign enough as in the case of Jonah, but the resurrection will be given. Luke's report is much briefer and omits what is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:41">Matthew 12:41</span>. </p>
