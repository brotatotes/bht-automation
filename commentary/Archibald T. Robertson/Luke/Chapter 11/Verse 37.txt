<p><b> Now as he spake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν δε τω λαλησα</span></span>). Luke's common idiom, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> with the articular infinitive (aorist active infinitive) but it does not mean "after he had spoken" as Plummer argues, but simply "in the speaking," no time in the aorist infinitive. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:21">Luke 3:21</span> for similar use of aorist infinitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Asketh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερωτα</span></span>). Present active indicative, dramatic present. Request, not question.</p>
<p><b>To dine </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως αριστηση</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως</span></span> rather than the common <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>. Aorist active subjunctive rather than present, for a single meal. The verb is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αριστον</span></span> (breakfast). See distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αριστον</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειπνον</span></span> (dinner or supper) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:12">Luke 14:12</span>. It is the morning meal (breakfast or lunch) after the return from morning prayers in the synagogue (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:4">Matthew 22:4</span>), not the very early meal called <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακρατισμα</span></span>. The verb is, however, used for the early meal on the seashore in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:12">John 21:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15">John 21:15</span>.</p>
<p><b>With him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ' αυτω</span></span>). By his side.</p>
<p><b>Sat down to meat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεπεσεν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπιπτω</span></span>, old verb, to recline, to fall back on the sofa or lounge. No word here for "to meat." </p>
