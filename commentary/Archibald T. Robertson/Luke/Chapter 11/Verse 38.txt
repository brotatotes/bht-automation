<p><b> That he had not first washed before dinner </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ου πρωτον εβαπτισθη προ του αριστου</span></span>). The verb is first aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτιζω</span></span>, to dip or to immerse. Here it is applied to the hands. It was the Jewish custom to dip the hands in water before eating and often between courses for ceremonial purification. In Galilee the Pharisees and scribes had sharply criticized the disciples for eating with unwashed hands (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:1-23">Mark 7:1-23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:1-20">Matthew 15:1-20</span>) when Jesus had defended their liberty and had opposed making a necessity of such a custom (tradition) in opposition to the command of God. Apparently Jesus on this occasion had himself reclined at the breakfast (not dinner) without this ceremonial dipping of the hands in water. The Greek has "first before" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτον προ</span></span>), a tautology not preserved in the translation. </p>
