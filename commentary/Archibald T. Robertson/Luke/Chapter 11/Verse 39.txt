<p><b> The Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κυριος</span></span>). The Lord Jesus plainly and in the narrative portion of Luke.</p>
<p><b>Now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν</span></span>). Probably refers to him. You Pharisees do now what was formerly done.</p>
<p><b>The platter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του πινακος</span></span>). The dish. Old word, rendered "the charger" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:8">Matthew 14:8</span>. Another word for "platter" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροψις</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:25">Matthew 23:25</span> means "side-dish."</p>
<p><b>But your inward part </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το δε εσωθεν υμων</span></span>). The part within you (Pharisees). They keep the external regulations, but their hearts are full of plunder (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαγης</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαζω</span></span>, to seize) and wickedness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονηριας</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονηρος</span></span>, evil man). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:25">Matthew 23:25</span> for a like indictment of the Pharisees for care for the outside of the cup but neglect of what is on the inside. Both inside and outside should be clean, but the inside first. </p>
