<p><b> Tithe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδεκατουτε</span></span>). Late verb for the more common <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεκατευω</span></span>. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:23">Matthew 23:23</span>. Take a tenth off (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο-</span></span>). Rue (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πηγανον</span></span>). Botanical term in late writers from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πηγνυμ</span></span>, to make fast because of its thick leaves. Here <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:23">Matthew 23:23</span> has "anise."</p>
<p><b>Every herb </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν λαχανον</span></span>). General term as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:32">Mark 4:32</span>. Matthew has "cummin."</p>
<p><b>Pass by </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρερχεσθε</span></span>). Present middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρερχομα</span></span>, common verb, to go by or beside. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:23">Matthew 23:23</span> has "ye have left undone" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφηκατε</span></span>). Luke here has "love" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπην</span></span>), not in Matthew.</p>
<p><b>Ought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδε</span></span>). As in Matthew. Imperfect of a present obligation, not lived up to just like our "ought" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οwεδ</span></span>, not paid). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παρεινα</span></span>, as in Matthew, the second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιημ</span></span>. to leave off. Common verb. Luke does not have the remark about straining out the gnat and swallowing the camel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:34">Matthew 23:34</span>). It is plain that the terrible exposure of the scribes and Pharisees in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:23">Luke 11:23</span> in the temple was simply the culmination of previous conflicts such as this one. </p>
