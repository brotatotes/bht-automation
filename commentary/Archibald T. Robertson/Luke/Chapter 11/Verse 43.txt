 The chief seats in the synagogues  (την πρωτοκαθεδριαν εν ταις συναγωγαις). Singular here, plural in Matthew 23:6. This semi-circular bench faced the congregation. Matthew 23:6 has also the chief place at feasts given by Luke also in that discourse (Luke 20:46) as well as in Luke 14:7, a marked characteristic of the Pharisees.
