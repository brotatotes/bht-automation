<p><b> The tombs which appear not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα μνηνεια τα αδηλα</span></span>). These hidden graves would give ceremonial defilement for seven days (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:16">Numbers 19:16</span>). Hence they were usually whitewashed as a warning. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:27">Matthew 23:27</span> the Pharisees are called "whited sepulchres." Men do not know how rotten they are. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδηλος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δηλος</span></span>, apparent or plain) occurs in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:8">1 Corinthians 14:8</span>, though an old and common word.</p>
<p><b>Here men walking around </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιπατουντες</span></span>) walk over the tombs without knowing it. These three woes cut to the quick and evidently made the Pharisees wince. </p>
