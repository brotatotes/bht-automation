The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υβριζω</span></span> is an old one and common for outrageous treatment, a positive insult (so <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:32">Luke 18:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:6">Matthew 22:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:14">Matthew 22:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:5">Matthew 22:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span>). So Jesus proceeds to give the lawyers three woes as he had done to the Pharisees. </p>
