<p><b> Grievous to be borne </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυσβαστακτα</span></span>). A late word in LXX and Plutarch (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυς</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασταζω</span></span>). Here alone in text of Westcott and Hort who reject it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:4">Matthew 23:4</span> where we have "heavy burdens" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορτια βαρεα</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:2">Galatians 6:2</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρη</span></span> with a distinction drawn. Here we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορτιζετε</span></span> (here only in the N.T. and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:28">Matthew 11:28</span>) for "lade," <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορτια</span></span> as cognate accusative and then <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορτιοις</span></span> (dative after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου προσψαυετε</span></span>, touch not). It is a fierce indictment of scribes (lawyers) for their pettifogging interpretations of the written law in their oral teaching (later written down as <i>Mishna</i> and then as <i>Gemarah</i>), a terrible load which these lawyers did not pretend to carry themselves, not even "with one of their fingers" to "touch" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσψαυω</span></span>, old verb but only here in the N.T.), touch with the view to remove. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:4">Matthew 23:4</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κινησα</span></span>, to move. A physician would understand the meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσπαυω</span></span> for feeling gently a sore spot or the pulse. </p>
