 Grievous to be borne  (δυσβαστακτα). A late word in LXX and Plutarch (δυς and βασταζω). Here alone in text of Westcott and Hort who reject it in Matthew 23:4 where we have "heavy burdens" (φορτια βαρεα). In Galatians 6:2 we have βαρη with a distinction drawn. Here we have φορτιζετε (here only in the N.T. and Matthew 11:28) for "lade," φορτια as cognate accusative and then φορτιοις (dative after ου προσψαυετε, touch not). It is a fierce indictment of scribes (lawyers) for their pettifogging interpretations of the written law in their oral teaching (later written down as Mishna and then as Gemarah), a terrible load which these lawyers did not pretend to carry themselves, not even "with one of their fingers" to "touch" (προσψαυω, old verb but only here in the N.T.), touch with the view to remove. Matthew 23:4 has κινησα, to move. A physician would understand the meaning of προσπαυω for feeling gently a sore spot or the pulse.
