<p><b> The wisdom of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η σοφια του θεου</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:34">Matthew 23:34</span> Jesus uses "I send" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω αποστελλω</span></span>) without this phrase "the wisdom of God." There is no book to which it can refer. Jesus is the wisdom of God as Paul shows (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:30">1 Corinthians 1:30</span>), but it is hardly likely that he so describes himself here. Probably he means that God in his wisdom said, but even so "Jesus here speaks with confident knowledge of the Divine counsels" (Plummer). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:22">Luke 10:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:7">Luke 15:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:10">Luke 15:10</span>. Here the future tense occurs, "I will send" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστελω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Some of them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ αυτων</span></span>). No "some" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινας</span></span>) in the Greek, but understood. They will act as their fathers did. They will kill and persecute. </p>
