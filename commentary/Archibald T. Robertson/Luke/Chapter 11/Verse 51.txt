<p><b> From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο αιματος Αβελ εως αιματος Ζαχαριου</span></span>). The blood of Abel is the first shed in the Old Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:10">Genesis 4:10</span>), that of Zacharias the last in the O.T. canon which ended with Chronicles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:22">2 Chronicles 24:22</span>). Chronologically the murder of Uriah by Jehoiakim was later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+26:23">Jeremiah 26:23</span>), but this climax is from Genesis to II Chronicles (the last book in the canon). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:35">Matthew 23:35</span> for discussion of Zachariah as "the son of Barachiah" rather than "the son of Jehoiada."</p>
<p><b>Between the altar and the sanctuary </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταξυ του θυσιαστηριου κα του οικου</span></span>). Literally, between the altar and the house (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:35">Matthew 23:35</span> has temple, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναου</span></span>). </p>
