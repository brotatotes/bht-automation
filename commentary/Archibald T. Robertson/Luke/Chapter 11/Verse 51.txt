 From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah  (απο αιματος Αβελ εως αιματος Ζαχαριου). The blood of Abel is the first shed in the Old Testament (Genesis 4:10), that of Zacharias the last in the O.T. canon which ended with Chronicles (2 Chronicles 24:22). Chronologically the murder of Uriah by Jehoiakim was later (Jeremiah 26:23), but this climax is from Genesis to II Chronicles (the last book in the canon). See on Matthew 23:35 for discussion of Zachariah as "the son of Barachiah" rather than "the son of Jehoiada."Between the altar and the sanctuary  (μεταξυ του θυσιαστηριου κα του οικου). Literally, between the altar and the house (Matthew 23:35 has temple, ναου).
