<p><b> From thence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κ'ακειθεν</span></span>). Out of the Pharisee's house. What became of the breakfast we are not told, but the rage of both Pharisees and lawyers knew no bounds.</p>
<p><b>To press upon him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεχειν</span></span>). An old Greek verb to hold in, to be enraged at, to have it in for one. It is the same verb used of the relentless hatred of Herodias for John the Baptist (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:19">Mark 6:19</span>).</p>
<p><b>To provoke him to speak </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστοματιζειν</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στομα</span></span> (mouth). Plato uses it of repeating to a pupil for him to recite from memory, then to recite by heart (Plutarch). Here (alone in the N.T.) the verb means to ply with questions, to entice to answers, to catechize.</p>
<p><b>Of many things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ πλειονων</span></span>). "Concerning more (comparative) things." They were stung to the quick by these woes which laid bare their hollow hypocrisy. </p>
