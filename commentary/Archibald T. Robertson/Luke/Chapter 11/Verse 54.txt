<p><b> Laying wait for him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεδρευοντες αυτον</span></span>). An old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδρα</span></span>, a seat, so to lie in ambush for one. Here only and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:21">Acts 23:21</span> in the N.T. Vivid picture of the anger of these rabbis who were treating Jesus as if he were a beast of prey.</p>
<p><b>To catch something out of his mouth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θηρευσα το εκ του στοματος αυτου</span></span>). An old Greek verb, though here only in the N.T., from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θηρα</span></span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:9">Romans 11:9</span>), to ensnare, to catch in hunting, to hunt. These graphic words from the chase show the rage of the rabbis toward Jesus. Luke gives more details here than in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:45-47">Luke 20:45-47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:1-7">Matthew 23:1-7</span>, but there is no reason at all why Jesus should not have had this conflict at the Pharisee's breakfast before that in the temple in the great Tuesday debate. </p>
