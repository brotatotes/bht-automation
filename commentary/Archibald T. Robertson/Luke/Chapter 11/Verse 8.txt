<p><b> Though </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε κα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κα ε</span></span> would be "Even if," a different idea.</p>
<p><b>Because he is his friend </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το εινα φιλον αυτου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δια</span></span> and the accusative articular infinitive with accusative of general reference, a causal clause="because of the being a friend of his."</p>
<p><b>Yet because of his importunity </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια γε την αναιδιαν αυτου</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναιδης</span></span>, shameless, and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιδως</span></span>, shame, shamelessness, impudence. An old word, but here alone in the N.T. Examples in the papyri. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γε</span></span> here, one of the intensive particles, is to be noted. It sharpens the contrast to "though" by "yet." As examples of importunate prayer Vincent notes Abraham in behalf of Sodom (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:23-33">Genesis 18:23-33</span>) and the Syro-Phoenician woman in behalf of her daughter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:22-28">Matthew 15:22-28</span>). </p>
