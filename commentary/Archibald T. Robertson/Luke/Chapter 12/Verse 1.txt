<p><b> In the meantime </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν οις</span></span>). It is a classic idiom to start a sentence or even a paragraph as here with a relative, "in which things or circumstances," without any expressed antecedent other than the incidents in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:53">Luke 11:53</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:3">Luke 12:3</span> Luke actually begins the sentence with two relatives <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθ' ων οσα</span></span> (wherefore whatsoever).</p>
<p><b>Many thousands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυριαδων</span></span>). Genitive absolute with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισυναχθεισων</span></span> (first aorist passive participle feminine plural because of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυριαδων</span></span>), a double compound late verb, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισυναγω</span></span>, to gather together unto. The word "myriads" is probably hyperbolical as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:20">Acts 21:20</span>, but in the sense of ten thousand, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:19">Acts 19:19</span>, it means a very large crowd apparently drawn together by the violent attacks of the rabbis against Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Insomuch that they trode one upon another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε καταπατειν αλληλους</span></span>). The imagination must complete the picture of this jam.</p>
<p><b>Unto his disciples first of all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τους μαθητας αυτου πρωτον</span></span>). This long discourse in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:12">Luke 12:12</span> is really a series of separate talks to various groups in the vast crowds around Jesus. This particular talk goes through verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:12">Luke 12:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>Beware of </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεχετε εαυτοις απο</span></span>). Put your mind (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουν</span></span> understood) for yourselves (dative) and avoid (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> with the ablative).</p>
<p><b>The leaven of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της ζυμης ητις εστιν υποχρισις των Φαρισαιων</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:15">Mark 8:15</span> Jesus had coupled the lesson of the Pharisees with that of Herod, in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:6">Matthew 16:6</span> with that of the Sadducees also. He had long ago called the Pharisees hypocrites (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:2">Matthew 6:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:5">Matthew 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:16">Matthew 6:16</span>). The occasion was ripe here for this crisp saying. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:33">Matthew 13:33</span> leaven does not have an evil sense as here, which see. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:13">Matthew 23:13</span> for hypocrites. Hypocrisy was the leading Pharisaic vice (Bruce) and was a mark of sanctity to hide an evil heart. </p>
