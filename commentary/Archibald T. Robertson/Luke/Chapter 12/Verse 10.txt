<p><b> But unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω δε εις το αγιον πνευμα βλασφημησαντ</span></span>). This unpardonable sin is given by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:28">Mark 3:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:31">Matthew 12:31</span> immediately after the charge that Jesus was in league with Beelzebub. Luke here separates it from the same charge made in Judea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:15-20">Luke 11:15-20</span>). As frequently said, there is no sound reason for saying that Jesus only spoke his memorable sayings once. Luke apparently finds a different environment here. Note the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> here in the sense of "against." </p>
