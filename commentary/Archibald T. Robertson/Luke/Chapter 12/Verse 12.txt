<p><b> What ye ought to say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α δε ειπειν</span></span>). Literally, what things it is necessary (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>) to say. This is no excuse for neglect in pulpit preparation. It is simply a word for courage in a crisis to play the man for Christ and to trust the issue with God without fear. </p>
