 A judge or a divider  (κριτην η μεριστην). Jesus repudiates the position of judge or arbiter in this family fuss. The language reminds one of Exodus 2:14. Jesus is rendering unto Caesar the things of Caesar (Luke 20:25) and shows that his kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36). The word for divider or arbiter (μεριστης) is a late word from μεριζομα (verse Luke 12:13) and occurs here only in the N.T.
