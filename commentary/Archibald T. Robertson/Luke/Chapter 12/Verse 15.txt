From every kind of greedy desire for more (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεον</span></span>, more, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξια</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>, to have) an old word which we have robbed of its sinful aspects and refined to mean business thrift.</p>
