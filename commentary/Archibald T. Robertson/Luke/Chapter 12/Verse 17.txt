<p><b> Reasoned within himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διελογιζετο εν αυτω</span></span>). Imperfect middle, picturing his continued cogitations over his perplexity.</p>
<p><b>Where to bestow </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">που συναξω</span></span>). Future indicative deliberative, where I shall gather together.</p>
<p><b>My fruits </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους καρπους μου</span></span>). So it is with the rich fool: my fruits, my barns, my corn, my goods, just like Nabal whose very name means fool (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+25:11">1 Samuel 25:11</span>), whether a direct reference to him or not. </p>
