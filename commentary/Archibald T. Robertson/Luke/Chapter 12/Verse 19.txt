<p><b> Laid up for many years </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κειμενα εις ετη πολλα</span></span>). Not in D and some other Latin MSS. The man's apostrophe to his "soul" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span>) is thoroughly Epicurean, for his soul feeds on his goods. The asyndeton here (take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry) shows his eagerness. Note difference in tenses (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπαυου</span></span>, keep on resting, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαγε</span></span>, eat at once, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιε</span></span>, drink thy fill, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευφραινου</span></span>, keep on being merry), first and last presents, the other two aorists. </p>
