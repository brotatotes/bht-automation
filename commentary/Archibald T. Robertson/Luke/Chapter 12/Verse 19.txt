 Laid up for many years  (κειμενα εις ετη πολλα). Not in D and some other Latin MSS. The man's apostrophe to his "soul" (ψυχη) is thoroughly Epicurean, for his soul feeds on his goods. The asyndeton here (take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry) shows his eagerness. Note difference in tenses (αναπαυου, keep on resting, φαγε, eat at once, πιε, drink thy fill, ευφραινου, keep on being merry), first and last presents, the other two aorists.
