<p><b> Covered up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συγκεκαλυμμενον εστιν</span></span>). Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συγκαλυπτω</span></span>, an old verb, but here only in the N.T., to cover up on all sides and so completely. Verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:2-9">Luke 12:2-9</span> here are parallel with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:26-33">Matthew 10:26-33</span> spoken to the Twelve on their tour of Galilee, illustrating again how often Jesus repeated his sayings unless we prefer to say that he never did so and that the Gospels have hopelessly jumbled them as to time and place. See the passage in Matthew for discussion of details. </p>
