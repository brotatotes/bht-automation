 Thou foolish one  (αφρων). Fool, for lack of sense (α privative and φρην, sense) as in Luke 11:40; 2 Corinthians 11:19. Old word, used by Socrates in Xenophon. Nominative form as vocative.Is thy soul required of thee  (την ψυχην σου αιτουσιν απο σου). Plural active present, not passive: "They are demanding thy soul from thee." The impersonal plural (aitousin) is common enough (Luke 6:38; Luke 12:11; Luke 16:9; Luke 23:31). The rabbis used "they" to avoid saying "God."
