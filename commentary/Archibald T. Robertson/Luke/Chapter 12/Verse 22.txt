<p><b> Unto his disciples </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τους μαθητας αυτου</span></span>). So Jesus turns from the crowd to the disciples (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:22-40">Luke 12:22-40</span>, when Peter interrupts the discourse). From here to the end of the chapter Luke gives material that appears in Matthew, but not in one connection as here. In Matthew part of it is in the charge to the Twelve on their tour in Galilee, part in the eschatological discourse on the Mount of Olives. None of it is in Mark. Hence Q or the Logia seems to be the source of it. The question recurs again whether Jesus repeated on other occasions what is given here or whether Luke has here put together separate discourses as Matthew is held by many to have done in the Sermon on the Mount. We have no way of deciding these points. We can only say again that Jesus would naturally repeat his favourite sayings like other popular preachers and teachers. So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:22-31">Luke 12:22-31</span> corresponds to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:25-33">Matthew 6:25-33</span>, which see for detailed discussion. The parable of the rich fool was spoken to the crowd, but this exhortation to freedom from care (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:22-31">Luke 12:22-31</span>) is to the disciples. So the language in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:22">Luke 12:22</span> is precisely that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:25">Matthew 6:25</span>. See there for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη μεριμνατε</span></span> (stop being anxious) and the deliberative subjunctive retained in the indirect question (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαγητε, ενδυσησθε</span></span>). So verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:23">Luke 12:23</span> here is the same in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:25">Matthew 6:25</span> except that there it is a question with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ</span></span> expecting the affirmative answer, whereas here it is given as a reason (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>, for) for the preceding command. </p>
