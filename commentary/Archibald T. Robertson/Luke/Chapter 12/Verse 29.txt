<p><b> Seek not ye </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις μη ζητειτε</span></span>). Note emphatic position of "ye" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις</span></span>). Stop seeking (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and present imperative active). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:31">Matthew 6:31</span> has: "Do not become anxious" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη μεριμνησητε</span></span>), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and ingressive subjunctive occur as direct questions (What are we to eat? What are we to drink? What are we to put on?) whereas here they are in the indirect form as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:22">Luke 12:22</span> save that the problem of clothing is not here mentioned:</p>
<p><b>Neither be ye of doubtful mind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μη μετεωριζεσθε</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη</span></span> and present passive imperative (stop being anxious) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετεωριζω</span></span>. An old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετεωρος</span></span> in midair, high (our meteor), to lift up on high, then to lift oneself up with hopes (false sometimes), to be buoyed up, to be tossed like a ship at sea, to be anxious, to be in doubt as in late writers (Polybius, Josephus). This last meaning is probably true here. In the LXX and Philo, but here only in the N.T. </p>
