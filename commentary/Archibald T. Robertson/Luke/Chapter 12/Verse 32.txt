 Little flock  (το μικρον ποιμνιον). Vocative with the article as used in Hebrew and often in the Koine and so in the N.T. See both πατερ and ο πατηρ in the vocative in Luke 10:21. See Robertson, Grammar, pp. 465f. Ποιμνιον (flock) is a contraction from ποιμενιον from ποιμην (shepherd) instead of the usual ποιμνη (flock). So it is not a diminutive and μικρον is not superfluous, though it is pathetic.For it is your Father's good pleasure  (οτ ευδοκησεν ο πατηρ υμων). First aorist active indicative of ευδοκεω. Timeless aorist as in Luke 3:22. This verse has no parallel in Matthew.
