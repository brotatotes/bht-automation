<p><b> Sell that ye have </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πωλησατε τα υπαρχοντα υμων</span></span>). Not in Matthew. Did Jesus mean this literally and always? Luke has been charged with Ebionism, but Jesus does not condemn property as inherently sinful. "The attempt to keep the letter of the rule here given (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:44">Acts 2:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:45">Acts 2:45</span>) had disastrous effects on the church of Jerusalem, which speedily became a church of paupers, constantly in need of alms (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:25">Romans 15:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:26">Romans 15:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:3">1 Corinthians 16:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:4">2 Corinthians 8:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:1">2 Corinthians 9:1</span>)" (Plummer).</p>
<p><b>Purses which wax not old </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλαντια μη παλαιουμενα</span></span>). So already <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλαντιον</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:4">Luke 10:4</span>. Late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλαιοω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλαιος</span></span>, old, to make old, declare old as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:13">Hebrews 8:13</span>, is passive to become old as here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:11">Hebrews 1:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>That faileth not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεκλειπτον</span></span>). Verbal from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλειπω</span></span>, to fail. Late word in Diodorus and Plutarch. Only here in the N.T. or LXX, but in papyri. "I prefer to believe that even Luke sees in the words not a mechanical rule, but a law for the spirit" (Bruce).</p>
<p><b>Draweth near </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγγιζε</span></span>). Instead of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19">Matthew 6:19</span> "dig through and steal."</p>
<p><b>Destroyeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαφθειρε</span></span>). Instead of "doth consume" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19">Matthew 6:19</span>. </p>
