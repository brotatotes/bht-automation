 Be girded about  (εστωσαν περιεζωσμενα). Periphrastic perfect passive imperative third plural of the verb περιζωννυμ or περιζωννυω (later form), an old verb, to gird around, to fasten the garments with a girdle. The long garments of the orientals made speed difficult. It was important to use the girdle before starting. Cf. Luke 17:8; Acts 12:8.Burning  (καιομενο). Periphrastic present middle imperative, already burning and continuously burning. The same point of the Parable of the Ten Virgins (Matthew 25:1-13) is found here in condensed form. This verse introduces the parable of the waiting servants (Luke 12:35-40).
