<p><b> When he shall return from the marriage feast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποτε αναλυση εκ των γαμων</span></span>). The interrogative conjunction <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποτε</span></span> and the deliberative aorist subjunctive retained in the indirect question. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναλυω</span></span>, very common Greek verb, but only twice in the N.T. (here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span>). The figure is breaking up a camp or loosening the mooring of a ship, to depart. Perhaps here the figure is from the standpoint of the wedding feast (plural as used of a single wedding feast in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:8">Luke 14:8</span>), departing from there. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:2">Matthew 22:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>When he cometh and knocketh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελθοντος κα κρουσαντος</span></span>). Genitive absolute of the aorist active participle without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> and in spite of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτο</span></span> (dative) being used after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιξωσιν</span></span> (first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιγω</span></span>). </p>
