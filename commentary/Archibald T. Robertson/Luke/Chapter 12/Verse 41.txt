<p><b> Peter said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ειπεν δε ο Πετρος</span></span>). This whole paragraph from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:22-40">Luke 12:22-40</span> had been addressed directly to the disciples. Hence it is not surprising to find Peter putting in a question. This incident confirms also the impression that Luke is giving actual historical data in the environment of these discourses. He is certain that the Twelve are meant, but he desires to know if others are included, for he had spoken to the multitude in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:13-21">Luke 12:13-21</span>. Recall <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:37">Mark 13:37</span>. This interruption is somewhat like that on the Mount of Transfiguration (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:33">Luke 9:33</span>) and is characteristic of Peter. Was it the magnificent promise in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:37">Luke 12:37</span> that stirred Peter's impulsiveness? It is certainly more than a literary device of Luke. Peter's question draws out a parabolic reply by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42-48">Luke 12:42-48</span>). </p>
