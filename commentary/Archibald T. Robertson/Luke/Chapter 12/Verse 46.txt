<p><b> Shall cut him asunder </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διχοτομησε</span></span>). An old and somewhat rare word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διχοτομος</span></span> and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διχα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεμνω</span></span>, to cut, to cut in two. Used literally here. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:51">Matthew 24:51</span>.</p>
<p><b>With the unfaithful </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα των απιστων</span></span>). Not here "the unbelieving" though that is a common meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιστος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστος</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθω</span></span>), but the unreliable, the untrustworthy. Here <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:51">Matthew 24:51</span> has "with the hypocrites," the same point. The parallel with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:43-51">Matthew 24:43-51</span> ends here. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:51">Matthew 24:51</span> adds the saying about the wailing and the gnashing of teeth. Clearly there Luke places the parable of the wise steward in this context while Matthew has it in the great eschatological discourse. Once again we must either think that Jesus repeated the parable or that one of the writers has misplaced it. Luke alone preserves what he gives in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:47">Luke 12:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:48">Luke 12:48</span>. </p>
