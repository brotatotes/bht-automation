 Shall cut him asunder  (διχοτομησε). An old and somewhat rare word from διχοτομος and that from διχα and τεμνω, to cut, to cut in two. Used literally here. In the N.T. only here and Matthew 24:51.With the unfaithful  (μετα των απιστων). Not here "the unbelieving" though that is a common meaning of απιστος (α privative and πιστος, from πειθω), but the unreliable, the untrustworthy. Here Matthew 24:51 has "with the hypocrites," the same point. The parallel with Matthew 24:43-51 ends here. Matthew 24:51 adds the saying about the wailing and the gnashing of teeth. Clearly there Luke places the parable of the wise steward in this context while Matthew has it in the great eschatological discourse. Once again we must either think that Jesus repeated the parable or that one of the writers has misplaced it. Luke alone preserves what he gives in verses Luke 12:47; Luke 12:48.
