<p><b> I came to cast fire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πυρ ηλθον βαλειν</span></span>). Suddenly Jesus lets the volcano in his own heart burst forth. The fire was already burning. "Christ came to set the world on fire, and the conflagration had already begun" (Plummer). The very passion in Christ's heart would set his friends on fire and his foes in opposition as we have just seen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:53">Luke 11:53</span>). It is like the saying of Jesus that he came to bring not peace, but a sword, to bring cleavage among men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:34-36">Matthew 10:34-36</span>).</p>
<p><b>And what will I, if it is already kindled? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τ θελω ε ηδη ανηφθη;</span></span>). It is not clear what this passage means. Probably <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span> is be taken in the sense of "how" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πως</span></span>). How I wish. Then <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> can be taken as equal to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>. How I wish that it were already kindled. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ανηφθη</span></span> is first aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπτω</span></span>, to set fire to, to kindle, to make blaze. Probably Luke means the conflagration to come by his death on the Cross for he changes the figure and refers to that more plainly. </p>
