<p><b> I have a baptism </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισμα δε εχω</span></span>). Once again Jesus will call his baptism the baptism of blood and will challenge James and John to it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:32">Mark 10:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:22">Matthew 20:22</span>). So here. "Having used the metaphor of fire, Christ now uses the metaphor of water. The one sets forth the result of his coming as it affects the world, the other as it affects himself. The world is lit up with flames and Christ is bathed in blood" (Plummer).</p>
<p><b>And how I am straitened </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα πως συνεχομα</span></span>). See this same vivid verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεχομα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:37">Luke 8:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:5">Acts 18:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span> where Paul uses it of his desire for death just as Jesus does here. The urge of the Cross is upon Jesus at the moment of these words. We catch a glimpse of the tremendous passion in his soul that drove him on.</p>
<p><b>Till it be accomplished </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως οτου τελεσθη</span></span>). First aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελεω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως οτου</span></span> (until which time), the common construction for the future with this conjunction. </p>
