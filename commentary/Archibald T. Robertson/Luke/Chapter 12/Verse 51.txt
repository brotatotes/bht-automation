<p><b> But rather division </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' η διαμερισμον</span></span>). Peace at any price is not the purpose of Christ. It is a pity for family jars to come, but loyalty to Christ counts more than all else. These ringing words (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:51-53">Luke 12:51-53</span>) occur in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:34-36">Matthew 10:34-36</span> in the address to the Twelve for the Galilean tour. See discussion of details there. These family feuds are inevitable where only part cleave to Christ. In Matthew we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> with the genitive whereas in Luke it is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> with the dative (and accusative once). </p>
