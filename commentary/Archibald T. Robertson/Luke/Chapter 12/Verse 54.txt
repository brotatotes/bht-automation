<p><b> To the multitudes also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τοις οχλοις</span></span>). After the strong and stirring words just before with flash and force Jesus turns finally in this series of discourses to the multitudes again as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:15">Luke 12:15</span>. There are similar sayings to these verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:54-59">Luke 12:54-59</span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:25">Matthew 5:25</span>. There is a good deal of difference in phraseology whether that is due to difference of source or different use of the same source (Q or Logia) we do not know. Not all the old MSS. give <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:2">Matthew 16:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:3">Matthew 16:3</span>. In Matthew the Pharisees and Sadducees were asking for a sign from heaven as they often did. These signs of the weather, "a shower" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομβρος</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:54">Luke 12:54</span>) due to clouds in the west, "a hot wave" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυσων</span></span>, verse 55) due to a south wind (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νοτον</span></span>) blowing, "fair weather" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδια</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:2">Matthew 16:2</span>) when the sky is red, are appealed to today. They have a more or less general application due to atmospheric and climatic conditions. </p>
