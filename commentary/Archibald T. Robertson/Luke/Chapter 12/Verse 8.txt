 Everyone who shall confess me  (πας ος αν ομολογησε εν εμο). Just like Matthew 10:32 except the use of αν here which adds nothing. The Hebraistic use of εν after ομολογεω both here and in Matthew is admitted by even Moulton (Prolegomena, p. 104).The Son of man  (ο υιος του ανθρωπου). Here Matthew 10:32 has κ'αγω (I also) as the equivalent.
