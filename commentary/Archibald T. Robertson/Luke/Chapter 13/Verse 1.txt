 At that very season  (εν αυτω τω καιρω). Luke's frequent idiom, "at the season itself." Apparently in close connexion with the preceding discourses. Probably "were present" (παρησαν, imperfect of παρειμ) means "came," "stepped to his side," as often (Matthew 26:50; Acts 12:20; John 11:28). These people had a piece of news for Jesus.Whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices  (ων το αιμα Πειλατος εμιξεν μετα των θυσιων αυτων). The verb εμιξεν is first aorist active (not past perfect) of μιγνυμ, a common verb. The incident is recorded nowhere else, but is in entire harmony with Pilate's record for outrages. These Galileans at a feast in Jerusalem may have been involved in some insurrection against the Roman government, the leaders of whom Pilate had slain right in the temple courts where the sacrifices were going on. Jesus comments on the incident, but not as the reporters had expected. Instead of denunciation of Pilate he turned it into a parable for their own conduct in the uncertainty of life.
