<p><b> At that very season </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αυτω τω καιρω</span></span>). Luke's frequent idiom, "at the season itself." Apparently in close connexion with the preceding discourses. Probably "were present" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρησαν</span></span>, imperfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρειμ</span></span>) means "came," "stepped to his side," as often (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:50">Matthew 26:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:20">Acts 12:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:28">John 11:28</span>). These people had a piece of news for Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων το αιμα Πειλατος εμιξεν μετα των θυσιων αυτων</span></span>). The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμιξεν</span></span> is first aorist active (not past perfect) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιγνυμ</span></span>, a common verb. The incident is recorded nowhere else, but is in entire harmony with Pilate's record for outrages. These Galileans at a feast in Jerusalem may have been involved in some insurrection against the Roman government, the leaders of whom Pilate had slain right in the temple courts where the sacrifices were going on. Jesus comments on the incident, but not as the reporters had expected. Instead of denunciation of Pilate he turned it into a parable for their own conduct in the uncertainty of life. </p>
