<p><b> Answered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκριθεις</span></span>). First aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκρινομα</span></span>. No one had spoken to him, but he felt his importance as the ruler of the synagogue and was indignant (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγανακτων</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχομα</span></span>, to feel much pain). His words have a ludicrous sound as if all the people had to do to get their crooked backs straightened out was to come round to his synagogue during the week. He forgot that this poor old woman had been coming for eighteen years with no result. He was angry with Jesus, but he spoke to the multitude (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω οχλω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Ought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>). Really, must, necessary, a direct hit at Jesus who had "worked" on the sabbath in healing this old woman.</p>
<p><b>And not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μη</span></span>). Instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ου</span></span>, because in the imperative clause. </p>
