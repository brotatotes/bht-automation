<p><b> He said therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγεν ουν</span></span>). It is not clear to what to refer "therefore," whether to the case of the woman in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:11">Luke 13:11</span>, the enthusiasm of the crowd in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:17">Luke 13:17</span>, or to something not recorded by Luke. </p>
