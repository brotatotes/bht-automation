<p><b> A grain of mustard seed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοκκω σιναπεως</span></span>). Either the <i>sinapis nigra</i> or the <i>salvadora persica</i>, both of which have small seeds and grow to twelve feet at times. The Jews had a proverb: "Small as a mustard seed." Given by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:30-32">Mark 4:30-32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:31">Matthew 13:31</span> in the first great group of parables, but just the sort to be repeated.</p>
<p><b>Cast into his own garden </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβαλεν εις κηπον εαυτου</span></span>). Different from "earth" (Mark) or "field" (Matthew.)" <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κηπος</span></span>, old word for garden, only here in the N.T. and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:1">John 19:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:26">John 19:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:41">John 19:41</span>.</p>
<p><b>Became a tree </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο εις δενδρον</span></span>). Common Hebraism, very frequent in LXX, only in Luke in the N.T., but does appear in <i>Koine</i> though rare in papyri; this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> after words like <i>ginomai</i>. It is a translation Hebraism in Luke.</p>
<p><b>Lodged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεσκηνωσεν</span></span>). Mark and Matthew have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατασκηνοιν</span></span> infinitive of the same verb, to make tent (or nest). </p>
