<p><b> Strive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγωνιζεσθε</span></span>). Jesus makes short shrift of the question. He includes others (present middle plural of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγωνιζομα</span></span>, common verb, our agonize). Originally it was to contend for a prize in the games. The kindred word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγωνια</span></span> occurs of Christ's struggle in Gethsemane (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:44">Luke 22:44</span>). The narrow gate appears also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:13">Matthew 7:13</span>, only there it is an outside gate (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυλης</span></span>) while here it is the entrance to the house, "the narrow door" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυρας</span></span>). </p>
