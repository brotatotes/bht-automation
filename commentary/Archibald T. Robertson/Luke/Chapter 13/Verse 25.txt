 When once  (αφ' ου αν). Possibly to be connected without break with the preceding verse (so Westcott and Hort), though Bruce argues for two parables here, the former (verse Luke 13:24) about being in earnest, while this one (verses Luke 13:25-30) about not being too late. The two points are here undoubtedly. It is an awkward construction, αφ' ου = απο τουτου οτε with αν and the aorist subjunctive (εγερθη and αποκλειση). See Robertson, Grammar, p. 978.Hath shut to  (αποκλειση), first aorist active subjunctive of αποκλειω, old verb, but only here in the N.T. Note effective aorist tense and perfective use of απο, slammed the door fast.And ye begin  (κα αρξησθε). First aorist middle subjunctive of αρχομα with αφ' ου αν like εγερθη and αποκλειση.To stand  (εστανα). Second perfect active infinitive of ιστημ, intransitive tenseand to knock  (κα κρουειν). Present active infinitive, to keep on knocking.Open to us  (ανοιξον ημιν). First aorist active imperative, at once and urgent.He shall say  (ερε). Future active of ειπον (defective verb). This is probably the apodosis of the αφ' ου clause.
