<p><b> Shall ye begin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρξεσθε</span></span>). Future middle, though Westcott and Hort put <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρξησθε</span></span> (aorist middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχομα</span></span>) and in that case a continuation of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφ' ου</span></span> construction. It is a difficult passage and the copyists had trouble with it.</p>
<p><b>In thy presence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωπιον σου</span></span>). As guests or hosts or neighbours some claim, or the master of the house. It is grotesque to claim credit because Christ taught in their streets, but they are hard run for excuses and claims. </p>
