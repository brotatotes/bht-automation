 There  (εκε). Out there, outside the house whence they are driven.When ye shall see  (οταν οψησθε). First aorist middle subjunctive (of a late aorist ωψαμην) of οραω, though οψεσθε (future middle) in margin of Westcott and Hort, unless we admit here a "future" subjunctive like Byzantine Greek (after Latin).And yourselves cast forth without  (υμας δε εκβαλλομενους εξω). Present passive participle, continuous action, "you being cast out" with the door shut. See on Matthew 8:11 for this same picture.
