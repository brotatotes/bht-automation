<p><b> That fox </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη αλωπεκ ταυτη</span></span>). This epithet for the cunning and cowardice of Herod shows clearly that Jesus understood the real attitude and character of the man who had put John the Baptist to death and evidently wanted to get Jesus into his power in spite of his superstitious fears that he might be John the Baptist <i>redivivus</i>. The message of Jesus means that he is independent of the plots and schemes of both Herod and the Pharisees. The preacher is often put in a tight place by politicians who are quite willing to see him shorn of all real power.</p>
<p><b>Cures </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιασεις</span></span>). Old word, but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:22">Acts 4:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:30">Acts 4:30</span>.</p>
<p><b>I am perfected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειουμα</span></span>). Present passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειοω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειος</span></span>, to bring to perfection, frequent in the N.T. Used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span> of the Father's purpose in the humanity of Christ. Perfect humanity is a process and Jesus was passing through that, without sin, but not without temptation and suffering. It is the prophetic present with the sense of the future. </p>
