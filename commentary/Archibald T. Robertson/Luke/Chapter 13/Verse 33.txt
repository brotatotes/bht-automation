<p><b> The day following </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εχομενη</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:15">Acts 20:15</span>. The same as the third day in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:32">Luke 13:32</span>. A proverb.</p>
<p><b>It cannot be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ενδεχετα</span></span>). It is not accepted, it is inadmissible. A severely ironical indictment of Jerusalem. The shadow of the Cross reaches Perea where Jesus now is as he starts toward Jerusalem. </p>
