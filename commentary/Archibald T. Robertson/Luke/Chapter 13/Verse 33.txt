 The day following  (τη εχομενη). See Acts 20:15. The same as the third day in verse Luke 13:32. A proverb.It cannot be  (ουκ ενδεχετα). It is not accepted, it is inadmissible. A severely ironical indictment of Jerusalem. The shadow of the Cross reaches Perea where Jesus now is as he starts toward Jerusalem.
