 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem  (Ιερουσαλημ, Ιερουσαλημ). In Matthew 23:37 Jesus utters a similar lament over Jerusalem. The connection suits both there and here, but Plummer considers it "rather a violent hypothesis" to suppose that Jesus spoke these words twice. It is possible, of course, though not like Luke's usual method, that he put the words here because of the mention of Jerusalem. In itself it is not easy to see why Jesus could not have made the lament both here and in Jerusalem. The language of the apostrophe is almost identical in both places (Luke 13:34; Matthew 23:37-39). For details see on Matthew. In Luke we have επισυναξα (late first aorist active infinitive) and in Matthew επισυναγαγειν (second aorist active infinitive), both from επισυναγω, a double compound of late Greek (Polybius). Both have "How often would I" (ποσακις ηθελησα). How often did I wish. Clearly showing that Jesus made repeated visits to Jerusalem as we know otherwise only from John's Gospel.Even as  (ον τροπον). Accusative of general reference and in Matthew 23:37 also. Incorporation of antecedent into the relative clause.Brood  (νοσσιαν) is in Luke while Matthew haschickens  (νοσσια), both late forms for the older νεοσσια. The adjectivedesolate  (ερημος) is wanting in Luke 13:35 and is doubtful in Matthew 23:39.
