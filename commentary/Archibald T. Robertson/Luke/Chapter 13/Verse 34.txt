<p><b> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιερουσαλημ, Ιερουσαλημ</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:37">Matthew 23:37</span> Jesus utters a similar lament over Jerusalem. The connection suits both there and here, but Plummer considers it "rather a violent hypothesis" to suppose that Jesus spoke these words twice. It is possible, of course, though not like Luke's usual method, that he put the words here because of the mention of Jerusalem. In itself it is not easy to see why Jesus could not have made the lament both here and in Jerusalem. The language of the apostrophe is almost identical in both places (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:34">Luke 13:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:37-39">Matthew 23:37-39</span>). For details see on Matthew. In Luke we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισυναξα</span></span> (late first aorist active infinitive) and in Matthew <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισυναγαγειν</span></span> (second aorist active infinitive), both from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισυναγω</span></span>, a double compound of late Greek (Polybius). Both have "How often would I" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποσακις ηθελησα</span></span>). How often did I wish. Clearly showing that Jesus made repeated visits to Jerusalem as we know otherwise only from John's Gospel.</p>
<p><b>Even as </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον τροπον</span></span>). Accusative of general reference and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:37">Matthew 23:37</span> also. Incorporation of antecedent into the relative clause.</p>
<p><b>Brood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νοσσιαν</span></span>) is in Luke while Matthew has</p>
<p><b>chickens </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νοσσια</span></span>), both late forms for the older <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεοσσια</span></span>. The adjective</p>
<p><b>desolate </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερημος</span></span>) is wanting in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:35">Luke 13:35</span> and is doubtful in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:39">Matthew 23:39</span>. </p>
