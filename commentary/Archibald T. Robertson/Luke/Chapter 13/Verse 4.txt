<p><b> The tower in Siloam </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πυργος εν Σιλωαμ</span></span>). Few sites have been more clearly located than this. Jesus mentions this accident (only in Luke) of his own accord to illustrate still further the responsibility of his hearers. Jesus makes use of public events in both these incidents to teach spiritual lessons. He gives the "moral" to the massacre of the Galilean pilgrims and the "moral" of the catastrophe at Siloam.</p>
<p><b>Offenders </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειλετα</span></span>). Literally,</p>
<p><b>debtors </b>, not sinners as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:2">Luke 13:2</span> and as the Authorized Version renders here. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:41">Luke 7:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:4">Luke 11:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:24-34">Matthew 18:24-34</span>. </p>
