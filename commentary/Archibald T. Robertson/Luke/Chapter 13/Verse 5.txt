<p><b> Except ye repent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη μετανοησητε</span></span>). First aorist active subjunctive, immediate repentance in contrast to continued repentance, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοητε</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:3">Luke 13:3</span>, though Westcott and Hort put <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοητε</span></span> in the margin here. The interpretation of accidents is a difficult matter, but the moral pointed out by Jesus is obvious. </p>
