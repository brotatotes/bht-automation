<p><b> Planted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεφυτευμενην</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυτευω</span></span>, to plant, an old verb, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυτον</span></span>, a plant, and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυω</span></span>, to grow. But this participle with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειχεν</span></span> (imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>) does not make a periphrastic past perfect like our English "had planted." It means rather, he had a fig tree, one already planted in his vineyard. </p>
