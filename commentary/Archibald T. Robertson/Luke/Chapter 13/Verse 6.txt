 Planted  (πεφυτευμενην). Perfect passive participle of φυτευω, to plant, an old verb, from φυτον, a plant, and that from φυω, to grow. But this participle with ειχεν (imperfect active of εχω) does not make a periphrastic past perfect like our English "had planted." It means rather, he had a fig tree, one already planted in his vineyard.
