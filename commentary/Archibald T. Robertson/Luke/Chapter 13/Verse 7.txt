 The vinedresser  (τον αμπελουργον). Old word, but here only in the N.T., from αμπελος, vine, and εργον, work.These three years I come  (τρια ετη αφ' ου ερχομα). Literally, "three years since (from which time) I come." These three years, of course, have nothing to do with the three years of Christ's public ministry. The three years are counted from the time when the fig tree would normally be expected to bear, not from the time of planting. The Jewish nation is meant by this parable of the barren fig tree. In the withering of the barren fig tree later at Jerusalem we see parable changed to object lesson or fact (Mark 11:12-14; Matthew 21:18).Cut it down  (εκκοψον). "Cut it out," the Greek has it, out of the vineyard, perfective use of εκ with the effective aorist active imperative of κοπτω, where we prefer "down."Why?  (ινα τ). Ellipsis here of γενητα of which τ is subject (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 739,916).Also  (κα). Besides bearing no fruit.Doth cumber the ground  (την γην καταργε). Makes the ground completely idle, of no use (κατα, αργεω, from αργος, α privative and εργον, work). Late verb, here only in the N.T. except in Paul's Epistles.
