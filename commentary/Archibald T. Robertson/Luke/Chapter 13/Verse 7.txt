<p><b> The vinedresser </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αμπελουργον</span></span>). Old word, but here only in the N.T., from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμπελος</span></span>, vine, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργον</span></span>, work.</p>
<p><b>These three years I come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρια ετη αφ' ου ερχομα</span></span>). Literally, "three years since (from which time) I come." These three years, of course, have nothing to do with the three years of Christ's public ministry. The three years are counted from the time when the fig tree would normally be expected to bear, not from the time of planting. The Jewish nation is meant by this parable of the barren fig tree. In the withering of the barren fig tree later at Jerusalem we see parable changed to object lesson or fact (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:12-14">Mark 11:12-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:18">Matthew 21:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>Cut it down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκοψον</span></span>). "Cut it out," the Greek has it, out of the vineyard, perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> with the effective aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπτω</span></span>, where we prefer "down."</p>
<p><b>Why? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα τ</span></span>). Ellipsis here of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενητα</span></span> of which <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span> is subject (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 739,916).</p>
<p><b>Also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>). Besides bearing no fruit.</p>
<p><b>Doth cumber the ground </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την γην καταργε</span></span>). Makes the ground completely idle, of no use (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα, αργεω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αργος</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργον</span></span>, work). Late verb, here only in the N.T. except in Paul's Epistles. </p>
