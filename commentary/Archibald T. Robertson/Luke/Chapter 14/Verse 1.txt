<p><b> When he went </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ελθειν αυτον</span></span>). Luke's favourite temporal clause = "on the going as to him."</p>
<p><b>That </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>). Another common Lukan idiom, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">και=οτ</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span>, like Hebrew <i>wav</i>.</p>
<p><b>They </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτο</span></span>). Emphatic.</p>
<p><b>Were watching </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν παρατηρουμενο</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect middle. Note force of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτο</span></span>, middle voice, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα-</span></span>. They were themselves watching on the side (on the sly), watching insidiously, with evil intent as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:2">Mark 3:2</span> (active). </p>
