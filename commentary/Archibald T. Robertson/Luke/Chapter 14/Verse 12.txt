<p><b> A dinner or a supper </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αριστον η δειπνον</span></span>). More exactly, a breakfast or a dinner with distinction between them as already shown. This is a parable for the host as one had just been given for the guests, though Luke does not term this a parable.</p>
<p><b>Call not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη φωνε</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη</span></span> and the present imperative active, prohibiting the habit of inviting only friends. It is the <i>exclusive</i> invitation of such guests that Jesus condemns. There is a striking parallel to this in Plato's <i>Phaedrus</i> 233.</p>
<p><b>Recompense </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανταποδομα</span></span>). In the form of a return invitation. Like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span> in "bid thee again" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντικαλεσωσιν</span></span>). </p>
