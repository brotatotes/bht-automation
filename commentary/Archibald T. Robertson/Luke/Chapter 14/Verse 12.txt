 A dinner or a supper  (αριστον η δειπνον). More exactly, a breakfast or a dinner with distinction between them as already shown. This is a parable for the host as one had just been given for the guests, though Luke does not term this a parable.Call not  (μη φωνε). Μη and the present imperative active, prohibiting the habit of inviting only friends. It is the exclusive invitation of such guests that Jesus condemns. There is a striking parallel to this in Plato's Phaedrus 233.Recompense  (ανταποδομα). In the form of a return invitation. Like αντ in "bid thee again" (αντικαλεσωσιν).
