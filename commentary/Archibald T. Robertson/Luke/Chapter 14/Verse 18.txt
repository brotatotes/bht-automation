<p><b> With one consent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο μιας</span></span>). Some feminine substantive like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωμης</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχης</span></span> has to be supplied. This precise idiom occurs nowhere else. It looked like a conspiracy for each one in his turn did the same thing.</p>
<p><b>To make excuse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραιτεισθα</span></span>). This common Greek verb is used in various ways, to ask something from one (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:6">Mark 15:6</span>), to deprecate or ask to avert (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:19">Hebrews 12:19</span>), to refuse or decline (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:11">Acts 25:11</span>), to shun or to avoid (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:23">2 Timothy 2:23</span>), to beg pardon or to make excuses for not doing or to beg (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:18">Luke 14:18</span>). All these ideas are variations of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτεω</span></span>, to ask in the middle voice with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> in composition.</p>
<p><b>The first </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πρωτος</span></span>). In order of time. There are three of the "many" ("all"), whose excuses are given, each more flimsy than the other.</p>
<p><b>I must needs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω αναγκην</span></span>). I have necessity. The land would still be there, a strange "necessity."</p>
<p><b>Have me excused </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχε με παρηιτημενον</span></span>). An unusual idiom somewhat like the English perfect with the auxiliary "have" and the modern Greek idiom with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>, but certainly not here a Greek periphrasis for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρηιτησο</span></span>. This perfect passive participle is predicate and agrees with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span>. See a like idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:1">Mark 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:19">Luke 12:19</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 902f.). The Latin had a similar idiom, <i>habe me excusatum</i>. Same language in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:19">Luke 14:19</span>. </p>
