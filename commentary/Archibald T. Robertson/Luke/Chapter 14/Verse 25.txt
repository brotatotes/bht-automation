 And he turned  (κα στραφεις). Second aorist passive participle of στρεφω, common verb. It is a dramatic act on the part of Jesus, a deliberate effort to check the wild and unthinking enthusiasm of the crowds who followed just to be following. Note "many multitudes" (οχλο πολλο) and the imperfect tense συνεπορευοντο, were going along with him.
