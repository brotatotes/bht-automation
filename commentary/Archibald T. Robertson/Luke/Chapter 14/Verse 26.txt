<p><b> Hateth not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μισε</span></span>). An old and very strong verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισεω</span></span>, to hate, detest. The orientals use strong language where cooler spirits would speak of preference or indifference. But even so Jesus does not here mean that one must hate his father or mother of necessity or as such, for <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:4">Matthew 15:4</span> proves the opposite. It is only where the element of choice comes in (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:24">Matthew 6:24</span>) as it sometimes does, when father or mother opposes Christ. Then one must not hesitate. The language here is more sharply put than in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:37">Matthew 10:37</span>. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> here coalesces with the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισε</span></span> in this conditional clause of the first class determined as fulfilled. It is the language of exaggerated contrast, it is true, but it must not be watered down till the point is gone. In mentioning "and wife" Jesus has really made a comment on the excuse given in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:20">Luke 14:20</span> (I married a wife and so I am not able to come).</p>
<p><b>And his own life also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετ τε κα την ψυχην εαυτου</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε κα</span></span>, both--and. "The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε</span></span> (B L) binds all the particulars into one bundle of <i>renuncianda</i>" (Bruce). Note this same triple group of conjunctions (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετ τε κα</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:28">Acts 21:28</span>, "And moreover also," "even going as far as his own life." Martyrdom should be an ever-present possibility to the Christian, not to be courted, but not to be shunned. Love for Christ takes precedence "over even the elemental instinct of self-preservation" (Ragg). </p>
