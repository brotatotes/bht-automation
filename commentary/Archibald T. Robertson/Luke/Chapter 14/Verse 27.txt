<p><b> His own cross </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον σταυρον εαυτου</span></span>). This familiar figure we have had already (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:23">Luke 9:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:34">Mark 8:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:38">Matthew 10:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:24">Matthew 16:24</span>). Each follower has a cross which he must bear as Jesus did his. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βασταζω</span></span> is used of cross bearing in the N.T. only here (figuratively) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:17">John 19:17</span> literally of Jesus. Crucifixion was common enough in Palestine since the days of Antiochus Epiphanes and Alexander Jannaeus. </p>
