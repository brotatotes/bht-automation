<p><b> Build a tower </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυργον οικοδομησα</span></span>). A common metaphor, either a tower in the city wall like that by the Pool of Siloam (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:4">Luke 13:4</span>) or a watchtower in a vineyard (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:33">Matthew 21:33</span>) or a tower-shaped building for refuge or ornament as here. This parable of the rash builder has the lesson of counting the cost.</p>
<p><b>Sit down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθισας</span></span>). Attitude of deliberation.</p>
<p><b>First </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτον</span></span>). First things first. So in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:31">Luke 14:31</span>.</p>
<p><b>Count </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψηφιζε</span></span>). Common verb in late writers, but only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:18">Revelation 13:18</span> in the N.T. The verb is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψηφος</span></span>, a stone, which was used in voting and so counting. Calculate is from the Latin <i>calculus</i>, a pebble. To vote was to cast a pebble (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ ψηφον</span></span>). Luke has Paul using "deposit a pebble" for casting his vote (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>).</p>
<p><b>The cost </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την δαπανην</span></span>). Old and common word, but here only in the N.T. from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαπτω</span></span>, to tear, consume, devour. Expense is something which eats up one's resources.</p>
<p><b>Whether he hath wherewith to complete it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε εχε εις απαρτισμον</span></span>). If he has anything for completion of it. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Απαρτισμον</span></span> is a rare and late word (in the papyri and only here in the N.T.). It is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαρτιζω</span></span>, to finish off (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ-</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτιζω</span></span> like our articulate), to make even or square. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηρτισμενος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:17">2 Timothy 3:17</span>. </p>
