 Or else  (ε δε μηγε). Same idiom in Luke 5:36. Luke is fond of this formula.An ambassage  (πρεσβειαν). Old and common word for the office of ambassador, composed of old men (πρεσβεις) like Japanese Elder Statesmen who are supposed to possess wisdom. In the N.T. only here and Luke 19:14.Asketh conditions of peace  (ερωτα προς ειρηνην). The use of ερωταω in this sense of beg or petition is common in the papyri and Koine generally. The original use of asking a question survives also. The text is uncertain concerning προς ειρηνην which means with ερωταω, to ask negotiations for peace. In B we have εις instead of προς like verse Luke 14:28. Most MSS. have τα before προς or εις, but not in Aleph and B. It is possible that the τα was omitted because of preceding τα (ομοεοτελευτον), but the sense is the same. See Romans 14:19 τα της ειρηνης, the things of peace, which concern or look towards peace, the preliminaries of peace.
