<p><b> Renounceth not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ αποτασσετα</span></span>). Old Greek word to set apart as in a military camp, then in the middle voice to separate oneself from, say good-bye to (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:61">Luke 9:61</span>), to renounce, forsake, as here.</p>
<p><b>All that he hath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασιν τοις εαυτου υπαρχουσιν</span></span>). Dative case, says good-bye to all his property, "all his own belongings" (neuter plural participle used as substantive) as named in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:26">Luke 14:26</span>. This verse gives the principle in the two parables of the rash builder and of the rash king. The minor details do not matter. The spirit of self-sacrifice is the point. </p>
