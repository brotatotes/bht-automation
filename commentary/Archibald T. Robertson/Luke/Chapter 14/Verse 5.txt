 An ass or an ox  (ονος η βους). But Westcott and Hort υιος η βους ( a son or an ox ). The manuscripts are much divided between υιος (son) and ονος (ass) which in the abbreviated uncials looked much alike (TC, OC) and were much alike. The sentence in the Greek reads literally thus: Whose ox or ass of you shall fall (πεσειτα, future middle of πιπτο) into a well and he (the man) will not straightway draw him up (ανασπασε, future active of ανασπαω) on the sabbath day? The very form of the question is a powerful argument and puts the lawyers and the Pharisees hopelessly on the defensive.
