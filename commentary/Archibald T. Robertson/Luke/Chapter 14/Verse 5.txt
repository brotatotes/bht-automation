<p><b> An ass or an ox </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονος η βους</span></span>). But Westcott and Hort <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος η βους</span></span> (<b> a son or an ox </b>). The manuscripts are much divided between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος</span></span> (son) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονος</span></span> (ass) which in the abbreviated uncials looked much alike (TC, OC) and were much alike. The sentence in the Greek reads literally thus: Whose ox or ass of you shall fall (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεσειτα</span></span>, future middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιπτο</span></span>) into a well and he (the man) will not straightway draw him up (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανασπασε</span></span>, future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανασπαω</span></span>) on the sabbath day? The very form of the question is a powerful argument and puts the lawyers and the Pharisees hopelessly on the defensive. </p>
