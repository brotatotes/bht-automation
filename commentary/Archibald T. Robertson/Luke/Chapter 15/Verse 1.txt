<p><b> All the publicans and sinners </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντες ο τελωνα κα ο αμαρτωλο</span></span>). The two articles separate the two classes (all the publicans and the sinners). They are sometimes grouped together (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:30">Luke 5:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:11">Matthew 9:11</span>), but not here. The publicans are put on the same level with the outcasts or sinners. So in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:2">Luke 15:2</span> the repeated article separates Pharisees and scribes as not quite one. The use of "all" here may be hyperbole for very many or the reference may be to these two classes in the particular place where Jesus was from time to time.</p>
<p><b>Were drawing near unto him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν αυτω εγγιζοντες</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγγιζω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγγυς</span></span> (near), late verb.</p>
<p><b>For to hear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουειν</span></span>). Just the present active infinitive of purpose. </p>
