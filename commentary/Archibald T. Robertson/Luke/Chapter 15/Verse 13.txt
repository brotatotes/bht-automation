<p><b> Not many days after </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετ' ου πολλας ημερας</span></span>). Literally, after not many days. Luke is fond of this idiom (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:6">Luke 7:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:5">Acts 1:5</span>).</p>
<p><b>Took his journey </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεδημησεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδημεω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδημος</span></span>, away from home). Common verb. In the N.T. here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:33">Matthew 21:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:14">Matthew 25:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:1">Mark 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:9">Luke 20:9</span>. He burned all his bridges behind him, gathering together all that he had.</p>
<p><b>Wasted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεσκορπισεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διασκορπιζω</span></span>, a somewhat rare verb, the very opposite of "gathered together" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγογων</span></span>). More exactly he scattered his property. It is the word used of winnowing grain (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:24">Matthew 25:24</span>).</p>
<p><b>With riotous living </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζων ασωτως</span></span>). Living dissolutely or profligately. The late adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασωτως</span></span> (only here in the N.T.) from the common adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασωτος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωζω</span></span>), one that cannot be saved, one who does not save, a spendthrift, an abandoned man, a profligate, a prodigal. He went the limit of sinful excesses. It makes sense taken actively or passively (<i>prodigus</i> or <i>perditus</i>), active probably here. </p>
