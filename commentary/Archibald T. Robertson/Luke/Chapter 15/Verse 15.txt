 Joined himself  (εκολληθη). First aorist passive of κολλαω, an old verb to glue together, to cleave to. In the N.T. only the passive occurs. He was glued to, was joined to. It is not necessary to take this passive in the middle reflexive sense.The citizens  (των πολιτων). Curiously enough this common word citizen (πολιτης from πολις, city) is found in the N.T. only in Luke's writings (Luke 15:15; Luke 19:14; Acts 21:39) except in Hebrews 8:11 where it is quoted from Jeremiah 38:34.To feed swine  (βοσκειν χοιρους). A most degrading occupation for anyone and for a Jew an unspeakable degradation.
