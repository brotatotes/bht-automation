The use of "many" here suggests a wealthy and luxurious home.Have bread enough and to spare  (περισσευοντα αρτων). Old verb from περισσος and that from περ (around). Present passive here, "are surrounded by loaves" like a flood.I perish  (εγω δε λιμω ωδε απολλυμα). Every word here counts: While I on the other hand am here perishing with hunger. It is the linear present middle of απολλυμ. Note εγω expressed and δε of contrast.
