<p><b> But when he came to himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις εαυτον δε ελθων</span></span>). As if he had been far from himself as he was from home. As a matter of fact he had been away, out of his head, and now began to see things as they really were. Plato is quoted by Ackerman (<i>Christian Element in Plato</i>) as thinking of redemption as coming to oneself.</p>
<p><b>Hired servants </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθιο</span></span>). A late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθος</span></span> (hire). In the N.T. only in this chapter. The use of "many" here suggests a wealthy and luxurious home.</p>
<p><b>Have bread enough and to spare </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσευοντα αρτων</span></span>). Old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσος</span></span> and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span> (around). Present passive here, "are surrounded by loaves" like a flood.</p>
<p><b>I perish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω δε λιμω ωδε απολλυμα</span></span>). Every word here counts: While I on the other hand am here perishing with hunger. It is the linear present middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολλυμ</span></span>. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω</span></span> expressed and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> of contrast. </p>
