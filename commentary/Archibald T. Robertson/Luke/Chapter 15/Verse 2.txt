<p><b> Both ... and </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε ... κα</span></span>). United in the complaint.</p>
<p><b>Murmured </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεγογγυζον</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαγογγυζω</span></span>, late Greek compound in the LXX and Byzantine writers. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:7">Luke 19:7</span>. The force of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> here is probably between or among themselves. It spread (imperfect tense) whenever these two classes came in contact with Jesus. As the publicans and the sinners were drawing near to Jesus just in that proportion the Pharisees and the scribes increased their murmurings. The social breach is here an open yawning chasm.</p>
<p><b>This man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>). A contemptuous sneer in the use of the pronoun. They spoke out openly and probably pointed at Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Receiveth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσδεχετα</span></span>). Present middle indicative of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσδεχομα</span></span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:36">Luke 12:36</span> we had it for expecting, here it is to give access to oneself, to welcome like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεδεξατο</span></span> of Martha's welcome to Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:38">Luke 10:38</span>). The charge here is that this is the habit of Jesus. He shows no sense of social superiority to these outcasts (like the Hindu "untouchables" in India).</p>
<p><b>And eateth with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα συνεσθιε αυτοις</span></span>). Associative instrumental case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοις</span></span>) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν-</span></span> in composition. This is an old charge (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:30">Luke 5:30</span>) and a much more serious breach from the standpoint of the Pharisees. The implication is that Jesus prefers these outcasts to the respectable classes (the Pharisees and the scribes) because he is like them in character and tastes, even with the harlots. There was a sting in the charge that he was the "friend" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλος</span></span>) of publicans and sinners (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:34">Luke 7:34</span>). </p>
