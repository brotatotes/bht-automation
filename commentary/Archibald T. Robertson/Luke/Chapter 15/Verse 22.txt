<p><b> The best robe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στολην την πρωτην</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Στολη</span></span> is an old word for a fine stately garment that comes down to the feet (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στελλο</span></span>, to prepare, equip), the kind worn by kings (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:5">Mark 16:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:46">Luke 22:46</span>). Literally, "a robe the first." But not the first that you find, but the first in rank and value, the finest in the house. This in contrast with his shabby clothes.</p>
<p><b>A ring </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δακτυλιον</span></span>). Common in classical writers and the LXX, but here only in the N.T. From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δακτυλος</span></span>, finger. See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρυσοδακτυλιος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:2">James 2:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>Shoes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποδηματα</span></span>). Sandals, "bound under." Both sandals and ring are marks of the freeman as slaves were barefooted. </p>
