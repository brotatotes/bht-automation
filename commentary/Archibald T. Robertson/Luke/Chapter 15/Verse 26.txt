<p><b> Servants </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδων</span></span>). Not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλο</span></span> (bondslaves) as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:22">Luke 15:22</span>. The Greeks often used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παις</span></span> for servant like the Latin <i>puer</i>. It could be either a hired servant (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθιος</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:17">Luke 15:17</span>) or slave (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>He inquired </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επυνθανετο</span></span>). Imperfect middle, inquired repeatedly and eagerly.</p>
<p><b>What these things might be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ αν ειη ταυτα</span></span>). Not "poor" Greek as Easton holds, but simply the form of the direct question retained in the indirect. See the direct form as the apodosis of a condition of the fourth class in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:17">Acts 10:17</span> we have the construction with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν ειη</span></span> of the direct retained in the indirect question. So also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:62">Luke 1:62</span>: See Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1044. </p>
