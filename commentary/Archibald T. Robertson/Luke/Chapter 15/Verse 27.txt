<p><b> Is come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκε</span></span>). Present indicative active, but a stem with perfect sense, old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκω</span></span> retaining this use after perfect tenses came into use (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 893).</p>
<p><b>Hath killed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθυσεν</span></span>). Aorist active indicative and literally means,</p>
<p><b>did kill </b>. Difficult to handle in English for our tenses do not correspond with the Greek.</p>
<p><b>Hath received </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απελαβεν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative with similar difficulty of translation. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> in compositions, like <i>re-</i> in "receive," hath gotten him back (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ-</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Safe and sound </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υγιαινοντα</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υγιαινω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υγιης</span></span>, to be in good health. In spite of all that he has gone through and in spite of the father's fears. </p>
