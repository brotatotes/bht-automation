<p><b> This parable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την παραβολην ταυτην</span></span>). The Parable of the Lost Sheep (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:3-7">Luke 15:3-7</span>). This is Christ's way of answering the cavilling of these chronic complainers. Jesus gave this same parable for another purpose in another connection (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:12-14">Matthew 18:12-14</span>). The figure of the Good Shepherd appears also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1-18">John 10:1-18</span>. "No simile has taken more hold upon the mind of Christendom" (Plummer). Jesus champions the lost and accepts the challenge and justifies his conduct by these superb stories. "The three Episodes form a climax: The Pasture--the House--the Home; the Herdsman--the Housewife--the Father; the Sheep--the Treasure--the Beloved Son" (Ragg). </p>
