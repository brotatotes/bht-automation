<p><b> This thy son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο υιος σου ουτος</span></span>). Contempt and sarcasm. He does not say: "This my brother."</p>
<p><b>Came </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλθεν</span></span>). He does not even say, came back or came home.</p>
<p><b>Devoured </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταφαγων</span></span>). We say, "eaten up," but the Greek has, "eaten down" (perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα-</span></span>). Suggested by the feasting going on.</p>
<p><b>With harlots </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα πορνων</span></span>). This may be true (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:13">Luke 15:13</span>), but the elder son did not know it to be true. He may reflect what he would have done in like case. </p>
