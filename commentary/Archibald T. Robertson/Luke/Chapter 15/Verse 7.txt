<p><b> Over one sinner that repenteth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ εν αμαρτωλω μετανοουντ</span></span>). The word sinner points to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:1">Luke 15:1</span>. Repenting is what these sinners were doing, these lost sheep brought to the fold. The joy in heaven is in contrast with the grumbling Pharisees and scribes.</p>
<p><b>More than over </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η επ</span></span>). There is no comparative in the Greek. It is only implied by a common idiom like our "rather than."</p>
<p><b>Which need no repentance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιτινες ου χρειαν εχουσιν μετανοιας</span></span>). Jesus does not mean to say that the Pharisees and the scribes do not need repentance or are perfect. He for the sake of argument accepts their claims about themselves and by their own words condemns them for their criticism of his efforts to save the lost sheep. It is the same point that he made against them when they criticized Jesus and the disciples for being at Levi's feast (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:31">Luke 5:31</span>). They posed as "righteous." Very well, then. That shuts their mouths on the point of Christ's saving the publicans and sinners. </p>
