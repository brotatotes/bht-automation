<p><b> Ten pieces of silver </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δραχμας δεκα</span></span>). The only instance in the N.T. of this old word for a coin of 65.5 grains about the value of the common <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δηναριυς</span></span> (about eighteen cents), a quarter of a Jewish shekel. The double drachma (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδραχμον</span></span>) occurs in the N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:24">Matthew 17:24</span>. The root is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δρασσομα</span></span>, to grasp with the hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:19">1 Corinthians 3:19</span>), and so a handful of coin. Ten drachmas would be equal to nearly two dollars, but in purchasing power much more.</p>
<p><b>Sweep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρο</span></span>). A late colloquial verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαροω</span></span> for the earlier <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαιρω</span></span>, to clear by sweeping. Three times in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:25">Luke 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:8">Luke 15:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:44">Matthew 12:44</span>). The house was probably with out windows (only the door for light and hence the lamp lit) and probably also a dirt floor. Hence Bengel says: <i>non sine pulvere</i>. This parable is peculiar to Luke. </p>
