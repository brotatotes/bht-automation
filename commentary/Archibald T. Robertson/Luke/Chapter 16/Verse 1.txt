<p><b> Unto the disciples </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα προς τους μαθητας</span></span>). The three preceding parables in chapter 15 exposed the special faults of the Pharisees, "their hard exclusiveness, self-righteousness, and contempt for others" (Plummer). This parable is given by Luke alone. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> (also) is not translated in the Revised Version. It seems to mean that at this same time, after speaking to the Pharisees (chapter 15), Jesus proceeds to speak a parable to the disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:1-13">Luke 16:1-13</span>), the parable of the Unjust Steward. It is a hard parable to explain, but Jesus opens the door by the key in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:9">Luke 16:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>Which had a steward </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος ηιχεν οικονομον</span></span>). Imperfect active, continued to have. Steward is house-manager or overseer of an estate as already seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42">Luke 12:42</span>.</p>
<p><b>Was accused </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεβληθη</span></span>). First aorist indicative passive, of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαβαλλω</span></span>, an old verb, but here only in the N.T. It means to throw across or back and forth, rocks or words and so to slander by gossip. The word implies malice even if the thing said is true. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαβολος</span></span> (slanderer) is this same root and it is used even of women, she-devils (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:11">1 Timothy 3:11</span>).</p>
<p><b>That he was wasting </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως διασκορπιζων</span></span>). For the verb see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:13">Luke 15:13</span>. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> with the participle is a fine Greek idiom for giving the alleged ground of a charge against one.</p>
<p><b>His goods </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα υπαρχοντα αυτου</span></span>). "His belongings," a Lukan idiom. </p>
