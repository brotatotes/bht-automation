 Faithful in the unrighteous mammon  (εν τω αδικω μαμωνα). In the use of what is considered "unrighteous" as it so often is. Condition of the first class, "if ye did not prove to be" (ε ουκ εγενεσθε). Failure here forfeits confidence in "the true riches" (το αληθινον). There is no sadder story than to see a preacher go down by the wrong use of money, caught in this snare of the devil.
