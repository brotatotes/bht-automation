<p><b> Faithful in the unrighteous mammon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω αδικω μαμωνα</span></span>). In the use of what is considered "unrighteous" as it so often is. Condition of the first class, "if ye did not prove to be" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε ουκ εγενεσθε</span></span>). Failure here forfeits confidence in "the true riches" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το αληθινον</span></span>). There is no sadder story than to see a preacher go down by the wrong use of money, caught in this snare of the devil. </p>
