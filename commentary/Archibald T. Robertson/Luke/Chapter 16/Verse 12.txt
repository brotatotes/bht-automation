 That which is your own  (το υμετερον). But Westcott and Hort read το ημετερον (our own) because of B L Origen. The difference is due to itacism in the pronunciation of υ- and η alike (long). But the point in the passage calls for "yours" as correct. Earthly wealth is ours as a loan, a trust, withdrawn at any moment. It belongs to another (εν τω αλλοτριω). If you did not prove faithful in this, who will give you what is really yours forever? Compare "rich toward God" (Luke 12:21).
