<p><b> That which is your own </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το υμετερον</span></span>). But Westcott and Hort read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ημετερον</span></span> (our own) because of B L Origen. The difference is due to itacism in the pronunciation of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υ-</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span> alike (long). But the point in the passage calls for "yours" as correct. Earthly wealth is ours as a loan, a trust, withdrawn at any moment. It belongs to another (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω αλλοτριω</span></span>). If you did not prove faithful in this, who will give you what is really yours forever? Compare "rich toward God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:21">Luke 12:21</span>). </p>
