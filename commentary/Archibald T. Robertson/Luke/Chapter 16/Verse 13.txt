<p><b> Servant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικετης</span></span>). Household (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικος</span></span>) servant. This is the only addition to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:24">Matthew 6:24</span> where otherwise the language is precisely the same, which see. Either Matthew or Luke has put the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογιον</span></span> in the wrong place or Jesus spoke it twice. It suits perfectly each context. There is no real reason for objecting to repetition of favourite sayings by Jesus. </p>
