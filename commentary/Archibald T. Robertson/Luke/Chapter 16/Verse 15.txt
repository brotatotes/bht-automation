<p><b> That justify yourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δικαιουντες εαυτους</span></span>). They were past-masters at that and were doing it now by upturned noses.</p>
<p><b>An abomination in the sight of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βδελυγμα ενωπιον του θεου</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:15">Matthew 24:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:14">Mark 13:14</span> for this LXX word for a detestable thing as when Antiochus Epiphanes set up an altar to Zeus in place of that to Jehovah. There is withering scorn in the use of this phrase by Jesus to these pious pretenders. </p>
