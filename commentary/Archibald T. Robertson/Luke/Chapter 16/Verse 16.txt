<p><b> Entereth violently into it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις αυτην βιαζετα</span></span>). A corresponding saying occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:12">Matthew 11:12</span> in a very different context. In both the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιαζετα</span></span>, occurs also, but nowhere else in the N.T. It is present middle here and can be middle or passive in Matthew, which see. It is rare in late prose. Deissmann (<i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 258) cites an inscription where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιαζομα</span></span> is reflexive middle and used absolutely. Here the meaning clearly is that everyone forces his way into the kingdom of God, a plea for moral enthusiasm and spiritual passion and energy that some today affect to despise. </p>
