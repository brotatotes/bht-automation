<p><b> What is this that I hear? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ τουτο ακουω;</span></span>). There are several ways of understanding this terse Greek idiom. The Revised Version (above) takes <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span> to be equal to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ εστιν τουτο ο ακουω</span></span>; That is a possible use of the predicate <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο</span></span>. Another way is to take <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span> to be exclamatory, which is less likely. Still another view is that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span> is " Why": "Why do I hear this about thee?" See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:15">Acts 14:15</span> where that is the idiom employed.</p>
<p><b>Render </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδος</span></span>). Second aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδιδωμ</span></span>, Give back (and at once).</p>
<p><b>The account </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον λογον</span></span>). The reckoning or report. Common use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Stewardship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικονομιας</span></span>). Same root as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικονομος</span></span> (steward). This demand does not necessarily mean dismissal if investigation proved him innocent of the charges. But the reason given implies that he is to be dismissed:</p>
<p><b>Thou canst no longer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γαρ δυνη</span></span>). </p>
