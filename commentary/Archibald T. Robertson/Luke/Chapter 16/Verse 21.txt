<p><b> With the crumbs that fell </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο των πιπτοντων</span></span>). From the things that fell from time to time. The language reminds one of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:16">Luke 15:16</span> (the prodigal son) and the Syro-Phoenician woman (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:28">Mark 7:28</span>). Only it does not follow that this beggar did not get the scraps from the rich man's table. Probably he did, though nothing more. Even the wild street dogs would get them also.</p>
<p><b>Yea, even the dogs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα κα ο κυνες</span></span>). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα κα</span></span> see also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:7">Luke 12:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:22">Luke 24:22</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αλλα</span></span> can mean "yea," though it often means "but." Here it depends on how one construes Luke's meaning. If he means that he was dependent on casual scraps and it was so bad that even the wild dogs moreover were his companions in misery, the climax came that he was able to drive away the dogs. The other view is that his hunger was unsatisfied, but even the dogs increased his misery.</p>
<p><b>Licked his sores </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επελειχον τα ελκη αυτου</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιλειχω</span></span>, a late vernacular <i>Koine</i> verb, to lick over the surface. It is not clear whether the licking of the sores by the dogs added to the misery of Lazarus or gave a measure of comfort, as he lay in his helpless condition. "Furrer speaks of witnessing dogs and lepers waiting together for the refuse" (Bruce). It was a scramble between the dogs and Lazarus. </p>
