<p><b> Was borne </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απενεχθηνα</span></span>). First aorist passive infinitive from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποφερω</span></span>, a common compound defective verb. The accusative case of general reference (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον</span></span>) is common with the infinitive in such clauses after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span>, like indirect discourse. It is his soul, of course, that was so borne by the angels, not his body.</p>
<p><b>Into Abraham's bosom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον ολπον Αβρααμ</span></span>). To be in Abraham's bosom is to the Jew to be in Paradise. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span> the Logos is in the bosom of the Father. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are in heaven and welcome those who come (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:11">Matthew 8:11</span>; 4Macc. 14:17). The beloved disciple reclined on the bosom of Jesus at the last passover (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:23">John 13:23</span>) and this fact indicates special favour. So the welcome to Lazarus was unusual.</p>
<p><b>Was buried </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εταφη</span></span>). Second aorist (effective) passive of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαπτω</span></span>. Apparently in contrast with the angelic visitation to the beggar. </p>
