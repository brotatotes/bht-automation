<p><b> Neither will they be persuaded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδ' πεισθησοντα</span></span>). First future passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθω</span></span>. Gressmann calls attention to the fact that Jesus is saying this in the conclusion of the parable. It is a sharp discouragement against efforts today to communicate with the dead. "Saul was not led to repentance when he saw Samuel at Endor nor were the Pharisees when they saw Lazarus come forth from the tomb. The Pharisees tried to put Lazarus to death and to explain away the resurrection of Jesus" (Plummer). Alford comments on the curious fact that Lazarus was the name of the one who did rise from the dead but whose return from the dead "was the immediate exciting cause of their (Pharisees) crowning act of unbelief." </p>
