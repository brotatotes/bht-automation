<p><b> His lord commended </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επηινεσεν ο κυριος</span></span>). The steward's lord praised him though he himself had been wronged again (see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:1">Luke 16:1</span> "wasting his goods").</p>
<p><b>The unrighteous steward </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον οικονομον της αδικιας</span></span>). Literally, the steward of unrighteousness. The genitive is the case of genus, species, the steward distinguished by unrighteousness as his characteristic. See "the mammon of unrighteousness" in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:9">Luke 16:9</span>. See "the forgetful hearer" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:25">James 1:25</span>. It is a vernacular idiom common to Hebrew, Aramaic, and the <i>Koine</i>.</p>
<p><b>Wisely </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρονιμως</span></span>). An old adverb, though here alone in the N.T. But the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρονιμος</span></span> from which it comes occurs a dozen times as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:16">Matthew 10:16</span>. It is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρονεω</span></span> and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρην</span></span>, the mind (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:20">1 Corinthians 14:20</span>), the discerning intellect. Perhaps "shrewdly" or "discreetly" is better here than "wisely." The lord does not absolve the steward from guilt and he was apparently dismissed from his service. His shrewdness consisted in finding a place to go by his shrewdness. He remained the steward of unrighteousness even though his shrewdness was commended.</p>
<p><b>For </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). Probably by this second <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> Jesus means to say that he cites this example of shrewdness because it illustrates the point. "This is the moral of the whole parable. Men of the world in their dealings with men like themselves are more prudent than the children of light in their intercourse with one another" (Plummer). We all know how stupid Christians can be in their co-operative work in the kingdom of God, to go no further.</p>
<p><b>Wiser than </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρονιμωτερο υπερ</span></span>). Shrewder beyond, a common Greek idiom. </p>
