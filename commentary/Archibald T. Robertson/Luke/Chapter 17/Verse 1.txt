<p><b> It is impossible </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανενδεκτον εστιν</span></span>). See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ενδεχετα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:33">Luke 13:33</span>. Alpha privative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν-</span></span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδεκτος</span></span>, verbal adjective, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδεχομα</span></span>. The word occurs only in late Greek and only here in the N.T. The meaning is inadmissible, unallowable.</p>
<p><b>But that occasions of stumbling should come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του τα σκανδαλα μη ελθειν</span></span>). This genitive articular infinitive is not easy to explain. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:25">Acts 10:25</span> there is another example where the genitive articular infinitive seems to be used as a nominative (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1040). The loose Hebrew infinitive construction may have a bearing here, but one may recall that the original infinitives were either locatives (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-εν</span></span>) or datives (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-α</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τα σκανδαλα</span></span> is simply the accusative of general reference. Literally, the not coming as to occasions of stumbling. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκανδαλον</span></span> (a trap) see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29">Matthew 5:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:23">Matthew 16:23</span>. It is here only in Luke. The positive form of this saying appears in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:7">Matthew 18:7</span>, which see. </p>
