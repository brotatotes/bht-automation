 Unprofitable  (αχρειο). The Syriac Sinaitic omits "unprofitable." The word is common in Greek literature, but in the N.T. only here and Matthew 25:30 where it means "useless" (α privative and χρειος from χραομα, to use). The slave who only does what he is commanded by his master to do has gained no merit or credit. "In point of fact it is not commands, but demands we have to deal with, arising out of special emergencies" (Bruce). The slavish spirit gains no promotion in business life or in the kingdom of God.
