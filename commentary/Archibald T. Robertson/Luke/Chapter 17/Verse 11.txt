<p><b> Through the midst of Samaria and Galilee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια μεσον Σαμαριας κα Γαλιλαιας</span></span>). This is the only instance in the N.T. of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> with the accusative in the local sense of "through." Xenophon and Plato use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια μεσου</span></span> (genitive). Jesus was going from Ephraim (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:54">John 11:54</span>) north through the midst of Samaria and Galilee so as to cross over the Jordan near Bethshean and join the Galilean caravan down through Perea to Jerusalem. The Samaritans did not object to people going north away from Jerusalem, but did not like to see them going south towards the city (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51-56">Luke 9:51-56</span>). </p>
