<p><b> It were well for him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυσιτελε αυτω</span></span>). An old word, but only here in the N.T., from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυσιτελης</span></span> and this from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυω</span></span>, to pay, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα τελη</span></span>, the taxes. So it pays the taxes, it returns expenses, it is profitable. Literally here, "It is profitable for him" (dative case, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span>). Matthew has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφερε</span></span> (it is advantageous, bears together for).</p>
<p><b>If a millstone were hanged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε λιθος μυλικος περικειτα</span></span>). Literally, "if a millstone is hanged." Present passive indicative from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περικειμα</span></span> (to lie or be placed around). It is used as a perfect passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιτιθημ</span></span>. So it is a first-class condition, determined as fulfilled, not second-class as the English translations imply. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μυλικος</span></span> is simply a stone (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθος</span></span>), belonging to a mill. Here only in the text of Westcott and Hort, not in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:42">Mark 9:42</span> which is like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:6">Matthew 18:6</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυλος ονικος</span></span> where the upper millstone is turned by an ass, which see.</p>
<p><b>Were thrown </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερριπτα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ριπτω</span></span>, old verb. Literally, is thrown or has been thrown or cast or hurled. Mark has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεβλητα</span></span> and Matthew <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταποντισθη</span></span>, which see, all three verbs vivid and expressive. Rather than (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span>). The comparative is not here expressed before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span> as one would expect. It is implied in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυσιτελε</span></span>. See the same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:7">Luke 15:7</span>. </p>
