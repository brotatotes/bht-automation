<p><b> With observation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα παρατησεως</span></span>). Late Greek word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρατηρεω</span></span>, to watch closely. Only here in the N.T. Medical writers use it of watching the symptoms of disease. It is used also of close astronomical observations. But close watching of external phenomena will not reveal the signs of the kingdom of God. </p>
