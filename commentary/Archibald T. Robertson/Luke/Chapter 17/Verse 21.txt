<p><b> Within you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντος υμων</span></span>). This is the obvious, and, as I think, the necessary meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντος</span></span>. The examples cited of the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντος</span></span> in Xenophon and Plato where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντος</span></span> means "among" do not bear that out when investigated. Field (<i>Ot. Norv</i>.) "contends that there is no clear instance of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντος</span></span> in the sense of among" (Bruce), and rightly so. What Jesus says to the Pharisees is that they, as others, are to look for the kingdom of God within themselves, not in outward displays and supernatural manifestations. It is not a localized display "Here" or "There." It is in this sense that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:20">Luke 11:20</span> Jesus spoke of the kingdom of God as "come upon you" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφθασεν εφ' υμας</span></span>), speaking to Pharisees. The only other instance of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντος</span></span> in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:26">Matthew 23:26</span>) necessarily means "within" ("the inside of the cup"). There is, beside, the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντος</span></span> meaning "within" in the Oxyrhynchus Papyrus saying of Jesus of the Third Century (Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 426) which is interesting: "The kingdom of heaven is within you" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντος υμων</span></span> as here in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:21">Luke 17:21</span>). </p>
