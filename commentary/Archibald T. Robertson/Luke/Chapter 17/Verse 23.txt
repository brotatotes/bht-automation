 Go not away nor follow after them  (μη απελθητε μηδε διωξητε). Westcott and Hort bracket απελθητε μηδε. Note aorist subjunctive with μη in prohibition, ingressive aorist. Do not rush after those who set times and places for the second advent. The Messiah was already present in the first advent (verse Luke 17:21) though the Pharisees did not know it.
