<p><b> They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησθιον, επινον, εγαμουν, εγαμιζοντο</span></span>). Imperfects all of them vividly picturing the life of the time of Noah. But the other tenses are aorists (Noah entered <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισηλθεν</span></span>, the flood came <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλθεν</span></span>, destroyed <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απωλεσεν</span></span>). </p>
