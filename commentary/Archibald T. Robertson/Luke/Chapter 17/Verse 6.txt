<p><b> If ye have </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε εχετε</span></span>). Condition of the first class, assumed to be true.</p>
<p><b>Ye would say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγετε αν</span></span>). Imperfect active with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and so a conclusion (apodosis) of the second class, determined as unfulfilled, a mixed condition therefore.</p>
<p><b>Sycamine tree </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συκαμινω</span></span>). At the present time both the black mulberry (sycamine) and the white mulberry (sycamore) exist in Palestine. Luke alone in the N.T. uses either word, the sycamine here, the sycamore in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:4">Luke 19:4</span>. The distinction is not observed in the LXX, but it is observed in the late Greek medical writers for both trees have medicinal properties. Hence it may be assumed that Luke, as a physician, makes the distinction. Both trees differ from the English sycamore. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:20">Matthew 17:20</span> we have "mountain" in place of "sycamine tree."</p>
<p><b>Be thou rooted up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκριζωθητ</span></span>). First aorist passive imperative as is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυτευθητ</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Would have obeyed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπηκουσεν αν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span>, apodosis of a second-class condition (note aorist tense here, imperfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγετε</span></span>). </p>
