 If ye have  (ε εχετε). Condition of the first class, assumed to be true.Ye would say  (ελεγετε αν). Imperfect active with αν and so a conclusion (apodosis) of the second class, determined as unfulfilled, a mixed condition therefore.Sycamine tree  (συκαμινω). At the present time both the black mulberry (sycamine) and the white mulberry (sycamore) exist in Palestine. Luke alone in the N.T. uses either word, the sycamine here, the sycamore in Luke 19:4. The distinction is not observed in the LXX, but it is observed in the late Greek medical writers for both trees have medicinal properties. Hence it may be assumed that Luke, as a physician, makes the distinction. Both trees differ from the English sycamore. In Matthew 17:20 we have "mountain" in place of "sycamine tree."Be thou rooted up  (εκριζωθητ). First aorist passive imperative as is φυτευθητ.Would have obeyed  (υπηκουσεν αν). First aorist active indicative with αν, apodosis of a second-class condition (note aorist tense here, imperfect ελεγετε).
