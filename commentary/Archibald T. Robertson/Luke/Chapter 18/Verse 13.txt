Second perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>, intransitive like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταθεις</span></span> above. But no ostentation as with the Pharisee in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:11">Luke 18:11</span>. At a distance from the Pharisee, not from the sanctuary.</p>

<p><b>A sinner </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω αμαρτωλω</span></span>). The sinner, not a sinner. It is curious how modern scholars ignore this Greek article. The main point in the contrast lies in this article. The Pharisee thought of others as sinners. The publican thinks of himself alone as the sinner, not of others at all. </p>
