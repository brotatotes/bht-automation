 Standing afar off  (μακροθεν εστως). Second perfect active participle of ιστημ, intransitive like σταθεις above. But no ostentation as with the Pharisee in verse Luke 18:11. At a distance from the Pharisee, not from the sanctuary.Would not lift  (ουκ ηθελεν ουδε επαρα). Negatives (double) imperfect ofthelo , was not willing even to lift up, refused to lift (επαρα, first aorist active infinitive of the liquid compound verb, επ-αιρω). Smote (ετυπτε). Imperfect active of τυπτω, old verb, kept on smiting or beating. Worshippers usually lifted up their closed eyes to God.Be merciful  (ιλασθητ). First aorist passive imperative of ιλασκομα, an old verb, found also in LXX and inscriptions (εξιλασκομα, Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 224).A sinner  (τω αμαρτωλω). The sinner, not a sinner. It is curious how modern scholars ignore this Greek article. The main point in the contrast lies in this article. The Pharisee thought of others as sinners. The publican thinks of himself alone as the sinner, not of others at all.
