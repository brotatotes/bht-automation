<p><b> This man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>). This despised publican referred to contemptuously in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:11">Luke 18:11</span> as "this" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>) publican.</p>
<p><b>Rather than the other </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ' εκεινον</span></span>). In comparison with (placed beside) that one. A neat Greek idiom after the perfect passive participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεδικαιομενος</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>For </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). This moral maxim Christ had already used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:11">Luke 14:11</span>. Plummer pertinently asks: "Why is it assumed that Jesus did not repeat his sayings?" </p>
