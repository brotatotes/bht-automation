<p><b> Called </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεκαλεσατο</span></span>). Indirect middle aorist indicative, called the children with their parents to himself and then rebuked the disciples for their rebuke of the parents. The language of Jesus is precisely that of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:14">Mark 10:14</span> which see, and nearly that of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:14">Matthew 19:14</span> which see also. The plea of Jesus that children be allowed to come to him is one that many parents need to heed. It is a tragedy to think of parents "forbidding" their children or of preachers doing the same or of both being stumbling-blocks to children. </p>
