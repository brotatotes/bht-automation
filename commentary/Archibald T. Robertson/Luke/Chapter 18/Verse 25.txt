 Through a needle's eye  (δια τρηματος βελονης). Both words are old. Τρημα means a perforation or hole or eye and in the N.T. only here and Matthew 19:24. Βελονη means originally the point of a spear and then a surgeon's needle. Here only in the N.T. Mark 10:25; Matthew 19:24 have ραφιδος for needle. This is probably a current proverb for the impossible. The Talmud twice speaks of an elephant passing through the eye of a needle as being impossible.
