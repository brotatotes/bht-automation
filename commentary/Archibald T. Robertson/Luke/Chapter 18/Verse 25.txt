<p><b> Through a needle's eye </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τρηματος βελονης</span></span>). Both words are old. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τρημα</span></span> means a perforation or hole or eye and in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:24">Matthew 19:24</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βελονη</span></span> means originally the point of a spear and then a surgeon's needle. Here only in the N.T. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:25">Mark 10:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:24">Matthew 19:24</span> have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραφιδος</span></span> for needle. This is probably a current proverb for the impossible. The Talmud twice speaks of an elephant passing through the eye of a needle as being impossible. </p>
