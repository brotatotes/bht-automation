 The impossible with men possible with God  (τα αδυνατα παρα ανθρωποις δυνατα παρα τω θεω). Paradoxical, but true. Take your stand "beside" (παρα) God and the impossible becomes possible. Clearly then Jesus meant the humanly impossible by the parabolic proverb about the camel going through the needle's eye. God can break the grip of gold on a man's life, but even Jesus failed with this young ruler.
