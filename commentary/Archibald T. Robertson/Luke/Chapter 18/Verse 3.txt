<p><b> Came oft </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρχετο</span></span>). Imperfect tense denotes repetitions, no adverb for "oft" in the Greek.</p>
<p><b>Avenge me of </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκδικησον με απο</span></span>). A late verb for doing justice, protecting one from another (note both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>, here). Deissmann (<i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, pp. 420ff.) quotes a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηλη</span></span> of the second century B.C. with a prayer for vengeance for a Jewish girl that had been murdered which has this very verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκδικεω</span></span>. </p>
