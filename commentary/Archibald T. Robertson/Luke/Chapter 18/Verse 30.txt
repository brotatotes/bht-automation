 Shall not receive  (ουχ μη λαβη). Very strong double negative with aorist active subjunctive of λαμβανω.Manifold more  (πολλαπλασιονα). Late Greek word, here alone in the N.T. save Matthew 19:29 where Westcott and Hort have it though many MSS. there read εκατονπλασιονα (a hundredfold) as in Mark 10:30.
