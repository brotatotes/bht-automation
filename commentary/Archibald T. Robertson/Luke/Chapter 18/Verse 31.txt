<p><b> Took unto him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαβων</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαμβανω</span></span>. Taking along with himself. So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:32">Mark 10:32</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:17">Matthew 20:17</span> adds <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ' ιδιαν</span></span> (apart).

<p><b>Unto the Son of man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω υιω του ανθρωπου</span></span>). Dative case of personal interest. The position is amphibolous and the construction makes sense either with "shall be accomplished" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελεσθησετα</span></span>) or "that are written" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα γεγραμμενα</span></span>), probably the former. Compare these minute details of the prophecy here (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:32">Luke 18:32</span>) with the words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:33">Mark 10:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:18">Matthew 20:18</span>, which see. </p>
