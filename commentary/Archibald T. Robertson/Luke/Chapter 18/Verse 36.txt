<p><b> Inquired </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επυνθανετο</span></span>). Imperfect middle. Repeatedly inquired as he heard the tramp of the passing crowd going by (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαπορευομενου</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>What this meant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ ειη τουτο</span></span>). Literally, What it was. Without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> the optative is due to indirect discourse, changed from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span>. With <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> (margin of Westcott and Hort) the potential optative of the direct discourse is simply retained. </p>
