<p><b> Passeth by </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρερχετα</span></span>). Present middle indicative retained in indirect discourse as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραγε</span></span> is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:30">Matthew 20:30</span>. No reason for differences of English tenses in the two passages (was passing by, passeth by). </p>
