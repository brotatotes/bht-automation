<p><b> And he is longsuffering </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακροθυμε</span></span>). This present active indicative comes in awkwardly after the aorist subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιηση</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span>, but this part of the question is positive. Probably <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> here means "and yet" as so often (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:30">John 9:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:32">John 16:32</span>, etc.). God delays taking vengeance on behalf of his people, not through indifference, but through patient forbearance. </p>
