<p><b> Howbeit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλην</span></span>). It is not clear whether this sentence is also a question or a positive statement. There is no way to decide. Either will make sense though not quite the same sense. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα</span></span> before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρησε</span></span> seems to indicate a question expecting a negative answer as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:30">Acts 8:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:19">Romans 14:19</span>. But here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα</span></span> comes in the middle of the sentence instead of near the beginning, an unusual position for either inferential <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα</span></span> or interrogative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα</span></span>. On the whole the interrogative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα</span></span> is probably correct, meaning to question if the Son will find a persistence of faith like that of the widow. </p>
