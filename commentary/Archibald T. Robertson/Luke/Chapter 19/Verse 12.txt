<p><b> To take to himself a kingdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαβειν εαυτω βασιλειαν</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span> with the dative reflexive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτω</span></span> where the middle voice could have been used. Apparently this parable has the historical basis of Archelaus who actually went from Jerusalem to Rome on this very errand to get a kingdom in Palestine and to come back to it. This happened while Jesus was a boy in Nazareth and it was a matter of common knowledge. </p>
