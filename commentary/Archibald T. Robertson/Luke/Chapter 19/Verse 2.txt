<p><b> Chief publican </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχιτελωνης</span></span>). The word occurs nowhere else apparently but the meaning is clear from the other words with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχι-</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχιερευς</span></span> (chief priest) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχιποιμην</span></span> (chief shepherd). Jericho was an important trading point for balsam and other things and so Zacchaeus was the head of the tax collections in this region, a sort of commissioner of taxes who probably had other publicans serving under him. </p>
