<p><b> Thou knewest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηιδεις</span></span>). Second past perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>, to see, used as imperfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span>, to know. Either it must be taken as a question as Westcott and Hort do or be understood as sarcasm as the Revised Version has it. The words of the wicked (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονηρος</span></span>) slave are turned to his own condemnation. </p>
