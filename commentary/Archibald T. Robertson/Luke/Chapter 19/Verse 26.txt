<p><b> That hath not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του μη εχοντος</span></span>). The present tense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span> here, that keeps on not having, probably approaches the idea of acquiring or getting, the one who keeps on not acquiring. This is the law of nature and of grace. </p>
