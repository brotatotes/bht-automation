 Unto Bethphage and Bethany  (εις Βηθφαγη κα Βηθανια). Both indeclinable forms of the Hebrew or Aramaic names. In Mark 11:1 "Bethany" is inflected regularly, which see.Of Olives  (Ελαιων). As in Mark 11:1; Matthew 21:1, though some editors take it to be, not the genitive plural of ελαια (olive tree), but the name of the place Olivet. In the Greek it is just a matter of accent (circumflex or acute) Olivet is correct in Acts 1:12. See on Matthew 21:1; Mark 11:1 for details.
