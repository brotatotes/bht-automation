<p><b> Unto Bethphage and Bethany </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Βηθφαγη κα Βηθανια</span></span>). Both indeclinable forms of the Hebrew or Aramaic names. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:1">Mark 11:1</span> "Bethany" is inflected regularly, which see.</p>
<p><b>Of Olives </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ελαιων</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:1">Mark 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:1">Matthew 21:1</span>, though some editors take it to be, not the genitive plural of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαια</span></span> (olive tree), but the name of the place Olivet. In the Greek it is just a matter of accent (circumflex or acute) Olivet is correct in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:12">Acts 1:12</span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:1">Matthew 21:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:1">Mark 11:1</span> for details. </p>
