<p><b> He sought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζητε</span></span>). Imperfect active. He was seeking, conative idea.</p>
<p><b>Jesus who he was </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησουν τις εστιν</span></span>). Prolepsis, to see who Jesus was. He had heard so much about him. He wanted to see which one of the crowd was Jesus.</p>
<p><b>For the crowd </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο του οχλου</span></span>). He was short and the crowd was thick and close.</p>
<p><b>Stature </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη ηλικια</span></span>). No doubt of that meaning here and possibly so in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:52">Luke 2:52</span>. Elsewhere "age" except <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:25">Luke 12:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:27">Matthew 6:27</span> where it is probably "stature" also. </p>
