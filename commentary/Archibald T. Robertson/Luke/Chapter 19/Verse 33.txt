The same word κυριος used of the Lord Jesus in verse Luke 19:31 (and Luke 19:34) and which these "owners" would understand. See on Matthew 21:3; Mark 11:3 for κυριος used by Jesus about himself with the expectation that these disciples would recognize him by that title as they did. The word in common use for the Roman emperor and in the LXX to translate the Hebrew Elohim (God).
