<p><b> At the descent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τη καταβασε</span></span>). Epexegetic of "drawing nigh." They were going by the southern slope of the Mount of Olives. As they turned down to the city, the grand view stirred the crowd to rapturous enthusiasm. This was the first sight of the city on this route which is soon obscured in the descent. The second view bursts out again (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:41">Luke 19:41</span>). It was a shout of triumph from the multitude with their long pent-up enthusiasm (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:11">Luke 19:11</span>), restrained no longer by the parable of the pounds.</p>
<p><b>For all the mighty works which they had seen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ πασων ειδον δυναμεων</span></span>). Neat Greek idiom, incorporation of the antecedent (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμεων</span></span>) into the relative clause and attraction of the case of the relative from the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ας</span></span> to the genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span>. And note "all." The climax had come, Lazarus, Bartimaeus, and the rest. </p>
