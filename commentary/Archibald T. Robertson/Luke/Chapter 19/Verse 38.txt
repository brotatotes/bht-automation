<p><b> The king cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ερχομενοσ, ο βασιλευς</span></span>). The Messianic hopes of the people were now all ablaze with expectation of immediate realization. A year ago in Galilee he had frustrated their plans for a revolutionary movement "to take him by force to make him king" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:15">John 6:15</span>). The phrase "the coming king" like "the coming prophet" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:14">John 6:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>) expressed the hope of the long-looked-for Messiah. They are singing from the Hallel in their joy that Jesus at last is making public proclamation of his Messiahship.</p>
<p><b>Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ουρανω ειρηνη κα δοξα εν υψιστοις</span></span>). This language reminds one strongly of the song of the angels at the birth of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:14">Luke 2:14</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:10">Mark 11:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:9">Matthew 21:9</span> have "Hosannah in the highest." </p>
