 The king cometh  (ο ερχομενοσ, ο βασιλευς). The Messianic hopes of the people were now all ablaze with expectation of immediate realization. A year ago in Galilee he had frustrated their plans for a revolutionary movement "to take him by force to make him king" (John 6:15). The phrase "the coming king" like "the coming prophet" (John 6:14; Deuteronomy 18:15) expressed the hope of the long-looked-for Messiah. They are singing from the Hallel in their joy that Jesus at last is making public proclamation of his Messiahship.Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest  (εν ουρανω ειρηνη κα δοξα εν υψιστοις). This language reminds one strongly of the song of the angels at the birth of Jesus (Luke 2:14). Mark 11:10; Matthew 21:9 have "Hosannah in the highest."
