<p><b> If these shall hold their peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ουτο σιωπησουσιν</span></span>). A condition of the first class, determined as fulfilled. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> cuts no figure in the case (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:31">Acts 8:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:8">1 Thessalonians 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:15">1 John 5:15</span>). The kind of condition is determined by the mode which is here indicative. The future tense by its very nature does approximate the aorist subjunctive, but after all it is the indicative.</p>
<p><b>The stones will cry out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λιθο κραξουσιν</span></span>). A proverb for the impossible happening. </p>
