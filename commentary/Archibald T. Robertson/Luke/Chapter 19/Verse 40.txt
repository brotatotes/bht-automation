 If these shall hold their peace  (εαν ουτο σιωπησουσιν). A condition of the first class, determined as fulfilled. The use of εαν rather than ε cuts no figure in the case (see Acts 8:31; 1 Thessalonians 3:8; 1 John 5:15). The kind of condition is determined by the mode which is here indicative. The future tense by its very nature does approximate the aorist subjunctive, but after all it is the indicative.The stones will cry out  (ο λιθο κραξουσιν). A proverb for the impossible happening.
