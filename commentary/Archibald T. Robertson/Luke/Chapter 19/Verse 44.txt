<p><b> Shall dash to the ground </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδαφιουσιν</span></span>). Attic future of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδαφιζω</span></span>, to beat level, to raze to the ground, a rare verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδαφος</span></span>, bottom, base, ground (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:7">Acts 22:7</span>), here alone in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Because </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθ' ων</span></span>). "In return for which things."</p>
<p><b>Thou knewest not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εγνως</span></span>). Applying the very words of the lament in the condition in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:42">Luke 19:42</span>. This vivid prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem is used by those who deny predictive prophecy even for Jesus as proof that Luke wrote the Gospel after the destruction of Jerusalem. But it is no proof at all to those who concede to Jesus adequate knowledge of his mission and claims. </p>
