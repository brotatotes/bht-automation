<p><b> Began to cast out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρξατο εκβαλλειν</span></span>). So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:15">Mark 11:15</span> whereas <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span> has simply "he cast out." See Mark and Matthew for discussion of this second cleansing of the temple at the close of the public ministry in relation to the one at the beginning in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:14-22">John 2:14-22</span>. There is nothing gained by accusing John or the Synoptics of a gross chronological blunder. There was abundant time in these three years for all the abuses to be revived. </p>
