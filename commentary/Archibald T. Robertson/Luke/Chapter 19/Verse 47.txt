<p><b> He was teaching </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην διδασκων</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect.</p>
<p><b>Daily </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το καθ' ημεραν</span></span>). Note the accusative neuter article, "as to the according to the day," very awkward English surely, but perfectly good Greek. The same idiom occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:3">Luke 11:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Sought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζητουν</span></span>). Imperfect active, conative imperfect, were seeking, trying to seek.</p>
<p><b>The principal men of the people </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πρωτο του λαου</span></span>). The first men of the people. The position after the verb and apart from the chief priests and the scribes calls special attention to them. Some of these "first men" were chief priests or scribes, but not all of them. The lights and leaders of Jerusalem were bent on the destruction (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολεσα</span></span>) of Jesus. The raising of Lazarus from the dead brought them together for this action (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:47-53">John 11:47-53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:9-11">John 12:9-11</span>). </p>
