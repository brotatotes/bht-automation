<p><b> They could not find </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ ηυρισκον</span></span>). Imperfect active. They kept on not finding.</p>
<p><b>What they might do </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το τ ποιησωσιν</span></span>). First aorist active deliberative subjunctive in a direct question retained in the indirect. Note the article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το</span></span> (neuter accusative) with the question.</p>
<p><b>Hung upon him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεκρεμετο αυτου</span></span>). Imperfect middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκρεμαμα</span></span>, an old verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μ</span></span> form) to hang from, here only in the N.T. The form is an <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομεγα</span></span> form from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκρεμομα</span></span>, a constant tendency to the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομεγα</span></span> form in the <i>Koine</i>. It pictures the whole nation (save the leaders in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:47">Luke 19:47</span>) hanging upon the words of Jesus as if in suspense in mid-air, rapt attention that angered these same leaders. Tyndale renders it "stuck by him." </p>
