<p><b> Stood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταθεις</span></span>). Apparently Jesus and Zacchaeus had come to the house of Zacchaeus and were about to enter when the murmur became such a roar that Zacchaeus turned round and faced the crowd.</p>
<p><b>If I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τινος τ εσυκοφαντησα</span></span>). A most significant admission and confession. It is a condition of the first class (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and the aorist active indicative) that assumes it to be true. His own conscience was at work. He may have heard audible murmurs from the crowd. For the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συκοφαντειν</span></span>, see discussion on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:14">Luke 3:14</span>, the only two instances in the N.T. He had extorted money wrongfully as they all knew.</p>
<p><b>I return fourfold </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδιδωμ τετραπλουν</span></span>). I offer to do it here and now on this spot. This was the Mosaic law (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:1">Exodus 22:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+5:6">Numbers 5:6</span>). Restitution is good proof of a change of heart. D. L. Moody used to preach it with great power. Without this the offer of Zacchaeus to give half his goods to the poor would be less effective. "It is an odd coincidence, nothing more, that the fig-mulberry (sycamore) should occur in connexion with the <i>fig</i>-shewer (sycophant)." </p>
