<p><b> Decree from Caesar Augustus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δογμα παρα Καισαρος Αυγουστου</span></span>). Old and common word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκεω</span></span>, to think, form an opinion. No such decree was given by Greek or Roman historians and it was for long assumed by many scholars that Luke was in error. But papyri and inscriptions have confirmed Luke on every point in these crucial verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:1-7">Luke 2:1-7</span>. See W.M. Ramsay's books (<i>Was Christ Born at Bethelehem?</i> <i>Luke the Physician</i>. <i>The Bearing of Recent Discovery on the Trustworthiness of the N.T.</i>).</p>
<p><b>The World </b>(<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την οικουμενην</span></span>). Literally, <b>the inhabited</b> (<b>land </b>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γην</span></span>). Inhabited by the Greeks, then by the Romans, then the whole world (Roman world, the world ruled by Rome). So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:6">Acts 17:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>Should be enrolled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απογραφεσθα</span></span>). It was a census, not a taxing, though taxing generally followed and was based on the census. This word is very old and common. It means to write or copy off for the public records, to register. </p>
