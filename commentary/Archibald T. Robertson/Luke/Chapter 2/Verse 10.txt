<p><b> I bring you good tidings of great joy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιζομα υμιν χαραν μεγαλην</span></span>). Wycliff, "I evangelize to you a great joy." The active verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιζω</span></span> occurs only in late Greek writers, LXX, a few papyri examples, and the N.T. The middle (deponent) appears from Aristophanes on. Luke and Paul employ both substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιον</span></span> and verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιζω</span></span> very frequently. It is to Paul's influence that we owe their frequency and popularity in the language of Christendom (George Milligan, <i>The Epistles to the Thessalonians</i>, p. 143). The other Gospels do not have the verb save <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:5">Matthew 11:5</span> and that in a quotation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span>). </p>
