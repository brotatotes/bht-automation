<p><span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ις βορν</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετεχθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τικτω</span></span>. Was born.</p>
<p><b>Saviour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωτηρ</span></span>). This great word is common in Luke and Paul and seldom elsewhere in the N.T. (Bruce). The people under Rome's rule came to call the emperor "Saviour" and Christians took the word and used it of Christ. See inscriptions (Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 344).</p>
<p><b>Christ the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος Κυριος</span></span>). This combination occurs nowhere else in the N.T. and it is not clear what it really means. Luke is very fond of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span> (<b>Lord </b>) where the other Gospels have Jesus. It may mean "Christ the Lord," "Anointed Lord," "Messiah, Lord," "The Messiah, the Lord," "An Anointed One, a Lord," or "Lord Messiah." It occurs once in the LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="la+4:20">Lamentations 4:20</span>) and is in Ps. of Sol. 17:36. Ragg suggests that our phrase "the Lord Jesus Christ" is really involved in "A Saviour (Jesus) which is Christ the Lord." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span> for Christ and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:3">Matthew 21:3</span> for Lord. </p>
