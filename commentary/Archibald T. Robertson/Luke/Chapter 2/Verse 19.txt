<p><b> Kept </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνετηρε</span></span>). Imperfect active. She kept on keeping together (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν-</span></span>) all these things. They were meat and drink to her. She was not astonished, but filled with holy awe. The verb occurs from Aristotle on. She could not forget. But did not Mary keep also a Baby Book? And may not Luke have seen it?</p>
<p><b>Pondering </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνβαλλουσα</span></span>). An old Greek word. Placing together for comparison. Mary would go over each detail in the words of Gabriel and of the shepherds and compare the sayings with the facts so far developed and brood over it all with a mother's high hopes and joy. </p>
