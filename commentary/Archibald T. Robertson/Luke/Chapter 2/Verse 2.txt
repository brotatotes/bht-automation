<p><b> The first enrolment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απογραφη πρωτη</span></span>). A definite allusion by Luke to a series of censuses instituted by Augustus, the second of which is mentioned by him in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:37">Acts 5:37</span>. This second one is described by Josephus and it was supposed by some that Luke confused the two. But Ramsay has shown that a periodical fourteen-year census in Egypt is given in dated papyri back to A.D. 20. The one in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:37">Acts 5:37</span> would then be A.D. 6. This is in the time of Augustus. The first would then be B.C. 8 in Egypt. If it was delayed a couple of years in Palestine by Herod the Great for obvious reasons, that would make the birth of Christ about B.C. 6 which agrees with the other known data</p>
<p><b>When Quirinius </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυρηνιου</span></span>). Genitive absolute. Here again Luke has been attacked on the ground that Quirinius was only governor of Syria once and that was A.D. 6 as shown by Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. XVIII. I.I). But Ramsay has proven by inscriptions that Quirinius was twice in Syria and that Luke is correct here also. See summary of the facts in my <i>Luke the Historian in the Light of Research</i>, pp. 118-29. </p>
