<p><b> His name was called Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εκληθη το ονομα αυτου Ιησους</span></span>). The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> is left untranslated or has the sense of "then" in the apodosis. The naming was a part of the ceremony of circumcision as is shown also in the case of John the Baptist (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:59-66">Luke 1:59-66</span>). </p>
