<p><b> The days of their purification </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α ημερα του καθαρισμου αυτων</span></span>). The old manuscripts have "their" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτων</span></span>) instead of "her" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτης</span></span>) of the later documents. But it is not clear whether "their" refers to Mary and Joseph as is true of "they brought" or to Mary and the child. The mother was Levitically unclean for forty days after the birth of a son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+12:1-8">Leviticus 12:1-8</span>).</p>
<p><b>To present him to the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραστησα τω Κυριω</span></span>). Every first-born son was thus redeemed by the sacrifice (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:2-12">Exodus 13:2-12</span>) as a memorial of the sparing of the Israelitish families (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:15">Numbers 18:15</span>). The cost was about two dollars and a half in our money. </p>
