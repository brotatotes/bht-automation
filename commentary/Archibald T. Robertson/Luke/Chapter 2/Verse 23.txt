<p><b> In the law of the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν νομω Κυριου</span></span>). No articles, but definite by preposition and genitive. Vincent notes that "law" occurs in this chapter five times. Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span>) will urge that Jesus "was made under the law" as Luke here explains. The law did not require that the child be brought to Jerusalem. The purification concerned the mother, the presentation the son. </p>
