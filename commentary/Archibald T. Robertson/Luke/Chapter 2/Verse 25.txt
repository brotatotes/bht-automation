<p><b> Devout </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευλαβης</span></span>). Used only by Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:5">Acts 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:2">Acts 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:12">Acts 22:12</span>) in the N.T. Common in ancient Greek from Plato on. It means taking hold well or carefully (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαβειν</span></span>) and so reverently, circumspectly.</p>
<p><b>Looking for the consolation of Israel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσδεχομενος παρακλησιν του Ισραελ</span></span>). Old Greek verb to admit to one's presence (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:2">Luke 15:2</span>) and then to expect as here and of Anna in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:38">Luke 2:38</span>.</p>
<p><b>Paraklsin </b> here means the Messianic hope (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:10">Isaiah 11:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:1">Isaiah 40:1</span>), calling to one's side for cheer.</p>
<p><b>Upon him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ' αυτον</span></span>). This is the explanation of his lively Messianic hope. It was due to the Holy Spirit. Simeon and Anna are representatives of real piety in this time of spiritual dearth and deadness. </p>
