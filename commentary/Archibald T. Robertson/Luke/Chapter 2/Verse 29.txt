 Now lettest thou  (νυν απολυεις). Present active indicative,Thou art letting. The Nunc Dimittis, adoration and praise. It is full of rapture and vivid intensity (Plummer) like the best of the Psalms. The verb απολυω was common for the manumission of slaves and Simeon here calls himself "thy slave (δουλον σου), Lord (Δεσποτα, our despot)." See 2 Peter 2:1.
