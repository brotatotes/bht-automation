 Revelation to the Gentiles  (αποκαλυψιν εθνων). Objective genitive. The Messiah is to be light (φως) for the Gentiles in darkness (Luke 1:70) and glory (δοξα) for Israel (cf. Romans 9:1-5; Isaiah 49:6). The word εθνος originally meant just a crowd or company, then a race or nation, then the nations other than Israel (the people, ο λαος) or the people of God. The word Gentile is Latin from gens, a tribe or nation. But the world-wide mission of the Messiah comes out clearly in these early chapters in Luke.
