<p><b> His father and his mother </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πατηρ αυτου κα η μητηρ</span></span>). Luke had already used "parents" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:27">Luke 2:27</span>. He by no means intends to deny the Virgin Birth of Jesus so plainly stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:34-38">Luke 1:34-38</span>. He merely employs here the language of ordinary custom. The late MSS. wrongly read "and Joseph" instead of "his father."</p>
<p><b>Were marvelling </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην θαυμαζοντες</span></span>). The masculine gender includes the feminine when both are referred to. But <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> is singular, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν</span></span>, the normal imperfect plural in this periphrastic imperfect. This is due to the wide space between copula and participle. The copula <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> agrees in number with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πατηρ</span></span> while the participle coming last agrees with both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πατερ κα η μητηρ</span></span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:3">Matthew 17:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:40">Matthew 22:40</span>). If one wonders why they marvelled at Simeon's words after what they had heard from Gabriel, Elisabeth, and the Shepherds, he should bear in mind that every parent is astonished and pleased at the fine things others see in the child. It is a mark of unusual insight for others to see so much that is obvious to the parent. Simeon's prophecy had gone beyond the angel's outline and it was surprising that he should know anything about the child's destiny. </p>
