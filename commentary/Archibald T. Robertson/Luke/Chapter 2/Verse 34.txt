<p><b> Is set for the falling and the rising up of many in Israel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κειτα εις πτωσιν κα αναστασιν πολλων εν τω Ισραηλ</span></span>). Present indicative of the old defective verb appearing only in present and imperfect in the N.T. Sometimes it is used as the passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span> as here. The falling of some and the rising up of others is what is meant. He will be a stumbling-block to some (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:14">Isaiah 8:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:44">Matthew 21:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:33">Romans 9:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:16">1 Peter 2:16</span>) who love darkness rather than light (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span>), he will be the cause of rising for others (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:9">Romans 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:6">Ephesians 2:6</span>). "Judas despairs, Peter repents: one robber blasphemes, the other confesses" (Plummer). Jesus is the magnet of the ages. He draws some, he repels others. This is true of all epoch-making men to some extent.</p>
<p><b>Spoken against </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιλεγομενον</span></span>). Present passive participle, continuous action. It is going on today. Nietzsche regarded Jesus Christ as the curse of the race because he spared the weak. </p>
