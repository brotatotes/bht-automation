<p><b> A sword </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρομφαια</span></span>). A large sword, properly a long Thracian javelin. It occurs in the LXX of Goliath's sword (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+17:51">1 Samuel 17:51</span>). How little Mary understood the meaning of Simeon's words that seemed so out of place in the midst of the glorious things already spoken, a sharp thorn in their roses, a veritable bitter-sweet. But one day Mary will stand by the Cross of Christ with this Thracian javelin clean through her soul, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταβατ Ματερ Δολοροσα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:25">John 19:25</span>). It is only a parenthesis here, and a passing cloud perhaps passed over Mary's heart already puzzled with rapture and ecstasy.</p>
<p><b>May be revealed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαλυφθωσιν</span></span>). Unveiled. First aorist passive subjunctive after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως αν</span></span> and expresses God's purpose in the mission of the Messiah. He is to test men's thoughts (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαλογισμο</span></span>) and purposes. They will be compelled to take a stand for Christ or against him. That is true today. </p>
