<p><b> To their own city Nazareth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις πολιν εαυτων Ναζαρετ</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:23">Matthew 2:23</span> about Nazareth. Luke tells nothing of the flight to Egypt and the reason for the return to Nazareth instead of Bethlehem, the place of the birth of Jesus as told in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:13-23">Matthew 2:13-23</span>. But then neither Gospel gives all the details of this period. Luke has also nothing about the visit of the wise men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:1-12">Matthew 2:1-12</span>) as Matthew tells nothing of the shepherds and of Simeon and Anna (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:8-28">Luke 2:8-28</span>). The two Gospels supplement each other. </p>
