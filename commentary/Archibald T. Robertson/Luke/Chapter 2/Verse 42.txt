<p><b> Twelve years old </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετων δωδεκα</span></span>). Predicate genitive. Luke does not say that Jesus had not been to Jerusalem before, but at twelve a Jewish boy became a "son of the law" and began to observe the ordinances, putting on the phylacteries as a reminder.</p>
<p><b>They went up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινοντων αυτων</span></span>). Genitive absolute with present active participle, a loose construction here, for the incident narrated took place <i>after</i> they had gone up, not <i>while</i> they were gong up. "On their usual going up" (Plummer). </p>
