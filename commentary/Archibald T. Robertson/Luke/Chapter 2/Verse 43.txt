<p><b> When they had fulfilled the days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειωσαντων τας ημερας</span></span>). Genitive absolute again, but aorist participle (effective aorist). "The days" may mean the full seven days (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:15">Exodus 12:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+23:6-8">Leviticus 23:6-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+16:3">Deuteronomy 16:3</span>), or the two chief days after which many pilgrims left for home.</p>
<p><b>As they were returning </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω υποστρεφειν αντους</span></span>). The articular infinitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>, a construction that Luke often uses (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:21">Luke 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:27">Luke 2:27</span>).</p>
<p><b>The boy, Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησους ο παις</span></span>). More exactly, "Jesus the boy." In verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:40">Luke 2:40</span> it was "the child " (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το παιδιον</span></span>), here it is "the boy" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο παις</span></span>, no longer the diminutive form). It was not disobedience on the part of "the boy" that made him remain behind, but intense interest in the services of the temple; "involuntary preoccupation" (Bruce) held him fast. </p>
