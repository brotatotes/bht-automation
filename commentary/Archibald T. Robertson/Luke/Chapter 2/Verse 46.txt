<p><b> After three days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα ημερας τρεις</span></span>). One day out, one day back, and on the third day finding him.</p>
<p><b>In the temple </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ιερω</span></span>). Probably on the terrace where members of the Sanhedrin gave public instruction on sabbaths and feast-days, so probably while the feast was still going on. The rabbis probably sat on benches in a circle. The listeners on the ground, among whom was Jesus the boy in a rapture of interest.</p>
<p><b>Both hearing them and asking them questions </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ακουοντα αυτων κα επερωτωντα αυτους</span></span>). Paul sat at the feet of Gamaliel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:3">Acts 22:3</span>). Picture this eager boy alive with interest. It was his one opportunity in a theological school outside of the synagogue to hear the great rabbis expound the problems of life. This was the most unusual of all children, to be sure, in intellectual grasp and power. But it is a mistake to think that children of twelve do not think profoundly concerning the issues of life. What father or mother has ever been able to answer a child's questions? </p>
