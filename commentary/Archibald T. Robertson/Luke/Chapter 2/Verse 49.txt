<p><b> Son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνον</span></span>). Child, literally. It was natural for Mary to be the first to speak.</p>
<p><b>Why </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ</span></span>). The mother's reproach of the boy is followed by a confession of negligence on her part and of Joseph (<b>sorrowing </b>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδυνωμενο</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Thy father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πατερ σου</span></span>). No contradiction in this. Alford says: "Up to this time Joseph had been so called by the holy child himself, but from this time never."</p>
<p><b>Sought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζητουμεν</span></span>). Imperfect tense describing the long drawn out search for three days.</p>
<p><b>How is it that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ οτ</span></span>). The first words of Jesus preserved to us. This crisp Greek idiom without copula expresses the boy's amazement that his parents should not know that there was only one possible place in Jerusalem for him.</p>
<p><b>I must be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε εινα με</span></span>). Messianic consciousness of the necessity laid on him.

<p><b>In my Father's house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις του πατρος μου</span></span>). Not "about my Father's business," but "in my Father's house" (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:51">Genesis 41:51</span>). Common Greek idiom. And note "my," not "our." When the boy first became conscious of his peculiar relation to the Father in heaven we do not know. But he has it now at twelve and it will grow within him through the years ahead in Nazareth. </p>
