<p><b> He was subject unto them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην υποτασσομενος αυτοις</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect passive. He continued subject unto them, this wondrous boy who really knew more than parents and rabbis, this gentle, obedient, affectionate boy. The next eighteen years at Nazareth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:23">Luke 3:23</span>) he remained growing into manhood and becoming the carpenter of Nazareth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:3">Mark 6:3</span>) in succession to Joseph (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:55">Matthew 13:55</span>) who is mentioned here for the last time. Who can tell the wistful days when Jesus waited at Nazareth for the Father to call him to his Messianic task?</p>
<p><b>Kept </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διετηρε</span></span>). Imperfect active. Ancient Greek word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διατηρεω</span></span>), but only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:29">Acts 15:29</span> in the N.T. though in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+37:11">Genesis 37:11</span>. She kept thoroughly (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) all these recent sayings (or things, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρηματα</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:19">Luke 2:19</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνετηρε</span></span> is the word used of Mary after the shepherds left. These she kept pondering and comparing all the things. Surely she has a full heart now. Could she foresee how destiny would take Jesus out beyond her mother's reach? </p>
