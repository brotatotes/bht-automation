<p><b> Advanced in wisdom and stature </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προεκοπτεν τη σοφια κα ηλικια</span></span>). Imperfect active, he kept cutting his way forward as through a forest or jungle as pioneers did. He kept growing in stature (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλικια</span></span> may mean age, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:25">Luke 12:25</span>, but stature here) and in wisdom (more than mere knowledge). His physical, intellectual, moral, spiritual development was perfect. "At each stage he was perfect for that stage" (Plummer).</p>
<p><b>In favour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαριτ</span></span>). Or grace. This is ideal manhood to have the favour of God and men. </p>
