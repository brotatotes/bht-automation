<p><b> That she should be delivered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του τεκειν αυτην</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>For the bearing the child as to her </b>. A neat use of the articular infinitive, second aorist active, with the accusative of general reference. From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τικτω</span></span>, common verb. </p>
