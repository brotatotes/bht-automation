<p><b> Her firstborn </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον πρωτοτοκον</span></span>). The expression naturally means that she afterwards had other children and we read of brothers and sisters of Jesus. There is not a particle of evidence for the notion that Mary refused to bear other children because she was the mother of the Messiah.</p>
<p><b>Wrapped in swaddling clothes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσπαργανωσεν</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπαργανον</span></span>, a swathing band. Only here and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:12">Luke 2:12</span> in the N.T., but in Euripides, Aristotle, Hippocrates, Plutarch. Frequent in medical works.</p>
<p><b>In a manger </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν φατνη</span></span>). In a crib in a stall whether in a cave (Justin Martyr) or connected with the inn we do not know. The cattle may have been out on the hills or the donkeys used in travelling may have been feeding in this stall or another near.</p>
<p><b>In the inn </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω καταλυματ</span></span>). A lodging-house or khan, poor enough at best, but there was not even room in this public place because of the crowds for the census. See the word also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:11">Luke 22:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:14">Mark 14:14</span> with the sense of guest-room (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+1:13">1 Kings 1:13</span>). It is the Hellenistic equivalent for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταγωγειον</span></span> and appears also in one papyrus. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:24">Exodus 4:24</span>. There would sometimes be an inner court, a range or arches, an open gallery round the four sides. On one side of the square, outside the wall, would be stables for the asses and camels, buffaloes and goats. Each man had to carry his own food and bedding. </p>
