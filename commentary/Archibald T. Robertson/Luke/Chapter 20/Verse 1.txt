<p><b> On one of the days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν μια των ημερων</span></span>). Luke's favourite way of indicating time.

These leaders (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:47">Luke 19:47</span>) had determined to attack Jesus on this morning, both Sadducees (chief priests) and Pharisees (scribes), a formal delegation from the Sanhedrin. </p>
