<p><b> What shall I do? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ ποιησω;</span></span>). Deliberative future indicative or aorist subjunctive (same form). This detail only in Luke. Note the variations in all three Gospels. All three have "will reverence" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντραπησοντα</span></span>) for which see Matthew and Mark.</p>
<p><b>It may be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισως</span></span>). Perhaps, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισος</span></span>, equal. Old adverb, but only here in the N.T. </p>
