<p><b> Tell us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον ημιν</span></span>). Luke adds these words to what Mark and Matthew have. Second aorist active imperative for the old form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπε</span></span> and with ending <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ον</span></span> of the first aorist active. Westcott and Hort punctuate the rest of the sentence as an indirect question after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον</span></span>, but the Revised Version puts a semicolon after "us" and retains the direct question. The Greek manuscripts have no punctuation. </p>
