Mark has ειδως, "knowing," and Matthew γνους, coming to know or grasping (second aorist active participle of γινωσκω).Craftiness  (πανουργιαν). Old word for doing any deed. Matthew has "wickedness" (πονηριαν) and Mark "hypocrisy" (υποκρισιν). Unscrupulous they certainly were. They would stoop to any trick and go the limit.
