<p><b> Perceived </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατανοησας</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατανοεω</span></span>, to put the mind down on. Mark has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδως</span></span>, "knowing," and Matthew <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνους</span></span>, coming to know or grasping (second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Craftiness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πανουργιαν</span></span>). Old word for doing any deed. Matthew has "wickedness" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονηριαν</span></span>) and Mark "hypocrisy" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποκρισιν</span></span>). Unscrupulous they certainly were. They would stoop to any trick and go the limit. </p>
