<p><b> They were not able </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ισχυσαν</span></span>). They did not have strength. An old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυς</span></span> (strength). They failed "to take hold (cf. verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:20">Luke 20:20</span>) of the saying before the people." These "crack" students had made an ignominious failure and were not able to make a case for the surrender of Jesus to Pilate. He had slipped through their net with the utmost ease.</p>
<p><b>Held their peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσιγησαν</span></span>). Ingressive aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σιγαω</span></span>. They became silent as they went back with the "dry grins." </p>
