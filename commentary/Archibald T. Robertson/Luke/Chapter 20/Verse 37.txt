<p><b> Even Moses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα Μωυσης</span></span>). Moses was used by the Sadducees to support their denial of the resurrection. This passage (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:6">Exodus 3:6</span>) Jesus skilfully uses as a proof of the resurrection. See discussion on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:32">Matthew 22:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:26">Mark 12:26</span>. </p>
