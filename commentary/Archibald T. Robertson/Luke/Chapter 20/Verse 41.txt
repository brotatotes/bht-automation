<p><b> How say they? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πως λεγουσιν;</span></span>). The Pharisees had rallied in glee and one of their number, a lawyer, had made a feeble contribution to the controversy which resulted in his agreement with Jesus and in praise from Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:28-34">Mark 12:28-34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:34-40">Matthew 27:34-40</span>). Luke does not give this incident which makes it plain that by "they say" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγουσιν</span></span>) Jesus refers to the Pharisees (rabbis, lawyers), carrying on the discussion and turning the tables on them while the Pharisees are still gathered together (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:41">Matthew 22:41</span>). The construction with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγουσιν</span></span> is the usual infinitive and the accusative in indirect discourse. By "the Christ" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον Χριστον</span></span>) "the Messiah" is meant. </p>
