<p><b> In the hearing of all the people </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουοντος παντος του λαου</span></span>). Genitive absolute, "while all the people were listening" (present active participle). That is the time to speak. The details in this verse and verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:47">Luke 20:47</span> are precisely those given in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:38">Mark 12:38</span>, which see for discussion of details. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:1-39">Matthew 23:1-39</span> has a very full and rich description of this last phase of the debate in the temple where Jesus drew a full-length portrait of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees and scribes in their presence. It was a solemn climax to this last public appearance of Christ in the temple when Jesus poured out the vials of his indignation as he had done before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:2">Matthew 16:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:37-54">Luke 11:37-54</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:12-1">Luke 11:12-1</span>). </p>
