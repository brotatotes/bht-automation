 In the hearing of all the people  (ακουοντος παντος του λαου). Genitive absolute, "while all the people were listening" (present active participle). That is the time to speak. The details in this verse and verse Luke 20:47 are precisely those given in Mark 12:38, which see for discussion of details. Matthew 23:1-39 has a very full and rich description of this last phase of the debate in the temple where Jesus drew a full-length portrait of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees and scribes in their presence. It was a solemn climax to this last public appearance of Christ in the temple when Jesus poured out the vials of his indignation as he had done before (Matthew 16:2; Luke 11:37-54; Luke 11:12-1).
