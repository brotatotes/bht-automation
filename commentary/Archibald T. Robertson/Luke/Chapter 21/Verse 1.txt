<p><b> And he looked up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αναβλεψας δε</span></span>). He had taken his seat, after the debate was over and the Sanhedrin had slunk away in sheer defeat, "over against the treasury" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:41">Mark 12:41</span>). The word for "treasury" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαζοφυλακιον</span></span>) is a compound of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαζα</span></span> (Persian word for royal treasury) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλακη</span></span> guard or protection. It is common in the LXX, but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:41">Mark 12:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:43">Mark 12:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:20">John 8:20</span>. Jesus was watching (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:41">Mark 12:41</span>) the rich put in their gifts as a slight diversion from the intense strain of the hours before. </p>
