<p><b> Famines and pestilences </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λοιμο κα λιμο</span></span>). Play on the two words pronounced just alike in the <i>Koine</i> (itacism).</p>
<p><b>And terrors </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβηθρα τε</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε ... τε</span></span> in this verse groups the two kinds of woes. This rare word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβηθρα</span></span> is only here in the N.T. It is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβεω</span></span>, to frighten, and occurs only in the plural as here. </p>
