<p><b> But before all these things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ δε τουτων παντων</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:8">Mark 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:8">Matthew 24:8</span> these things are termed "the beginning of travail." That may be the idea here. Plummer insists that priority of time is the point, not magnitude.</p>
<p><b>Bringing you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαγομενους</span></span>). Present passive participle from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαγω</span></span>, an old verb to lead off or away. But here the participle is in the accusative plural, not the nominative like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδοντες</span></span> (present active participle, delivering you up), agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμας</span></span> not expressed the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδοντες</span></span>, "you being brought before or led off." "A technical term in Athenian legal language" (Bruce). </p>
