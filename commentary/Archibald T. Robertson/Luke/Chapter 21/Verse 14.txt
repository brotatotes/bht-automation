<p><b> Not to meditate beforehand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη προμελεταιν</span></span>). The classical word for conning a speech beforehand. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:11">Mark 13:11</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προμεριμναω</span></span>, a later word which shows previous anxiety rather than previous preparation.</p>
<p><b>How to answer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολογηθηνα</span></span>). First aorist passive infinitive. It is the preparation for the speech of defence (apology) that Jesus here forbids, not the preparation of a sermon. </p>
