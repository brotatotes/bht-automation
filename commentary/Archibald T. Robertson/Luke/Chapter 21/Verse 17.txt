<p><b> Not a hair of your head shall perish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θριξ εκ της κεφαλης υμων ου μη απολητα</span></span>). Only in Luke. Second aorist middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολλυμ</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span> (double negative). Jesus has just said that some they will put to death. Hence it is spiritual safety here promised such as Paul claimed about death in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:21">Philippians 1:21</span>. </p>
