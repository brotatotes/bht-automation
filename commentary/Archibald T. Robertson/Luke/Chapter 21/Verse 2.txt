 Poor  (πενιχραν). A rare word from πενης (πενομα, to work for one's living). Latin penuria and Greek πειναω, to be hungry are kin to it. Here only in the N.T. Mark 12:42 has πτωχη, a more common word from πτωσσω, to be frightened, to strike and hide from fear, to be in beggary. And Luke uses this adjective also of her in verse Luke 21:3.
