<p><b> Compassed with armies </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυκλουμενην υπο στρατοπεδων</span></span>). Present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυκλοω</span></span>, to circle, encircle, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυκλος</span></span>, circle. Old verb, but only four times in N.T. The point of this warning is the present tense, being encircled. It will be too late after the city is surrounded. It is objected by some that Jesus, not to say Luke, could not have spoken (or written) these words before the Roman armies came. One may ask why not, if such a thing as predictive prophecy can exist and especially in the case of the Lord Jesus. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατοπεδων</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατος</span></span>, army, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεδον</span></span>, plain) is a military camp and then an army in camp. Old word, but only here in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Then know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε γνωτε</span></span>). Second aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>. Christians did flee from Jerusalem to Pella before it was too late as directed in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:21">Luke 21:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:14">Mark 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:16">Matthew 24:16</span>. </p>
