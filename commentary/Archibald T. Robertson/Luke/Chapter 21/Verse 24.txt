<p><b> Edge of the sword </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοματ μαχαιρης</span></span>). Instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοματ</span></span> which means "mouth" literally (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+34:26">Genesis 34:26</span>). This verse like the close of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:22">Luke 21:22</span> is only in Luke. Josephus (<i>War</i>, VI. 9.3) states that 1,100,000 Jews perished in the destruction of Jerusalem and 97,000 were taken captive. Surely this is an exaggeration and yet the number must have been large.</p>
<p><b>Shall be led captive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιχμαλωτισθησοντα</span></span>). Future passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιχμαλωτιζω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιχμη</span></span>, spear and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλωτος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλισκομα</span></span>). Here alone in the literal sense in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Shall be trodden under foot </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστα πατουμενη</span></span>). Future passive periphrastic of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατεω</span></span>, to tread, old verb.</p>
<p><b>Until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ ου πληρωθωσιν καιρο εθνων</span></span>). First aorist passive subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ ου</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως ου</span></span>. What this means is not clear except that Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:25">Romans 11:25</span> shows that the punishment of the Jews has a limit. The same idiom appears there also with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ ου</span></span> and the aorist subjunctive. </p>
