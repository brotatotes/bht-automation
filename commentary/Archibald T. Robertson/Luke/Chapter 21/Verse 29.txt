<p><b> The fig tree, and all the trees </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την συκην κα παντα τα δενδρα</span></span>). This parable of the fig-tree (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:28-32">Mark 13:28-32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:32-35">Matthew 24:32-35</span>) Luke applies to "all the trees." It is true about all of them, but the fig tree was very common in Palestine. </p>
