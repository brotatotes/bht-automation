<p><b> My words shall not pass away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λογο μου ου μη παρελευσοντα</span></span>). Future middle indicative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span>, a bit stronger statement than the subjunctive. It is noteworthy that Jesus utters these words just after the difficult prediction in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:32">Luke 21:32</span>. </p>
