<p><b> As some spake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινων λεγοντων</span></span>). Genitive absolute. The disciples we know from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:1">Mark 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:1">Matthew 24:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>How </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). Literally, "that."</p>
<p><b>It was adorned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεκοσμητα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative, state of completion, stands adorned, tense retained in indirect discourse, though English has to change it. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κοσμεω</span></span>, old and common verb for orderly arrangement and adorning.</p>
<p><b>With goodly stones and offerings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθοις καλοις κα αναθημασιν</span></span>). Instrumental case. Some of these stones in the substructure were enormous. "The columns of the cloister or portico were monoliths of marble over forty feet high" (Plummer). Cf. Josephus, <i>War</i>, V.5. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθημα</span></span> (here only in the N.T.) is not to be confused with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθεμα</span></span> from the same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανατιθημ</span></span>, but which came to mean a curse (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:14">Acts 23:14</span>). So <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθεμα</span></span> came to mean devoted in a bad sense, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθημα</span></span> in a good sense. "Thus <i>knave</i>, lad, becomes a <i>rascal; villain</i>, a <i>farmer</i>, becomes a <i>scoundrel; cunning</i>, <i>skilful</i>, becomes <i>crafty</i>" (Vincent). These offerings in the temple were very numerous and costly (2Macc. 3:2-7) like the golden vine of Herod with branches as tall as a man (Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. XV. ii.3). </p>
