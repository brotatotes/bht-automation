<p><b> As for these things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτα</span></span>). Accusative of general reference.</p>
<p><b>One stone upon another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθος επ λιθω</span></span>). Stone upon stone (locative). Here both <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:2">Mark 13:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:2">Matthew 24:2</span> have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ λιθον</span></span> (accusative). Instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ αφεθησετα</span></span> (future passive) they both have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη αφεθη</span></span> (double negative with aorist passive subjunctive). It was a shock to the disciples to hear this after the triumphal entry. </p>
