<p><b> The Passover </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασχα</span></span>) Both names (unleavened bread and passover) are used here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:1">Mark 14:1</span>. Strictly speaking the passover was Nisan 14 and the unleavened bread 15-21. This is the only place in the N.T. where the expression "the feast of unleavened bread" (common in LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:15">Luke 23:15</span>, etc.) occurs, for <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:1">Mark 14:1</span> has just "the unleavened bread." <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:17">Matthew 26:17</span> uses unleavened bread and passover interchangeably.</p>
