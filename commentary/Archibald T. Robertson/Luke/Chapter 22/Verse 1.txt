 The Passover  (πασχα) Both names (unleavened bread and passover) are used here as in Mark 14:1. Strictly speaking the passover was Nisan 14 and the unleavened bread 15-21. This is the only place in the N.T. where the expression "the feast of unleavened bread" (common in LXX, Luke 23:15, etc.) occurs, for Mark 14:1 has just "the unleavened bread." Matthew 26:17 uses unleavened bread and passover interchangeably.Drew nigh  (ηγγιζεν). Imperfect active. Mark 14:1; Matthew 26:2 mention "after two days" definitely.
