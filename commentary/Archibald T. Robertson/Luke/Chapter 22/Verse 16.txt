<p><b> Until it be fulfilled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως οτου πληρωθη</span></span>). First aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτου</span></span>), the usual construction about the future. It seems like a Messianic banquet that Jesus has in mind (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:15">Luke 14:15</span>). </p>
