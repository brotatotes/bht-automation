<p><b> Which is given for you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το υπερ υμων διδομενον</span></span>). Some MSS. omit these verses though probably genuine. The correct text in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:24">1 Corinthians 11:24</span> has "which is for you," not "which is broken for you." It is curious to find the word "broken" here preserved and justified so often, even by Easton in his commentary on Luke, p. 320.</p>
<p><b>In remembrance of me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την εμην αναμνησιν</span></span>). Objective use of the possessive pronoun <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμην</span></span>, not the subjective.</p>
<p><b>This do </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο ποιειτε</span></span>). Present active indicative, repetition, keep on doing this. </p>
