<p><b> After the supper </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα το δειπνησα</span></span>). Preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα</span></span> and the accusative articular infinitive. The textual situation here is confusing, chiefly because of the two cups (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:17">Luke 22:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:20">Luke 22:20</span>). Some of the documents omit the latter part of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19">Luke 22:19</span> and all of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:20">Luke 22:20</span>. It is possible, of course, that this part crept into the text of Luke from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:24">1 Corinthians 11:24</span>. But, if this part is omitted, Luke would then have the order reversed, the cup before the bread. So there are difficulties whichever turn one takes here with Luke's text whether one cup or two cups.</p>
<p><b>The New Covenant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε καινη διαθηκη</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:28">Matthew 26:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:24">Mark 14:24</span> for "covenant." Westcott and Hort reject "new" there, but accept it here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:25">1 Corinthians 11:25</span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:38">Luke 5:38</span> for difference between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινη</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεα</span></span>. "The ratification of a covenant was commonly associated with the shedding of blood; and what was written in blood was believed to be indelible" (Plummer).</p>
<p><b>Poured out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκχυννομενον</span></span>). Same word in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:24">Mark 14:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:28">Matthew 26:28</span> translated "shed." Late form present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκχυννω</span></span> of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκχεω</span></span>, to pour out. </p>
