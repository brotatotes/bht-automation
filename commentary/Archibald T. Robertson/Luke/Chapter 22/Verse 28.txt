<p><b> In my temptations </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις πειρασμοις μου</span></span>). Probably "trials" is better here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span> though temptations clearly in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:13">James 1:13</span>. This is the tragedy of the situation when Jesus is facing the Cross with the traitor at the table and the rest chiefly concerned about their own primacy and dignity. </p>
