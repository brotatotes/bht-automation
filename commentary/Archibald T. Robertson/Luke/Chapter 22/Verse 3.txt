<p><b> Satan entered into Judas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισηλθεν εις Ιουδαν</span></span>). Ingressive aorist active indicative. Satan was now renewing his attack on Jesus suspended temporarily (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:13">Luke 4:13</span>) "until a good chance." He had come back by the use of Simon Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:33">Mark 8:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:23">Matthew 16:23</span>). The conflict went on and Jesus won ultimate victory (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:18">Luke 10:18</span>). Now Satan uses Judas and has success with him for Judas allowed him to come again and again (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:27">John 13:27</span>). Judas evidently opened the door to his heart and let Satan in. Then Satan took charge and he became a devil as Jesus said (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:70">John 6:70</span>). This surrender to Satan in no way relieves Judas of his moral responsibility. </p>
