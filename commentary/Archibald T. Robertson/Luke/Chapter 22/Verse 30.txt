<p><b> And ye shall sit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθησεσθε</span></span>). But Westcott and Hort read in the text <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθησθε</span></span> (present middle subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>). The picture seems to be that given in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span> when Jesus replied to Peter's inquiry. It is not clear how literally this imagery is to be taken. But there is the promise of honour for the loyal among these in the end. </p>
