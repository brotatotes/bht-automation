<p><b> That thy faith fail not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη εκλιπη ε πιστις μου</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive of purpose with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδεηθην</span></span> (<b> I prayed </b>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλειπω</span></span>, old verb. Our word <i>eclipse</i> is this word. Evidently Jesus could not keep Satan from attacking Peter. He had already captured Judas. Did he not repeatedly attack Jesus? But he could and did pray for Peter's faith and his praying won in the end, though Peter stumbled and fell.</p>
<p><b>And do thou </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα συ</span></span>). The words single out Peter sharply.</p>
<p><b>Once thou hast turned again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποτε επιστρεψας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστρεφω</span></span>, common verb to turn to, to return. But the use of this word implied that Peter would fall though he would come back and "strengthen thy brethren." </p>
