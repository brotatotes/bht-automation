<p><b> Buy a sword </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγορασατω μαχαιραν</span></span>). This is for defence clearly. The reference is to the special mission in Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:1-6">Luke 9:1-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:6-13">Mark 6:6-13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:35-11">Matthew 9:35-11</span>). They are to expect persecution and bitter hostility (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:18-21">John 15:18-21</span>). Jesus does not mean that his disciples are to repel force by force, but that they are to be ready to defend his cause against attack. Changed conditions bring changed needs. This language can be misunderstood as it was then. </p>
