<p><b> But this is your hour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' αυτη εστιν υμων η ωρα</span></span>). So Jesus surrenders. The moral value of his atoning sacrifice on the Cross consists in the voluntariness of his death. He makes it clear that they have taken undue advantage of him in this hour of secret prayer and had failed to seize him in public in the temple. But "the power of darkness" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η εξουσια του σκοτους</span></span>), had its turn. A better day will come. The might, authority of darkness. </p>
