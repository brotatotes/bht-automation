<p><b> Into the high priest's house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την οικιαν του αρχιερεως</span></span>). Luke alone mentions "the house." Though it is implied in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:53">Mark 14:53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:57">Matthew 26:57</span>.</p>
<p><b>Followed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκολουθε</span></span>). Imperfect, was following, as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:58">Matthew 26:58</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:15">John 18:15</span>. Curiously <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:54">Mark 14:54</span> has the aorist. </p>
