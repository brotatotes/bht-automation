<p><b> In the light </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς το φως</span></span>). Facing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span>) the light, for the fire gave light as well as heat. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:65">Mark 14:65</span> has "warming himself in the light," John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:18">John 18:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:25">John 18:25</span>) "warming himself."</p>

The other Gospels (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:67">Mark 14:67</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:69">Matthew 26:69</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:25">John 18:25</span>) make a direct address to Peter. Both could be true, as she turned to Peter. </p>
