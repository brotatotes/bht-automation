 Consented  (εξωμολογησεν). Old verb, but the ancients usually used the simple form for promise or consent rather than the compound. This is the only instance of this sense in the N.T. It is from ομολογος (ομος, same, and λεγω, to say), to say the same thing with another and so agree.Opportunity  (ευκαριαν). From ευκαιρος (ευ, καιρος), a good chance. Old word, but in the N.T. only here and parallel passage Matthew 26:16.In the absence of the multitude  (ατερ οχλου). Ατερ is an old preposition, common in the poets, but rare in prose. Also in verse Luke 22:35. It means "without," "apart from," like χωρις. The point of Judas was just this. He would get Jesus into the hands of the Sanhedrin during the feast in spite of the crowd. It was necessary to avoid tumult (Matthew 26:5) because of the popularity of Jesus.
