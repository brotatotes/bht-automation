<p><b> Consented </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξωμολογησεν</span></span>). Old verb, but the ancients usually used the simple form for promise or consent rather than the compound. This is the only instance of this sense in the N.T. It is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομος</span></span>, same, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span>, to say), to say the same thing with another and so agree.</p>
<p><b>Opportunity </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευκαριαν</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευκαιρος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ, καιρος</span></span>), a good chance. Old word, but in the N.T. only here and parallel passage <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:16">Matthew 26:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>In the absence of the multitude </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατερ οχλου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ατερ</span></span> is an old preposition, common in the poets, but rare in prose. Also in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:35">Luke 22:35</span>. It means "without," "apart from," like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρις</span></span>. The point of Judas was just this. He would get Jesus into the hands of the Sanhedrin during the feast in spite of the crowd. It was necessary to avoid tumult (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:5">Matthew 26:5</span>) because of the popularity of Jesus. </p>
