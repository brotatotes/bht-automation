 And he went out and wept bitterly  (κα εξελθων εξω εκλαυσεν πικρως). A few old Latin documents omit this verse which is genuine in Matthew 26:75. It may be an insertion here from there, but the evidence for the rejection is too slight. It is the ingressive aorist (εκλαυσεν), he burst into tears. "Bitter" is a common expression for tears in all languages and in all hearts.
