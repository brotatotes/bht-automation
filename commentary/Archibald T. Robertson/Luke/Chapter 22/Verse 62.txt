<p><b> And he went out and wept bitterly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εξελθων εξω εκλαυσεν πικρως</span></span>). A few old Latin documents omit this verse which is genuine in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:75">Matthew 26:75</span>. It may be an insertion here from there, but the evidence for the rejection is too slight. It is the ingressive aorist (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλαυσεν</span></span>), he burst into tears. "Bitter" is a common expression for tears in all languages and in all hearts. </p>
