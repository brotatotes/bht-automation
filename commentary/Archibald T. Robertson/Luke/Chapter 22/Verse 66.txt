<p><b> As soon as it was day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως εγενετο ημερα</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:1">Mark 15:1</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:1">Matthew 27:1</span>) has "morning."</p>
<p><b>The assembly of the people </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πρεσβυτεριον του λαου</span></span>). The technical word for "the eldership" (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτερος</span></span>, an old man or elder) or group of the elders composing the Sanhedrin. The word occurs in the LXX for the Sanhedrin. In the N.T. occurs only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:5">Acts 22:5</span> of the Sanhedrin. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14">1 Timothy 4:14</span> Paul uses it of the elders in a church (or churches). The Sanhedrin was composed of the elders and scribes and chief priests (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:1">Mark 15:1</span>) and all three groups are at this meeting. Luke's language (both chief priests and scribes, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τε ... κα</span></span>) seems to apply the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτεριον</span></span> to the whole Sanhedrin. Sadducees (chief priests) and Pharisees (scribes) were nearly equally represented.</p>
<p><b>Into their council </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το συνεδριον αυτων</span></span>). The place of the gathering is not given, but Jesus was led into the council chamber. </p>
