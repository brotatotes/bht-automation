<p><b> If thou art the Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ε συ ε ο Χριστος</span></span>). The Messiah, they mean. The condition is the first class, assuming it to be true.</p>
<p><b>If I tell you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εαν υμιν ειπω</span></span>). Condition of the third class, undetermined, but with likelihood of being determined. This is the second appearance of Jesus before the Sanhedrin merely mentioned by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:1">Mark 15:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:1">Matthew 27:1</span> who give in detail the first appearance and trial. Luke merely gives this so-called ratification meeting after daybreak to give the appearance of legality to their vote of condemnation already taken (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:64">Mark 14:64</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:66">Matthew 26:66</span>).</p>
<p><b>Ye will not believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη πιστευσητε</span></span>). Double negative with the aorist subjunctive, strongest possible negative. So as to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:68">Luke 22:68</span>. </p>
