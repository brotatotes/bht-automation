<p><b> The day of unleavened bread came </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλθεν η ημερα των αζυμων</span></span>). The day itself came, not simply was drawing nigh (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:1">Luke 22:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>Must be sacrificed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδε θυεσθα</span></span>). This was Nisan 14 which began at sunset. Luke is a Gentile and this fact must be borne in mind. The lamb must be slain by the head of the family (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:6">Exodus 12:6</span>). The controversy about the day when Christ ate the last passover meal has already been discussed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:17">Matthew 26:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:12">Mark 14:12</span>). The Synoptics clearly present this as a fact. Jesus was then crucified on Friday at the passover or Thursday (our time) at the regular hour 6 P.M. (beginning of Friday). The five passages in John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:1">Luke 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:27">Luke 13:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:28">Luke 18:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:14">Luke 19:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:31">Luke 19:31</span>) rightly interpreted teach the same thing as shown in my <i>Harmony of the Gospels for Students of the Life of Christ</i> (pp.279-284). </p>
