 As one that perverteth the people  (ως αποστρεφοντα τον λαον). Pilate here condenses the three charges in verse Luke 23:2 into one (Plummer). He uses a more common compound of στρεφω here, αποστρεφω, to turn away from, to seduce, to mislead, whereas διαστρεφω in verse Luke 23:2 has more the notion of disturbing (turning this way and that).

Pilate understands the charge against Jesus to be that he is a revolutionary agitator and a dangerous rival to Caesar, treason in plain words.Having examined him before you  (ενωπιον υμων ανακρινας).
