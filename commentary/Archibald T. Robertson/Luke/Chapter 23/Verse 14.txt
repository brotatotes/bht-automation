<p><b> As one that perverteth the people </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως αποστρεφοντα τον λαον</span></span>). Pilate here condenses the three charges in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:2">Luke 23:2</span> into one (Plummer). He uses a more common compound of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρεφω</span></span> here, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστρεφω</span></span>, to turn away from, to seduce, to mislead, whereas <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαστρεφω</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:2">Luke 23:2</span> has more the notion of disturbing (turning this way and that). Note the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> with the particle, the alleged reason. Pilate understands the charge against Jesus to be that he is a revolutionary agitator and a dangerous rival to Caesar, treason in plain words.</p>
<p><b>Having examined him before you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωπιον υμων ανακρινας</span></span>). Right before your eyes I have given him a careful examination (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα</span></span>) up and down, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>, to judge, sift. Old and common verb in the general sense and in the forensic sense as here and which Luke alone has in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:14">Luke 23:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:9">Luke 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:19">Luke 12:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+28:18">Luke 28:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:8">Acts 24:8</span>) except <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:3">1 Corinthians 9:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Whereof </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span>). Attraction of the relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> to the case (genitive) of the unexpressed antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span>. </p>
