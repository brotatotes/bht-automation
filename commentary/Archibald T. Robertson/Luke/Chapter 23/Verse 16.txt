<p><b> Chastise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδευσας</span></span>). First aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδευω</span></span>, to train a child (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παις</span></span>), and then, as a part of the training, punishment. Our English word chasten is from the Latin <i>castus</i>, pure, chaste, and means to purify (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:6">Hebrews 12:6</span>). Perhaps Pilate may have split a hair over the word as Wycliff puts it: "I shall deliver him amended." But, if Jesus was innocent, Pilate had no doubt to "chastise" him to satisfy a mob. Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:17">Luke 23:17</span> is omitted by Westcott and Hort as from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:6">Mark 15:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:15">Matthew 27:15</span>. </p>
