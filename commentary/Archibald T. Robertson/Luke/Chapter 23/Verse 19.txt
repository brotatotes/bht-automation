<p><b> Insurrection </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στασιν</span></span>). An old word for sedition, standing off, the very charge made against Jesus (and untrue). If Jesus had raised insurrection against Caesar, these accusers would have rallied to his standard.</p>
<p><b>And for murder </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα φονον</span></span>). They cared nought for this. In fact, the murderer was counted a hero like bandits and gangsters today with some sentimentalists.</p>
<p><b>Was cast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην βληθεις</span></span>). Periphrastic aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλω</span></span>, a quite unusual form. </p>
