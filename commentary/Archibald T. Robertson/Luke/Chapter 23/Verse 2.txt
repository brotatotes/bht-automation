<p><b> Began to accuse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρξαντο κατηγορειν</span></span>). They went at it and kept it up. Luke mentions three, but neither of them includes their real reason nor do they mention their own condemnation of Jesus. They had indulged their hatred in doing it, but they no longer have the power of life and death. Hence they say nothing to Pilate of that.</p>
<p><b>We found </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευραμεν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative with first aorist vowel <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span>. Probably they mean that they had caught Jesus in the act of doing these things (<i>in flagrante delicto</i>) rather than discovery by formal trial.</p>
<p><b>Perverting our nation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαστρεφοντα το εθνος ημων</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαστρεφω</span></span>, old verb to turn this way and that, distort, disturb. In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:10">Acts 13:10</span>. The Sanhedrin imply that the great popularity of Jesus was seditious.</p>
<p><b>Forbidding to give tribute to Caesar </b>, (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωλυοντα φορους καισαρ διδονα</span></span>). Note object infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδονα</span></span> after the participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωλυοντα</span></span>. Literally, hindering giving tribute to Caesar. This was a flat untruth. Their bright young students had tried desperately to get Jesus to say this very thing, but they had failed utterly (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:25">Luke 20:25</span>).</p>
<p><b>Saying that he himself is Christ a king </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγοντα αυτον Χριστον βασιλεα εινα</span></span>). Note the indirect discourse here after the participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγοντα</span></span> with the accusative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον</span></span> where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον</span></span> could have been used), and the infinitive. This charge is true, but not in the sense meant by them. Jesus did claim to be the Christ and the king of the kingdom of God. But the Sanhedrin wanted Pilate to think that he set himself up as a rival to Caesar. Pilate would understand little from the word "Christ," but "King" was a different matter. He was compelled to take notice of this charge else he himself would be accused to Caesar of winking at such a claim by Jesus. </p>
