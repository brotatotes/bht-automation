<p><b> But they shouted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε επεφωνουν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιφωνεω</span></span>, to call to. Old verb and a verb pertinent here. They kept on yelling.</p>
<p><b>Crucify, crucify </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταυρου, σταυρου</span></span>). Present active imperative. Go on with the crucifixion. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:13">Mark 15:13</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταυρωσον</span></span> (first aorist active imperative), do it now and be done with it. No doubt some shouted one form, some another. </p>
