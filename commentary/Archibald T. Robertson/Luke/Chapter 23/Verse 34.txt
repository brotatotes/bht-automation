 Father forgive them  (Πατερ, αφες αυτοις). Second aorist active imperative of αφιημ, with dative case. Some of the oldest and best documents do not contain this verse, and yet, while it is not certain that it is a part of Luke's Gospel, it is certain that Jesus spoke these words, for they are utterly unlike any one else. Jesus evidently is praying for the Roman soldiers, who were only obeying, but not for the Sanhedrin.Cast lots  (εβαλον κληρον). Second aorist active indicative of βαλλω. See Mark 15:24; Matthew 27:35. John 19:23. shows how the lot was cast for the seamless garment, the four soldiers dividing the other garments.
