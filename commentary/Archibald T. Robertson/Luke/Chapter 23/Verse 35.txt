<p><b> The people stood beholding </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστηκε</span></span>). Past perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>, intransitive and like imperfect. A graphic picture of the dazed multitude, some of whom may have been in the Triumphal Entry on Sunday morning.</p>
<p><b>Scoffed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεμυκτηριζον</span></span>). Imperfect active, perhaps inchoative, began to turn up (out, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span>) at the dying Christ. The language comes from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:7">Psalms 22:7</span>.</p>
<p><b>The Christ of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Χριστος του θεου</span></span>). He had claimed to be just this (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:67">Luke 22:67</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:70">Luke 22:70</span>). The sarcastic sneer (he saved others; let him save others, for himself he cannot save) is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:31">Mark 15:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:42">Matthew 27:42</span>. Luke alone gives the contemptuous use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span> (this fellow) and the fling in "the elect" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εκλεκτος</span></span>). These rulers were having their day at last. </p>
