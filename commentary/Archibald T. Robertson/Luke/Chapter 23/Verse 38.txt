 A superscription  (επιγραφη). Mark 15:26 has "the superscription of his accusation" Matthew 27:37, "his accusation," John 19:19 "a title." But they all refer to the charge written at the top on the cross giving, as was the custom, the accusation on which the criminal was condemned, with his name and residence. Put all the reports together and we have: This is Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews. This full title appeared in Latin for law, in Aramaic for the Jews, in Greek for everybody (John 19:20).
