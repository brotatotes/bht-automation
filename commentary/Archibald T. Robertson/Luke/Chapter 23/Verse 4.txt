<p><b> The multitude </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους οχλους</span></span>). The first mention of them. It is now after daybreak. The procession of the Sanhedrin would draw a crowd (Plummer) and some may have come to ask for the release of a prisoner (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:8">Mark 15:8</span>). There was need of haste if the condemnation went through before friends of Jesus came.</p>
<p><b>I find no fault </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν ευρισκω αιτιον</span></span>). In the N.T. Luke alone uses this old adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτιος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:4">Luke 23:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:14">Luke 23:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:22">Luke 23:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:40">Acts 19:40</span>) except <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:9">Luke 5:9</span>. It means one who is the author, the cause of or responsible for anything. Luke does not give the explanation of this sudden decision of Pilate that Jesus is innocent. Evidently he held a careful examination before he delivered his judgment on the case. That conversation is given in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:33-38">John 18:33-38</span>. Pilate took Jesus inside the palace from the upper gallery (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:33">John 18:33</span>) and then came out and rendered his decision to the Sanhedrin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:38">John 18:38</span>) who would not go into the palace of Pilate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:28">John 18:28</span>). </p>
