<p><b> Nothing amiss </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν ατοπον</span></span>). Nothing out of place (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοπος</span></span>, place). Old word, three times in the N.T.

This can only mean that this robber accepts the claims of Jesus to be true. He is dying for claiming to be Messiah, as he is. </p>
