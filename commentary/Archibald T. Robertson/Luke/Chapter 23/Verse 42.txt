<p><b> In thy kingdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την βασιλειαν σου</span></span>, text of Westcott and Hort or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τε βασιλεια σου</span></span>, margin). Probably no difference in sense is to be found, for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> are essentially the same preposition. He refers to the Messianic rule of Jesus and begs that Jesus will remember him. It is not clear whether he hopes for immediate blessing or only at the judgment. </p>
