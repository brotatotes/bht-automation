<p><b> Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σημερον μετ' εμου εση εν τω παραδεισω</span></span>). However crude may have been the robber's Messianic ideas Jesus clears the path for him. He promises him immediate and conscious fellowship after death with Christ in Paradise which is a Persian word and is used here not for any supposed intermediate state; but the very bliss of heaven itself. This Persian word was used for an enclosed park or pleasure ground (so Xenophon). The word occurs in two other passages in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:4">2 Corinthians 12:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:7">Revelation 2:7</span>), in both of which the reference is plainly to heaven. Some Jews did use the word for the abode of the pious dead till the resurrection, interpreting "Abraham's bosom" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:22">Luke 16:22</span>) in this sense also. But the evidence for such an intermediate state is too weak to warrant belief in it. </p>
