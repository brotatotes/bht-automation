<p><b> The sun's light failing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ηλιου εκλειποντος</span></span>). Genitive absolute of the present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλειπω</span></span>, an old verb, to leave out, omit, pass by, to fail, to die. The word was used also of the eclipse of the sun or moon. But this was impossible at this time because the moon was full at the passover. Hence many documents change this correct text to "the sun was darkened" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσκοτισθη ο ηλιος</span></span>) to obviate the difficulty about the technical eclipse. But the sun can be darkened in other ways. In a London fog at noon the street lights are often turned on. The Revised Version translates it correctly, "the sun's light failing." Leave the darkness unexplained.</p>
<p><b>In the midst </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεσον</span></span>).
