<p><b> Stood afar off </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστηκεισαν απο μακροθεν</span></span>).

Melancholy picture of the inner circle of the acquaintances of Jesus and the faithful band of women from Galilee.</p>
<p><b>Seeing these things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορωσα ταυτα</span></span>). And helpless either to prevent them or to understand them. They could only stand and look with blinded eyes. </p>
