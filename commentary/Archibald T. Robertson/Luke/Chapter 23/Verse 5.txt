<p><b> But they were the more urgent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε επισχυον</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισχυω</span></span>, to give added (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>) strength (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυω</span></span>).

<p><b>He stirred up the people </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανασειε τον λαον</span></span>). This compound is rare, though old (Thucydides), to shake up (back and forth).

These very words occur in the address of Peter to the group in the house of Cornelius (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:37">Acts 10:37</span>). The idiomatic use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρξαμενος</span></span> appears also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span>. Galilee (Grote) was the mother of seditious men (see Josephus). </p>
