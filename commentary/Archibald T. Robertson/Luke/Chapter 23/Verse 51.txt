<p><b> He had not consented to their counsel and deed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος ουκ ην συνκατατεθειμενος τη βουλη κα τη πραξε αυτων</span></span>). This parenthesis is given by Luke alone and explains that, though a councillor (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλευτης</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:43">Mark 5:43</span>) he had not agreed to the vote of the Sanhedrin. It is fairly certain that both Joseph and Nicodemus were suspected of sympathy with Jesus and so were not invited to the trial of Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Was looking for </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεδεχετο</span></span>). Imperfect middle. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:43">Mark 15:43</span> has the periphrastic imperfect (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην προσδεχομενος</span></span>). </p>
