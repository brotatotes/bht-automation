<p><b> The day of the Preparation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερα παρασκευης</span></span>). The technical Jewish phrase for the day before the sabbath for which see discussion on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:62">Matthew 27:62</span>.</p>
<p><b>Drew on </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεφωσκεν</span></span>). Imperfect active, began to dawn or give light. However, it was sundown, not sunrise when the Jewish sabbath (twenty-four-hour day) began. The confusion is to us, not to the Jews or the readers of the Greek New Testament. Luke is not speaking of the twelve-hour day which began with sunrise, but the twenty-four-hour day which began with sunset. </p>
