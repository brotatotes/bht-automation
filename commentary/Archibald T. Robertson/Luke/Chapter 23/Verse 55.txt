<p><b> Had come with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν συνεληλυθυια</span></span>). Periphrastic past perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνερχομα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Followed after </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακολουθησασα</span></span>). Aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακολουθεω</span></span>, an old verb, but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:17">Acts 16:17</span>. It is possible that they followed after Joseph and Nicodemus so that they "beheld the tomb," (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθεασαντο το μνημειον</span></span>), and also "how his body was laid" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ετεθη το σωμα αυτου</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>. They may in fact, have witnessed the silent burial from a distance. The Syriac Sinaitic and the Syriac Curetonian give it thus: "and the women, who came with Him from Galilee went to the sepulchre in their footsteps, and saw the body when they had brought it in there." At any rate the women saw "that" and "how" the body of Jesus was laid in this new tomb of Joseph in the rocks. </p>
