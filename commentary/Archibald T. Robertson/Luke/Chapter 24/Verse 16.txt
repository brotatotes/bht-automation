 Were holden that they should not know him  (εκρατουντο του μη επιγνωνα αυτον). Imperfect passive of κρατεω, continued being held, with the ablative case of the articular infinitive, "from recognizing him," from knowing him fully (επι-γνωνα, ingressive aorist of επιγινωσκο). The μη is a redundant negative after the negative idea in εκρατουντο.
