<p><b> But we hoped </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις δε ηλπιζομεν</span></span>). Imperfect active, we were hoping. Note emphasis in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις</span></span> (we).</p>
<p><b>Redeem </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυτρουσθα</span></span>). From the bondage of Rome, no doubt.</p>
<p><b>Yea and beside all this </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα γε κα συν πασιν τουτοις</span></span>). Particles pile up to express their emotions.</p>
<p><b>Yea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span> here affirmative, as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:22">Luke 24:22</span>, not adversative) at least (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γε</span></span>) also (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>) together with all these things (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν πασιν τουτοις</span></span>). Like Pelion on Ossa with them in their perplexity.</p>
<p><b>Now the third day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τριτην ταυτην ημεραν αγε</span></span>). A difficult idiom for the English. "One is keeping this a third day." And he is still dead and we are still without hope. </p>
