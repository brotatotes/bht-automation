<p><b> Had seen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εωρακενα</span></span>). Perfect active infinitive in indirect assertion after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγουσα</span></span>. Same construction for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηιν</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγουσιν</span></span>. But all this was too indirect and uncertain (women and angels) for Cleopas and his companion. </p>
