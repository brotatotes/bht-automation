<p><b> Of the Lord Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του κυριου Ιησου</span></span>). The Western family of documents does not have these words and Westcott and Hort bracket them as Western non-interpolations. There are numerous instances of this shorter Western text in this chapter. For a discussion of the subject see my <i>Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament</i>, pp. 225-237. This precise combination (the Lord Jesus) is common in the Acts, but nowhere else in the Gospels. </p>
