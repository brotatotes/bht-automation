<p><b> Myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος</span></span>). Jesus is patient with his proof. They were convinced before he came into the room, but that psychological shock had unnerved them all.</p>
<p><b>Handle </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψηλαφησατε</span></span>). This very word is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span> as proof of the actual human body of Jesus. It is an old verb for touching with the hand.</p>
<p><b>Flesh and bones </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκα κα οστεα</span></span>). At least this proves that he is not just a ghost and that Jesus had a real human body against the Docetic Gnostics who denied it. But clearly we are not to understand that our resurrection bodies will have "flesh and bones." Jesus was in a transition state and had not yet been glorified. The mystery remains unsolved, but it was proof to the disciples of the identity of the Risen Christ with Jesus of Nazareth. </p>
