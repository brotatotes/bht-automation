<p><b> While they were perplexed thereabout </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω απορεισθα αυτας περ τουτου</span></span>). Luke's common Hebraistic idiom, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> with the articular infinitive (present passive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απορεισθα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απορεω</span></span>, to lose one's way) and the accusative of general reference.</p>
<p><b>Two men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανδρες δυο</span></span>). Men, not women. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:5">Mark 16:5</span> speaks of a young man (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεανισκον</span></span>) while <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:5">Matthew 28:5</span> has "an angel." We need not try to reconcile these varying accounts which agree in the main thing. The angel looked like a man and some remembered two. In verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:23">Luke 24:23</span> Cleopas and his companion call them "angels."</p>
<p><b>Stood by </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεστησαν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφιστημ</span></span>. This common verb usually means to step up suddenly, to burst upon one.</p>
<p><b>In dazzling apparel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εσθητ αστραπτουση</span></span>). This is the correct text. This common simplex verb occurs only twice in the N.T., here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:24">Luke 17:24</span> (the Transfiguration). It has the same root as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αστραπη</span></span> (lightning). The "men" had the garments of "angels." </p>
