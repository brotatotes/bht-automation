<p><b> Disbelieved for joy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιστουντων αυτων απο της χαρας</span></span>). Genitive absolute and a quite understandable attitude. They were slowly reconvinced, but it was after all too good to be true.</p>
<p><b>Anything to eat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βρωσιμον</span></span>). Only here in the N.T., though an old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιβρωσκω</span></span>, to eat. </p>
