<p><b> Opened he their mind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διηνοιξεν αυτων τον νουν</span></span>). The same verb as that in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:31">Luke 24:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:32">Luke 24:32</span> about the eyes and the Scriptures. Jesus had all these years been trying to open their minds that they might understand the Scriptures about the Messiah and now at last he makes one more effort in the light of the Cross and the Resurrection. They can now see better the will and way of God, but they will still need the power of the Holy Spirit before they will fully know the mind of Christ. </p>
