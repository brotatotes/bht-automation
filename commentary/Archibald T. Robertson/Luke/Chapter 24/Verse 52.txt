<p><b> Worshipped him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνησαντες αυτον</span></span>). Here again we have one of Westcott and Hort's Western non-interpolations that may be genuine or not.</p>
<p><b>With great joy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα χαρας μεγαλης</span></span>). Now that the Ascension has come they are no longer in despair. Joy becomes the note of victory as it is today. No other note can win victories for Christ. The bells rang in heaven to greet the return of Jesus there, but he set the carillon of joy to ringing on earth in human hearts in all lands and for all time. </p>
