<p><b> He is not here, but is risen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν ωδε, αλλα ηγερθη</span></span>). Another Western non-interpolation according to Westcott and Hort. The words are genuine at any rate in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:6">Mark 16:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:7">Matthew 28:7</span>.</p>
<p><b>The third day rise again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη τριτη ημερα αναστηνα</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:22">Luke 9:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:32">Luke 18:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:33">Luke 18:33</span> where Jesus plainly foretold this fact. And yet they had forgotten it, for it ran counter to all their ideas and hopes. </p>
