<p><b> From the tomb </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο του μνημειου</span></span>). Some documents omit these words. This word for tomb is like our "memorial" from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιμνησκω</span></span>, to remind.</p>
<p><b>Told </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηγγειλαν</span></span>). It was a wonderful proclamation. Luke does not separate the story of Mary Magdalene from that of the other women as John does (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:2-18">John 20:2-18</span>). </p>
