<p><b> Also publicans </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τελωνα</span></span>). We have had the word already in Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:46">Matthew 5:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:10">Matthew 9:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:19">Matthew 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:17">Matthew 18:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:31">Matthew 21:31</span>) and Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:15">Mark 11:15</span>). It is sometimes coupled with harlots and other sinners, the outcasts of society. The word is made up from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελος</span></span>, tax, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωνεομα</span></span>, to buy, and is an old one. The renter or collector of taxes was not popular anywhere, but least of all when a Jew collected taxes for the Romans and did it by terrible graft and extortions.</p>
<p><b>Extort </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρασσετε</span></span>). The verb means only to do or practice, but early the tax-collectors learned how to "do" the public as regular "blood-suckers." Lucian links them with crows and sycophants. </p>
