<p><b> Soldiers also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα στρατευομενο</span></span>). Men on service, <i>militantes</i> rather than <i>milites</i> (Plummer). So Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:4">2 Timothy 2:4</span>. An old word like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρατιωτης</span></span>, soldier. Some of these soldiers acted as police to help the publicans. But they were often rough and cruel.</p>
<p><b>Do violence to no man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδενα διασεισητε</span></span>). Here only in the N.T., but in the LXX and common in ancient Greek. It means to shake (seismic disturbance, earthquake) thoroughly (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) and so thoroughly to terrify, to extort money or property by intimidating (3Macc. 7:21). The Latin employs <i>concutere</i>, so. It was a process of blackmail to which Socrates refers (Xenophon, <i>Memorabilia</i>, ii. 9,1). This was a constant temptation to soldiers. Might does not make right with Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Neither exact anything wrongfully </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδε συκοφαντησητε</span></span>). In Athens those whose business it was to inform against any one whom they might find exporting figs out of Attica were called fig-showers or sycophants (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συκοφαντα</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συκον</span></span>, fig, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαινω</span></span>, show. Some modern scholars reject this explanation since no actual examples of the word meaning merely a fig-shower have been found. But without this view it is all conjectural. From the time of Aristophanes on it was used for any malignant informer or calumniator. These soldiers were tempted to obtain money by informing against the rich, blackmail again. So the word comes to mean to accuse falsely. The sycophants came to be a regular class of informers or slanderers in Athens. Socrates is quoted by Xenophon as actually advising Crito to employ one in self-defence, like the modern way of using one gunman against another. Demosthenes pictures a sycophant as one who "glides about the market like a scorpion, with his venomous sting all ready, spying out whom he may surprise with misfortune and ruin and from whom he can most easily extort money, by threatening him with an action dangerous in its consequences" (quoted by Vincent). The word occurs only in Luke in the N.T., here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:8">Luke 19:8</span> in the confession of Zaccheus. It occurs in the LXX and often in the old Greek.</p>
<p><b>Be content with your wages </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρκεισθε τοις οψωνιοις υμων</span></span>). Discontent with wages was a complaint of mercenary soldiers. This word for wages was originally anything cooked (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψον</span></span>, cooked food), and bought (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωνεομα</span></span>, to buy). Hence, "rations," "pay," wages. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Οψαριον</span></span>, diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψον</span></span>, was anything eaten with bread like broiled fish. So <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψωνιον</span></span> comes to mean whatever is bought to be eaten with bread and then a soldier's pay or allowance (Polybius, and other late Greek writers) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:7">1 Corinthians 9:7</span>. Paul uses the singular of a preacher's pay (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:8">2 Corinthians 11:8</span>) and the plural of the wages of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:23">Romans 6:23</span>) = death (death is the diet of sin). </p>
