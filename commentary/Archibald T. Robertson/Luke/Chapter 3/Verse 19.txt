 Reproved  (ελεγχομενος). Present passive participle of ελεγχω, an old verb meaning in Homer to treat with contempt, then to convict (Matthew 18:15), to expose (Ephesians 5:11), to reprove as here. The substantive ελεγχος means proof (Hebrews 11:1) and ελεγμος, censure (2 Timothy 3:16). Josephus (Ant. XVIII. V.4) shows how repulsive this marriage was to Jewish feeling.Evil things  (πονηρων). Incorporated into the relative sentence. The word is from πονοσ, πονεω, toil, work, and gives the active side of evil, possibly with the notion of work itself as evil or at least an annoyance. The "evil eye" (οφθαλμος πονηρος in Mark 7:22) was a "mischief working eye" (Vincent). In Matthew 6:23 it is a diseased eye. So Satan is "the evil one" (Matthew 5:37; Matthew 6:13, etc.). It is a very common adjective in the N.T. as in the older Greek.Had done  (εποιησεν). Aorist active indicative, not past perfect, merely a summary constative aorist, he did .
