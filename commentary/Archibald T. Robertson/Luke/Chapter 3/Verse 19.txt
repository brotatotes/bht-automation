The substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγχος</span></span> means proof (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγμος</span></span>, censure (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:16">2 Timothy 3:16</span>).

<p><b>Evil things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονηρων</span></span>). Incorporated into the relative sentence. The word is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονοσ, πονεω</span></span>, toil, work, and gives the active side of evil, possibly with the notion of work itself as evil or at least an annoyance.

In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:23">Matthew 6:23</span> it is a diseased eye.
