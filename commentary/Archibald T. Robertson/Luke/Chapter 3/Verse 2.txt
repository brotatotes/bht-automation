<p><b> The Word of God came unto John </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο ρημα θεου επ Ιωανην</span></span>). The great epoch marked by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ρημα θεου</span></span> is some particular utterance of God (Plummer), common in LXX, here alone in the N.T. Then John is introduced as the son of Zacharias according to Chapter 1. Matthew describes him as the Baptist, Mark as the Baptizer. No other Gospel mentions Zacharias. Mark begins his Gospel here, but Matthew and Luke have two Infancy Chapters before. Luke alone tells of the coming of the word to John. All three Synoptics locate him "in the wilderness" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη ερημω</span></span>) as here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:4">Mark 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:1">Matthew 3:1</span> (adding "of Judea"). </p>
