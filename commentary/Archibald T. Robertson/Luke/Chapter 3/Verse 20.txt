<p><b> Added </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεθηκεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative (kappa aorist). Common verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προστιθημ</span></span>) in all Greek. In N.T. chiefly in Luke and Acts. Hippocrates used it of applying wet sponges to the head and Galen of applying a decoction of acorns. There is no evidence that Luke has a medical turn to the word here. The absence of the conjunction <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> (that) before the next verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεκλεισεν</span></span> (shut up) is asyndeton. This verb literally means</p>
<p><b>shut down </b>, possibly with a reference to closing down the door of the dungeon, though it makes sense as a perfective use of the preposition, like our "shut up" without a strict regard to the idea of "down." It is an old and common verb, though here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span> only in the N.T. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:3">Matthew 14:3</span> for further statement about the prison. </p>
