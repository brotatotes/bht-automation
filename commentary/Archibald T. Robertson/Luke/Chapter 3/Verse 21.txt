 When all the people were baptised  (εν τω βαπτισθηνα απαντα τον λαον). The use of the articular aorist infinitive here with εν bothers some grammarians and commentators. There is no element of time in the aorist infinitive. It is simply punctiliar action, literally "in the being baptized as to all the people." Luke does not say that all the people were baptized before Jesus came or were baptized at the same time. It is merely a general statement that Jesus was baptized in connexion with or at the time of the baptizing of the people as a whole.Jesus also having been baptized  (κα Ιησου βαπτισθεντος). Genitive absolute construction, first aorist passive participle. In Luke's sentence the baptism of Jesus is merely introductory to the descent of the Holy Spirit and the voice of the Father. For the narrative of the baptism see Mark 1:9; Matthew 3:13-16.And praying  (κα προσευχομενου). Alone in Luke who so often mentions the praying of Jesus. Present participle and so naturally meaning that the heaven was opened while Jesus was praying though not necessarily in answer to his prayer.The heaven was opened  (ανεωιχθηνα τον ουρανον). First aorist passive infinitive with double augment, whereas the infinitive is not supposed to have any augment. The regular form would be ανοιχθηνα as in D (Codex Bezae). So the augment appears in the future indicative κατεαξε (Matthew 12:20) and the second aorist passive subjunctive κατεαγωσιν (John 19:31). Such unusual forms appear in the Koine. This infinitive here with the accusative of general reference is the subject of εγενετο (it came to pass). Matthew 3:16 uses the same verb, but Mark 1:10 has σχιζομενους, rent asunder.
