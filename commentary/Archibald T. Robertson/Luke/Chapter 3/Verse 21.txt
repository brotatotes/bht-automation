<p><b> When all the people were baptised </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω βαπτισθηνα απαντα τον λαον</span></span>). The use of the articular aorist infinitive here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> bothers some grammarians and commentators. There is no element of time in the aorist infinitive. It is simply punctiliar action, literally "in the being baptized as to all the people." Luke does not say that all the people were baptized before Jesus came or were baptized at the same time. It is merely a general statement that Jesus was baptized in connexion with or at the time of the baptizing of the people as a whole.</p>
<p><b>Jesus also having been baptized </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα Ιησου βαπτισθεντος</span></span>). Genitive absolute construction, first aorist passive participle. In Luke's sentence the baptism of Jesus is merely introductory to the descent of the Holy Spirit and the voice of the Father. For the narrative of the baptism see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:9">Mark 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:13-16">Matthew 3:13-16</span>.</p>
<p><b>And praying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα προσευχομενου</span></span>). Alone in Luke who so often mentions the praying of Jesus. Present participle and so naturally meaning that the heaven was opened while Jesus was praying though not necessarily in answer to his prayer.</p>
<p><b>The heaven was opened </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεωιχθηνα τον ουρανον</span></span>). First aorist passive infinitive with double augment, whereas the infinitive is not supposed to have any augment. The regular form would be <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιχθηνα</span></span> as in D (Codex Bezae). So the augment appears in the future indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεαξε</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:20">Matthew 12:20</span>) and the second aorist passive subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεαγωσιν</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:31">John 19:31</span>). Such unusual forms appear in the <i>Koine</i>. This infinitive here with the accusative of general reference is the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span> (it came to pass). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span> uses the same verb, but <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:10">Mark 1:10</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχιζομενους</span></span>, rent asunder. </p>
