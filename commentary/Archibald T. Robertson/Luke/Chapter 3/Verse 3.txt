<p><b> All the region round about Jordan </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασαν περιχωρον του Ιορδανου</span></span>). The wilderness was John's abode (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:80">Luke 1:80</span>) so that he began preaching where he was. It was the plain (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+13:10">Genesis 13:10</span>) or valley of the Jordan, El Ghor, as far north as Succoth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+4:17">2 Chronicles 4:17</span>). Sometimes he was on the eastern bank of the Jordan (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:40">John 10:40</span>), though usually on the west side. His baptizing kept him near the river.</p>
<p><b>The baptism of repentance unto remission of sins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισμα μετανοιας εις αφεσιν αμαρτιων</span></span>). The same phrase as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:4">Mark 1:4</span>, which see for discussion of these important words. The word remission (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεσις</span></span>) "occurs in Luke more frequently than in all the other New Testament writers combined" (Vincent). In medical writers it is used for the relaxing of disease. </p>
