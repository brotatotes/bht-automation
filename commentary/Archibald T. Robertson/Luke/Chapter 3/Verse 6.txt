<p><b> All flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασα σαρξ</span></span>). Used in the N.T. of the human race alone, though in the LXX brutes are included.</p>
<p><b>The salvation of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το σοτηριον του θεου</span></span>). The saving act of God. This phrase aptly describes Luke's Gospel which has in mind the message of Christ for all men. It is the universal Gospel. </p>
