<p><b> Full of the Holy Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρης πνευματος αγιου</span></span>). An evident allusion to the descent of the Holy Spirit on Jesus at his baptism (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:21">Luke 3:21</span>). The distinctness of the Persons in the Trinity is shown there, but with evident unity. One recalls also Luke's account of the overshadowing of Mary by the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:35">Luke 1:35</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:1">Matthew 4:1</span> says that "Jesus was led of the Spirit" while <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:12">Mark 1:12</span> states that "the Spirit driveth him forth" which see for discussion. "Jesus had been endowed with supernatural power; and He was tempted to make use of it in furthering his own interests without regard to the Father's will" (Plummer).</p>
<p><b>Was led by the Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγετο εν το πνευματ</span></span>). Imperfect passive, continuously led. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εν</span></span> may be the instrumental use as often, for <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:1">Matthew 4:1</span> has here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο</span></span> of direct agency. But Matthew has the aorist passive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηχθη</span></span> which may be ingressive as he has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την ερημον</span></span> (into the wilderness) while Luke has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω ερημω</span></span> (in the wilderness). At any rate Luke affirms that Jesus was now continuously under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Hence in this same sentence he mentions the Spirit twice.</p>
<p><b>During the forty days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερας τεσσερακοντα</span></span>). Accusative of duration of time, to be connected with "led" not with "tempted." He was led in the Spirit during these forty days (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+8:2">Deuteronomy 8:2</span>, forty years). The words are amphibolous also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:13">Mark 1:13</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:2">Matthew 4:2</span> seems to imply that the three recorded temptations came at the close of the fasting for forty days. That can be true and yet what Luke states be true also. These three may be merely specimens and so "representative of the struggle which continued throughout the whole period" (Plummer). </p>
