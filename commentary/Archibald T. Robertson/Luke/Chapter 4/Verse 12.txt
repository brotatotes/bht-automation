<p><b> It is said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρητα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative, stands said, a favourite way of quoting Scripture in the N.T. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:7">Matthew 4:7</span> we have the usual "it is written" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγραπτα</span></span>). Here Jesus quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+6:16">Deuteronomy 6:16</span>. Each time he uses Deuteronomy against the devil. The LXX is quoted. It is the volitive future indicative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span>, a common prohibition. Jesus points out to the devil that testing God is not trusting God (Plummer). </p>
