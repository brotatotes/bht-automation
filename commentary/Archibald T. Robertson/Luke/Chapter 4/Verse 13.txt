<p><b> Every temptation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα πειρασμον</span></span>). These three kinds exhaust the avenues of approach (the appetites, the nerves, the ambitions). Satan tried them all. They formed a cycle (Vincent). Hence "he was in all points tempted like as we are" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>). "The enemy tried all his weapons, and was at all points defeated" (Plummer). Probably all during the forty days the devil tempted him, but three are representatives of all.</p>
<p><b>For a season </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ καιρου</span></span>). Until a good opportunity should return, the language means. We are thus to infer that the devil returned to his attack from time to time. In the Garden of Gethsemane he tempted Jesus more severely than here. He was here trying to thwart the purpose of Jesus to go on with his Messianic plans, to trip him at the start. In Gethsemane the devil tried to make Jesus draw back from the culmination of the Cross with all its agony and horror. The devil attacked Jesus by the aid of Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:33">Mark 8:33</span>), through the Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:40">John 8:40</span>), besides Gethsemane (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:42">Luke 22:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:53">Luke 22:53</span>). </p>
