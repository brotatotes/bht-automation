<p><b> Returned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεστρεψεν</span></span>). Luke does not fill in the gap between the temptations in the wilderness of Judea and the Galilean Ministry. He follows the outline of Mark. It is John's Gospel alone that tells of the year of obscurity (Stalker) in various parts of the Holy Land.</p>
<p><b>In the power of the Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη δυναμε του πνευματος</span></span>). Luke in these two verses (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:14">Luke 4:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:15">Luke 4:15</span>) gives a description of the Galilean Ministry with three marked characteristics (Plummer): the power of the spirit, rapid spread of Christ's fame, use of the Jewish synagogues. Luke often notes the power of the Holy Spirit in the work of Christ. Our word dynamite is this same word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις</span></span> (power).</p>
<p><b>A fame </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φημη</span></span>). An old Greek word found in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:26">Matthew 9:26</span>. It is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φημ</span></span>, to say. Talk ran rapidly in every direction. It assumes the previous ministry as told by John. </p>
