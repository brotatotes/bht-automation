<p><b> And he taught </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αυτος εδιδασκεν</span></span>). Luke is fond of this mode of transition so that it is not certain that he means to emphasize "he himself" as distinct from the rumour about him. It is the imperfect tense, descriptive of the habit of Jesus. The synagogues were an open door to Jesus before the hostility of the Pharisees was aroused.</p>
<p><b>Being glorified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαζομενος</span></span>). Present passive participle, durative action like the imperfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιδασκεν</span></span>. General admiration of Jesus everywhere. He was the wonder teacher of his time. Even the rabbis had not yet learned how to ridicule and oppose Jesus. </p>
