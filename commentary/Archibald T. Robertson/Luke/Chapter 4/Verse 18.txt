<p><b> Anointed me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχρισεν με</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χριω</span></span> from which</p>
<p><b>Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστος</span></span>) is derived, the Anointed One. Isaiah is picturing the Jubilee year and the release of captives and the return from the Babylonian exile with the hope of the Messiah through it all. Jesus here applies this Messianic language to himself. "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me" as was shown at the baptism (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:21">Luke 3:21</span>) where he was also "anointed" for his mission by the Father's voice (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:22">Luke 3:22</span>).</p>
<p><b>To the poor </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πτωχοις</span></span>). Jesus singles this out also as one of the items to tell John the Baptist in prison (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:22">Luke 7:22</span>). Our word <i>Gospel</i> is a translation of the Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ευαγγελιον</span></span>, and it is for the poor.</p>
<p><b>He hath sent me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεσταλκεν με</span></span>). Change of tense to perfect active indicative. He is now on that mission here. Jesus is God's <i>Apostle</i> to men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>, Whom thou didst send).</p>
<p><b>Proclaim </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυξα</span></span>). As a herald like Noah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>).</p>
<p><b>To the captives </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιχμαλωτοις</span></span>). Prisoners of war will be released (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιχμη</span></span>, a spear point, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλωτος</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλισκομα</span></span>, to be captured). Captured by the spear point. Common word, but here only in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Set at liberty </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστειλα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστελλω</span></span>. Same verb as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεσταλκεν</span></span>, above. Brought in here from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:6">Isaiah 58:6</span>. Plummer suggests that Luke inserts it here from memory. But Jesus could easily have turned back the roll and read it so.</p>
<p><b>Them that are bruised </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεθραυσμενους</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θραυω</span></span>, an old verb, but here only in the N.T. It means to break in pieces broken in heart and often in body as well. One loves to think that Jesus felt it to be his mission to mend broken hearts like pieces of broken earthenware, real rescue-mission work. Jesus mends them and sets them free from their limitations. </p>
