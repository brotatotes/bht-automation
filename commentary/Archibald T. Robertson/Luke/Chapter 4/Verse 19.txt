 The acceptable year of the Lord  (ενιαυτον Κυριου δεκτον). He does not mean that his ministry is to be only one year in length as Clement of Alexandria and Origen argued. That is to turn figures into fact. The Messianic age has come, Jesus means to say. On the first day of the year of Jubilee the priests with sound of trumpet proclaimed the blessings of that year (Leviticus 25:8-17). This great passage justly pictures Christ's conception of his mission and message.
