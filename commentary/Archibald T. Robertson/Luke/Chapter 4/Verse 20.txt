<p><b> He closed the book </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πτυξας το βιβλιον</span></span>). Aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πτυσσω</span></span>. Rolled up the roll and gave it back to the attendant who had given it to him and who put it away again in its case.</p>
<p><b>Sat down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθισεν</span></span>). Took his seat there as a sign that he was going to speak instead of going back to his former seat. This was the usual Jewish attitude for public speaking and teaching (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:3">Luke 5:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:1">Mark 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:13">Acts 16:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>Were fastened on him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν ατενιζοντες αυτω</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect active and so a vivid description. Literally, the eyes of all in the synagogue were gazing fixedly upon him. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατενιζω</span></span> occurs in Aristotle and the Septuagint. It is from the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατενης</span></span> and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεινω</span></span>, to stretch, and copulative or intensive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative. The word occurs in the N.T. here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:56">Luke 22:56</span>, ten times in Acts, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:13">2 Corinthians 3:13</span>. Paul uses it of the steady eager gaze of the people at Moses when he came down from the mountain when he had been communing with God. There was something in the look of Jesus here that held the people spellbound for the moment, apart from the great reputation with which he came to them. In small measure every effective speaker knows what it is to meet the eager expectations of an audience. </p>
