<p><b> Doubtless </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντως</span></span>). Adverb. Literally, at any rate, certainly, assuredly. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:22">Acts 21:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:4">Acts 28:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>This parable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την παραβολην ταυτην</span></span>). See discussion on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:13">Luke 4:13</span>. Here the word has a special application to a crisp proverb which involves a comparison. The word physician is the point of comparison. Luke the physician alone gives this saying of Jesus. The proverb means that the physician was expected to take his own medicine and to heal himself. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολη</span></span> in the N.T. is confined to the Synoptic Gospels except <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9">Hebrews 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:19">Hebrews 11:19</span>. This use for a proverb occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:36">Luke 5:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:39">Luke 6:39</span>. This proverb in various forms appears not only among the Jews, but in Euripides and Aeschylus among the Greeks, and in Cicero's <i>Letters</i>. Hobart quotes the same idea from Galen, and the Chinese used to demand it of their physicians. The point of the parable seems to be that the people were expecting him to make good his claim to the Messiahship by doing here in Nazareth what they had heard of his doing in Capernaum and elsewhere. "Establish your claims by direct evidence" (Easton). This same appeal (Vincent) was addressed to Christ on the Cross (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:40">Matthew 27:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:42">Matthew 27:42</span>). There is a tone of sarcasm towards Jesus in both cases.</p>
<p><b>Heard done </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσαμεν γενομενα</span></span>). The use of this second aorist middle participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενα</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσαμεν</span></span> is a neat Greek idiom. It is punctiliar action in indirect discourse after this verb of sensation or emotion (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1040-42, 1122-24).</p>
<p><b>Do also here </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησον κα ωδε</span></span>). Ingressive aorist active imperative. Do it here in thy own country and town and do it now. Jesus applies the proverb to himself as an interpretation of their real attitude towards himself. </p>
