The interjection of these words here by Luke may indicate a break in his address, though there is no other indication of an interval here. Perhaps they only serve to introduce solemnly the new proverb like the words</p>
<p><b>Verily I say unto you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμην λεγω υμιν</span></span>). This proverb about the prophet having no honour in his own country Jesus had already applied to himself according to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:44">John 4:44</span>. Both <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:4">Mark 6:4</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:57">Matthew 13:57</span> give it in a slightly altered form on the last visit of Jesus to Nazareth. The devil had tempted Jesus to make a display of his power to the people by letting them see him floating down from the pinnacle of the temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:9-11">Luke 4:9-11</span>). </p>
