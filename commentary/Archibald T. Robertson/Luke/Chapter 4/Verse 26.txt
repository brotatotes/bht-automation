<p><b> Unto Zarephath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Σαρεπτα</span></span>). The modern village Surafend on the coast road between Tyre and Sidon.</p>
<p><b>Unto a woman that was a widow </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς γυναικα χηραν</span></span>). Literally, unto a woman a widow (like our vernacular widow woman). This is an illustration of the proverb from the life of Elijah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:8">1 Kings 17:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:9">1 Kings 17:9</span>). This woman was in the land of Sidon or Phoenicia, a heathen, where Jesus himself will go later. </p>
