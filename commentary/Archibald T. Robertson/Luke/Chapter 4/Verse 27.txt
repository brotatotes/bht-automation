<p><b> In the time of Elisha the prophet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ Ελισαιου του προφητου</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> with the genitive for "in the time of" is a good Greek idiom. The second illustration of the proverb is from the time of Elisha and is another heathen,</p>
<p><b>Naaman the Syrian </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ναιμαν ο Σψρος</span></span>). He was the lone leper that was cleansed by Elisha (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:1">2 Kings 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:14">2 Kings 5:14</span>). </p>
