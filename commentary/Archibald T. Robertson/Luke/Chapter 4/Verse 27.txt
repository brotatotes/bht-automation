 In the time of Elisha the prophet  (επ Ελισαιου του προφητου). This use of επ with the genitive for "in the time of" is a good Greek idiom. The second illustration of the proverb is from the time of Elisha and is another heathen,Naaman the Syrian  (Ναιμαν ο Σψρος). He was the lone leper that was cleansed by Elisha (2 Kings 5:1; 2 Kings 5:14).
