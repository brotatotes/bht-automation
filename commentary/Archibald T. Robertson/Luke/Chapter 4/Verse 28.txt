<p><b> They were all filled with wrath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επλησθησαν παντες θυμου</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιμπλημ</span></span> followed by the genitive case. The people of Nazareth at once caught on and saw the point of these two Old Testament illustrations of how God in two cases blessed the heathen instead of the Jewish people. The implication was evident. Nazareth was no better than Capernaum if as good. He was under no special obligation to do unusual things in Nazareth because he had been reared there. Town pride was insulted and it at once exploded in a burst of rage. </p>
