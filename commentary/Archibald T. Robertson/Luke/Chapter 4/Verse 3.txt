<p><b> The Son of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος του θεου</span></span>). No article as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:3">Matthew 4:3</span>. So refers to the relationship as Son of God rather than to the office of Messiah. Manifest reference to the words of the Father in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:22">Luke 3:22</span>. Condition of the first class as in Matthew. The devil assumes that Jesus is Son of God.</p>
<p><b>This stone </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω λιθω τουτω</span></span>). Perhaps pointing to a particular round stone that looked in shape and size like a loaf of bread. Stanley (<i>Sinai and Palestine</i>, p. 154) on Mt. Carmel found crystallizations of stones called "Elijah's melons." The hunger of Jesus opened the way for the diabolic suggestion designed to inspire doubt in Jesus toward his Father. Matthew has "these stones."</p>
<p><b>Bread </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτος</span></span>). Better "loaf." For discussion of this first temptation see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:3">Matthew 4:3</span>. Jesus felt the force of each of the temptations without yielding at all to the sin involved. See discussion on Matthew also for reality of the devil and the objective and subjective elements in the temptations. Jesus quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+8:3">Deuteronomy 8:3</span> in reply to the devil. </p>
