<p><b> Which had </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχων</span></span>). Mark has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>A spirit of an unclean demon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα δαιμονιου ακαθαρτου</span></span>). Mark has "unclean spirit." Luke's phrase here is unique in this combination. Plummer notes that Matthew has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονιον</span></span> ten times and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακαθαρτον</span></span> twice as an epithet of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span>; Mark has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονιον</span></span> thirteen times and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακαθαρτον</span></span> eleven times as an epithet of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span>. Luke's Gospel uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονιον</span></span> twenty-two times and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακαθαρτον</span></span> as an epithet, once of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονιον</span></span> as here and once of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span>. In Mark the man is in (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>) the power of the unclean spirit, while here the man "has" a spirit of an unclean demon.</p>
<p><b>With a loud voice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνη μεγαλη</span></span>). Not in Mark. Really a scream caused by the sudden contact of the demon with Jesus. </p>
