 Which had  (εχων). Mark has εν.A spirit of an unclean demon  (πνευμα δαιμονιου ακαθαρτου). Mark has "unclean spirit." Luke's phrase here is unique in this combination. Plummer notes that Matthew has δαιμονιον ten times and ακαθαρτον twice as an epithet of πνευμα; Mark has δαιμονιον thirteen times and ακαθαρτον eleven times as an epithet of πνευμα. Luke's Gospel uses δαιμονιον twenty-two times and ακαθαρτον as an epithet, once of δαιμονιον as here and once of πνευμα. In Mark the man is in (εν) the power of the unclean spirit, while here the man "has" a spirit of an unclean demon.With a loud voice  (φωνη μεγαλη). Not in Mark. Really a scream caused by the sudden contact of the demon with Jesus.
