 Ah!  (Εα). An interjection frequent in the Attic poets, but rare in prose. Apparently second person singular imperative of εαω, to permit. It is expressive of wonder, fear, indignation. Here it amounts to a diabolical screech. For the rest of the verse see discussion on Mark 1:24 and Matthew 8:29. The muzzle (φιμος) occurs literally in 1 Corinthians 9:9; 1 Timothy 5:18, and metaphorically here and Mark 1:25; Mark 4:39; Matthew 22:12.
