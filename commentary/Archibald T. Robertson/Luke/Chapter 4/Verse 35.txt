<p><b> Had thrown him down in the midst </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ριψαν αυτον εις το μεσον</span></span>). First aorist (effective) participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ριπτω</span></span>, an old verb with violent meaning, to fling, throw, hurl off or down.</p>
<p><b>Having done him no hurt </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν βλαψαν αυτον</span></span>). Luke as a physician carefully notes this important detail not in Mark. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βλαπτω</span></span>, to injure, or hurt, occurs in the N.T. only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:18">Mark 16:18</span>, though a very common verb in the old Greek. </p>
