<p><b> Amazement came </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο θαμβος</span></span>). Mark has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθαμβηθησαν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>They spake together one with another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνελαλουν προς αλληλους</span></span>). Imperfect indicative active and the reciprocal pronoun. Mark has simply the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνζητειν</span></span> (question).</p>
<p><b>For </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). We have here an ambiguous <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:45">Luke 1:45</span>, which can be either the relative "that" or the casual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> "because" or "for," as the Revised Version has it. Either makes good sense. Luke adds here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμε</span></span> (with power) to Mark's "authority" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσιαν</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>And they come out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξερχοντα</span></span>). So Luke where Mark has "and they obey him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υπακουουσιν αυτω</span></span>). </p>
