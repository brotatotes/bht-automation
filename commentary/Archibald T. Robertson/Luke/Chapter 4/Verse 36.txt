 Amazement came  (εγενετο θαμβος). Mark has εθαμβηθησαν.They spake together one with another  (συνελαλουν προς αλληλους). Imperfect indicative active and the reciprocal pronoun. Mark has simply the infinitive συνζητειν (question).For  (οτ). We have here an ambiguous οτ as in Luke 1:45, which can be either the relative "that" or the casual οτ "because" or "for," as the Revised Version has it. Either makes good sense. Luke adds here δυναμε (with power) to Mark's "authority" (εξουσιαν).And they come out  (εξερχοντα). So Luke where Mark has "and they obey him" (κα υπακουουσιν αυτω).
