<p><b> Went forth a rumour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεπορευετο ηχος</span></span>). Imperfect middle, kept on going forth. Our very word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχο</span></span> in this word. Late Greek form for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηχω</span></span> in the old Greek. Used for the roar of the waves on the shore. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:25">Luke 21:25</span>. Vivid picture of the resounding influence of this day's work in the synagogue, in Capernaum. </p>
