<p><b> He rose up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστας</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανιστημ</span></span>, a common verb. B. Weiss adds here "from the teacher's seat." Either from his seat or merely leaving the synagogue. This incident of the healing of Peter's mother-in-law is given in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:29-34">Mark 1:29-34</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14-17">Matthew 8:14-17</span>, which see for details.</p>
<p><b>Into the house of Simon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την οικιαν Σιμωνος</span></span>). "Peter's house" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14">Matthew 8:14</span>). "The house of Simon and Andrew" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:29">Mark 1:29</span>). Paul's reference to Peter's wife (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:5">1 Corinthians 9:5</span>) is pertinent. They lived together in Capernaum. This house came also to be the Capernaum home of Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Simon's wife's mother </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πενθερα του Σιμωνος</span></span>). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πενθερα</span></span> for mother-in-law is old and well established in usage. Besides the parallel passages (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:30">Mark 1:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14">Matthew 8:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:38">Luke 4:38</span>) it occurs in the N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:53">Luke 12:53</span>. The corresponding word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πενθερος</span></span>, father-in-law, occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13">John 18:13</span> alone in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Was holden with a great fever </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην συνεχομενη πυρετω μεγαλω</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect passive, the analytical tense accenting the continuous fever, perhaps chronic and certainly severe. Luke employs this verb nine times and only three others in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span> passive with diseases here; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:14">2 Corinthians 5:14</span> active; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span> passive). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:8">Acts 28:8</span> the passive "with dysentery" is like the construction here and is a common one in Greek medical writers as in Greek literature generally. Luke uses the passive with "fear," <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:37">Luke 8:37</span>, the active for holding the hands over the ears (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:57">Acts 7:57</span>) and for pressing one or holding together (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:45">Luke 8:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:43">Luke 19:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:63">Luke 22:63</span>), the direct middle for holding oneself to preaching (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:5">Acts 18:5</span>). It is followed here by the instrumental case. Hobart (<i>Medical Language of Luke</i>, p. 3) quotes Galen as dividing fevers into "great" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγαλο</span></span>) and "small" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σμικρο</span></span>). </p>
