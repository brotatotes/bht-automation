<p><b> He stood over her </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστας επανω αυτης</span></span>). Second aorist active participle. Only in Luke. Surely we are not to take Luke to mean that Jesus here took the exorcist's position and was rebuking a malignant personality. The attitude of Jesus is precisely that of any kindly sympathetic physician. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:31">Mark 1:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:15">Matthew 8:15</span> mention the touch of her hand rather than the tender look over her head.</p>
<p><b>Rebuked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επετιμησεν</span></span>). Only in Luke. Jesus bade the fever leave her as he spoke to the wind and the waves and Luke uses this same verb (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:24">Luke 8:24</span>).</p>
<p><b>Rose up and ministered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναστασα διηκονε</span></span>). Second aorist active participle as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:38">Luke 4:38</span>, but inchoative imperfect tense <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διηκονε</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονεω</span></span> (note augment of compound verb). She rose up immediately, though a long high fever usually leaves one very weak. The cure was instantaneous and complete. She began to minister at once and kept it up. </p>
