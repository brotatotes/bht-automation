<p><b> When it was day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενης ημερας</span></span>). Genitive absolute with aorist middle participle. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:35">Mark 1:35</span> notes it was "a great while before day" (which see for discussion) when Jesus rose up to go after a restless night. No doubt, because of the excitement of the previous sabbath in Capernaum. He went out to pray (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:35">Mark 1:35</span>).</p>
<p><b>Sought after him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεζητουν αυτον</span></span>). Imperfect active indicative. The multitudes kept at it until "they came unto him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλθον εως αυτου</span></span>, aorist active indicative). They accomplished their purpose, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως αυτου</span></span>, right up to him.</p>
<p><b>Would have stayed him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατειχον αυτον</span></span>). Better,</p>
<p><b>They tried to hinder him </b>. The conative imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεχω</span></span>, an old and common verb. It means either to hold fast (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:15">Luke 8:15</span>), to take, get possession of (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:9">Luke 14:9</span>) or to hold back, to retain, to restrain (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:13">Philemon 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18">Romans 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:6">Romans 7:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:6">2 Thessalonians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:42">Luke 4:42</span>). In this passage it is followed by the ablative case.</p>
<p><b>That he should not go from them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του μη πορευεσθα απ' αυτων</span></span>). Literally, "from going away from them." The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> (not) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατειχον</span></span> is the neat Greek idiom of the redundant negative after a verb of hindering like the French <i>ne</i> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1171) . </p>
