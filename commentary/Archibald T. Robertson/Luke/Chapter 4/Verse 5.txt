<p><b> The world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της οικουμενης</span></span>). The inhabited world. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:8">Matthew 4:8</span> it is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του κοσμου</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>In a moment of time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν στιγμη χρονου</span></span>). Only in Luke and the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στιγμη</span></span> nowhere else in the N.T. (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στιζω</span></span>, to prick, or puncture), a point or dot. In Demosthenes, Aristotle, Plutarch. Like our "second" of time or tick of the clock. This panorama of all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them in a moment of time was mental, a great feat of the imagination (a mental satanic "movie" performance), but this fact in no way discredits the idea of the actual visible appearance of Satan also. This second temptation in Luke is the third in Matthew's order. Luke's order is geographical (wilderness, mountain, Jerusalem). Matthew's is climacteric (hunger, nervous dread, ambition). There is a climax in Luke's order also (sense, man, God). There is no way to tell the actual order. </p>
