<p><b> Thou shalt worship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνησεις</span></span>). Satan used this verb to Jesus who turns it against him by the quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+6:13">Deuteronomy 6:13</span>. Jesus clearly perceived that one could not worship both Satan and God. He had to choose whom he would serve. Luke does not give the words, "Get thee hence, Satan" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:10">Matthew 4:10</span>), for he has another temptation to narrate. </p>
