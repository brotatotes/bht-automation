<p><b> Pressed upon him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επικεισθα</span></span>). Luke in this paragraph (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:1-11">Luke 5:1-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:16-20">Mark 1:16-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18-22">Matthew 4:18-22</span>) does not follow the chronology of Mark as he usually does. It seems reasonably clear that the renewed call of the four fishermen came before the first tour of Galilee in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:42-44">Luke 4:42-44</span>. It is here assumed that Luke is describing in his own way the incident given in Mark and Matthew above. Luke singles out Simon in a graphic way. This verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επικεισθα</span></span> is an old one and means to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιε υπον</span></span>, rest upon as of a stone on the tomb (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:38">John 11:38</span>) or of fish on the burning coals (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:9">John 21:9</span>). So it is used of a tempest (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:20">Acts 27:20</span>) and of the urgent demands for Christ's crucifixion (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:23">Luke 23:23</span>). Here it vividly pictures the eager crowds around Jesus. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εν τω επικεισθα</span></span> is a favourite idiom with Luke as we have already seen, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> with the articular infinitive in the locative case.</p>
<p><b>That </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κα</span></span> does not technically mean the declarative conjunction "that," but it is a fair rendering of the somewhat awkward idiom of Luke to a certain extent imitating the Hebrew use of <i>wav</i>.</p>
<p><b>Was standing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην εστως</span></span>). Periphrastic second past perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span> which here is equal to a practical imperfect.</p>
<p><b>By the lake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα την λιμνην</span></span>). The use of the accusative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>, alongside, after a verb of rest used to be called the pregnant use, came and was standing. But that is no longer necessary, for the accusative as the case of extension is the oldest of the cases and in later Greek regains many of the earlier uses of the other cases employed for more precise distinctions. See the same idiom in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:2">Luke 5:2</span>. We need not here stress the notion of extension. "With characteristic accuracy Luke never calls it a sea, while the others never call it a lake" (Plummer). </p>
