<p><b> Behold </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ιδου</span></span>). Quite a Hebraistic idiom, this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span> (almost like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδου</span></span> (interjection) and no verb.</p>
<p><b>Full of leprosy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρης λεπρας</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:40">Mark 1:40</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:2">Matthew 8:2</span> have simply "a leper" which see. Evidently a bad case full of sores and far advanced as Luke the physician notes. The law (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+13:12">Leviticus 13:12</span>) curiously treated advanced cases as less unclean than the earlier stages.</p>
<p><b>Fell on his face </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεσων επ προσωπον</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιπτω</span></span>, common verb. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:40">Mark 1:40</span> has "kneeling" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γονυπετων</span></span>) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:40">Matthew 8:40</span> "worshipped" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεκυνε</span></span>). All three attitudes were possible one after the other. All three Synoptics quote the identical language of the leper and the identical answer of Jesus. His condition of the third class turned on the "will" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεληις</span></span>) of Jesus who at once asserts his will (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θηλω</span></span>) and cleanses him. All three likewise mention the touch (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηψατο</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:13">Luke 5:13</span>) of Christ's hand on the unclean leper and the instantaneous cure. </p>
