<p><b> To tell no man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν ειπειν</span></span>). This is an indirect command after the verb "charged" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρηγγειλεν</span></span>). But Luke changes (<i>constructio variata</i>) to the direct quotation, a common idiom in Greek and often in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:4">Acts 1:4</span>). Here in the direct form he follows <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:43">Mark 1:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:4">Matthew 8:4</span>. See discussion there about the direction to go to the priest to receive a certificate showing his cleansing, like our release from quarantine (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+13:39">Leviticus 13:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+14:2-32">Leviticus 14:2-32</span>).</p>
<p><b>For a testimony unto them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις μαρτυριον αυτοις</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοις</span></span> (them) here is "according to sense," as we say, for it has no antecedent in the context, just to people in general. But this identical phrase with absence of direct reference occurs in Mark and Matthew, pretty good proof of the use of one by the other. Both <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:4">Matthew 8:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:14">Luke 5:14</span> follow <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:44">Mark 1:44</span>. </p>
