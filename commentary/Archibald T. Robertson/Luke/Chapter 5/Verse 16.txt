<p><b> But he withdrew himself in the deserts and prayed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος δε ην υποχωρων εν ταις ερημοις κα προσευχομενος</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfects. Literally, "But he himself was with drawing in the desert places and praying." The more the crowds came as a result of the leper's story, the more Jesus turned away from them to the desert regions and prayed with the Father. It is a picture of Jesus drawn with vivid power. The wild enthusiasm of the crowds was running ahead of their comprehension of Christ and his mission and message. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυποχωρεω</span></span> (perhaps with the notion of slipping away secretly, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο-</span></span>) is a very common Greek verb, but in the N.T. occurs in Luke alone. Elsewhere in the N.T. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναχωρεω</span></span> (to go back) appears. </p>
