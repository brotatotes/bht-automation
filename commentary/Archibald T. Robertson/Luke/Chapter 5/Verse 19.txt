<p><b> By what way they might bring him in </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιας εις ενεγκωσιν αυτον</span></span>). Deliberative subjunctive of the direct question retained in the indirect.</p>
<p><b>The housetop </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το δωμα</span></span>). Very old word. The flat roof of Jewish houses was usually reached by outside stairway. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:9">Acts 10:9</span> where Peter went for meditation.</p>
<p><b>Through the tiles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια των κεραμων</span></span>). Common and old word for the tile roof. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:4">Mark 2:4</span> speaks of digging a hole in this tile roof.</p>
<p><b>Let him down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθηκαν αυτον</span></span>). First aorist (k aorist) effective active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθιημ</span></span>, common verb. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:4">Mark 2:4</span> has historical present <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλωσ</span></span>, the verb used by Jesus to Peter and in Peter's reply (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:4">Luke 5:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>With his couch </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν τω κλινιδιω</span></span>). Also in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:24">Luke 5:24</span>. Diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλινη</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:18">Luke 5:18</span>) occurring in Plutarch and <i>Koine</i> writers. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:4">Mark 2:4</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραβαττον</span></span> (pallet).

<p><b>Into the midst before Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το μεσον εμπροσθεν του Ιησου</span></span>). The four friends had succeeded, probably each holding a rope to a corner of the pallet. It was a moment of triumph over difficulties and surprise to all in the house (Peter's apparently, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:1">Mark 2:1</span>). </p>
