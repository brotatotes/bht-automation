<p><b> Their faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την πιστιν αυτων</span></span>). In all three Gospels.</p>
<p><b>Man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπε</span></span>). Mark and Matthew have "child" or "Son" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνον</span></span>). Are forgiven (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεωντα</span></span>). This Doric form of the perfect passive indicative is for the Attic <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφειντα</span></span>. It appears also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:23">Luke 5:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:47">Luke 7:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:48">Luke 7:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:23">John 20:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:12">1 John 2:12</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:6">Mark 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:2">Matthew 9:2</span> have the present passive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιεντα</span></span>. Possibly this man's malady was due to his sin as is sometimes true (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:14">John 5:14</span>). The man had faith along with that of the four, but he was still a paralytic when Jesus forgave his sins. </p>
