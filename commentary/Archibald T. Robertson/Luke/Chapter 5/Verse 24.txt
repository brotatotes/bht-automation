<p><b> He saith unto him that was palsied </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπεν τω παραλελυμενω</span></span>). This same parenthesis right in the midst of the words of Jesus is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:11">Mark 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:6">Matthew 9:6</span>, conclusive proof of interrelation between these documents. The words of Jesus are quoted practically alike in all three Gospels, the same purpose also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ειδητε</span></span> (second perfect active subjunctive). </p>
