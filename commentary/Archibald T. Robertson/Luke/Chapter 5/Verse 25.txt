<p><b> Whereon he lay </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφ' ο κατεκειτο</span></span>). Imperfect, upon which he had been lying down. Luke uses this phrase instead of repeating <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλινιδιον</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:24">Luke 5:24</span>).</p>
<p><b>Glorifying God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοξαζων τον θεον</span></span>). As one can well imagine. </p>
