 He forsook all  (καταλιπων παντα). This detail in Luke alone. He left his profitable business for the service of Christ.Followed him  (ηκολουθε αυτω). Imperfect active, perhaps inchoative. He began at once to follow him and he kept it up. Both Mark 2:14; Matthew 9:9 have the aorist (ηκολουθησεν), perhaps ingressive.
