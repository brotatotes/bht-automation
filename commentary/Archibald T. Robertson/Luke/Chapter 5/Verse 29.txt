<p><b> A great feast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοχην μεγαλην</span></span>). Here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:13">Luke 14:13</span> only in the N.T. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοχη</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεχομα</span></span>, means reception. Occurs in Plutarch and LXX. Levi made Jesus a big reception.</p>
<p><b>Publicans and others </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελωνων κα αλλων</span></span>). Luke declines here to use "sinners" like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:15">Mark 2:15</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:10">Matthew 9:10</span> though he does so in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:30">Luke 5:30</span> and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:1">Luke 15:1</span>. None but social outcasts would eat with publicans at such a feast or barbecue, for it was a very large affair.</p>
<p><b>Were sitting at meat with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν μετ' αυτων κατακειμενο</span></span>). Literally, were reclining with them (Jesus and the disciples). It was a motley crew that Levi had brought together, but he showed courage as well as loyalty to Jesus. </p>
