<p><b> The Pharisees and their scribes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Φαρισαιο κα ο γραμματεις αυτων</span></span>). Note article with each substantive and the order, not "scribes and Pharisees," but "the Pharisees and the scribes of them" (the Pharisees). Some manuscripts omit "their," but <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:16">Mark 2:16</span> (the scribes of the Pharisees) shows that it is correct here. Some of the scribes were Sadducees. It is only the Pharisees who find fault here.</p>
<p><b>Murmured </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγογγυζον</span></span>). Imperfect active. Picturesque onomatopoetic word that sounds like its meaning. A late word used of the cooing of doves. It is like the buzzing of bees, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τονθορρυζω</span></span> of literary Greek. They were not invited to this feast and would not have come if they had been. But, not being invited, they hang on the outside and criticize the disciples of Jesus for being there. The crowd was so large that the feast may have been served out in the open court at Levi's house, a sort of reclining garden party.</p>
<p><b>The publicans and sinners </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των τελωνων κα αμαρτωλων</span></span>). Here Luke is quoting the criticism of the critics. Note one article making one group of all of them. </p>
