<p><b> To repentance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις μετανοιαν</span></span>). Alone in Luke not genuine in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:17">Mark 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:12">Matthew 9:12</span>. Only sinners would need a call to repentance, a change of mind and life. For the moment Jesus accepts the Pharisaic division between "righteous" and "sinners" to score them and to answer their criticism. At the other times he will show that they only pretend to be "righteous" and are "hypocrites" in reality. But Jesus has here blazed the path for all soul-winners. The self-satisfied are the hard ones to win and they often resent efforts to win them to Christ. </p>
