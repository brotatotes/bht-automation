<p><b> Often </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυκνα</span></span>). Only in Luke. Common word for thick, compact, often.</p>
<p><b>And make supplications </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα δεησεις ποιουντα</span></span>). Only in Luke.</p>
<p><b>But thine </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε σο</span></span>). Sharp contrast between the conduct of the disciples of Jesus and those of John and the Pharisees who here appear together as critics of Christ and his disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:18">Mark 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:14">Matthew 9:14</span>), though Luke does not bring that out sharply. It is probable that Levi had his reception for Jesus on one of the Jewish fast days and, if so, this would give special edge to their criticism. </p>
