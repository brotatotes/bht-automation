<p><b> Also a parable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα παραβολην</span></span>). There are three parables here in the answer of Jesus (the bridegroom, the patch on the garment, the wineskin). They are not called parables save here, but they are parables and Luke's language means that.</p>
<p><b>Rendeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχισας</span></span>). This in Luke alone. Common verb. Used of splitting rocks (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:51">Matthew 27:51</span>). Our word schism comes from it.</p>
<p><b>Putteth it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιβαλλε</span></span>). So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:16">Matthew 9:16</span> when <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:21">Mark 2:21</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιραπτε</span></span> (sews on). The word for "piece" or "patch" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιβλημα</span></span>) in all the three Gospels is from the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιβαλλω</span></span>, to clap on, and is in Plutarch, Arrian, LXX, though the verb is as old as Homer. See on Matthew and Mark for distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινος</span></span> (fresh), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεος</span></span> (new), and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλαιος</span></span> (old).</p>
<p><b>He will rend the new </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα το καινον σχισε</span></span>). Future active indicative. So the best MSS.</p>
<p><b>Will not agree </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου συμφωνησε</span></span>). Future active indicative. So the best manuscripts again.</p>
<p><b>With the old </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω παλαιω</span></span>). Associative instrumental case. Instead of this phrase in Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:21">Mark 2:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:16">Matthew 9:16</span> have "a worse rent" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρον σχισμα</span></span>). </p>
