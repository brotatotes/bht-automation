 Also a parable  (κα παραβολην). There are three parables here in the answer of Jesus (the bridegroom, the patch on the garment, the wineskin). They are not called parables save here, but they are parables and Luke's language means that.Rendeth  (σχισας). This in Luke alone. Common verb. Used of splitting rocks (Matthew 27:51). Our word schism comes from it.Putteth it  (επιβαλλε). So Matthew 9:16 when Mark 2:21 has επιραπτε (sews on). The word for "piece" or "patch" (επιβλημα) in all the three Gospels is from the verb επιβαλλω, to clap on, and is in Plutarch, Arrian, LXX, though the verb is as old as Homer. See on Matthew and Mark for distinction between καινος (fresh), νεος (new), and παλαιος (old).He will rend the new  (κα το καινον σχισε). Future active indicative. So the best MSS.Will not agree  (ου συμφωνησε). Future active indicative. So the best manuscripts again.With the old  (τω παλαιω). Associative instrumental case. Instead of this phrase in Luke, Mark 2:21; Matthew 9:16 have "a worse rent" (χειρον σχισμα).
