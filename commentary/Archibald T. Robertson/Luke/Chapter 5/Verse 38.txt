 Must be put  (βλητεον). This verbal adjective in -τεος rather than -τος appears here alone in the N.T. though it is common enough in Attic Greek. It is a survival of the literary style. This is the impersonal use and is transitive in sense here and governs the accusative "new wine" (οινον νεον), though the agent is not expressed (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1097).
