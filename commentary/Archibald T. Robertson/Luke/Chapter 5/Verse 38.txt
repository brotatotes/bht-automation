<p><b> Must be put </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλητεον</span></span>). This verbal adjective in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-τεος</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-τος</span></span> appears here alone in the N.T. though it is common enough in Attic Greek. It is a survival of the literary style. This is the impersonal use and is transitive in sense here and governs the accusative "new wine" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οινον νεον</span></span>), though the agent is not expressed (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1097). </p>
