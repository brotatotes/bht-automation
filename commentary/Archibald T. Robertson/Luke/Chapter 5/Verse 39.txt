<p><b> The old is good </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hο παλαιος χρηστος εστιν</span></span>). So the best MSS. rather that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρηστοτερος</span></span>, comparative (better). Westcott and Hort wrongly bracket the whole verse, though occurring in Aleph, B C L and most of the old documents. It is absent in D and some of the old Latin MSS. It is the philosophy of the obscurantist, that is here pictured by Christ. "The prejudiced person will not even try the new, or admit that it has any merits. He knows that the old is pleasant, and suits him; and that is enough; he is not going to change" (Plummer). This is Christ's picture of the reactionary Pharisees. </p>
