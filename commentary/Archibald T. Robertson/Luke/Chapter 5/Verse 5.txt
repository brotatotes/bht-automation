<p><b> Master </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστατα</span></span>). Used only by Luke in the N.T. and always in addresses to Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:24">Luke 8:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:45">Luke 8:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:33">Luke 9:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:49">Luke 9:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:13">Luke 17:13</span>). Common in the older writers for superintendent or overseer (one standing over another). This word recognizes Christ's authority.</p>
<p><b>We toiled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπιασαντες</span></span>). This verb is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">wορκ, τοιλ</span></span>) and occurs from Aristophanes on. It used to be said that the notion of weariness in toil appears only in the LXX and the N.T. But Deissmann (<i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, pp. 312f.) cites examples from inscriptions on tombstones quite in harmony with the use in the N.T. Peter's protest calls attention also to the whole night of fruitless toil.</p>
<p><b>But at thy word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ δε τω ρηματ σου</span></span>). On the base of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>. Acquiescence to show his obedience to Christ as "Master," but with no confidence whatsoever in the wisdom of this particular command. Besides, fishing in this lake was Peter's business and he really claimed superior knowledge on this occasion to that of Jesus. </p>
