<p><b> They beckoned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατενευσαν</span></span>). Possibly they were too far away for a call to be understood. Simon alone had been ordered to put out into the deep. So they used signs.</p>
<p><b>Unto their partners </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις μετεχοις</span></span>).

Both terms are here employed of the two pairs of brothers who have a business company under Simon's lead.</p>
<p><b>Help them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συλλαβεσθα</span></span>). Second aorist middle infinitive. Take hold together with and so to help.
