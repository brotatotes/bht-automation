<p><b> On a sabbath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν σαββατω</span></span>). This is the second sabbath on which Jesus is noted by Luke. The first was <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:31-41">Luke 4:31-41</span>. There was another in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1-47">John 5:1-47</span>. There is Western and Syrian (Byzantine) evidence for a very curious reading here which calls this sabbath "secondfirst" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευτεροπρωτω</span></span>). It is undoubtedly spurious, though Westcott and Hort print it in the margin. A possible explanation is that a scribe wrote "first" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτω</span></span>) on the margin because of the sabbath miracle in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:6-11">Luke 6:6-11</span>. Then another scribe recalled <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:31">Luke 4:31</span> where a sabbath is mentioned and wrote "second" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευτερω</span></span>) also on the margin. Finally a third scribe combined the two in the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευτεροπρωτω</span></span> that is not found elsewhere. If it were genuine, we should not know what it means.</p>
<p><b>Plucked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετιλλον</span></span>). Imperfect active. They were plucking as they went on through (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαπορευεσθα</span></span>). Whether wheat or barley, we do not know, not our "corn" (maize).</p>
<p><b>Did eat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησθιον</span></span>). Imperfect again. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:1">Matthew 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:23">Mark 2:23</span> for the separate acts in supposed violence of the sabbath laws.</p>
<p><b>Rubbing them in their hands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψωχοντες ταις χερσιν</span></span>). Only in Luke and only here in the N.T. This was one of the chief offences. "According to Rabbinical notions, it was reaping, threshing, winnowing, and preparing food all at once" (Plummer). These Pharisees were straining out gnats and swallowing camels! This verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψωχω</span></span> is a late one for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψαω</span></span>, to rub. </p>
