<p><b> He looked round about on them all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιβλεψαμενος</span></span>). First aorist middle participle as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:5">Mark 3:5</span>, the middle voice giving a personal touch to it all. Mark adds "with anger" which Luke here does not put in. All three Gospels have the identical command:</p>
<p><b>Stretch forth thy hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξτεινον την χειρα σου</span></span>). First aorist active imperative.</p>
<p><b>Stretch out </b>, clean out, full length. All three Gospels also have the first aorist passive indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκατεσταθη</span></span> with the double augment of the double compound verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαθιστημ</span></span>. As in Greek writers, so here the double compound means complete restoration to the former state. </p>
