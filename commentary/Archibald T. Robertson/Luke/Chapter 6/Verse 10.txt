 He looked round about on them all  (περιβλεψαμενος). First aorist middle participle as in Mark 3:5, the middle voice giving a personal touch to it all. Mark adds "with anger" which Luke here does not put in. All three Gospels have the identical command:Stretch forth thy hand  (εξτεινον την χειρα σου). First aorist active imperative.Stretch out , clean out, full length. All three Gospels also have the first aorist passive indicative απεκατεσταθη with the double augment of the double compound verb αποκαθιστημ. As in Greek writers, so here the double compound means complete restoration to the former state.
