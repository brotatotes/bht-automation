<p><b> They were filled with madness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επλησθησαν ανοιας</span></span>) First aorist passive (effective) with genitive: In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:26">Luke 5:26</span> we saw the people filled with fear. Here is rage that is kin to insanity, for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιας</span></span> is lack of sense (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νους</span></span>, mind). An old word, but only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:9">2 Timothy 3:9</span> in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Communed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διελαλουν</span></span>), imperfect active, picturing their excited counsellings with one another. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:6">Mark 3:6</span> notes that they bolted out of the synagogue and outside plotted even with the Herodians how to destroy Jesus, strange co-conspirators these against the common enemy.</p>
<p><b>What they might do to Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ αν ποιησαιεν Ιησου</span></span>). Luke puts it in a less damaging way than <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:6">Mark 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:14">Matthew 12:14</span>. This aorist optative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> is the deliberative question like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span> retained in the indirect form here. Perhaps Luke means, not that they were undecided about killing Jesus, but only as to the best way of doing it. Already nearly two years before the end we see the set determination to destroy Jesus. We see it here in Galilee. We have already seen it at the feast in Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span>) where "the Jews sought the more to kill him." John and the Synoptics are in perfect agreement as to the Pharisaic attitude toward Jesus. </p>
