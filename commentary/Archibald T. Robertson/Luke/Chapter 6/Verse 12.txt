<p><b> He went out into the mountains to pray</b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξελθειν αυτον εις το ορος προσευξασθα</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ-</span></span> where <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:13">Mark 3:13</span> has <b>goeth up</b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινε</span></span>). Luke alone has "to pray" as he so often notes the habit of prayer in Jesus.</p>
<p><b>He continued all night </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην διανυκτερευων</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect active. Here alone in the N.T., but common in the LXX and in late Greek writers. Medical writers used it of whole night vigils.</p>
<p><b>In prayer to God</b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη προσευχη του θεου</span></span>). Objective genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θεου</span></span>. This phrase occurs nowhere else. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προσευχη</span></span> does not mean "place of prayer" or synagogue as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:13">Acts 16:13</span>, but the actual prayer of Jesus to the Father all night long. He needed the Father's guidance now in the choice of the Apostles in the morning. </p>
