<p><b> When it was day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε εγενετο ημερα</span></span>). When day came, after the long night of prayer.</p>
<p><b>He chose from them twelve </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεξαμενος απ' αυτων δωδεκα</span></span>). The same root (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγ</span></span>) was used for picking out, selecting and then for saying. There was a large group of "disciples" or "learners" whom he "called" to him (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεφωνησεν</span></span>), and from among whom he chose (of himself, and for himself, indirect middle voice (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεξαμενος</span></span>). It was a crisis in the work of Christ. Jesus assumed full responsibility even for the choice of Judas who was not forced upon Jesus by the rest of the Twelve. "You did not choose me, but I chose you," (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:16">John 15:16</span>) where Jesus uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξελεξασθε</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξελεξαμην</span></span> as here by Luke.</p>
<p><b>Whom also he named apostles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ους κα αποστολους ωνομασεν</span></span>). So then Jesus gave the twelve chosen disciples this appellation. Aleph and B have these same words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:14">Mark 3:14</span> besides the support of a few of the best cursives, the Bohairic Coptic Version and the Greek margin of the Harclean Syriac. Westcott and Hort print them in their text in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:14">Mark 3:14</span>, but it remains doubtful whether they were not brought into Mark from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13">Luke 6:13</span> where they are undoubtedly genuine. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:2">Matthew 10:2</span> where the connection with sending them out by twos in the third tour of Galilee. The word is derived from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστελλω</span></span>, to send (Latin, <i>mitto</i>) and apostle is missionary, one sent. Jesus applies the term to himself (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστειλας</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>) as does <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>. The word is applied to others, like Barnabas, besides these twelve including the Apostle Paul who is on a par with them in rank and authority, and even to mere messengers of the churches (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23">2 Corinthians 8:23</span>). But these twelve apostles stand apart from all others in that they were all chosen at once by Jesus himself "that they might be with him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:14">Mark 3:14</span>), to be trained by Jesus himself and to interpret him and his message to the world. In the nature of the case they could have no successors as they had to be personal witnesses to the life and resurrection of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span>). The selection of Matthias to succeed Judas cannot be called a mistake, but it automatically ceased. For discussion of the names and groups in the list see discussion on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:1-4">Matthew 10:1-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:14-19">Mark 3:14-19</span>. </p>
