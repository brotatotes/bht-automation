<p><b> With unclean spirits </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο πνευματων ακαθαρτων</span></span>) . In an amphibolous position for it can be construed with "troubled," (present passive participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενοχλουμενο</span></span>) or with "were healed" (imperfect passive, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθεραπευοντο</span></span>). The healings were repeated as often as they came. Note here both verbs, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιαομα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεραπευω</span></span>, used of the miraculous cures of Jesus. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θεραπευω</span></span> is the verb more commonly employed of regular professional cures, but no such distinction is made here. </p>
