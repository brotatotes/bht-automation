<p><b> Sought to touch him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζητουν απτεσθα αυτου</span></span>). Imperfect active. One can see the surging, eager crowd pressing up to Jesus. Probably some of them felt that there was a sort of virtue or magic in touching his garments like the poor woman in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:43">Luke 8:43</span>. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:23">Mark 5:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:21">Matthew 9:21</span>).</p>
<p><b>For power came forth from him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ δυναμις παρ' αυτου εξηρχετο</span></span>). Imperfect middle, <b>power was coming out from him </b>. This is the reason for the continual approach to Jesus.</p>
<p><b>And healed them all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ιατο παντας</span></span>). Imperfect middle again. Was healing all, kept on healing all. The preacher today who is not a vehicle of power from Christ to men may well question why that is true. Undoubtedly the failure to get a blessing is one reason why many people stop going to church. One may turn to Paul's tremendous words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:13">Philippians 4:13</span>: "I have strength for all things in him who keeps on pouring power into me" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα ισχυω εν τω ενδυναμουντ με</span></span>). It was at a time of surpassing dynamic spiritual energy when Jesus delivered this greatest of all sermons so far as they are reported to us. The very air was electric with spiritual power. There are such times as all preachers know. </p>
