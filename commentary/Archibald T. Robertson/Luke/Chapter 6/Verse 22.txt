<p><b> When they shall separate you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν αφορισωσιν υμας</span></span>). First aorist active subjunctive, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφοριζω</span></span>, common verb for marking off a boundary. So either in good sense or bad sense as here. The reference is to excommunication from the congregation as well as from social intercourse.</p>
<p><b>Cast out your name as evil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξβαλωσιν το ονομα υμων ως πονηρον</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλλω</span></span>, common verb. The verb is used in Aristophanes, Sophocles, and Plato of hissing an actor off the stage. The name of Christian or disciple or Nazarene came to be a byword of contempt as shown in the Acts. It was even unlawful in the Neronian persecution when Christianity was not a <i>religio licita</i>.</p>
<p><b>For the Son of man's sake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεκα του υιου του ανθρωπου</span></span>). Jesus foretold what will befall those who are loyal to him. The Acts of the Apostles is a commentary on this prophecy. This is Christ's common designation of himself, never of others save by Stephen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:56">Acts 7:56</span>) and in the Apocalypse (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:13">Revelation 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</span>). But both Son of God and Son of man apply to him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:50">John 1:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:52">John 1:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:63">Matthew 26:63</span>). Christ was a real man though the Son of God. He is also the representative man and has authority over all men. </p>
