<p><b> But woe unto you that are rich </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πλην ουα υμιν τοις πλουσιοις</span></span>). Sharp contrast (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλην</span></span>). As a matter of fact the rich Pharisees and Sadducees were the chief opposers of Christ as of the early disciples later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:1-6">James 5:1-6</span>).</p>
<p><b>Ye have received </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεχετε</span></span>). Receipt in full <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεχω</span></span> means as the papyri show.</p>
<p><b>Consolation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακλησιν</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλεω</span></span>, to call to one's side, to encourage, to help, to cheer. </p>
