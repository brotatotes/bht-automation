<p><b> Now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν</span></span>). Here twice as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:21">Luke 6:21</span> in contrast with future punishment. The joys and sorrows in these two verses are turned round, measure for measure reversed. The Rich Man and Lazarus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:19-31">Luke 16:19-31</span>) illustrate these contrasts in the present and the future. </p>
