<p><b> But I say unto you that hear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αλλα υμιν λεγω τοις ακουουσιν</span></span>). There is a contrast in this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span> like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:44">Matthew 5:44</span>. This is the only one of the many examples given by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:5">Luke 6:5</span> of the sharp antithesis between what the rabbis taught and what Jesus said. Perhaps that contrast is referred to by Luke. If necessary, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span> could be coordinating or paratactic conjunction as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:11">2 Corinthians 7:11</span> rather than adversative as apparently here. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:43">Matthew 5:43</span> Love of enemies is in the O.T., but Jesus ennobles the word, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαω</span></span>, and uses it of love for one's enemies. </p>
