<p><b> On the cheek </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ την σιαγονα</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:39">Matthew 5:39</span> has "right." Old word meaning jaw or jawbone, but in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:39">Matthew 5:39</span>, which see for discussion. It seems an act of violence rather than contempt. Sticklers for extreme literalism find trouble with the conduct of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:22">John 18:22</span> where Jesus, on receiving a slap in the face, protested against it.</p>
<p><b>Thy cloke </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ιματιον</span></span>), <b>thy coat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον χιτωνα</span></span>). Here the upper and more valuable garment (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιματιον</span></span>) is first taken, the under and less valuable <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χιτων</span></span> last. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:40">Matthew 5:40</span> the process (apparently a legal one) is reversed.</p>
<p><b>Withhold not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη κωλυσηις</span></span>). Aorist subjunctive in prohibition against committing an act. Do not hinder him in his robbing. It is usually useless anyhow with modern armed bandits. </p>
