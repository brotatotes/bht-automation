<p><b> Ask them not again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη απαιτε</span></span>). Here the present active imperative in a prohibition, do not have the habit of asking back. This common verb only here in the N.T., for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτουσιν</span></span> is the correct text in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:20">Luke 12:20</span>. The literary flavour of Luke's <i>Koine</i> style is seen in his frequent use of words common in the literary Greek, but appearing nowhere else in the N.T. </p>
