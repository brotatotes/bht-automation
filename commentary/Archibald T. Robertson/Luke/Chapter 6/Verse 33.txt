<p><b> Do good </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθοποιητε</span></span>). Third-class condition, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and present subjunctive. This verb not in old Greek, but in LXX.</p>
<p><b>Even sinners </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο αμαρτωλο</span></span>). Even the sinners, the article distinguishing the class. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:46">Matthew 5:46</span> has "even the publicans" and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:47">Luke 5:47</span> "even the Gentiles." That completes the list of the outcasts for "sinners" includes "harlots" and all the rest. </p>
