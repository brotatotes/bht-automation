<p><b> If ye lend </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν δανισητε</span></span>). Third-class condition, first aorist active subjunctive from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δανιζω</span></span> (old form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δανειζω</span></span>) to lend for interest in a business transaction (here in active to lend and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:42">Matthew 5:42</span> middle to borrow and nowhere else in N.T.), whereas <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κιχρημ</span></span> (only <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:5">Luke 11:5</span> in N.T.) means to loan as a friendly act.</p>
<p><b>To receive again as much </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα απολαβωσιν τα ισα</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολαμβανω</span></span>, old verb, to get back in full like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεχω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:24">Luke 6:24</span>. Literally here, "that they may get back the equal" (principal and interest, apparently). It could mean "equivalent services." No parallel in Matthew. </p>
