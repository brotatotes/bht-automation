<p><b> Also a parable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα παραβολην</span></span>). Plummer thinks that the second half of the sermon begins here as indicated by Luke's insertion of "And he spake (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπεν δε</span></span>) at this point. Luke has the word parable some fifteen times both for crisp proverbs and for the longer narrative comparisons. This is the only use of the term parable concerning the metaphors in the Sermon on the Mount. But in both Matthew and Luke's report of the discourse there are some sixteen possible applications of the word. Two come right together: The blind leading the blind, the mote and the beam. Matthew gives the parabolic proverb of the blind leading the blind later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:14">Matthew 15:14</span>). Jesus repeated these sayings on various occasions as every teacher does his characteristic ideas. So Luke <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:40">Luke 6:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:24">Matthew 10:24</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:45">Luke 6:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:34">Matthew 12:34</span> <b> </b> </p>
<p><b>Can </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μητ δυνατα</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητ</span></span> in the question shows that a negative answer is expected.</p>
<p><b>Guide </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδηγειν</span></span>). Common verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδηγος</span></span> (guide) and this from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδος</span></span> (way) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγεομα</span></span>, to lead or guide.</p>
<p><b>Shall they not both fall? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ αμφοτερο εμπεσουνται;</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ουχ</span></span>, a sharpened negative from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span>, in a question expecting the answer Yes. Future middle indicative of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπιπτω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Into a pit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις βοθυνον</span></span>). Late word for older <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βοθρος</span></span>. </p>
