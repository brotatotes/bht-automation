<p><b> Did take </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαβων</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>. Not in Mark and Matthew. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:1-8">Matthew 12:1-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:23-28">Mark 2:23-28</span> for discussion of details about the shewbread and the five arguments in defence of his conduct on the sabbath (example of David, work of the priests on the sabbath, prophecy of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:6">Hosea 6:6</span>, purpose of the sabbath for man, the Son of Man lord of the sabbath). It was an overwhelming and crushing reply to these pettifogging ceremonialists to which they could not reply, but which increased their anger. Codex D transfers verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:5">Luke 6:5</span> to after verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:10">Luke 6:10</span> and puts here the following: "On the same day beholding one working on the sabbath he said to him: Man, if you know what you are doing, happy are you; but if you do not know, cursed are you and a transgressor of the law." </p>
