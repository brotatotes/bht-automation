<p><b> The disciple is not above his master </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν μαθητης υπερ τον διδασκαλον</span></span>). Literally, a learner (or pupil) is not above the teacher. Precisely so in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:24">Matthew 10:24</span> where "slave" is added with "lord." But here Luke adds: "But everyone when he is perfected shall be as his master" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηρτισμενος δε πας εστα ως ο διδασκαλος αυτου</span></span>). The state of completion, perfect passive participle, is noted in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηρτισμενος</span></span>. The word is common for mending broken things or nets (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:21">Matthew 4:21</span>) or men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:1">Galatians 6:1</span>). So it is a long process to get the pupil patched up to the plane of his teacher. </p>
