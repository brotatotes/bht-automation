<p><b> On another sabbath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ετερω σαββατω</span></span>). This was a second (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερον</span></span>, as it often means), but not necessarily the next, sabbath. This incident is given by all three synoptics (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:1-6">Mark 3:1-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:9-14">Matthew 12:9-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:6-11">Luke 6:6-11</span>). See Matt. and Mark for details. Only Luke notes that it was on a sabbath. Was this because Luke as a physician had to meet this problem in his own practise?</p>
<p><b>Right hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η δεξια</span></span>). This alone in Luke, the physician's eye for particulars. </p>
