<p><b> The scribes and the Pharisees </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο γραμματεις κα ο Φαρισαιο</span></span>). Only Luke here though Pharisees named in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:14">Matthew 12:14</span> and Pharisees and Herodians in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:6">Mark 3:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>Watched him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρετηρουντο αυτον</span></span>). Imperfect middle, were watching for themselves on the side (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:2">Mark 3:2</span> has the imperfect active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρετηρουν</span></span>. Common verb, but the proposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> gave an extra touch, watching either assiduously like the physician at the bedside or insidiously with evil intent as here.</p>
<p><b>Would heal </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεραπευσε</span></span>). But the present active indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεραπευε</span></span>) may be the correct text here. So Westcott and Hort.</p>
<p><b>That they might find out how to accuse him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ευρωσιν κατηγορειν αυτου</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκω</span></span> and the infinitive with it means to find out how to do a thing. They were determined to make a case against Jesus. They felt sure that their presence would prevent any spurious work on the part of Jesus. </p>
