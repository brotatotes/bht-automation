<p><b> After </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επειδη, επε ανδ δη</span></span>). This conjunction was written <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επε δη</span></span> in Homer and is simple <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επε</span></span> with the intensive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δη</span></span> added and even <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επε δη περ</span></span> once in N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:1">Luke 1:1</span>). This is the only instance of the temporal use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επειδη</span></span> in the N.T. The causal sense occurs only in Luke and Paul, for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επε</span></span> is the correct text in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:46">Matthew 21:46</span>.</p>
<p><b>Had ended </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επληρωσεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative. There is here a reference to the conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount, but with nothing concerning the impression produced by the discourse such as is seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:28">Matthew 7:28</span>. This verse really belongs as the conclusion of Chapter 6, not as the beginning of Chapter 7.</p>
<p><b>In the ears of the people </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τας ακοας του λαου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ακοη</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span>, to hear, is used of the sense of hearing (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:17">1 Corinthians 12:17</span>), the ear with which one hears (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:35">Mark 7:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:11">Hebrews 5:11</span>), the thing heard or the report (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:16">Romans 10:16</span>) or oral instruction (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:2">Galatians 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:5">Galatians 3:5</span>). Both <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:5-13">Matthew 8:5-13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:1-10">Luke 7:1-10</span> locate the healing of the centurion's servant in Capernaum where Jesus was after the Sermon on the Mount. </p>
