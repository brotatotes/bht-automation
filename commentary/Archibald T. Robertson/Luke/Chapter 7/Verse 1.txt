 After  (επειδη, επε ανδ δη). This conjunction was written επε δη in Homer and is simple επε with the intensive δη added and even επε δη περ once in N.T. (Luke 1:1). This is the only instance of the temporal use of επειδη in the N.T. The causal sense occurs only in Luke and Paul, for επε is the correct text in Matthew 21:46.Had ended  (επληρωσεν). First aorist active indicative. There is here a reference to the conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount, but with nothing concerning the impression produced by the discourse such as is seen in Matthew 7:28. This verse really belongs as the conclusion of Chapter 6, not as the beginning of Chapter 7.In the ears of the people  (εις τας ακοας του λαου). Ακοη from ακουω, to hear, is used of the sense of hearing (1 Corinthians 12:17), the ear with which one hears (Mark 7:35; Hebrews 5:11), the thing heard or the report (Romans 10:16) or oral instruction (Galatians 3:2; Galatians 3:5). Both Matthew 8:5-13; Luke 7:1-10 locate the healing of the centurion's servant in Capernaum where Jesus was after the Sermon on the Mount.
