<p><b> Soon afterwards </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν το εξης</span></span>). According to this reading supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρονω</span></span>, time. Other MSS. read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εξης</span></span> (supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερα</span></span>, day). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hεξης</span></span> occurs in Luke and Acts in the N.T. though old adverb of time.</p>
<p><b>That </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hοτ</span></span>). Not in the Greek, the two verbs <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επορευθη</span></span> having no connective (asyndeton).</p>
<p><b>Went with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεπορευοντο αυτω</span></span>). Imperfect middle picturing the procession of disciples and the crowd with Jesus. Nain is not mentioned elsewhere in the N.T. There is today a hamlet about two miles west of Endor on the north slope of Little Hermon. There is a burying-place still in use. Robinson and Stanley think that the very road on which the crowd with Jesus met the funeral procession can be identified. </p>
