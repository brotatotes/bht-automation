<p><b> Behold </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ιδου</span></span>). The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> introduces the apodosis of the temporal sentence and has to be left out in translations. It is a common idiom in Luke, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ιδου</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>There was carried out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεκομιζετο</span></span>). Imperfect passive indicative. Common verb in late Greek for carrying out a body for burial, though here only in the N.T. (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκομιζω</span></span>).

The "death of a widow's only son was the greatest misfortune conceivable" (Easton).</p>
<p><b>And she was a widow </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αυτη ην χηρα</span></span>). This word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χηρα</span></span> gives the finishing touch to the pathos of the situation. The word is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χηρος</span></span>, bereft. The mourning of a widow for an only son is the extremity of grief (Plummer).</p>
<p><b>Much people </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλος ικανος</span></span>). Considerable crowd as often with this adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικανος</span></span>. Some were hired mourners, but the size of the crowd showed the real sympathy of the town for her. </p>
