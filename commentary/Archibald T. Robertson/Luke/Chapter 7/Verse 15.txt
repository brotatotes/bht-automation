<p><b> Sat up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεκαθισεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative. The verb in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:40">Acts 9:40</span>. Medical writers often used it of the sick sitting up in bed (Hobart, <i>Med. Lang. of St. Luke</i>, p. 11). It is objected that the symmetry of these cases (daughter of Jairus raised from the death-bed, this widow's son raised from the bier, Lazarus raised from the tomb) is suspicious, but no one Gospel gives all three (Plummer).</p>
<p><b>Gave him to his mother </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκεν αυτον τη μητρ αυτου</span></span>). Tender way of putting it. "For he had already ceased to belong to his mother" (Bengel). So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:42">Luke 9:42</span>. </p>
