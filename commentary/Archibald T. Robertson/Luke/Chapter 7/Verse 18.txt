 And the disciples of John told him  (κα απηγγειλαν Ιωανη ο μαθητα αυτου). Literally, and his disciples announced to John. Such news (verse Luke 7:17) was bound to come to the ears of the Baptist languishing in the dungeon of Machaerus (Luke 3:20). Luke 7:18-35 runs parallel with Matthew 11:2-19, a specimen of Q, the non-Marcan portion of Matthew and Luke.
