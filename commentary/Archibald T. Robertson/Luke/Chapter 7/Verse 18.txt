<p><b> And the disciples of John told him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα απηγγειλαν Ιωανη ο μαθητα αυτου</span></span>). Literally, and his disciples announced to John. Such news (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:17">Luke 7:17</span>) was bound to come to the ears of the Baptist languishing in the dungeon of Machaerus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:20">Luke 3:20</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:18-35">Luke 7:18-35</span> runs parallel with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:2-19">Matthew 11:2-19</span>, a specimen of Q, the non-Marcan portion of Matthew and Luke. </p>
