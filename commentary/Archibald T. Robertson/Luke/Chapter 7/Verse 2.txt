<p><b> Centurion's servant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hεκατονταρχου τινος δουλος</span></span>). Slave of a certain centurion (Latin word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χεντυριο</span></span>, commander of a century or hundred). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:39">Mark 15:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:44">Mark 15:44</span> has the Latin word in Greek letters, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεντυριων</span></span>. The centurion commanded a company which varied from fifty to a hundred. Each cohort had six centuries. Each legion had ten cohorts or bands (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1">Acts 10:1</span>). The centurions mentioned in the N.T. all seem to be fine men as Polybius states that the best men in the army had this position. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:47">Luke 23:47</span>. The Greek has two forms of the word, both from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκατον</span></span>, hundred, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχω</span></span>, to rule, and they appear to be used interchangeably. So we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκατονταρχος</span></span>; here, the form is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-αρχος</span></span>, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκατονταρχης</span></span>, the form is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-αρχης</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:6">Luke 7:6</span>. The manuscripts differ about it in almost every instance. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-αρχος</span></span> form is accepted by Westcott and Hort only in the nominative save the genitive singular here in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:2">Luke 7:2</span> and the accusative singular in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:25">Acts 22:25</span>. See like variation between them in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:5">Matthew 8:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:8">Matthew 8:8</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-αρχος</span></span>) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:13">Matthew 8:13</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχη</span></span>). So also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-αρχον</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:25">Acts 22:25</span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-αρχης</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:26">Acts 22:26</span>).</p>
<p><b>Dear to him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω εντιμος</span></span>). Held in honour, prized, precious, dear (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:8">Luke 14:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4">1 Peter 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:29">Philippians 2:29</span>), common Greek word. Even though a slave he was dear to him.</p>
<p><b>Was sick </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακως εχων</span></span>). Having it bad. Common idiom. See already <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:16">Matthew 8:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:17">Mark 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:31">Luke 5:31</span>, etc. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:6">Matthew 8:6</span> notes that the slave was a paralytic.</p>
<p><b>And at the point of death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημελλεν τελευταιν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλω</span></span> (note double augment <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span>) which is used either with the present infinitive as here, the aorist (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:16">Revelation 3:16</span>), or even the future because of the future idea in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:15">Acts 24:15</span>). He was about to die. </p>
