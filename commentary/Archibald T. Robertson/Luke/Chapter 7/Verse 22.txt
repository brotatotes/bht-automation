<p><b> What things ye have seen and heard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α ειδετε κα ηκουσατε</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:4">Matthew 11:4</span>, present tense "which ye do hear and see." Rest of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:22">Luke 7:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:23">Luke 7:23</span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:4-6">Matthew 11:4-6</span>, which see for details. Luke mentions no raisings from the dead in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:21">Luke 7:21</span>, but the language is mainly general, while here it is specific. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σκανδαλιζομα</span></span> used here has the double notion of to trip up and to entrap and in the N.T. always means causing to sin. </p>
