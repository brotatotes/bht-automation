 When the messengers of John were departed  (απελθοντων των αγγελων Ιωανου). Genitive absolute of aorist active participle. Matthew 11:7 has the present middle participle πορευομενων, suggesting that Jesus began his eulogy of John as soon as the messengers (angels, Luke calls them) were on their way. The vivid questions about the people's interest in John are precisely alike in both Matthew and Luke.
