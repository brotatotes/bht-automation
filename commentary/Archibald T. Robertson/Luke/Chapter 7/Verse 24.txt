<p><b> When the messengers of John were departed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απελθοντων των αγγελων Ιωανου</span></span>). Genitive absolute of aorist active participle. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:7">Matthew 11:7</span> has the present middle participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορευομενων</span></span>, suggesting that Jesus began his eulogy of John as soon as the messengers (angels, Luke calls them) were on their way. The vivid questions about the people's interest in John are precisely alike in both Matthew and Luke. </p>
