<p><b> A prophet? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητην;</span></span>). A real prophet will always get a hearing if he has a message from God. He is a for-speaker, forth-teller (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ-φητης</span></span>). He may or may not be a fore-teller. The main thing is for the prophet to have a message from God which he is willing to tell at whatever cost to himself. The word of God came to John in the wilderness of Judea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2">Luke 3:2</span>). That made him a prophet. There is a prophetic element in every real preacher of the Gospel. Real prophets become leaders and moulders of men. </p>
