<p><b> Sent unto him elders of the Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστειλεν προς αυτον πρεσβουτερους των Ιουδαιων</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:5">Matthew 8:5</span> says "the centurion came unto him." For discussion of this famous case of apparent discrepancy see discussion on Matthew. One possible solution is that Luke tells the story as it happened with the details, whereas Matthew simply presents a summary statement without the details. What one does through another he does himself.</p>
<p><b>Asking him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερωτων αυτον</span></span>). Present active participle, masculine singular nominative, of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερωταω</span></span> common for asking a question as in the old Greek (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:68">Luke 22:68</span>). But more frequently in the N.T. the verb has the idea of making a request as here. This is not a Hebraism or an Aramaism, but is a common meaning of the verb in the papyri (Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 168). It is to be noted here that Luke represents the centurion himself as "asking" through the elders of the Jews (leading citizens). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:6">Matthew 8:6</span> the verb is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλων</span></span> (beseeching).</p>
<p><b>That he would come and save </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως ελθων διασωση</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hινα</span></span> is the more common final or sub-final (as here) conjunction, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως</span></span> still occurs. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διασωση</span></span> is effective aorist active subjunctive, to bring safe through as in a storm (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:1">Acts 28:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:4">Acts 28:4</span>). Common word. </p>
