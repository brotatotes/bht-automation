These legalistic interpreters of the law refused to admit the need of confession of sin on their part and so set aside the baptism of John. They annulled God's purposes of grace so far as they applied to them.Being not baptized by him  (μη βαπτισθεντες υπ' αυτου). First aorist passive participle. Μη is the usual negative of the participle in the Koine.
