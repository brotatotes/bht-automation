<p><b> And to what are they like? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τιν εισιν ομοιοι;</span></span>). This second question is not in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:16">Matthew 11:16</span>. It sharpens the point. The case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιν</span></span> is associative instrumental after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιο</span></span>. See discussion of details in Matthew. </p>
