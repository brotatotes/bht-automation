<p><b> John the Baptist is come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εληλυθεν</span></span>). Second perfect active indicative where <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:18">Matthew 11:18</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλθεν</span></span> second aorist active indicative. So as to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:34">Luke 7:34</span>. Luke alone has "bread" and "wine." Otherwise these verses like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:18">Matthew 11:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:19">Matthew 11:19</span>, which see for discussion of details. There are actually critics today who say that Jesus was called the friend of sinners and even of harlots because he loved them and their ways and so deserved the slur cast upon him by his enemies. If men can say that today we need not wonder that the Pharisees and lawyers said it then to justify their own rejection of Jesus. </p>
