 Standing behind at his feet  (στασα οπισω παρα τους ποδας αυτου). Second aorist active participle from ιστημ and intransitive, first aorist εστησα being transitive. The guest removed his sandals before the meal and he reclined on the left side with the feet outward. She was standing beside (παρα) his feet weeping  (κλαιουσα). She was drawn irresistibly by gratitude to Jesus and is overcome with emotion before she can use the ointment; her tears (τοις δακρυσιν, instrumental case of δακρυ) take the place of the ointment.Wiped them with the hair of her head  (ταις θριξιν της κεφαλης αυτης εξεμασσεν). Inchoative imperfect of an old verb εκμασσω, to rub out or off, began to wipe off, an act of impulse evidently and of embarrassment. "Among the Jews it was a shameful thing for a woman to let down her hair in public; but she makes this sacrifice" (Plummer). So Mary of Bethany wiped the feet of Jesus with her hair (John 12:3) with a similar sacrifice out of her great love for Jesus. This fact is relied on by some to prove that Mary of Bethany had been a woman of bad character, surely an utter failure to recognize Mary's motive and act.Kissed  (κατεφιλε). Imperfect active of καταφιλεω, to kiss repeatedly (force of κατα), and accented by the tense of continued action here. The word in the N.T. occurs here, of the prodigal's father (Luke 15:20), of the kiss of Judas (Mark 14:45; Matthew 26:49), of the Ephesian elders (Acts 20:37). " Kissing the feet was a common mark of deep reverence, especially to leading rabbis" (Plummer).Anointed them with the ointment  (ηλειφεν τω μυρω). Imperfect active again of αλειφω, a very common verb. Χριω has a more religious sense. The anointing came after the burst of emotional excitement.
