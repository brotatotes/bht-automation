<p><b> Standing behind at his feet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στασα οπισω παρα τους ποδας αυτου</span></span>). Second aorist active participle from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span> and intransitive, first aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστησα</span></span> being transitive. The guest removed his sandals before the meal and he reclined on the left side with the feet outward. She was standing beside (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>) his feet <b>weeping </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαιουσα</span></span>). She was drawn irresistibly by gratitude to Jesus and is overcome with emotion before she can use the ointment; her tears (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις δακρυσιν</span></span>, instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δακρυ</span></span>) take the place of the ointment.</p>
<p><b>Wiped them with the hair of her head </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταις θριξιν της κεφαλης αυτης εξεμασσεν</span></span>). Inchoative imperfect of an old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκμασσω</span></span>, to rub out or off, began to wipe off, an act of impulse evidently and of embarrassment. "Among the Jews it was a shameful thing for a woman to let down her hair in public; but she makes this sacrifice" (Plummer). So Mary of Bethany wiped the feet of Jesus with her hair (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:3">John 12:3</span>) with a similar sacrifice out of her great love for Jesus. This fact is relied on by some to prove that Mary of Bethany had been a woman of bad character, surely an utter failure to recognize Mary's motive and act.</p>
<p><b>Kissed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεφιλε</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταφιλεω</span></span>, to kiss repeatedly (force of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>), and accented by the tense of continued action here. The word in the N.T. occurs here, of the prodigal's father (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:20">Luke 15:20</span>), of the kiss of Judas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:45">Mark 14:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:49">Matthew 26:49</span>), of the Ephesian elders (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:37">Acts 20:37</span>). " Kissing the feet was a common mark of deep reverence, especially to leading rabbis" (Plummer).</p>
<p><b>Anointed them with the ointment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλειφεν τω μυρω</span></span>). Imperfect active again of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλειφω</span></span>, a very common verb. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριω</span></span> has a more religious sense. The anointing came after the burst of emotional excitement. </p>
