<p><b> Will love him most </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλειον αγαπησε αυτον</span></span>). Strictly, comparative</p>
<p><b>more </b>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλειον</span></span>, not superlative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλειστα</span></span>, but most suits the English idiom best, even between two. Superlative forms are vanishing before the comparative in the <i>Koine</i>. This is the point of the parable, the attitude of the two debtors toward the lender who forgave both of them (Plummer). </p>
