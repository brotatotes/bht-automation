 Will love him most  (πλειον αγαπησε αυτον). Strictly, comparativemore , πλειον, not superlative πλειστα, but most suits the English idiom best, even between two. Superlative forms are vanishing before the comparative in the Koine. This is the point of the parable, the attitude of the two debtors toward the lender who forgave both of them (Plummer).
