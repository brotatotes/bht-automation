<p><b> I suppose </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπολαμβανω</span></span>). Old verb, originally to take up from under, to bear away as on high, to take up in speech (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:30">Luke 10:30</span>), to take up in mind or to assume as here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:15">Acts 2:15</span>. Here with an air of supercilious indifference (Plummer).</p>
<p><b>The most </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πλειον</span></span>). The more.</p>
<p><b>Rightly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορθως</span></span>). Correctly. Socrates was fond of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πανυ ορθως</span></span>. The end of the argument. </p>
