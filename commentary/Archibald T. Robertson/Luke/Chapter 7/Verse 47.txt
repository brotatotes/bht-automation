<p><b> Are forgiven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεωντα</span></span>). Doric perfect passive form. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:21">Luke 5:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:23">Luke 5:23</span>.</p>
<p><b>For she loved much </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ηγαπησεν πολυ</span></span>). Illustration or proof, not reason for the forgiveness. Her sins had been already forgiven and remained forgiven.</p>
<p><b>But to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hω δε ολιγον αφιετα ολιγον αγαπα</span></span>). This explanation proves that the meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> preceding is proof, not cause. </p>
