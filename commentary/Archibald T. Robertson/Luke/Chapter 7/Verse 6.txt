<p><b> Went with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επορευετο συν αυτοις</span></span>). Imperfect indicative middle. He started to go along with them.</p>
<p><b>Now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη</span></span>). Already like Latin <i>jam</i>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:8">1 Corinthians 4:8</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυν ηδη</span></span> like <i>jam nunc</i>.</p>
<p><b>Sent friends </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεμψεν φιλους</span></span>). This second embassy also, wanting in Matthew's narrative. He "puts the message of both into the mouth of the centurion himself" (Plummer). Note saying (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγων</span></span>), present active singular participle, followed by direct quotation from the centurion himself.</p>
<p><b>Trouble not thyself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη σκυλλου</span></span>). Present middle (direct use) imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκυλλω</span></span>, old verb originally meaning to skin, to mangle, and then in later Greek to vex, trouble, annoy. Frequent in the papyri in this latter sense.</p>
<p><b>For I am not worthy that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γαρ ικανος ειμ ινα</span></span>). The same word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικανος</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιος</span></span>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:8">Matthew 8:8</span>, which see for discussion, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικω, ικανω</span></span>, to fit, to reach, be adequate for. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hινα</span></span> in both places as common in late Greek. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:8">Matthew 8:8</span> also for "roof" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στεγην</span></span>, covering). </p>
