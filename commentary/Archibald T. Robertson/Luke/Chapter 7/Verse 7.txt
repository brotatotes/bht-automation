<p><b> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διο ουδε εμαυτον ηξιωσα προς σε ελθειν</span></span>). Not in Matthew because he represents the centurion as coming to Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Speak the word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπε λογω</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:8">Matthew 8:8</span>. Second aorist active imperative with instrumental case, speak with a word.</p>
<p><b>My servant shall be healed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιαθητω ο παις μου</span></span>). Imperative first aorist passive, let be healed. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παις</span></span> literally means "boy," an affectionate term for the "slave," <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:2">Luke 7:2</span>), who was "dear" to him. </p>
