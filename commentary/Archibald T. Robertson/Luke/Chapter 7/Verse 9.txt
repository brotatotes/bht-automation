<p><b> Turned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στραφεις</span></span>). Second aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρεφω</span></span>, to turn. Common verb. A vivid touch not in Matthew's account. In both Matthew and Luke Jesus marvels at the great faith of this Roman centurion beyond that among the Jews. As a military man he had learned how to receive orders and to execute them and hence to expect obedience to his commands, He recognized Jesus as Master over disease with power to compel obedience. </p>
