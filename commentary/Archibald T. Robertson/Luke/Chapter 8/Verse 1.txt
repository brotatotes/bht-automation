<p><b> Soon afterwards </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω καθεξης</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:11">Luke 7:11</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω εξης</span></span>. This word means one after the other, successively, but that gives no definite data as to the time, only that this incident in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:1-3">Luke 8:1-3</span> follows that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:36-50">Luke 7:36-50</span>. Both in Luke alone.</p>
<p><b>That </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>). One of Luke's idioms with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εγενετο</span></span> like Hebrew <i>wav</i>. Went about (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωδευεν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διοδευω</span></span>, to make one's way through (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια, οδος</span></span>), common in late Greek writers. In the N.T. here only and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:1">Acts 17:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Through cities and villages </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα πολιν κα κωμην</span></span>). Distributive use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> (up and down). The clause is amphibolous and goes equally well with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωδευεν</span></span> or with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυσσων</span></span> (heralding) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ευαγγελιζομενος</span></span> (evangelizing, gospelizing). This is the second tour of Galilee, this time the Twelve with him. </p>
