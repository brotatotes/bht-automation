<p><b> The mysteries </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα μυστηρια</span></span>). See for this word on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:11">Matthew 13:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:11">Mark 4:11</span>. Part of the mystery here explained is how so many people who have the opportunity to enter the kingdom fail to do so because of manifest unfitness.</p>
<p><b>That </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>). Here <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:11">Mark 4:11</span> also has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> while <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:13">Matthew 13:13</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> (because). On the so-called causal use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> as here equal to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> see discussion on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:13">Matthew 13:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:11">Mark 4:11</span>. Plummer sensibly argues that there is truth both in the causal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> of Matthew and the final <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> of Mark and Matthew. "But the principle that he who hath shall receive more, while he who hath not shall be deprived of what he seemeth to have, explains both the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>. Jesus speaks in parables because the multitudes see without seeing and hear without hearing. But He also speaks in parable</p>
<p><b>in order that </b> they may see without seeing and hear without hearing." Only for "hearing" Luke has "understand" <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιωσιν</span></span>, present subjunctive from a late omega form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιω</span></span> instead of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-μ</span></span> verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιημ</span></span>. </p>
