<p><b> Is this </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν δε αυτη</span></span>). Means this. Jesus now proceeds to interpret his own parable.</p>
<p><b>The seed is the word of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο σπορος εστιν ο λογος του θεου</span></span>). The article with both subject and predicate as here means that they are interchangeable and can be turned round: The word of God is the seed. The phrase "the word of God" does not appear in Matthew and only once in Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:13">Mark 7:13</span>) and John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:35">John 10:35</span>), but four times in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:1">Luke 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:11">Luke 8:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:21">Luke 8:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:28">Luke 11:28</span>) and twelve times in Acts. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:14">Mark 4:14</span> we have only "the word." In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:31">Mark 3:31</span> we have "the will of God," and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46">Matthew 12:46</span> "the will of my Father" where <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:21">Luke 8:21</span> has "the word of God." This seems to show that Luke has the subjective genitive here and means the word that comes from God. </p>
