<p><b> Those by the wayside </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο παρα την οδον</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:15">Mark 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:19">Matthew 13:19</span> so here the people who hear the word = the seed are discussed by metonymy.</p>
<p><b>The devil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο διαβολος</span></span>). The slanderer. Here <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:15">Mark 4:15</span> has Satan.</p>
<p><b>From their heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο της καρδιας αυτων</span></span>). Here Mark has "in them." It is the devil's business to snatch up the seed from the heart before it sprouts and takes root. Every preacher knows how successful the devil is with his auditors. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:19">Matthew 13:19</span> has it "sown in the heart."</p>
<p><b>That they may not believe and be saved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη πιστευσαντες σωθωσιν</span></span>). Peculiar to Luke. Negative purpose with aorist active participle and first aorist (ingressive) passive subjunctive. Many reasons are offered today for the failure of preachers to win souls. Here is the main one, the activity of the devil during and after the preaching of the sermon. No wonder then that the sower must have good seed and sow wisely, for even then he can only win partial success. </p>
