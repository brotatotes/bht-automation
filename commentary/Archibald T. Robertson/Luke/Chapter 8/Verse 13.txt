<p><b> Which for a while believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο προς καιρον πιστευουσιν</span></span>). Ostensibly they are sincere and have made a real start in the life of faith.</p>
<p><b>They fall away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφισταντα</span></span>). Present middle indicative. They stand off, lose interest, stop coming to church, drop out of sight. It is positively amazing the number of new church members who "stumble" as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:17">Mark 4:17</span> has it (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκανδαλιζοντα</span></span>), do not like the pastor, take offence at something said or done by somebody, object to the appeals for money, feel slighted. The "season of trial" becomes a "season of temptation" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν καιρω πειρασμου</span></span>) for these superficial, emotional people who have to be periodically rounded up if kept within the fold. </p>
