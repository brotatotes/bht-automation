<p><b> In an honest and good heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν καρδια καλη κα αγαθη</span></span>). Peculiar to Luke. In verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:8">Luke 8:8</span> the land (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γην</span></span>) is called <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθην</span></span> (really good, generous) and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:15">Luke 8:15</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη καλη γη</span></span> (<b>in the beautiful or noble land</b>). So Luke uses both adjectives of the heart. The Greeks used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλος κ' αγαθος</span></span> of the high-minded gentleman. It is probable that Luke knew this idiom. It occurs here alone in the N.T. It is not easy to translate. We have such phrases as "good and true," "sound and good," "right and good," no one of which quite suits the Greek. Certainly Luke adds new moral qualities not in the Hellenic phrase. The English word "honest" here is like the Latin <i>honestus</i> (fair, noble). The words are to be connected with "hold fast" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεχουσιν</span></span>), "hold it down" so that the devil does not snatch it away, having depth of soil so that it does not shrivel up under the sun, and is not choked by weeds and thorns. It bears fruit (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρποφορουσιν</span></span>, an old expressive verb, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρπος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορεω</span></span>). That is the proof of spiritual life.</p>
<p><b>In patience </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υπομονη</span></span>). There is no other way for real fruit to come. Mushrooms spring up overnight, but they are usually poisonous. The best fruits require time, cultivation, patience. </p>
