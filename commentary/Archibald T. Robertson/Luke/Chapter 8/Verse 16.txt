<p><b> When he hath lighted a lamp </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυχνον αψας</span></span>). It is a portable lamp (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυχνον</span></span>) that one lights (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αψας</span></span> aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απτω</span></span>, to kindle, fasten to, light).</p>
<p><b>With a vessel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκευε</span></span>, instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκευος</span></span>). Here <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:21">Mark 4:21</span> has the more definite figure "under the bushel" as has <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:15">Matthew 5:15</span>.</p>
<p><b>Under the bed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποκατω κλινης</span></span>). Here <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:21">Mark 4:21</span> has the regular <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο την κλινην</span></span> instead of the late compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποκατω</span></span>. Ragg notes that Matthew distributes the sayings of Jesus given here by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:16-18">Luke 8:16-18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:21-25">Mark 4:21-25</span> concerning the parable of the lamp and gives them in three separate places (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:15">Matthew 5:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:26">Matthew 10:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:12">Matthew 13:12</span>). That is true, but it does not follow that Mark and Luke have bunched together separate sayings or that Matthew has scattered sayings delivered only on one occasion. One of the slowest lessons for some critics to learn is that Jesus repeated favourite sayings on different occasions and in different groupings just as every popular preacher and teacher does today. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:21">Mark 4:21</span> for further discussion of the lamp and stand.</p>
<p><b>May see the light </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βλεπωσιν το φως</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:16">Matthew 5:16</span> Jesus has it "may see your good works." The purpose of light is to let one see something else, not the light. Note present subjunctive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπωσιν</span></span>), linear action "Jesus had kindled a light within them. They must not hide it, but must see that it spreads to others" (Plummer). The parable of the lamp throws light on the parable of the sower. </p>
