<p><b> How ye hear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πως ακουετε</span></span>). The manner of hearing. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:24">Mark 4:24</span> has "what ye hear" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ακουετε</span></span>), the matter that is heard. Both are supremely important. Some things should not be heard at all. Some that are heard should be forgotten. Others should be treasured and practised.</p>
<p><b>For whosoever hath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hος αν γαρ εχη</span></span>). Present active subjunctive of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span> which may mean "keep on having" or "acquiring." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:25">Mark 4:25</span> for discussion.</p>
<p><b>Thinketh he hath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκε εχειν</span></span>), or <b>seems to acquire or to hold </b>. Losses in business illustrate this saying as when we see their riches take wings and fly away. So it is with hearing and heeding. Self-deception is a common complaint. </p>
