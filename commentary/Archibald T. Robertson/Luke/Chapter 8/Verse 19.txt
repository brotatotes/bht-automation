<p><b> His mother and brethren </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η μητηρ κα ο αδελφο αυτου</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:31-35">Mark 3:31-35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46-50">Matthew 12:46-50</span> place the visit of the mother and brothers of Jesus before the parable of the sower. Usually Luke follows Mark's order, but he does not do so here. At first the brothers of Jesus (younger sons of Joseph and Mary, I take the words to mean, there being sisters also) were not unfriendly to the work of Jesus as seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:12">John 2:12</span> when they with the mother of Jesus are with him and the small group (half dozen) disciples in Capernaum after the wedding in Cana. But as Jesus went on with his work and was rejected at Nazareth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:16-31">Luke 4:16-31</span>), there developed an evident disbelief in his claims on the part of the brothers who ridiculed him six months before the end (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:5">John 7:5</span>). At this stage they have apparently come with Mary to take Jesus home out of the excitement of the crowds, perhaps thinking that he is beside himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:21">Mark 3:21</span>). They hardly believed the charge of the rabbis that Jesus was in league with Beelzebub. Certainly the mother of Jesus could give no credence to that slander. But she herself was deeply concerned and wanted to help him if possible. See discussion of the problem in my little book <i>The Mother of Jesus</i> and also on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:31">Mark 3:31</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46">Matthew 12:46</span>.</p>
<p><b>Come to him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συντυχειν</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συντυγχανω</span></span>, an old verb, though here alone in the N.T., meaning to meet with, to fall in with as if accidentally, here with associative instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span>. </p>
