<p><b> Which had been healed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α ησαν τεθεραπευμενα</span></span>). Periphrastic past perfect passive, suggesting that the healing had taken place some time before this tour. These women all had personal grounds of gratitude to Jesus.</p>
<p><b>From whom seven devils (demons) had gone out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφ' ης δαιμονια επτα εξεληλυθε</span></span>). Past perfect active third singular for the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονια</span></span> are neuter plural. This first mention of Mary Magdalene describes her special cause of gratitude. This fact is stated also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:9">Mark 16:9</span> in the disputed close of the Gospel. The presence of seven demons in one person indicates special malignity (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:9">Mark 5:9</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:45">Matthew 17:45</span> for the parable of the demon who came back with seven other demons worse than the first. It is not known where Magdala was, whence Mary came. </p>
