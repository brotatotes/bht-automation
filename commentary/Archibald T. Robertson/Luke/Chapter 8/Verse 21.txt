<p><b> These which hear the word of God and do it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο τον λογον του θεου ακουοντες κα ποιουντες</span></span>). The absence of the article with "mother" and "brothers" probably means, as Plummer argues, "Mother to me and brothers to me are those who c." No one is a child of God because of human parentage (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:13">John 1:13</span>). "Family ties are at best temporal spiritual ties are eternal" (Plummer) . Note the use of "hear and do" together here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:24">Matthew 7:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:47">Luke 6:47</span> at the close of the Sermon on the Mount. The parable of the sower is almost like a footnote to that sermon. Later Jesus will make "doing" a test of friendship for him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:14">John 15:14</span>). </p>
