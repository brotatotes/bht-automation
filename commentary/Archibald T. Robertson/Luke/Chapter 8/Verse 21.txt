No one is a child of God because of human parentage (John 1:13). "Family ties are at best temporal spiritual ties are eternal" (Plummer) . Note the use of "hear and do" together here as in Matthew 7:24; Luke 6:47 at the close of the Sermon on the Mount. The parable of the sower is almost like a footnote to that sermon. Later Jesus will make "doing" a test of friendship for him (John 15:14).
