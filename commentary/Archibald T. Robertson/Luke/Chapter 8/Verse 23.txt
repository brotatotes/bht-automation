<p><b> He fell asleep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφυπνωσεν</span></span>). First aorist (ingressive) active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφυπνοω</span></span>, to put to sleep, to fall off to sleep, a late verb for which the older Greek used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθυπνοω</span></span>. Originally <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφυπνοω</span></span> meant to waken from sleep, then to fall off to sleep (possibly a medical use). This is the only passage which speaks of the sleep of Jesus. Here only in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Came down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεβη</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβαινω</span></span>, common verb. It was literally true. These wind storms (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαιλαπς</span></span>. So also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:37">Mark 4:37</span>) rushed from Hermon down through the Jordan gorge upon the Sea of Galilee and shook it like a tempest (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:24">Matthew 8:24</span>). Mark's (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:37">Mark 4:37</span>) vivid use of the dramatic present <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινετα</span></span> (ariseth) is not so precise as Luke's "came down." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:24">Matthew 8:24</span>. These sudden squalls were dangerous on this small lake.</p>
<p><b>They were filling </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεπληρουντο</span></span>). Imperfect passive. It was the boat that was being filled (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:37">Mark 4:37</span>) and it is here applied to the navigators as sailors sometimes spoke. An old verb, but in the N.T. used only by Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:23">Luke 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:1">Acts 2:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>Were in jeopardy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκινδυνευον</span></span>). Imperfect active, vivid description. Old verb, but in the N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:27">Acts 19:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:30">1 Corinthians 15:30</span>. </p>
