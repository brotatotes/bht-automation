<p><b> They arrived </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεπλευσαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταπλεω</span></span>, common verb, but here only in the N.T. Literally,</p>
<p><b>they sailed down </b> from the sea to the land, the opposite of</p>
<p><b>launched forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηχθησαν</span></span>) of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:22">Luke 8:22</span>. So we today use like nautical terms, to bear up, to bear down.</p>
<p><b>The Gerasenes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον Γερασηνων</span></span>). This is the correct text here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:1">Mark 5:1</span> while Gadarenes is correct in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28">Matthew 8:28</span>. See there for explanation of this famous discrepancy, now cleared up by Thomson's discovery of Khersa (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γερσα</span></span>) on the steep eastern bank and in the vicinity of Gadara.</p>
<p><b>Over against Galilee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιπερα της Γαλιλαιας</span></span>). Only here in the N.T. The later Greek form is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντιπεραν</span></span> (Polybius, etc.). Some MSS. here have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περαν</span></span> like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:1">Mark 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28">Matthew 8:28</span>. </p>
