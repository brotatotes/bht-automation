 And for a long time  (κα χρονω ικανω). The use of the associative instrumental case in expressions of time is a very old Greek idiom that still appears in the papyri (Robertson, Grammar, p. 527).He had worn no clothes  (ουκ ενεδυσατο ιματιον). First aorist middle indicative, constative aorist, viewing the "long time" as a point. Not pluperfect as English has it and not for the pluperfect, simply "and for a long time he did not put on himself (indirect middle) any clothing." The physician would naturally note this item. Common verb ενδυω or ενδυνω. This item in Luke alone, though implied by Mark 5:15 "clothed" (ιματισμενον).And abode not in any house  (κα εν οικια ουκ εμενεν). Imperfect active. Peculiar to Luke, though implied by the mention of tombs in all three (Mark 5:3; Matthew 8:28; Luke 8:27).
