<p><b> And for a long time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα χρονω ικανω</span></span>). The use of the associative instrumental case in expressions of time is a very old Greek idiom that still appears in the papyri (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 527).</p>
<p><b>He had worn no clothes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ενεδυσατο ιματιον</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative, constative aorist, viewing the "long time" as a point. Not pluperfect as English has it and not for the pluperfect, simply "and for a long time he did not put on himself (indirect middle) any clothing." The physician would naturally note this item. Common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδυω</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδυνω</span></span>. This item in Luke alone, though implied by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:15">Mark 5:15</span> "clothed" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιματισμενον</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>And abode not in any house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εν οικια ουκ εμενεν</span></span>). Imperfect active. Peculiar to Luke, though implied by the mention of tombs in all three (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:3">Mark 5:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28">Matthew 8:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:27">Luke 8:27</span>). </p>
