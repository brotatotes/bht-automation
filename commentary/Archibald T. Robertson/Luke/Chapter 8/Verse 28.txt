 Fell down  (προσεπεσεν). Second aorist active of προσπιπτω, to fall forward, towards, prostrate before one as here. Common verb. Mark 5:6 has προσεκυνησεν (worshipped).The Most High God  (του θεου του υψιστου). Uncertain whether του θεου genuine or not. But "the Most High" clearly means God as already seen (Luke 1:32; Luke 1:35; Luke 1:36; Luke 6:35). The phrase is common among heathen (Numbers 24:16; Micah 6:6; Isaiah 14:14). The demoniac may have been a Gentile, but it is the demon here speaking. See on Mark 2:7; Matthew 8:29 for the Greek idiom (τ εμο κα σο). "What have I to do with thee?" See there also for "Torment me not."
