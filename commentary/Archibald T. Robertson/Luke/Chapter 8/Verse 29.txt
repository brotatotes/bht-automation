In Matthew 23:4 it means to bind together. Some MSS. read δεσμεω in Luke 8:29.Breaking the bands asunder  (διαρησσων τα δεσμα). Old verb, the preposition δια (in two) intensifying the meaning of the simple verb ρησσω or ρηγνυμ, to rend.Was driven  (ηλαυνετο). Imperfect passive of ελαυνω, to drive, to row, to march (Xenophon). Only five times in the N.T. Here alone in Luke and peculiar to Luke in this incident.
