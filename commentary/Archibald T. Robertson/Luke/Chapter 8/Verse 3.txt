<p><b> Joanna </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιωανα</span></span>). Her husband <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χυζα</span></span>, steward (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτροπου</span></span>) of Herod, is held by some to be the nobleman (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλικος</span></span>) of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:46-53">John 4:46-53</span> who believed and all his house. At any rate Christ had a follower from the household of Herod Antipas who had such curiosity to see and hear him. One may recall also Manaen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>), Herod's foster brother. Joanna is mentioned again with Mary Magdalene in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:10">Luke 24:10</span>.</p>

The very fact that Jesus now had twelve men going with him called for help from others and the women of means responded to the demand.</p>
<p><b>Of their substance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ των υπαρχοντων αυταις</span></span>). From the things belonging to them. This is the first woman's missionary society for the support of missionaries of the Gospel. They had difficulties in their way, but they overcame these, so great was their gratitude and zeal. </p>
