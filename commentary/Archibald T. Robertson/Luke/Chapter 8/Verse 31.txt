 Into the abyss  (εις την αβυσσον). Rare old word common in LXX from α privative and βαθυς (deep). So bottomless place (supply χωρα). The deep sea in Genesis 1:2; Genesis 7:11. The common receptacle of the dead in Romans 10:7 and especially the abode of demons as here and Revelation 9:1-11; Revelation 11:7; Revelation 17:8; Revelation 20:1; Revelation 20:3.
