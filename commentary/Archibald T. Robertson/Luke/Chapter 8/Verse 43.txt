<p><b> Had spent all her living upon physicians </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ιατρους προσαναλωσασα ολον τον βιον</span></span>). First aorist active participle of an old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσαναλισκω</span></span>, only here in the N.T. But Westcott and Hort reject this clause because it is not in B D Syriac Sinaitic. Whether genuine or not, the other clause in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:26">Mark 5:26</span> certainly is not in Luke: "had suffered many things of many physicians." Probably both are not genuine in Luke who takes care of the physicians by the simple statement that it was a chronic case:</p>
<p><b>could not be healed of any </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ισχυσεν απ' ουδενος θεραπευθηνα</span></span>). He omitted also what Mark has: "and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse." </p>
