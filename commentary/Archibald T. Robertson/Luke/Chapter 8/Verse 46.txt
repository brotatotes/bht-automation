 For I perceived that power had gone forth from me  (εγω γαρ εγνων δυναμιν εξεληλυθυιαν απ' εμου). Εγνων is second aorist active indicative of γινωσκω, knowledge by personal experience as here. It is followed by the second perfect active participle εξεληλυθυιαν in indirect discourse (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1040-42). Jesus felt the sensation of power already gone. Who does not know what this sense of "goneness" or exhaustion of nervous energy means?
