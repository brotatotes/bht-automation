<p><b> For I perceived that power had gone forth from me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω γαρ εγνων δυναμιν εξεληλυθυιαν απ' εμου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγνων</span></span> is second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, knowledge by personal experience as here. It is followed by the second perfect active participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεληλυθυιαν</span></span> in indirect discourse (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1040-42). Jesus felt the sensation of power already gone. Who does not know what this sense of "goneness" or exhaustion of nervous energy means? </p>
