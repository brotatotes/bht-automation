<p><b> From the ruler of the synagogue's house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα του αρχισυναγωγου</span></span>). The word "house" is not in the Greek here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:35">Mark 5:35</span> where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> is used rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>, as here. But the ruler himself had come to Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:41">Luke 8:41</span>) and this is the real idea. Trouble not (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηκετ σκυλλε</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:6">Luke 7:6</span> for this verb and also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:35">Mark 5:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:36">Matthew 9:36</span>. </p>
