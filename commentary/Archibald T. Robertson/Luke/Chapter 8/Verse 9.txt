<p><b>What this parable might be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις αυτη ειη η παραβολη</span></span>). A mistranslation, What this parable was (or meant). The optative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειη</span></span> is merely due to indirect discourse, changing the indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> (is) of the direct question to the optative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειη</span></span> of the indirect, a change entirely with the writer or speaker and without any change of meaning (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1043f.). </p>
