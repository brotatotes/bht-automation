<p><b> The five ... the two </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους πεντε ... τους δυο</span></span>). Pointing back to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:13">Luke 9:13</span>, fine example of the Greek article.</p>
<p><b>And gave </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εδιδου</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>, kept on giving. This picturesque imperfect is preceded by the aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεκλασεν</span></span> (brake), a single act. This latter verb in the N.T. only here and the parallel in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:41">Mark 6:41</span>, though common enough in ancient Greek. We say "break off" where here the Greek has "break down" (or thoroughly), perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>. </p>
