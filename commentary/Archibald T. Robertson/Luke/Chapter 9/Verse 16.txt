 The five ... the two  (τους πεντε ... τους δυο). Pointing back to verse Luke 9:13, fine example of the Greek article.And gave  (κα εδιδου). Imperfect active of διδωμ, kept on giving. This picturesque imperfect is preceded by the aorist κατεκλασεν (brake), a single act. This latter verb in the N.T. only here and the parallel in Mark 6:41, though common enough in ancient Greek. We say "break off" where here the Greek has "break down" (or thoroughly), perfective use of κατα.
