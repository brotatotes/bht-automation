<p><b> As he was praying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω εινα αυτον προσευχομενον</span></span>). Common Lukan idiom of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> with the articular infinitive for a temporal clause, only here Luke has the periphrastic infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα προσευχομενον</span></span>) as also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:1">Luke 11:1</span>. This item about Christ's praying alone in Luke.</p>
<p><b>Alone </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα μονας</span></span>). In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:10">Mark 4:10</span>. Perhaps <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρας</span></span> (places) is to be supplied with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονας</span></span> (lonely places).</p>
<p><b>Were with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνησαν αυτω</span></span>). This seems like a contradiction unless "alone" is to be taken with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνησαν</span></span>. Westcott and Hort put <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνηντησαν</span></span> in the margin. This would mean that as Jesus was praying alone, the disciples fell in with him. At any rate he was praying apart from them. </p>
