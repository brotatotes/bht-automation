 He sent them forth  (απεστειλεν αυτους). First aorist active indicative of αποστελλω.To preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick  (κηρυσσειν την βασιλειαν του θεου κα ιασθα). Present indicative for the continuous functions during this campaign. This double office of herald (κηρυσσειν) and healer (ιασθα) is stated directly in Matthew 10:7-8. Note the verb ιαομα for healing here, though θεραπευειν in verse Luke 9:1, apparently used interchangeably.
