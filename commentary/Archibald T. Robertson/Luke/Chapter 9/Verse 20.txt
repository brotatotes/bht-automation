 But who say ye?  (Hυμεις δε τινα λεγετε;). Note the emphatic proleptical position of υμεις: "But ye who do ye say? This is really what mattered now with Jesus.The Christ of God  (Τον χριστον του θεου). The accusative though the infinitive is not expressed. The Anointed of God, the Messiah of God. See on Luke 2:26 for "the Anointed of the Lord." See on Matthew 16:17 for discussion of Peter's testimony in full. Mark 6:29 has simply "the Christ." It is clear from the previous narrative that this is not a new discovery from Simon Peter, but simply the settled conviction of the disciples after all the defections of the Galilean masses and the hostility of the Jerusalem ecclesiastics. The disciples still believed in Jesus as the Messiah of Jewish hope and prophecy. It will become plain that they do not grasp the spiritual conception of the Messiah and his kingdom that Jesus taught, but they are clear that he is the Messiah however faulty their view of the Messiah may be. There was comfort in this for Jesus. They were loyal to him.
