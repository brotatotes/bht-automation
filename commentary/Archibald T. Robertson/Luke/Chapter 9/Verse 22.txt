<p><b> Rejected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδοκιμασθηνα</span></span>). First aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδοκιμαζω</span></span>, to reject after trial.</p>
<p><b>The third day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη τριτη ημερα</span></span>). Locative case of time as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span>. Here in the parallel passage <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:31">Mark 8:31</span> has "after three days" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα τρεις ημερας</span></span>) in precisely the same sense. That is to say, "after three days" is just a free way of saying "on the third day" and cannot mean "on the fourth day" if taken too literally. For discussion of this plain prediction of the death of Christ with various details see discussion on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:31">Mark 8:31</span>. It was a melancholy outlook that depressed the disciples as Mark and Matthew show in the protest of Peter and his rebuke. </p>
