<p><b> He said unto all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγεν δε προς παντας</span></span>). This is like Luke (cf. verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:43">Luke 9:43</span>). Jesus wanted all (the multitude with his disciples, as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:34">Mark 8:34</span> has it) to understand the lesson of self-sacrifice. They could not yet understand the full meaning of Christ's words as applied to his approaching death of which he had been speaking. But certainly the shadow of the cross is already across the path of Jesus as he is here speaking. For details (soul, life, forfeit, gain, profit, lose, world) see discussion on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:24-26">Matthew 16:24-26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:34-37">Mark 8:34-37</span>. The word for lose (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολεσε</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολλυμ</span></span>, a very common verb) is used in the sense of destroy, kill, lose, as here. Note the mercantile terms in this passage (gain, lose, fine or forfeit, exchange).</p>
<p><b>Daily </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθ' ημεραν</span></span>). Peculiar to Luke in this incident. Take up the cross (his own cross) daily (aorist tense, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρατω</span></span>), but keep on following me (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακολουθειτω</span></span>, present tense). The cross was a familiar figure in Palestine. It was rising before Jesus as his destiny. Each man has his own cross to meet and bear. </p>
