<p><b> Till they see </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως αν ιδωσιν</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> referring to the future, an idiomatic construction. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:1">Mark 9:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:28">Matthew 16:28</span>. In all three passages "shall not taste of death" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη γευσωντα θανατου</span></span>, double negative with aorist middle subjunctive) occurs also. Rabbinical writings use this figure. Like a physician Christ tasted death that we may see how to die. Jesus referred to the cross as "this cup" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:36">Mark 14:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:39">Matthew 26:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:42">Luke 22:42</span>). Mark speaks of the kingdom of God as "come" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εληλυθυιαν</span></span>, second perfect active participle). Matthew as "coming" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομενον</span></span>) referring to the Son of man, while Luke has neither form. See Matthew and Mark for discussion of the theories of interpretation of this difficult passage. The Transfiguration follows in a week and may be the first fulfilment in the mind of Jesus. It may also symbolically point to the second coming. </p>
