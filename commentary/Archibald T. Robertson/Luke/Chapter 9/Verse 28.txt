<p><b> About eight days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωσε ημερα οκτω</span></span>). A <i>nominativus pendens</i> without connexion or construction. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:2">Mark 9:2</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:1">Matthew 17:1</span>) has "after six days" which agrees with the general statement.</p>
<p><b>Into the mountain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ορος</span></span>). Probably Mount Hermon because we know that Jesus was near Caesarea Philippi when Peter made the confession (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:27">Mark 8:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:13">Matthew 16:13</span>). Hermon is still the glory of Palestine from whose heights one can view the whole of the land. It was a fit place for the Transfiguration.</p>
<p><b>To pray </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευξασθα</span></span>). Peculiar to Luke who so often mentions Christ's habit of prayer (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:21">Luke 3:21</span>). See also verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:29">Luke 9:29</span> "as he was praying" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω προσευχεσθα</span></span>, one of Luke's favourite idioms).</p>
<p><b>His countenance was altered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο το ειδος του προσωπου αυτου ετερον</span></span>). Literally, "the appearance of his face became different." <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:2">Matthew 17:2</span> says that "his face did shine as the sun." Luke does not use the word "transfigured" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετεμορφωθη</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:2">Mark 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:2">Matthew 17:2</span>. He may have avoided this word because of the pagan associations with this word as Ovid's <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μεταμορφοσες</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>And his raiment became white and dazzling </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο ιματισμος αυτου λευκος εξαστραπτων</span></span>). Literally,</p>
<p><b>And his raiment white radiant </b>. There is no <i>and</i> between "white" and "dazzling." The participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαστραπτων</span></span> is from the compound verb meaning to flash (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αστραπτω</span></span>) out or forth (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span>). The simple verb is common for lightning flashes and bolts, but the compound in the LXX and here alone in the N.T. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:3">Mark 9:3</span> "exceeding white" and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:2">Matthew 17:2</span> "white as the light." </p>
