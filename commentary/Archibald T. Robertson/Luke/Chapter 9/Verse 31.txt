<p><b>Who appeared in glory </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο οφθεντες εν δοξη</span></span>).

<p><b>Spake of his decease </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγον την εξοδον</span></span>). Imperfect active, were talking about his <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξοδυς</span></span> (departure from earth to heaven) very much like our English word "decease" (Latin <i>decessus</i>, a going away). The glorious light graphically revealed Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus about the very subject concerning which Peter had dared to rebuke Jesus for mentioning (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:32">Mark 8:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:22">Matthew 16:22</span>). This very word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξοδυς</span></span> (way out) in the sense of death occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:15">2 Peter 1:15</span> and is followed by a brief description of the Transfiguration glory. Other words for death (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θανατος</span></span>) in the N.T. are <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβασις</span></span>, going out as departure (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7">Hebrews 13:7</span>), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιξις</span></span>, departing (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:29">Acts 20:29</span>), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναλυσις</span></span>, loosening anchor (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:6">2 Timothy 4:6</span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναλυσα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span>).</p>
<p><b>To accomplish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρουν</span></span>). To fulfil. Moses had led the Exodus from Egypt. Jesus will accomplish the exodus of God's people into the Promised Land on high. See on Mark and Matthew for discussion of significance of the appearance of Moses and Elijah as representatives of law and prophecy and with a peculiar death. The purpose of the Transfiguration was to strengthen the heart of Jesus as he was praying long about his approaching death and to give these chosen three disciples a glimpse of his glory for the hour of darkness coming. No one on earth understood the heart of Jesus and so Moses and Elijah came. The poor disciples utterly failed to grasp the significance of it all. </p>
