<p><b> Were heavy with sleep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησαν βεβαρημενο υπνω</span></span>). Periphrastic past perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρεω</span></span>, a late form for the ancient <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρυνω</span></span> (not in N.T. save Textus Receptus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:34">Luke 21:34</span>). This form, rare and only in passive (present, aorist, perfect) in the N.T., is like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρυνω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρυς</span></span>, and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρος</span></span>, weight, burden (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:2">Galatians 6:2</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυπνω</span></span> is in the instrumental case. They had apparently climbed the mountain in the early part of the night and were now overcome with sleep as Jesus prolonged his prayer. Luke alone tells of their sleep. The same word is used of the eyes of these three disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:43">Matthew 26:43</span>) and of the hearts of many (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:34">Luke 21:34</span>).</p>
<p><b>But when they were fully awake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαγρηγορησαντες δε</span></span>). First aorist active participle of this late (Herodian) and rare compound verb (here alone in the N.T.), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαγρηγορεω</span></span> (Luke is fond of compounds with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>). The simple verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γρηγορεω</span></span> (from the second perfect active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγρηγορα</span></span>) is also late, but common in the LXX and the N.T. The effect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> can be either to remain awake in spite of desire to sleep (margin of Revised Version) or to become thoroughly awake (ingressive aorist tense also) as Revised Version has it. This is most likely correct. The Syriac Sinaitic has it "When they awoke." Certainly they had been through a strain.</p>
<p><b>His glory </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την δοξαν αυτου</span></span>). See also verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:26">Luke 9:26</span> in the words of Jesus. </p>
