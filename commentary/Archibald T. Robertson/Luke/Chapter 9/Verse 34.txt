<p><b> Overshadowed them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεσκιαζεν αυτους</span></span>). Imperfect active (aorist in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:5">Matthew 17:5</span>) as present participle in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:7">Mark 9:7</span>, inchoative, the shadow began to come upon them. On Hermon as on many high mountains a cloud will swiftly cover the cap. I have seen this very thing at Blue Ridge, North Carolina. This same verb is used of the Holy Spirit upon Mary (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:35">Luke 1:35</span>). Nowhere else in the N.T., though an old verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επι, σκιαζω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκια</span></span>, shadow).</p>
<p><b>As they entered into the cloud </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω εισελθειν αυτους εις την νεφελην</span></span>). Luke's idiom of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> with the articular infinitive again (aorist active this time, on the entering in as to them). All six "entered into" the cloud, but only Peter, James, and John "became afraid" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφοβηθησαν</span></span>, ingressive first aorist passive). </p>
