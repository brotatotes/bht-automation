<p>If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινους</span></span> be accepted here instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτους</span></span>, the three disciples would be outside of the cloud.</p>
<p><b>Out of the cloud </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ της νεφελης</span></span>). This voice was the voice of the Father like that at the baptism of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:22">Luke 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:11">Mark 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>) and like that near the end (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:28-30">John 12:28-30</span>) when the people thought it was a clap of thunder or an angel.</p>
<p><b>My son, my chosen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hο υιος μου, ο εκλελεγμενος</span></span>). So the best documents (Aleph B L Syriac Sinaitic). The others make it "My Beloved" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:7">Mark 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:5">Matthew 17:5</span>. These disciples are commanded to hear Jesus, God's Son, even when he predicts his death, a pointed rebuke to Simon Peter as to all. </p>
