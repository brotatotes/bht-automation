<p><b> When the voice came </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν το γενεσθα την φωνην</span></span>). Another example of Luke's idiom, this time with the second aorist middle infinitive. Literally, "on the coming as to the voice" (accusative of general reference). It does not mean that it was "after" the voice was past that Jesus was found alone, but simultaneously with it (ingressive aorist tense).</p>
<p><b>Alone </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονος</span></span>). Same adjective in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:8">Mark 9:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:8">Matthew 17:8</span> translated "only." Should be rendered "alone" there also.</p>
<p><b>They held their peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσιγησαν</span></span>). Ingressive aorist active of common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σιγαω</span></span>, became silent. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:9">Mark 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:9">Matthew 17:9</span>, Jesus commanded them not to tell till His Resurrection from the dead. Luke notes that they in awe obeyed that command and it turns out that they finally forgot the lesson of this night's great experience. By and by they will be able to tell them, but not "in those days."</p>
<p><b>Which they had seen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων εωρακαν</span></span>). Attraction of the relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> into the case of the unexpressed antecedent <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span>. Perfect active indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εωρακαν</span></span> with <i>Koine</i> (papyri) form for the ancient <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εωρακασιν</span></span> changed by analogy to the first aorist ending in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-αν</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ασιν</span></span>. </p>
