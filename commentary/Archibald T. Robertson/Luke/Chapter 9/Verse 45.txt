<p><b> It was concealed from them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην παρακεκαλυμμενον απ' αυτων</span></span>). Periphrastic past perfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακαλυπτω</span></span>, a common verb, but only here in the N.T., to cover up, to hide from. This item only in Luke.</p>
<p><b>That they should not perceive it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη αισθωντα αυτο</span></span>). Second aorist middle subjunctive of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αισθανομα</span></span> used with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη</span></span>, negative purpose. This explanation at least relieves the disciples to some extent of full responsibility for their ignorance about the death of Jesus as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:32">Mark 9:32</span> observes, as does Luke here that they were afraid to ask him. Plummer says, "They were not allowed to understand the saying then, in order that they might remember it afterwards, and see that Jesus had met His sufferings with full knowledge and free will." Perhaps also, if they had fully understood, they might have lacked courage to hold on to the end. But it is a hard problem. </p>
