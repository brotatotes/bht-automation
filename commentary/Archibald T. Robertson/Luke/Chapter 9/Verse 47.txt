 Took a little child  (επιλαβομενος παιδιον). Second aorist middle participle of the common verb επιλαμβανω. Strictly, Taking a little child to himself (indirect middle). Mark 9:36 has merely the active λαβων of the simple verb λαμβανω. Set him by his side (εστησεν αυτο παρ' εαυτω). "In his arms" Mark 9:36 has it, "in the midst of them" Matthew 18:3 says. All three attitudes following one another (the disciples probably in a circle around Jesus anyhow) and now the little child (Peter's child?) was slipped down by the side of Jesus as he gave the disciples an object lesson in humility which they sorely needed.
