<p><b> This little child </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο το παιδιον</span></span>). As Jesus spoke he probably had his hand upon the head of the child. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:5">Matthew 18:5</span> has "one such little child." The honoured disciple, Jesus holds, is the one who welcomes little children "in my name" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τω ονοματ μου</span></span>), upon the basis of my name and my authority. It was a home-thrust against the selfish ambition of the Twelve. Ministry to children is a mark of greatness. Have preachers ever yet learned how to win children to Christ? They are allowed to slip away from home, from Sunday school, from church, from Christ.</p>
<p><b>For he that is least among you all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο γαρ μικροτερος εν πασιν υμιν υπαρχων</span></span>). Note the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαρχω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:41">Luke 8:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:50">Luke 23:50</span>. The comparative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μικροτερος</span></span> is in accord with the <i>Koine</i> idiom where the superlative is vanishing (nearly gone in modern Greek). But</p>
<p><b>great </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγας</span></span>) is positive and very strong. This saying peculiar to Luke here. </p>
