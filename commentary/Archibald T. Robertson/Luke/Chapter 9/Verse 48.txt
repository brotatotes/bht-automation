 This little child  (τουτο το παιδιον). As Jesus spoke he probably had his hand upon the head of the child. Matthew 18:5 has "one such little child." The honoured disciple, Jesus holds, is the one who welcomes little children "in my name" (επ τω ονοματ μου), upon the basis of my name and my authority. It was a home-thrust against the selfish ambition of the Twelve. Ministry to children is a mark of greatness. Have preachers ever yet learned how to win children to Christ? They are allowed to slip away from home, from Sunday school, from church, from Christ.For he that is least among you all  (ο γαρ μικροτερος εν πασιν υμιν υπαρχων). Note the use of υπαρχω as in Luke 8:41; Luke 23:50. The comparative μικροτερος is in accord with the Koine idiom where the superlative is vanishing (nearly gone in modern Greek). Butgreat  (μεγας) is positive and very strong. This saying peculiar to Luke here.
