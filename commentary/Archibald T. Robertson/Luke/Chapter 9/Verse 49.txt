<p><b> And John answered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκριθεις δε Ιωανης</span></span>). As if John wanted to change the subject after the embarrassment of the rebuke for their dispute concerning greatness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:46-48">Luke 9:46-48</span>).</p>
<p><b>Master </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστατα</span></span>). Only in Luke in the N.T. as already four times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:5">Luke 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:24">Luke 8:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:45">Luke 8:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:33">Luke 9:33</span>).</p>
<p><b>We forbade him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκωλυομεν αυτον</span></span>). Conative imperfect as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:38">Mark 9:38</span>, We tried to hinder him.</p>
<p><b>Because he followeth not with us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ουκ ακολουθε μεθ ημων</span></span>). Present tense preserved for vividness where Mark has imperfect</p>
<p><b>kolouthei </b>. Note also here "with us" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθ' ημων</span></span>) where Mark has associative instrumental <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημιν</span></span>. It is a pitiful specimen of partisan narrowness and pride even in the Beloved Disciple, one of the Sons of Thunder. The man was doing the Master's work in the Master's name and with the Master's power, but did not run with the group of the Twelve. </p>
