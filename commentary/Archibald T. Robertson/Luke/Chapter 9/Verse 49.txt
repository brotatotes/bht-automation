 And John answered  (αποκριθεις δε Ιωανης). As if John wanted to change the subject after the embarrassment of the rebuke for their dispute concerning greatness (Luke 9:46-48).Master  (επιστατα). Only in Luke in the N.T. as already four times (Luke 5:5; Luke 8:24; Luke 8:45; Luke 9:33).We forbade him  (εκωλυομεν αυτον). Conative imperfect as in Mark 9:38, We tried to hinder him.Because he followeth not with us  (οτ ουκ ακολουθε μεθ ημων). Present tense preserved for vividness where Mark has imperfectkolouthei . Note also here "with us" (μεθ' ημων) where Mark has associative instrumental ημιν. It is a pitiful specimen of partisan narrowness and pride even in the Beloved Disciple, one of the Sons of Thunder. The man was doing the Master's work in the Master's name and with the Master's power, but did not run with the group of the Twelve.
