<p><b> As many as receive you not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσο αν μη δεχωντα υμας</span></span>). Indefinite relative plural with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and present middle subjunctive and the negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span>. Here <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:14">Matthew 10:14</span> has the singular (whosoever) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:11">Mark 6:11</span> has "whatsoever place."</p>
<p><b>For a testimony against them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις μαρτυριον επ' αυτους</span></span>). Note use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ' αυτους</span></span> where <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:11">Mark 6:11</span> has simply the dative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοις</span></span> (disadvantage), really the same idea. </p>
