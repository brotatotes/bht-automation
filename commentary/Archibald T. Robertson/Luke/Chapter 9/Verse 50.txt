<p><b> "Against you is for you" </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθ' υμων υπερ υμων</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:40">Mark 9:40</span> has "against us is for us" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημων ... ημων</span></span>). The <i>Koine</i> Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υ</span></span> were often pronounced alike and it was easy to interchange them. So many MSS. here read just as in Mark. The point is precisely the same as it is a proverbial saying. See a similar saying in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:23">Luke 11:23</span>: "He that is not with me is against me." The prohibition here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:39">Mark 9:39</span> is general: "Stop hindering him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη κωλυετε, μη</span></span> and the present imperative, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the aorist subjunctive). The lesson of toleration in methods of work for Christ is needed today. </p>
