<p><b> When the days were well-nigh come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω συμπληρουσθα τας ημερας</span></span>). Luke's common idiom <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> with the articular infinitive, "in the being fulfilled as to the days." This common compound occurs in the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:23">Luke 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:1">Acts 2:1</span>. The language here makes it plain that Jesus was fully conscious of the time of his death as near as already stated (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:22">Luke 9:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:27">Luke 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:31">Luke 9:31</span>).</p>
<p><b>That he should be received up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της αναλημψεως αυτου</span></span>). Literally, "of his taking up." It is an old word (from Hippocrates on), but here alone in the N.T. It is derived from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναλαμβανω</span></span> (the verb used of the Ascension, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:2">Acts 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:11">Acts 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>) and refers here to the Ascension of Jesus after His Resurrection. Not only in John's Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>) does Jesus reveal a yearning for a return to the Father, but it is in the mind of Christ here as evidently at the Transfiguration (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:31">Luke 9:31</span>) and later in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:49">Luke 12:49</span>.</p>
<p><b>He steadfastly set his face </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος το προσωπον εστηρισεν</span></span>). Note emphatic <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος</span></span>,</p>
<p><b>he himself </b>, with fixedness of purpose in the face of difficulty and danger. This look on Christ's face as he went to his doom is noted later in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:32">Mark 10:32</span>. It is a Hebraistic idiom (nine times in Ezekiel), this use of face here, but the verb (effective aorist active) is an old one from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηριζω</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηριγξ</span></span>, a support), to set fast, to fix.</p>
<p><b>To go to Jerusalem </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του πορευεσθα εις Ιερουσαλημ</span></span>). Genitive infinitive of purpose. Luke three times mentions Christ making his way to Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:22">Luke 13:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:11">Luke 17:11</span>) and John mentions three journeys to Jerusalem during the later ministry (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:10">John 7:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:17">John 11:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span>). It is natural to take these journeys to be the same in each of these Gospels. Luke does not make definite location of each incident and John merely supplements here and there. But in a broad general way they seem to correspond. </p>
