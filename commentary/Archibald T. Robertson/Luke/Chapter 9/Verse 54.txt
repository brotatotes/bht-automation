<p><b> Saw this </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδοντες</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>. Saw the messengers returning.</p>
<p><b>We bid </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελεις ειπωμεν</span></span>). Deliberative subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπωμεν</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελεις</span></span> without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>, probably two questions, Dost thou wish? Shall we bid? Perhaps the recent appearance of Elijah on the Mount of Transfiguration reminded James and John of the incident in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+1:10-12">2 Kings 1:10-12</span>. Some MSS. add here "as Elijah did." The language of the LXX is quoted by James and John, these fiery Sons of Thunder. Note the two aorist active infinitives (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβηναι, αναλωσα</span></span>, the first ingressive, the second effective). </p>
