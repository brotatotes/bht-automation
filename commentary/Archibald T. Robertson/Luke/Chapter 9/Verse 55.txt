<p><b> But he turned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στραφεις δε</span></span>). Second aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στρεφω</span></span>, common verb, to turn round. Dramatic act. Some ancient MSS. have here:</p>
<p><b>Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ οιδατε ποιου πνευματος εστε</span></span>). This sounds like Christ and may be a genuine saying though not a part of Luke's Gospel. A smaller number of MSS. add also:</p>
<p><b>For the Son of Man came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hο γαρ υιος του ανθρωπου ουκ ηλθεν ψυχας ανθρωπων απολεσα αλλα σωσα</span></span>), a saying reminding us of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17">Matthew 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:10">Luke 19:10</span>. Certain it is that here Jesus rebuked the bitterness of James and John toward Samaritans as he had already chided John for his narrowness towards a fellow-worker in the kingdom. </p>
