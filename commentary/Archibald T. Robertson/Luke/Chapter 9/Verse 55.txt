 But he turned  (στραφεις δε). Second aorist passive participle of στρεφω, common verb, to turn round. Dramatic act. Some ancient MSS. have here:Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of  (ουκ οιδατε ποιου πνευματος εστε). This sounds like Christ and may be a genuine saying though not a part of Luke's Gospel. A smaller number of MSS. add also:For the Son of Man came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them  (Hο γαρ υιος του ανθρωπου ουκ ηλθεν ψυχας ανθρωπων απολεσα αλλα σωσα), a saying reminding us of Matthew 5:17; Luke 19:10. Certain it is that here Jesus rebuked the bitterness of James and John toward Samaritans as he had already chided John for his narrowness towards a fellow-worker in the kingdom.
