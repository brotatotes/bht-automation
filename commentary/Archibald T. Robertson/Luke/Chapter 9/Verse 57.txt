<p><b> A certain man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:19">Matthew 8:19</span> calls him "a scribe." <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:57-60">Luke 9:57-60</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:19-22">Matthew 8:19-22</span>, but not in Mark and so from Q or the Logia.</p>
<p><b>Wherever you go </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου εαν απερχη</span></span>) is the present middle subjunctive with the indefinite relative adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span>, common Greek idiom. See on Matthew for "holes," "nests," "Son of man." The idiom "where to lay his head" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">που την κεφαλην κλινη</span></span>) is the same in both, the deliberative subjunctive retained in the indirect question. "Jesus knows the measure of the scribe's enthusiasm" (Plummer). The wandering life of Jesus explains this statement. </p>
