<p><b> All that was done </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα γινομενα παντα</span></span>). Present middle participle, "all that was coming to pass."</p>
<p><b>He was much perplexed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διηπορε</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαπορεω</span></span>, to be thoroughly at a loss, unable to find a way out (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια, α</span></span> privative, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορος</span></span>, way), common ancient verb, but only in Luke's writings in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Because it was said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το λεγεσθα</span></span>). Neat Greek idiom, the articular passive infinitive after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>. Three reports came to the ears of Herod as Luke has it, each introduced by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> (that) in indirect discourse: "By some" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο τινων</span></span>), "by some" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο τινων δε</span></span>), "by others" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλων δε, υπο</span></span> not here expressed, but carried over). The verbs in the indirect discourse here (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:7">Luke 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:8">Luke 9:8</span>) are all three aorists (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγερθη</span></span> first passive; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφανη</span></span> second passive; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεστη</span></span> second active), not past perfects as the English has them. </p>
