 As he was yet a coming  (ετ προσερχομενου αυτου). Genitive absolute. While he was yet coming (the boy, that is, not Jesus). Note quaint English "a coming" retained in the Revised Version.Dashed him  (ερρηξεν αυτον). First aorist active indicative of ρηγνυμ or ρησσω, to rend or convulse, a common verb, used sometimes of boxers giving knockout blows.Tare grievously  (συνεσπαραξεν). Rare word as only here and Mark 9:20 in the N.T., which see.Gave him back to his father  (απεδωκεν αυτον τω πατρ αυτου). Tender touch alone in Luke as in Luke 7:15.  They were all astonished  (εξεπλησσοντο δε παντες). Imperfect passive of the common verb εκπλησσω or εκπληγνυμ, to strike out, a picturesque description of the amazement of all at the easy victory of Jesus where the nine disciples had failed.At the majesty of God  (επ τη μεγαλειοτητ του θεου). A late word from the adjective μεγαλειος and that from μεγας (great). In the N.T. only here and Acts 19:27 of Artemis and in 2 Peter 1:16 of the Transfiguration. It came to be used by the emperors like our word "Majesty."Which he did  (οις εποιε). This is one of the numerous poor verse divisions. This sentence has nothing to do with the first part of the verse. The imperfect active εποιε covers a good deal not told by Luke (see Mark 9:30; Matthew 17:22). Note the attraction of the relativehois  into the case ofpsin , its antecedent.
