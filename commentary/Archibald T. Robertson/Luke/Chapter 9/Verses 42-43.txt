<p><b>Dashed him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερρηξεν αυτον</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρηγνυμ</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρησσω</span></span>, to rend or convulse, a common verb, used sometimes of boxers giving knockout blows.</p>
<p><b>Tare grievously </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεσπαραξεν</span></span>). Rare word as only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:20">Mark 9:20</span> in the N.T., which see.</p>

<p><b> They were all astonished </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεπλησσοντο δε παντες</span></span>). Imperfect passive of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπλησσω</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπληγνυμ</span></span>, to strike out, a picturesque description of the amazement of all at the easy victory of Jesus where the nine disciples had failed.</p>
<p><b>At the majesty of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τη μεγαλειοτητ του θεου</span></span>). A late word from the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγαλειος</span></span> and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγας</span></span> (great). In the N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:27">Acts 19:27</span> of Artemis and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16">2 Peter 1:16</span> of the Transfiguration.

<p><b>Which he did </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οις εποιε</span></span>). This is one of the numerous poor verse divisions. This sentence has nothing to do with the first part of the verse. The imperfect active <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εποιε</span></span> covers a good deal not told by Luke (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:30">Mark 9:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:22">Matthew 17:22</span>). Note the attraction of the relative</p>
<p><b>hois </b> into the case of</p>
<p><b>psin </b>, its antecedent. </p>
