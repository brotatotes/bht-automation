<p><b> Driveth him forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον εκβαλλε</span></span>). Vivid word, bolder than Matthew's "was led up" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηχθη</span></span>) and Luke's "was led" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγετο</span></span>). It is the same word employed in the driving out of demons (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:34">Mark 1:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:39">Mark 1:39</span>). Mark has here "straightway" where Matthew has "then" (see on verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:9">Mark 1:9</span>). The forty days in the wilderness were under the direct guidance of the Holy Spirit. The entire earthly life of Jesus was bound up with the Holy Spirit from his birth to his death and resurrection. </p>
