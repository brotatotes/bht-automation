<p><b> And passing along by the Sea of Galilee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα παραγων παρα την θαλασσαν της Γαλιλαιας</span></span>). Mark uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span> (along, beside) twice and makes the picture realistic. He catches this glimpse of Christ in action. Casting a</p>
<p><b>net </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμφιβαλλοντας</span></span>). Literally casting on both sides, now on one side, now on the other. Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18">Matthew 4:18</span>) has a different phrase which see. There are two papyri examples of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμφιβαλλω</span></span>, one verb absolutely for fishing as here, the other with the accusative. It is fishing with a net, making a cast, a haul. These four disciples were fishermen (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλιεις</span></span>) and were</p>
<p><b>partners </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετοχο</span></span>) as Luke states (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:7">Luke 5:7</span>). </p>
