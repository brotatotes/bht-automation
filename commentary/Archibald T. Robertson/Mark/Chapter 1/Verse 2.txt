<p><b> In Isaiah, the prophet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω Εσαια τω προφητη</span></span>). The quotation comes from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:1">Malachi 3:1</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:3">Isaiah 40:3</span>. The Western and Neutral classes read Isaiah, the Alexandrian and Syrian, "the prophets," an evident correction because part of it is from Malachi. But Isaiah is mentioned as the chief of the prophets. It was common to combine quotations from the prophets in <i>testimonia</i> and <i>catenae</i> (chains of quotations). This is Mark's only prophetic quotation on his own account (Bruce). </p>
