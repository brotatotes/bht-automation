<p><b> And taught </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιδασκεν</span></span>). Inchoative imperfect, began to teach as soon as he entered the synagogue in Capernaum on the sabbath. The synagogue in Capernaum afforded the best opening for the teaching of Jesus. He had now made Capernaum (Tell Hum) his headquarters after the rejection in Nazareth as explained in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:16-31">Luke 4:16-31</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:13-16">Matthew 4:13-16</span>. The ruins of this synagogue have been discovered and there is even talk of restoring the building since the stones are in a good state of preservation. Jesus both taught (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκω</span></span>) and preached (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυσσω</span></span>) in the Jewish synagogues as opportunity was offered by the chief or leader of the synagogue (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχισυναγωγος</span></span>). The service consisted of prayer, praise, reading of scripture, and exposition by any rabbi or other competent person. Often Paul was invited to speak at such meetings. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:20">Luke 4:20</span> Jesus gave back the roll of Isaiah to the attendant or beadle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω υπηρετη</span></span>) whose business it was to bring out the precious manuscript and return it to its place. Jesus was a preacher of over a year when he began to teach in the Capernaum synagogue. His reputation had preceded him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:14">Luke 4:14</span>). </p>
