<p><b> They were astonished </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεπλησσοντο</span></span>). Pictorial imperfect as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:32">Luke 4:32</span> describing the amazement of the audience, "meaning strictly to strike a person out of his senses by some strong feeling, such as fear, wonder, or even joy" (Gould).</p>
<p><b>And not as their scribes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουχ ως ο γραμματεις</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:32">Luke 4:32</span> has only "with authority" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εξουσια</span></span>). Mark has it "as having authority" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως εχων εξουσιαν</span></span>). He struck a note not found by the rabbi. They quoted other rabbis and felt their function to be expounders of the traditions which they made a millstone around the necks of the people. By so doing they set aside the word and will of God by their traditions and petty legalism (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:9">Mark 7:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:13">Mark 7:13</span>).

"Mark omits much, and is in many ways a meagre Gospel, but it makes a distinctive contribution to the evangelic history <i>in showing by a few realistic touches</i> (this one of them) <i>the remarkable personality of Jesus</i>" (Bruce). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:29">Matthew 7:29</span> for the like impression made by the Sermon on the Mount where the same language occurs. The chief controversy in Christ's life was with these scribes, the professional teachers of the oral law and mainly Pharisees. At once the people see that Jesus stands apart from the old group. He made a sensation in the best sense of that word. There was a buzz of excitement at the new teacher that was increased by the miracle that followed the sermon. </p>
