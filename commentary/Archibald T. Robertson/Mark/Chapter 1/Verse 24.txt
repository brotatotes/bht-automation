<p><b> What have we to do with thee? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ημιν κα σοι?</span></span>) The same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span>. Ethical dative. Nothing in common between the demon and Jesus. Note "we." The man speaks for the demon and himself, double personality. The recognition of Jesus by the demons may surprise us since the rabbis (the ecclesiastics) failed to do so. They call Jesus "The Holy One of God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αγιος του θεου</span></span>). Hence the demon feared that Jesus was come to destroy him and the man in his power. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span> the demon calls Jesus "Son of God." Later the disciples will call Jesus "The Holy One of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:69">John 6:69</span>). The demon cried out aloud (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεκραξεν</span></span>, late first aorist form, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεκραγεν</span></span>, common second aorist) so that all heard the strange testimony to Jesus. The man says "I know" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span>), correct text, some manuscripts "we know" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδαμεν</span></span>), including the demon. </p>
