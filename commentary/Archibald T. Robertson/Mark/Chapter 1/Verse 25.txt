 Hold thy peace  (φιμωθητ). First aorist passive imperative of φιμοω. "Be quiet," Moffatt translates it. But it is a more vigorous word, "Be muzzled" like an ox. So literally in Deuteronomy 25:4; 1 Corinthians 9:9; 1 Timothy 5:18. It is common in Josephus, Lucian, and the LXX. See Matthew 22:12; Matthew 22:34. Gould renders it "Shut up." "Shut your mouth" would be too colloquial. Vincent suggests "gagged," but that is more the idea of επιστομαζειν in Titus 1:11, to stop the mouth.
