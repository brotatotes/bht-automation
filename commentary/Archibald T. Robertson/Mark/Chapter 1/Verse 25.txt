<p><b> Hold thy peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιμωθητ</span></span>). First aorist passive imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιμοω</span></span>. "Be quiet," Moffatt translates it. But it is a more vigorous word, "Be muzzled" like an ox. So literally in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+25:4">Deuteronomy 25:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:9">1 Corinthians 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:18">1 Timothy 5:18</span>. It is common in Josephus, Lucian, and the LXX. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:12">Matthew 22:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:34">Matthew 22:34</span>. Gould renders it "Shut up." "Shut your mouth" would be too colloquial. Vincent suggests "gagged," but that is more the idea of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστομαζειν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:11">Titus 1:11</span>, to stop the mouth. </p>
