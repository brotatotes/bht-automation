<p><b> They questioned among themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνζητειν αυτους</span></span>). By look and word.</p>
<p><b>A new teaching </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδαχη καινη</span></span>). One surprise had followed another this day. The teaching was fresh (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινη</span></span>), original as the dew of the morning on the blossoms just blown. That was a novelty in that synagogue where only staid and stilted rabbinical rules had been heretofore droned out. This new teaching charmed the people, but soon will be rated as heresy by the rabbis. And it was with authority (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ' εξουσιαν</span></span>). It is not certain whether the phrase is to be taken with "new teaching," "It's new teaching with authority behind it," as Moffatt has it, or with the verb; "with authority commandeth even the unclean spirits" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τοις πνευμασιν τοις ακαθαρτοις επιτασσε</span></span>). The position is equivocal and may be due to the fact that "Mark gives the incoherent and excited remarks of the crowd in this natural form" (Swete). But the most astonishing thing of all is that the demons "obey him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπακουουσιν αυτω</span></span>). The people were accustomed to the use of magical formulae by the Jewish exorcists (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:27">Matthew 12:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:13">Acts 19:13</span>), but here was something utterly different. Simon Magus could not understand how Simon Peter could do his miracles without some secret trick and even offered to buy it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:19">Acts 8:19</span>). </p>
