<p><b> The house of Simon and Andrew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την οικιαν Σιμωνος κα Ανδρεου</span></span>). Peter was married and both he and Andrew lived together in "Peter's house" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14">Matthew 8:14</span>) with Peter's wife and mother-in-law. Peter was evidently married before he began to follow Jesus. Later his wife accompanied him on his apostolic journeys (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:5">1 Corinthians 9:5</span>). This incident followed immediately after the service in the synagogue on the sabbath. All the Synoptics give it. Mark heard Peter tell it as it occurred in his own house where Jesus made his home while in Capernaum. Each Gospel gives touches of its own to the story. Mark has "lay sick of a fever " (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεκειτο πυρεσσουσα</span></span>), lay prostrate burning with fever. Matthew puts it "stretched out (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεβλημενην</span></span>) with a fever." Luke has it "holden with a great fever" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην συνεχομενη πυρετω μεγαλω</span></span>), a technical medical phrase. They all mention the instant recovery and ministry without any convalescence. Mark and Matthew speak of the touch of Jesus on her hand and Luke speaks of Jesus standing over her like a doctor. It was a tender scene. </p>
