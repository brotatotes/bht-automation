<p><b> When the sun did set </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε εδυσεν ο ηλιος</span></span>). This picturesque detail Mark has besides "at even" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψιας γενομενης</span></span>, genitive absolute, evening having come). Matthew has "when even was come," Luke "when the sun was setting." The sabbath ended at sunset and so the people were now at liberty to bring their sick to Jesus. The news about the casting out of the demon and the healing of Peter's mother-in-law had spread all over Capernaum. They brought them in a steady stream (imperfect tense, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφερον</span></span>). Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:40">Luke 4:40</span>) adds that Jesus laid his hand on every one of them as they passed by in grateful procession. </p>
