<p><b> At the door </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς την θυραν</span></span>). At the door of Peter's house. The whole city was gathered together there (n episungmen, past perfect passive periphrastic indicative, double compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span>). Mark alone mentions this vivid detail. He is seeing with Peter's eyes again. Peter no doubt watched the beautiful scene with pride and gratitude as Jesus stood in the door and healed the great crowds in the glory of that sunset. He loved to tell it afterwards.</p>
<p><b>Divers diseases </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποικιλαις νοσοις</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span> about <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποικιλος</span></span> meaning many-coloured, variegated. All sorts of sick folk came and were healed. </p>
