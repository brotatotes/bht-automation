<p><b> Devils </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονια</span></span>). Demons it should be translated always.</p>
<p><b>Suffered not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ηφιεν</span></span>). Would not allow, imperfect tense of continued refusal. The reason given is "because they knew him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ηιδεισαν αυτον</span></span>). Whether "to be Christ" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστον εινα</span></span>) is genuine or not, that is the meaning and is a direct reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:24">Mark 1:24</span> when in the synagogue the demon recognized and addressed Jesus as the Holy One of God. Testimony from such a source was not calculated to help the cause of Christ with the people. He had told the other demon to be silent. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span> for discussion of the word demon. </p>
