<p><b> Followed after him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεδιωξεν αυτον</span></span>). Hunted him out (Moffatt). Perfective use of the preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> (down to the finish). The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωκω</span></span> is used for the hunt or chase, pursuit. Vulgate has <i>persecutus est</i>. The personal story of Peter comes in here. "Simon's intention at least was good; the Master seemed to be losing precious opportunities and must be brought back" (Swete). Peter and those with him kept up the search till they found him. The message that they brought would surely bring Jesus back to Peter's house. </p>
