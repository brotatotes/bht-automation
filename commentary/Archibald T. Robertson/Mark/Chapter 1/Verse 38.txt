<p><b> Into the next towns </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τας εχομενας κωμοπολεις</span></span>). It was a surprising decision for Jesus to leave the eager, excited throngs in Capernaum for the country town or village cities without walls or much importance. Only instance of the word in the N.T. Late Greek word. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχομενας</span></span> for next is a classic use meaning clinging to, next to a thing. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:33">Luke 13:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:44">Acts 13:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:15">Acts 20:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:9">Hebrews 6:9</span>. "D" here has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγγυς</span></span> (near). </p>
