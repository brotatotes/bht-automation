<p><b> John came </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο Ιωανης</span></span>). His coming was an epoch (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span>), not a mere event (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span>). His coming was in accordance with the prophetic picture (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:2">Mark 1:2</span>). Note the same verb about John in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:6">John 1:6</span>. The coming of John the Baptizer was the real beginning of the spoken message about Christ. He is described as</p>
<p><b>the baptizing one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο απτιζων</span></span>) in the wilderness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη ερημω</span></span>). The baptizing took place in the River Jordan (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:5">Mark 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:9">Mark 1:9</span>) which was included in the general term the wilderness or the deserted region of Judea.</p>
<p><b>Preached the baptism of repentance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυσσων βαπτισμα μετανοιας</span></span>). Heralded a repentance kind of baptism (genitive case, genus case), a baptism marked by repentance. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span> for discussion of repent, an exceedingly poor rendering of John's great word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοιας</span></span>. He called upon the Jews to change their minds and to turn from their sins, "confessing their sins" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξομολογουμενο τας αμαρτιας αυτων</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span>. The public confessions produced a profound impression as they would now.</p>
<p><b>Unto remission of sins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις αφεσιν αμαρτιων</span></span>). This is a difficult phrase to translate accurately. Certainly John did not mean that the baptism was the means of obtaining the forgiveness of their sins or necessary to the remission of sins. The trouble lies in the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> which sometimes is used when purpose is expressed, but sometimes when there is no such idea as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:41">Matthew 10:41</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:41">Matthew 12:41</span>. Probably "with reference to" is as good a translation here as is possible. The baptism was on the basis of the repentance and confession of sin and, as Paul later explained (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>), was a picture of the death to sin and resurrection to new life in Christ. This symbol was already in use by the Jews for proselytes who became Jews. John is treating the Jewish nation as pagans who need to repent, to confess their sins, and to come back to the kingdom of God. The baptism in the Jordan was the objective challenge to the people. </p>
