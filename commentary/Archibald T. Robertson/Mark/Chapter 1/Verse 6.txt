<p><b> Clothed with camel's hair </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδεδυμενος τριχας καμηλου</span></span>). Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:4">Matthew 3:4</span>) has it a garment (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδυμα</span></span>) of camel's hair. Mark has it in the accusative plural the object of the perfect passive participle retained according to a common Greek idiom. It was, of course, not camel's skin, but rough cloth woven of camel's hair. For the locusts and wild honey, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:4">Matthew 3:4</span>. Dried locusts are considered palatable and the wild honey, or "mountain honey" as some versions give it (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελ αγριον</span></span>), was bountiful in the clefts of the rocks. Some Bedouins make their living yet by gathering this wild honey out of the rocks. </p>
