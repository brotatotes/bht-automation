<p><b> In the Jordan </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον Ιορδανην</span></span>). So in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:10">Mark 1:10</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του υδατος</span></span>, out of the water, after the baptism into the Jordan. Mark is as fond of "straightway" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευθυς</span></span>) as Matthew is of "then" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Rent asunder </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχιζομενους</span></span>). Split like a garment, present passive participle. Jesus saw the heavens parting as he came up out of the water, a more vivid picture than the "opened" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:21">Luke 3:21</span>. Evidently the Baptist saw all this and the Holy Spirit coming down upon Jesus as a dove because he later mentions it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:32">John 1:32</span>). The Cerinthian Gnostics took the dove to mean the heavenly <i>aeon Christ</i> that here descended upon the man Jesus and remained with him till the Cross when it left him, a sort of forecast of the modern distinction between the Jesus of history and the theological Christ. </p>
