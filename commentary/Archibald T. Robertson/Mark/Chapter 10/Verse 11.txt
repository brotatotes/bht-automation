<p>Mark does not give the exception stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:9">Matthew 19:9</span> "except for fornication" which see for discussion, though the point is really involved in what Mark does record. Mere formal divorce does not annul actual marriage consummated by the physical union. Breaking that bond does annul it. </p>
