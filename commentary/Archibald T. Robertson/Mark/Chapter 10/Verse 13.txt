So also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:15">Luke 18:15</span>, though <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:13">Matthew 19:13</span> has the constative aorist passive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσηνεχθησαν</span></span>).

They were brought to Jesus for his blessing and prayers (Matthew). The mothers had reverence for Jesus and wanted him to touch (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αψητα</span></span>) them.
