 He was moved with indignation  (ηγανακτησεν). In Mark alone. The word is ingressive aorist, became indignant, and is a strong word of deep emotion (from αγαν and αχθομα, to feel pain). Already in Matthew 21:15; Matthew 26:8. Old and common word.Suffer the little children to come unto me  (αφετε τα παιδια ερχεσθα προς με). Mark has the infinitive ερχεσθα (come) not in Matthew, but in Luke. Surely it ought to be a joy to parents to bring their children to Jesus, certainly to allow them to come, but to hinder their coming is a crime. There are parents who will have to give answer to God for keeping their children away from Jesus.
