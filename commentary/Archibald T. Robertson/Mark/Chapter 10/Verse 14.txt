<p><b> He was moved with indignation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγανακτησεν</span></span>). In Mark alone. The word is ingressive aorist, became indignant, and is a strong word of deep emotion (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχθομα</span></span>, to feel pain). Already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:15">Matthew 21:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:8">Matthew 26:8</span>. Old and common word.</p>
<p><b>Suffer the little children to come unto me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφετε τα παιδια ερχεσθα προς με</span></span>). Mark has the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχεσθα</span></span> (come) not in Matthew, but in Luke. Surely it ought to be a joy to parents to bring their children to Jesus, certainly to allow them to come, but to hinder their coming is a crime. There are parents who will have to give answer to God for keeping their children away from Jesus. </p>
