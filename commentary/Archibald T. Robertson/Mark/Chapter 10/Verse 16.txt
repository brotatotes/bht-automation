<p><b> He took them in his arms </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εναγκαλισαμενος</span></span>). A distinct rebuke to the protest of the over-particular disciples. This word already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:36">Mark 9:36</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:28">Luke 2:28</span> we have the full idiom, to receive into the arms (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τας αγκαλας δεχεσθα</span></span>). So with tender fondling Jesus repeatedly blessed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατευλογε</span></span>, imperfect), laying his hands upon each of them (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθεις</span></span>, present participle). It was a great moment for each mother and child. </p>
