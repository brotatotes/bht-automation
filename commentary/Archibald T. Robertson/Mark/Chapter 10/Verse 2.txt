<p><b> Tempting him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζοντες</span></span>). As soon as Jesus appears in Galilee the Pharisees attack him again (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:5">Mark 7:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:11">Mark 8:11</span>). Gould thinks that this is a test, not a temptation. The word means either (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:1">Matthew 4:1</span>), but their motive was evil. They had once involved the Baptist with Herod Antipas and Herodias on this subject. They may have some such hopes about Jesus, or their purpose may have been to see if Jesus will be stricter than Moses taught. They knew that he had already spoken in Galilee on the subject (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:31">Matthew 5:31</span>). </p>
