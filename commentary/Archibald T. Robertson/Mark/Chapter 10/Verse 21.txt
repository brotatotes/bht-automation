<p><b> Looking upon him loved him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμβλεψας αυτω ηγαπησεν</span></span>). Mark alone mentions this glance of affection, ingressive aorist participle and verb. Jesus fell in love with this charming youth.</p>
<p><b>One thing thou lackest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hεν σε υστερε</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:22">Luke 18:22</span> has it: "One thing thou lackest yet" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ετ εν σο λειπε</span></span>). Possibly two translations of the same Aramaic phrase. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:20">Matthew 19:20</span> represents the youth as asking "What lack I yet?" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ ετ υστερω;</span></span>). The answer of Jesus meets that inquiry after more than mere outward obedience to laws and regulations. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υστερω</span></span> is from the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υστερος</span></span> (behind) and means to be too late, to come short, to fail of, to lack. It is used either with the accusative, as here, or with the ablative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:5">2 Corinthians 11:5</span>, or the dative as in Textus Receptus here, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σο</span></span>. </p>
