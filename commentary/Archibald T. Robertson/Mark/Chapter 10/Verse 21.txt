 Looking upon him loved him  (εμβλεψας αυτω ηγαπησεν). Mark alone mentions this glance of affection, ingressive aorist participle and verb. Jesus fell in love with this charming youth.One thing thou lackest  (Hεν σε υστερε). Luke 18:22 has it: "One thing thou lackest yet" (Ετ εν σο λειπε). Possibly two translations of the same Aramaic phrase. Matthew 19:20 represents the youth as asking "What lack I yet?" (Τ ετ υστερω;). The answer of Jesus meets that inquiry after more than mere outward obedience to laws and regulations. The verb υστερω is from the adjective υστερος (behind) and means to be too late, to come short, to fail of, to lack. It is used either with the accusative, as here, or with the ablative as in 2 Corinthians 11:5, or the dative as in Textus Receptus here, σο.
