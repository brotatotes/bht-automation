<p><b> Looked round about </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιβλεψαμενος</span></span>). Another picture of the looks of Jesus and in Mark alone as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:5">Mark 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:34">Mark 3:34</span>. "To see what impression the incident had made on the Twelve" (Bruce). "When the man was gone the Lord's eye swept round the circle of the Twelve, as he drew for them the lesson of the incident" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>How hardly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πως δυσκολως</span></span>). So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:24">Luke 18:24</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:23">Matthew 19:23</span> has it: "With difficulty (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυσκολως</span></span>) shall a rich man." See on Matthew for this word. </p>
