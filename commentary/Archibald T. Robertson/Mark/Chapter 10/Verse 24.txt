 Were amazed  (εθαμβουντο). Imperfect passive. A look of blank astonishment was on their faces at this statement of Jesus. They in common with other Jews regarded wealth as a token of God's special favour.Children  (τεκνα). Here alone to the Twelve and this tender note is due to their growing perplexity.For them that trust in riches  (τους πεποιθοτας επ τοις χρημασιν). These words do not occur in Aleph B Delta Memphitic and one Old Latin manuscript. Westcott and Hort omit them from their text as an evident addition to explain the difficult words of Jesus.
