<p><b> Were amazed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθαμβουντο</span></span>). Imperfect passive. A look of blank astonishment was on their faces at this statement of Jesus. They in common with other Jews regarded wealth as a token of God's special favour.</p>
<p><b>Children </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνα</span></span>). Here alone to the Twelve and this tender note is due to their growing perplexity.</p>
<p><b>For them that trust in riches </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους πεποιθοτας επ τοις χρημασιν</span></span>). These words do not occur in Aleph B Delta Memphitic and one Old Latin manuscript. Westcott and Hort omit them from their text as an evident addition to explain the difficult words of Jesus. </p>
