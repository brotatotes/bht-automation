<p><b> Peter began to say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρξατο λεγειν ο Πετρος</span></span>). It was hard for Peter to hold in till now. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:27">Matthew 19:27</span> says that "Peter answered" as if the remark was addressed to him in particular. At any rate Peter reminds Jesus of what they had left to follow him, four of them that day by the sea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:20">Mark 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:22">Matthew 4:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:11">Luke 5:11</span>). It was to claim obedience to this high ideal on their part in contrast with the conduct of the rich young ruler. </p>
