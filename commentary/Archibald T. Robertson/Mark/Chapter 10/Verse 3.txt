<p><b> What did Moses command you? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ υμιν ενετειλατο Μωυσησ;</span></span>). Jesus at once brought up the issue concerning the teaching of Moses (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+24:1">Deuteronomy 24:1</span>). But Jesus goes back beyond this concession here allowed by Moses to the ideal state commanded in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:27">Genesis 1:27</span>. </p>
