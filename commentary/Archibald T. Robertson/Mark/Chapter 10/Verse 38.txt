 Or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with  (η το βαπτισμα ο εγω βαπτιζομα βαπτισθηνα). Cognate accusative with both passive verbs. Matthew 20:22 has only the cup, but Mark has both the cup and the baptism, both referring to death. Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane will refer to his death again as "the cup" (Mark 14:36; Matthew 26:39; Luke 22:42). He had already used baptism as a figure for his death (Luke 12:50). Paul will use it several times (1 Corinthians 15:29; Romans 6:3-6; Colossians 2:12).
