<p><b> Or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η το βαπτισμα ο εγω βαπτιζομα βαπτισθηνα</span></span>). Cognate accusative with both passive verbs. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:22">Matthew 20:22</span> has only the cup, but Mark has both the cup and the baptism, both referring to death. Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane will refer to his death again as "the cup" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:36">Mark 14:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:39">Matthew 26:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:42">Luke 22:42</span>). He had already used baptism as a figure for his death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:50">Luke 12:50</span>). Paul will use it several times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:29">1 Corinthians 15:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:3-6">Romans 6:3-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>). </p>
