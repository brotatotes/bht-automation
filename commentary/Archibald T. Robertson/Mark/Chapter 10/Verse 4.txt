<p><b> To write a bill of divorcement and to put her away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιβλιον αποστασιου γραψα κα απολυσα</span></span>). The word for "bill" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιβλιον</span></span>) is a diminutive and means "little book," like the Latin <i>libellus</i>, from which comes our word <i>libel</i> (Vincent). Wycliff has it here "a libel of forsaking." This same point the Pharisees raise in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:7">Matthew 19:7</span>, showing probably that they held to the liberal view of Hillel, easy divorce for almost any cause. That was the popular view as now. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:7">Matthew 19:7</span> for this and for discussion of "for your hardness of heart" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκληροκαρδια</span></span>). Jesus expounds the purpose of marriage (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24">Genesis 2:24</span>) and takes the stricter view of divorce, that of the school of Shammai. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1-12">Matthew 19:1-12</span> for discussion. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:10">Mark 10:10</span> notes that the disciples asked Jesus about this problem "in the house" after they had gone away from the crowd. </p>
