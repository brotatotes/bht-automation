<p><b> From Jericho </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο Ιερειχω</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:29">Matthew 20:29</span> for discussion of this phrase and Luke's (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:35">Luke 18:35</span>) "nigh unto Jericho" and the two Jerichos, the old and the new Roman (Luke). The new Jericho was "about five miles W. of the Jordan and fifteen E. of Jerusalem, near the mouth of the <i>Wady Kelt</i>, and more than a mile south of the site of the ancient town" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>Great multitude </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλου ικανου</span></span>). Considerable, more than sufficient. Often in Luke and the papyri in this sense. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span> for the other sense of fit for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικανος</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Bartimaeus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βαρτιμαιος</span></span>). Aramaic name like Bartholomew, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρ</span></span> meaning son like Hebrew <i>ben</i>. So Mark explains the name meaning "the son of Timaeus" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο υιος Τιμαιου</span></span>). Mark alone gives his name while <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:30">Matthew 20:30</span> mentions two which see for discussion.</p>
<p><b>Blind beggar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυφλος προσαιτης</span></span>), "begging" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαιτων</span></span>) Luke has it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:35">Luke 18:35</span>). All three Gospels picture him as</p>
<p><b>sitting by the roadside </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθητο παρα την οδον</span></span>). It was a common sight. Bartimaeus had his regular place. Vincent quotes Thomson concerning Ramleh: "I once walked the streets counting all that were either blind or had defective eyes, and it amounted to about one-half the male population. The women I could not count, for they are rigidly veiled" (<i>The Land and the Book</i>). The dust, the glare of the sun, the unsanitary habits of the people spread contagious eye-diseases. </p>
