 From Jericho  (απο Ιερειχω). See on Matthew 20:29 for discussion of this phrase and Luke's (Luke 18:35) "nigh unto Jericho" and the two Jerichos, the old and the new Roman (Luke). The new Jericho was "about five miles W. of the Jordan and fifteen E. of Jerusalem, near the mouth of the Wady Kelt, and more than a mile south of the site of the ancient town" (Swete).Great multitude  (οχλου ικανου). Considerable, more than sufficient. Often in Luke and the papyri in this sense. See Matthew 3:11 for the other sense of fit for ικανος.Bartimaeus  (Βαρτιμαιος). Aramaic name like Bartholomew, βαρ meaning son like Hebrew ben. So Mark explains the name meaning "the son of Timaeus" (ο υιος Τιμαιου). Mark alone gives his name while Matthew 20:30 mentions two which see for discussion.Blind beggar  (τυφλος προσαιτης), "begging" (επαιτων) Luke has it (Luke 18:35). All three Gospels picture him assitting by the roadside  (εκαθητο παρα την οδον). It was a common sight. Bartimaeus had his regular place. Vincent quotes Thomson concerning Ramleh: "I once walked the streets counting all that were either blind or had defective eyes, and it amounted to about one-half the male population. The women I could not count, for they are rigidly veiled" (The Land and the Book). The dust, the glare of the sun, the unsanitary habits of the people spread contagious eye-diseases.
