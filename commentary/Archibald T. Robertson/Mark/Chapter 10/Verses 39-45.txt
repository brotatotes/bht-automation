See on Matthew 20:23-28 for discussion on these memorable verses (Mark 10:39-45) identical in both Matthew and Mark. In particular in verse Mark 10:45 note the language of Jesus concerning his death as "a ransom for many" (λυτρον αντ πολλων), words of the Master that were not understood by the apostles when spoken by Jesus and which have been preserved for us by Peter through Mark. Some today seek to empty these words of all real meaning as if Jesus could not have or hold such a conception concerning his death for sinners.
