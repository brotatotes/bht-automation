<p><b> Unto Bethphage and Bethany </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Βηθφαγη κα Βηθανιαν</span></span>). Both together as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:29">Luke 19:29</span>, though <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:1">Matthew 21:1</span> mentions only Bethphage. See discussion in Matthew for this and the Mount of Olives. </p>
