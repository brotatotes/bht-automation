<p><b> When he had looked round about upon all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιβλεψαμενος παντα</span></span>). Another Markan detail in this aorist middle participle. Mark does not give what <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:39-55">Luke 19:39-55</span> has nor what <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:10-17">Matthew 21:10-17</span> does. But it is all implied in this swift glance at the temple before he went out to Bethany with the Twelve,</p>
<p><b>it being now eventide </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψε ηδη ουσης της ωρας</span></span>). Genitive absolute, the hour being already late. What a day it had been! What did the apostles think now? </p>
