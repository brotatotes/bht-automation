<p><b> For all the nations </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασιν τοις εθνεσιν</span></span>). Mark alone has this phrase from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+56:7">Isaiah 56:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+7:11">Jeremiah 7:11</span>. The people as well as the temple authorities were guilty of graft, extortion, and desecration of the house of prayer. Jesus assumes and exercises Messianic authority and dares to smite this political and financial abuse. Some people deny the right of the preacher to denounce such abuses in business and politics even when they invade the realm of morals and religion. But Jesus did not hesitate. </p>
