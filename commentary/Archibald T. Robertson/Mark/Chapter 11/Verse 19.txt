<p><b> Every evening </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν οψε εγενετο</span></span>). Literally,</p>
<p><b>whenever evening came on </b> or more exactly</p>
<p><b>whenever it became late </b>. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε αν</span></span>) with the aorist indicative is like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου αν</span></span> with the imperfect indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισεπορευετο</span></span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσο αν</span></span> with the aorist indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηψαντο</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:56">Mark 6:56</span>. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> makes the clause more indefinite and general, as here, unless it renders it more definite, a curious result, but true. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:37">Luke 21:37</span> has the accusative of extent of time, "the days," "the nights." The imperfect tense he (or they) would go (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεπορευετο, εξεπορευοντο</span></span>) out of the city suggests "whenever" as the meaning here. </p>
