 Every evening  (οταν οψε εγενετο). Literally,whenever evening came on  or more exactlywhenever it became late . The use of οταν (οτε αν) with the aorist indicative is like οπου αν with the imperfect indicative (εισεπορευετο) and οσο αν with the aorist indicative (ηψαντο) in Mark 6:56. The use of αν makes the clause more indefinite and general, as here, unless it renders it more definite, a curious result, but true. Luke 21:37 has the accusative of extent of time, "the days," "the nights." The imperfect tense he (or they) would go (εξεπορευετο, εξεπορευοντο) out of the city suggests "whenever" as the meaning here.
