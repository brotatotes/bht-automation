 Believe that ye have received them  (πιστευετε οτ ελαβετε). That is the test of faith, the kind that sees the fulfilment before it happens. Ελαβετε is second aorist active indicative, antecedent in time to πιστευετε, unless it be considered the timeless aorist when it is simultaneous with it. For this aorist of immediate consequence see John 15:6.
