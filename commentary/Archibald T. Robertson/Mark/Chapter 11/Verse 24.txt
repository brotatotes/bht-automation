<p><b> Believe that ye have received them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευετε οτ ελαβετε</span></span>). That is the test of faith, the kind that sees the fulfilment before it happens. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ελαβετε</span></span> is second aorist active indicative, antecedent in time to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευετε</span></span>, unless it be considered the timeless aorist when it is simultaneous with it. For this aorist of immediate consequence see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:6">John 15:6</span>. </p>
