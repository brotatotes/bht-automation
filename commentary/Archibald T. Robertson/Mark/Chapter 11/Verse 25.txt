<p><b> Whensoever ye stand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν στηκετε</span></span>). Late form of present indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηκω</span></span>, from perfect stem <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστηκα</span></span>. In LXX. Note use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:19">Mark 11:19</span>. Jesus does not mean by the use of "stand" here to teach that this is the only proper attitude in prayer.</p>
<p><b>That your Father also may forgive you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα κα ο πατηρ αφη υμιν</span></span>). Evidently God's willingness to forgive is limited by our willingness to forgive others. This is a solemn thought for all who pray. Recall the words of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:14">Matthew 6:14</span>. </p>
