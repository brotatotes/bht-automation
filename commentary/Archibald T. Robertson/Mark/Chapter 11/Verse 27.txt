 The chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders  (ο αρχιερεις κα ο γραμματεις κα ο πρεσβυτερο). Note the article with each separate group as in Luke 20:1 and Matthew 21:23. These three classes were in the Sanhedrin. Clearly a large committee of the Sanhedrin including both Sadducees and Pharisees here confront Jesus in a formal attack upon his authority for cleansing the temple and teaching in it.
