<p><b> The chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αρχιερεις κα ο γραμματεις κα ο πρεσβυτερο</span></span>). Note the article with each separate group as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:1">Luke 20:1</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:23">Matthew 21:23</span>. These three classes were in the Sanhedrin. Clearly a large committee of the Sanhedrin including both Sadducees and Pharisees here confront Jesus in a formal attack upon his authority for cleansing the temple and teaching in it. </p>
