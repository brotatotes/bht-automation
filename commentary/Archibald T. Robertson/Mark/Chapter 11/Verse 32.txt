<p><b> But should we say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα ειπωμεν</span></span>). Deliberative subjunctive with aorist active subjunctive again. It is possible to supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:31">Mark 11:31</span> and treat it as a condition as there. So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:26">Matthew 21:26</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:6">Luke 20:6</span>. But in Mark the structure continues rugged after "from men" with anacoluthon or even aposiopesis--"they feared the people" Mark adds. Matthew has it: "We fear the multitude." Luke puts it: "all the people will stone us." All three Gospels state the popular view of John as a prophet. Mark's "verily" is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οντως</span></span> really, actually. They feared John though dead as much as Herod Antipas did. His martyrdom had deepened his power over the people and disrespect towards his memory now might raise a storm (Swete). </p>
