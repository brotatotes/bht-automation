<p><b> A colt tied at the door without in the open street </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πωλον δεδεμενον προς θυραν εξω επ του αμφοδου</span></span>). A carefully drawn picture. The colt was outside the house in the street, but fastened (bound, perfect passive participle) to the door. "The better class of houses were built about an open court, from which a passage way under the house led to the street outside. It was at this outside opening to the street that the colt was tied" (Gould). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμφοδος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμφω</span></span>, both, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδος</span></span>, road) is difficult. It apparently means road around a thing, a crooked street as most of them were (cf. Straight Street in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:11">Acts 9:11</span>). It occurs only here in the N.T. besides D in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:28">Acts 19:28</span>. It is very common in the papyri for <i>vicus</i> or "quarter."</p>
<p><b>And they loose him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα λυουσιν αυτον</span></span>). Dramatic present tense. Perhaps Peter was one of those sent this time as he was later (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:8">Luke 22:8</span>). If so, that explains Mark's vivid details here. </p>
