<p><b> Branches </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στιβαδας</span></span>). A litter of leaves and rushes from the fields. Textus Receptus spells this word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοιβαδας</span></span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:8">Matthew 21:8</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαδους</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαω</span></span>, to break, branches broken or cut from trees. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:13">John 12:13</span> uses the branches of the palm trees (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα βαια των φοινικων</span></span>), "the feathery fronds forming the tufted crown of the tree" (Vincent).

Hence their unrestrained enthusiasm. They expect Jesus, of course, now to set up his rule in opposition to that of Caesar, to drive Rome out of Palestine, to conquer the world for the Jews. </p>
