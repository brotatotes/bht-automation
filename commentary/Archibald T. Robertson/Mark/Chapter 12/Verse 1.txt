<p><b> He began to speak unto them in parables </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρξατο αυτοις εν παραβολαις λαλειν</span></span>). Mark's common idiom again. He does not mean that this was the beginning of Christ's use of parables (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:2">Mark 4:2</span>), but simply that his teaching on this occasion took the parabolic turn. "The circumstances called forth the parabolic mood, that of one whose heart is chilled, and whose spirit is saddened by a sense of loneliness, and who, retiring within himself, by a process of reflection, frames for his thoughts forms which half conceal, half reveal them" (Bruce). Mark does not give the Parable of the Two Sons (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:28-32">Matthew 21:28-32</span>) nor that of the Marriage Feast of the King's Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:1-14">Matthew 22:1-14</span>). He gives here the Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen. Also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:33-46">Matthew 21:33-46</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:9-19">Luke 20:9-19</span>. See discussion in Matthew. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:33">Matthew 21:33</span> calls the man "a householder" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδεσποτης</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>A pit for the winepress </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποληνιον</span></span>). Only here in the N.T. Common in the LXX and in late Greek. Matthew had <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ληνον</span></span>, winepress. This is the vessel or trough under the winepress on the hillside to catch the juice when the grapes were trodden. The Romans called it <i>lacus</i> (lake) and Wycliff <i>dalf</i> (lake), like delved. See on Matthew for details just alike.</p>
<p><b>Husbandmen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεωργοις</span></span>). Workers in the ground, tillers of the soil (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργον, γη</span></span>). </p>
