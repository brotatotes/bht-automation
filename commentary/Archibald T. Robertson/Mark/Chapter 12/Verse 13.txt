 That they might catch him in talk  (ινα αυτον αγρευσωσιν λογω). Ingressive aorist subjunctive. The verb is late from αγρα (a hunt or catching). It appears in the LXX and papyri. Here alone in the N.T. Luke 20:20 has the same idea, "that they may take hold of his speech" (επιλαβωντα αυτου λογον) while Matthew 22:15 uses παγιδευσωσιν (to snare or trap). See discussion in Matthew. We have seen the scribes and Pharisees trying to do this very thing before (Luke 11:33). Mark and Matthew note here the combination of Pharisees and Herodians as Mark did in Mark 3:6. Matthew speaks of "disciples" or pupils of the Pharisees while Luke calls them "spies" (ενκαθετους).
