<p><b> That they might catch him in talk </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα αυτον αγρευσωσιν λογω</span></span>). Ingressive aorist subjunctive. The verb is late from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγρα</span></span> (a hunt or catching). It appears in the LXX and papyri. Here alone in the N.T. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:20">Luke 20:20</span> has the same idea, "that they may take hold of his speech" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιλαβωντα αυτου λογον</span></span>) while <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:15">Matthew 22:15</span> uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παγιδευσωσιν</span></span> (to snare or trap). See discussion in Matthew. We have seen the scribes and Pharisees trying to do this very thing before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:33">Luke 11:33</span>). Mark and Matthew note here the combination of Pharisees and Herodians as Mark did in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:6">Mark 3:6</span>. Matthew speaks of "disciples" or pupils of the Pharisees while Luke calls them "spies" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενκαθετους</span></span>). </p>
