<p><b> Knowing their hypocrisy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδως αυτων την υποχρισιν</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:18">Matthew 22:18</span> has "perceived their wickedness" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνους την πονηριαν αυτων</span></span>) while <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:23">Luke 20:23</span> says, "perceived their craftiness" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατανοησας αυτων την πανουργιαν</span></span>). Each of these words throws a flash-light on the spirit and attitude of these young men. They were sly, shrewd, slick, but they did not deceive Jesus with their pious palaver. See on Matthew for further details. </p>
