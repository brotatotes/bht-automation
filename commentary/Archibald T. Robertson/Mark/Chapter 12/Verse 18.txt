<p><b> There come unto him Sadducees </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχοντα Σαδδουκαιο προς αυτον</span></span>). Dramatic present. The Pharisees and Herodians had had their turn after the formal committee of the Sanhedrin had been so completely routed. It was inevitable that they should feel called upon to show their intellectual superiority to these raw Pharisaic and Herodian theologians. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:23-33">Matthew 22:23-33</span> for discussion of details. It was a good time to air their disbelief in the resurrection at the expense of the Pharisees and to score against Jesus where the Sanhedrin and then the Pharisees and Herodians had failed so ignominiously. </p>
