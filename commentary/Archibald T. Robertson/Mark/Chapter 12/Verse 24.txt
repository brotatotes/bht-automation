<p><b> Is it not for this cause that ye err? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ου δια τουτο πλανασθε;</span></span>). Mark puts it as a question with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> expecting the affirmative answer. Matthew puts it as a positive assertion: "Ye are." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πλαναομα</span></span> is to wander astray (cf. our word <i>planet</i>, wandering stars, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αστερες πλανητα</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:13">Jude 1:13</span>) like the Latin <i>errare</i> (our <i>error</i>, err).</p>
<p><b>That ye know not the scriptures </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ειδοτες τας γραφας</span></span>). The Sadducees posed as men of superior intelligence and knowledge in opposition to the traditionalists among the Pharisees with their oral law. And yet on this very point they were ignorant of the Scriptures. How much error today is due to this same ignorance among the educated!</p>
<p><b>Nor the power of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδε την δυναμιν του θεου</span></span>). The two kinds of ignorance generally go together (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:34">1 Corinthians 15:34</span>). </p>
