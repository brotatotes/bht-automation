 Is it not for this cause that ye err?  (Ου δια τουτο πλανασθε;). Mark puts it as a question with ου expecting the affirmative answer. Matthew puts it as a positive assertion: "Ye are." Πλαναομα is to wander astray (cf. our word planet, wandering stars, αστερες πλανητα, Jude 1:13) like the Latin errare (our error, err).That ye know not the scriptures  (μη ειδοτες τας γραφας).

And yet on this very point they were ignorant of the Scriptures. How much error today is due to this same ignorance among the educated!Nor the power of God  (μηδε την δυναμιν του θεου).
