<p><b> When they shall rise from the dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν εκ νεκρων αναστωσιν</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε</span></span> plus <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:30">Matthew 22:30</span> has it "in the resurrection," <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:35">Luke 20:35</span> "to attain to the resurrection." The Pharisees regarded the future resurrection body as performing marriage functions, as Mohammedans do today. The Pharisees were in error on this point. The Sadducees made this one of their objections to belief in the resurrection body, revealing thus their own ignorance of the true resurrection body and the future life where marriage functions do not exist.</p>
<p><b>As angels in heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως αγγελο εν τω ουρανω</span></span>). So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:30">Matthew 22:30</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:36">Luke 20:36</span> has "equal unto the angels" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισαγγελο</span></span>). "Their equality with angels consists in their deliverance from mortality and its consequences" (Swete). The angels are directly created, not procreated. </p>
