<p><b> Heard them questioning together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουσας αυτων συνζητουντων</span></span>). The victory of Christ over the Sadducees pleased the Pharisees who now had come back with mixed emotions over the new turn of things (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:34">Matthew 22:34</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:39">Luke 20:39</span> represents one of the scribes as commending Jesus for his skilful reply to the Sadducees. Mark here puts this scribe in a favourable light, "knowing that he had answered them well" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδως οτ καλως απεκριθη αυτοις</span></span>). "Them" here means the Sadducees. But <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:35">Matthew 22:35</span> says that this lawyer (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομικος</span></span>) was "tempting" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζων</span></span>) by his question. "A few, among whom was the scribe, were constrained to admire, even if they were willing to criticize, the Rabbi who though not himself a Pharisee, surpassed the Pharisees as a champion of the truth." That is a just picture of this lawyer.</p>
<p><b>The first of all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτη παντων</span></span>). First in rank and importance. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:36">Matthew 22:36</span> has "great" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγαλη</span></span>). See discussion there. Probably Jesus spoke in Aramaic. "First" and "great" in Greek do not differ essentially here. Mark quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+6:4">Deuteronomy 6:4</span> as it stands in the LXX and also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+19:18">Leviticus 19:18</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:40">Matthew 22:40</span> adds the summary: "On these two commandments hangeth (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρεματα</span></span>) the whole law and the prophets." </p>
