<p><b> And the scribe said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπεν αυτω ο γραμματευς</span></span>). Mark alone gives the reply of the scribe to Jesus which is a mere repetition of what Jesus had said about the first and the second commandments with the additional allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:22">1 Samuel 15:22</span> about love as superior to whole burnt offerings.</p>
<p><b>Well </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλως</span></span>). Not to be taken with "saidst" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπες</span></span>) as the Revised Version has it following Wycliff. Probably <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλως</span></span> (well) is exclamatory. "Fine, Teacher. Of a truth (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ' αληθειας</span></span>) didst thou say." </p>
