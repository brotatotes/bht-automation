<p><b> The common people heard him gladly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πολυς οχλος ηκουεν αυτου εδεως</span></span>). Literally, the much multitude (the huge crowd) was listening (imperfect tense) to him gladly. Mark alone has this item. The Sanhedrin had begun the formal attack that morning to destroy the influence of Jesus with the crowds whose hero he now was since the Triumphal Entry. It had been a colossal failure. The crowds were drawn closer to him than before. </p>
