<p><b> Beware of the scribes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπετε απο των γραμματεων</span></span>). Jesus now turns to the multitudes and to his disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:1">Matthew 23:1</span>) and warns them against the scribes and the Pharisees while they are still there to hear his denunciation. The scribes were the professional teachers of the current Judaism and were nearly all Pharisees. Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:38-40">Mark 14:38-40</span>) gives a mere summary sketch of this bold and terrific indictment as preserved in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:23">Mark 12:23</span> in words that fairly blister today. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:45-47">Luke 20:45-47</span> follows Mark closely. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:15">Matthew 8:15</span> for this same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπετε απο</span></span> with the ablative. It is usually called a translation-Hebraism, a usage not found with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπω</span></span> in the older Greek. But the papyri give it, a vivid vernacular idiom. "Beware of the Jews" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπε σατον απο των Ιουδαιων</span></span>, Berl. G. U. 1079. A.D. 41). See Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 577. The pride of the pompous scribes is itemized by Mark:</p>
<p><b>To walk in long robes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στολαις</span></span>),</p>
<p><b>stoles </b>, the dress of dignitaries like kings and priests.</p>
<p><b>Salutations in the marketplaces </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασπασμους εν ταις αγοραις</span></span>), where the people could see their dignity recognized. </p>
