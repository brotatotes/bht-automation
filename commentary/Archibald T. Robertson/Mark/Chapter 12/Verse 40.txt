<p><b> Devour widows' houses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κατεσθοντες τας οικιας των χηρων</span></span>). New sentence in the nominative. Terrible pictures of civil wrong by graft grabbing the homes of helpless widows. They inveigled widows into giving their homes to the temple and took it for themselves.</p>
<p><b>For a pretence make long prayers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφασε μακρα προσευχομενο</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προφασε</span></span> instrumental case of the same word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφημ</span></span>) from which prophet comes, but here pretext, pretence of extra piety while robbing the widows and pushing themselves to the fore. Some derive it from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφαινω</span></span>, to show forth.</p>
<p><b>Greater </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσοτερον</span></span>). More abundant condemnation. Some comfort in that at any rate. </p>
