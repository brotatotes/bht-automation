<p><b> Sat down over against the treasury </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθισας κατεναντ του γαζοφυλακιου</span></span>). The storm is over. The Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians, scribes, have all slunk away in terror ere the closing words. Mark draws this immortal picture of the weary Christ sitting by the treasury (compound word in the LXX from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαζα</span></span>, Persian word for treasure, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλακη</span></span>, guard, so safe for gifts to be deposited).</p>
<p><b>Beheld </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθεωρε</span></span>). Imperfect tense. He was watching</p>
<p><b>how the multitude cast money </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πως ο οχλος βαλλε</span></span>) into the treasury. The rich were casting in (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβαλλον</span></span>, imperfect tense) as he watched. </p>
