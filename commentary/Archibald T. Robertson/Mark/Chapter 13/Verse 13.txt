 But he that endureth to the end  (ο δε υπομεινας εις τελος). Note this aorist participle with the future verb. The idea here is true to the etymology of the word, remaining under (υπομενω) until the end. The divisions in families Jesus had predicted before (Luke 12:52; Luke 14:25).Be saved  (σωθησετα). Here Jesus means final salvation (effective aorist future passive), not initial salvation.
