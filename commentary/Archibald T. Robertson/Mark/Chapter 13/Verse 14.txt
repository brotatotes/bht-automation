<p><b> Standing where he ought not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστηκοτα οπου ου δε</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:15">Matthew 24:15</span> has "standing in the holy place" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστος εν τοπο αγιω</span></span>), neuter and agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βδελυγμα</span></span> (abomination), the very phrase applied in 1Macc. 1:54 to the altar to Zeus erected by Antiochus Epiphanes where the altar to Jehovah was. Mark personifies the abomination as personal (masculine), while <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:20">Luke 21:20</span> defines it by reference to the armies (of Rome, as it turned out). So the words of Daniel find a second fulfilment, Rome taking the place of Syria (Swete). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:15">Matthew 24:15</span> for this phrase and the parenthesis inserted in the words of Jesus ("Let him that readeth understand"). See also on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:16-25">Matthew 24:16-25</span> for discussion of details in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:14-22">Mark 13:14-22</span>. </p>
