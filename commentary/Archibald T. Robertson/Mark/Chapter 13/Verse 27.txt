<p><b> Shall gather together his elect </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισυναξε τους εκλεκτους αυτου</span></span>). This is the purpose of God through the ages.</p>
<p><b>From the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' ακρου γης εως ακρου ουρανου</span></span>). The Greek is very brief, "from the tip of earth to the tip of heaven." This precise phrase occurs nowhere else. </p>
