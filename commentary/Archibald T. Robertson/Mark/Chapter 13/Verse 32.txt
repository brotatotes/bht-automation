<p><b> Not even the Son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε ο υιος</span></span>). There is no doubt as to the genuineness of these words here such as exists in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:36">Matthew 24:36</span>. This disclaimer of knowledge naturally interpreted applies to the second coming, not to the destruction of Jerusalem which had been definitely limited to that generation as it happened in A.D. 70. </p>
