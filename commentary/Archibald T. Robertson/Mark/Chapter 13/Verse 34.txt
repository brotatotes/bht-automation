<p><b> Commanded also the porter to watch </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τω θυρωρω ενετειλατο ινα γρηγορη</span></span>) . The porter or door-keeper (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυρωρος</span></span>), as well as all the rest, to keep a watch (present subjunctive, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γρηγορη</span></span>). This Parable of the Porter is only in Mark. Our ignorance of the time of the Master's return is an argument not for indifference nor for fanaticism, but for alertness and eager readiness for his coming. </p>
