<p><b> Take need that no man lead you astray </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βλεπετε μη τις υμας πλανηση</span></span>). Same words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:4">Matthew 24:4</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:8">Luke 21:8</span> has it "that ye be not led astray" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πλανηθητε</span></span>). This word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλαναω</span></span> (our <i>planet</i>) is a bold one. This warning runs through the whole discussion. It is pertinent today after so many centuries. About the false Christs then and now see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:5">Matthew 24:5</span>. It is amazing the success that these charlatans have through the ages in winning the empty-pated to their hare-brained views. Only this morning as I am writing a prominent English psychologist has challenged the world to a radio communication with Mars asserting that he has made frequent trips to Mars and communicated with its alleged inhabitants. And the daily papers put his ebullitions on the front page. For discussion of the details in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:6-8">Mark 13:6-8</span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:5-8">Matthew 24:5-8</span>. All through the ages in spite of the words of Jesus men have sought to apply the picture here drawn to the particular calamity in their time. </p>
