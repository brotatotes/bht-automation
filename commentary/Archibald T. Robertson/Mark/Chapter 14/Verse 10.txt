<p><b> He that was one of the twelve </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εις των δωδεκα</span></span>). Note the article here, "the one of the twelve," Matthew has only <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>, "one." Some have held that Mark here calls Judas the primate among the twelve. Rather he means to call attention to the idea that he was the one of the twelve who did this deed. </p>
