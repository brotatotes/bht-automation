 He that was one of the twelve  (ο εις των δωδεκα). Note the article here, "the one of the twelve," Matthew has only εις, "one." Some have held that Mark here calls Judas the primate among the twelve. Rather he means to call attention to the idea that he was the one of the twelve who did this deed.
