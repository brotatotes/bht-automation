<p><b> And they, when they heard it, were glad </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε ακουσαντες εχαρησαν</span></span>). No doubt the rabbis looked on the treachery of Judas as a veritable dispensation of Providence amply justifying their plots against Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Conveniently </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευκαιρως</span></span>). This was the whole point of the offer of Judas. He claimed that he knew enough of the habits of Jesus to enable them to catch him "in the absence of the multitude" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:6">Luke 22:6</span>) without waiting for the passover to be over, when the crowds would leave. For discussion of the motives of Judas, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:15">Matthew 26:15</span>. Mark merely notes the promise of "money" while Matthew mentions "thirty pieces of silver" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+11:12">Zechariah 11:12</span>), the price of a slave. </p>
