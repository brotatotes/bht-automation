<p><b> He cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχετα</span></span>). Dramatic historical present. It is assumed here that Jesus is observing the passover meal at the regular time and hour, at 6 P.M. at the beginning of the fifteenth (evening of our Thursday, beginning of Jewish Friday). Mark and Matthew note the time as evening and state it as the regular passover meal. </p>
