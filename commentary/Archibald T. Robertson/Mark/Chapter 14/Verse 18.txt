<p><b> As they sat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακειμενων αυτων</span></span>). Reclined, of course. It is a pity that these verbs are not translated properly in English. Even Leonardo da Vinci in his immortal painting of the Last Supper has Jesus and his apostles sitting, not reclining. Probably he took an artist's license for effect.</p>
<p><b>Even he that eateth with me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εσθιων μετ' εμου</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+4:9">Psalms 4:9</span>. To this day the Arabs will not violate hospitality by mistreating one who breaks bread with them in the tent. </p>
