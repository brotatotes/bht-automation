<p><b> One of the twelve </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις των δωδεκα</span></span>). It is as bad as that. The sign that Jesus gave,</p>
<p><b>the one dipping in the dish with me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εμβαπτομενος μετ' εμου εις το τρυβλιον</span></span>), escaped the notice of all. Jesus gave the sop to Judas who understood perfectly that Jesus knew his purpose. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:21-24">Matthew 26:21-24</span> for further details. </p>
