Probably the ordinary wine of the country mixed with two-thirds water, though the word for wine (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οινος</span></span>) is not used here in the Gospels, but "the fruit of the vine" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του γενηματος της αμπελου</span></span>).

Mark and Matthew give substantially the same account of the institution of the Supper by Jesus, while <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:17-20">Luke 22:17-20</span> agrees closely with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-26">1 Corinthians 11:23-26</span> where Paul claims to have obtained his account by direct revelation from the Lord Jesus. </p>
