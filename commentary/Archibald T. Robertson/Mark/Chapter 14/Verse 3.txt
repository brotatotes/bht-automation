<p><b> As he sat at meat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακειμενου αυτου</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:7">Matthew 26:7</span> uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακειμενου</span></span>, both words meaning reclining (leaning down or up or back) and in the genitive absolute. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:6">Matthew 26:6</span> in proof that this is a different incident from that recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:36-50">Luke 7:36-50</span>. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:6-13">Matthew 26:6-13</span> for discussion of details.</p>
<p><b>Spikenard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναρδου πιστικης</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστικος</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναρδος</span></span> occurs only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:3">John 12:3</span>. The adjective is common enough in the older Greek and appears in the papyri also in the sense of genuine, unadulterated, and that is probably the idea here. The word spikenard is from the Vulgate <i>nardi spicati</i>, probably from the Old Latin <i>nardi pistici</i>.</p>
<p><b>Brake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συντριψουσα</span></span>). Only in Mark. She probably broke the narrow neck of the vase holding the ointment. </p>
