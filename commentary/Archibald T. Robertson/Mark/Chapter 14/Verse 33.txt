<p><b> Greatly amazed and sore troubled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκθαμβεισθα κα αδημονειν</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:37">Matthew 26:37</span> has "sorrowful and sore troubled." See on Matt. about <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδημονειν</span></span>. Mark alone uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξθαμβεισθα</span></span> (here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:15">Mark 9:15</span>). There is a papyrus example given by Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαμβεω</span></span> occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:32">Mark 10:32</span> for the amazement of the disciples at the look of Jesus as he went toward Jerusalem. Now Jesus himself feels amazement as he directly faces the struggle in the Garden of Gethsemane. He wins the victory over himself in Gethsemane and then he can endure the loss, despising the shame. For the moment he is rather amazed and homesick for heaven. "Long as He had foreseen the Passion, when it came clearly into view its terror exceeded His anticipations" (Swete). "He learned from what he suffered," (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:8">Hebrews 5:8</span>) and this new experience enriched the human soul of Jesus. </p>
