<p><b> Fell on the ground </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιπτεν επ της γης</span></span>). Descriptive imperfect. See him falling. Matthew has the aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεσεν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Prayed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσηυχετο</span></span>). Imperfect, prayed repeatedly or inchoative, began to pray. Either makes good sense.</p>
<p><b>The hour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ωρα</span></span>). Jesus had long looked forward to this "hour" and had often mentioned it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:30">John 7:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:20">John 8:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:23">John 12:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:27">John 12:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span>). See again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:41">Mark 14:41</span>. Now he dreads it, surely a human trait that all can understand. </p>
