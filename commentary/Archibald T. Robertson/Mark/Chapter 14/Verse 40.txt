<p><b> Very heavy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβαρυνομενο</span></span>). Perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα-</span></span> with the participle. Matthew has the simple verb. Mark's word is only here in the N.T. and is rare in Greek writers. Mark has the vivid present passive participle, while Matthew has the perfect passive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεβαρημενο</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>And they wist not what to answer him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκ ηιδεισαν τ αποκριθωσιν αυτω</span></span>). Deliberative subjunctive retained in the indirect question. Alone in Mark and reminds one of the like embarrassment of these same three disciples on the Mount of Transfiguration (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:6">Mark 9:6</span>). On both occasions weakness of the flesh prevented their real sympathy with Jesus in his highest and deepest experiences. "Both their shame and their drowsiness would make them dumb" (Gould). </p>
