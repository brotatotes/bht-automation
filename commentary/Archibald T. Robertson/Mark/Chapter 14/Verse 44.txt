<p><b> Token </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συσσημον</span></span>). A common word in the ancient Greek for a concerted signal according to agreement. It is here only in the New Testament. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:48">Matthew 26:48</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον</span></span>, sign. The signal was the kiss by Judas, a contemptible desecration of a friendly salutation.</p>
<p><b>And lead him away safely </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα απαγετε ασφαλως</span></span>). Only in Mark. Judas wished no slip to occur. Mark and Matthew do not tell of the falling back upon the ground when Jesus challenged the crowd with Judas. It is given by John alone (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:4-9">John 18:4-9</span>). </p>
