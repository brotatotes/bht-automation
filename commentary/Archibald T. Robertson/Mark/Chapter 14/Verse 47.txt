<p><b> A certain one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τις</span></span>). Mark does not tell that it was Peter. Only <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:10">John 18:10</span> does that after Peter's death. He really tried to kill the man, Malchus by name, as John again tells (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:10">John 18:10</span>). Mark does not give the rebuke to Peter by Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:52">Matthew 26:52</span>. </p>
