 Above three hundred pence  (επανω δηναριων τριακοσιων). Matthew has "for much" while John 12:5 has "for three hundred pence." The use of "far above" may be a detail from Peter's memory of Judas' objection whose name in this connection is preserved in John 12:4.And they murmured against her  (κα ενεβριμωντο αυτη). Imperfect tense of this striking word used of the snorting of horses and seen already in Mark 1:43; Mark 11:38. It occurs in the LXX in the sense of anger as here (Daniel 11:30). Judas made the complaint against Mary of Bethany, but all the apostles joined in the chorus of criticism of the wasteful extravagance.
