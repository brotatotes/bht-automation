<p><b> A certain young man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεανισκος τις</span></span>). This incident alone in Mark. It is usually supposed that Mark himself, son of Mary (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:12">Acts 12:12</span>) in whose house they probably had observed the passover meal, had followed Jesus and the apostles to the Garden. It is a lifelike touch quite in keeping with such a situation. Here after the arrest he was following with Jesus (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνηκολουθε αυτω</span></span>, imperfect tense). Note the vivid dramatic present <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατουσιν</span></span> (they seize him). </p>
