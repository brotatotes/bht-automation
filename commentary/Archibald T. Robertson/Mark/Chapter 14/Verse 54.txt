<p><b> Peter had followed him afar off </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hο Πετρος απο μακροθεν ηκολουθησεν αυτω</span></span>). Here Mark uses the constative aorist (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκολουθησεν</span></span>) where <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:58">Matthew 26:58</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:54">Luke 22:54</span> have the picturesque imperfect (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκολουθε</span></span>), was following. Possibly Mark did not care to dwell on the picture of Peter furtively following at a distance, not bold enough to take an open stand with Christ as the Beloved Disciple did, and yet unable to remain away with the other disciples.</p>
<p><b>Was sitting with </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην συνκαθημενος</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect middle, picturing Peter making himself at home with the officers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπηρετων</span></span>), under rowers, literally, then servants of any kind. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:25">John 18:25</span> describes Peter as standing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστως</span></span>). Probably he did now one, now the other, in his restless weary mood.</p>
<p><b>Warming himself in the light </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θερμαινομενος πρως το φως</span></span>). Direct middle. Fire has light as well as heat and it shone in Peter's face. He was not hidden as much as he supposed he was. </p>
