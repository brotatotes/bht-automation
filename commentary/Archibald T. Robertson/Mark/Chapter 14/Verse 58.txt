<p><b> Made with hands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειροποιητον</span></span>). In Mark alone. An old Greek word. The negative form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχειροποιητον</span></span> here occurs elsewhere only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:11">Colossians 2:11</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11">Hebrews 9:11</span> the negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> is used with the positive form. It is possible that a real <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογιον</span></span> of Jesus underlies the perversion of it here. Mark and Matthew do not quote the witnesses precisely alike. Perhaps they quoted Jesus differently and therein is shown part of the disagreement, for Mark adds verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:59">Mark 14:59</span> (not in Matthew). "And not even so did their witness agree together," repeating the point of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:57">Mark 14:57</span>. Swete observes that Jesus, as a matter of fact, did do what he is quoted as saying in Mark: "He said what the event has proved to be true; His death destroyed the old order, and His resurrection created the new." But these witnesses did not mean that by what they said. The only saying of Jesus at all like this preserved to us is that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span>, when he referred not to the temple in Jerusalem, but to the temple of his body, though no one understood it at the time. </p>
