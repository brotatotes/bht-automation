<p><b> And answered nothing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκ απεκρινατο ουδεν</span></span>). Mark adds the negative statement to the positive "kept silent" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσιωπα</span></span>), imperfect, also in Matthew. Mark does not give the solemn oath in Matthew under which Jesus had to answer. See on Matthew. </p>
