<p><b> They all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε παντες</span></span>). This would mean that Joseph of Arimathea was not present since he did not consent to the death of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:51">Luke 23:51</span>). Nicodemus was apparently absent also, probably not invited because of previous sympathy with Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:50">John 7:50</span>). But all who were present voted for the death of Jesus. </p>
