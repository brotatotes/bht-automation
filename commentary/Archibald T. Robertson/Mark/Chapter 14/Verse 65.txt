<p><b> Cover his face </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περικαλυπτειν αυτου το προσωπον</span></span>). Put a veil around his face. Not in Matthew, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:64">Luke 22:64</span> where Revised Version translates <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περικαλυψαντες</span></span> by "blind-folded." All three Gospels give the jeering demand of the Sanhedrin: "Prophesy" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητευσον</span></span>), meaning, as Matthew and Luke add, thereby telling who struck him while he was blindfolded. Mark adds "the officers" (same as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:54">Mark 14:54</span>) of the Sanhedrin, Roman lictors or sergeants-at-arms who had arrested Jesus in Gethsemane and who still held Jesus (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο συνεχοντες αυτον</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:63">Luke 22:63</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:67">Matthew 26:67</span> alludes to their treatment of Jesus without clearly indicating who they were.</p>
<p><b>With blows of their hands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραπισμασιν</span></span>). The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραπιζω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:67">Matthew 26:67</span> originally meant to smite with a rod. In late writers it comes to mean to slap the face with the palm of the hands. The same thing is true of the substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραπισμα</span></span> used here. A papyrus of the sixth century A.D. uses it in the sense of a scar on the face as the result of a blow. It is in the instrumental case here. "They caught him with blows," Swete suggests for the unusual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαβον</span></span> in this sense. "With rods" is, of course, possible as the lictors carried rods. At any rate it was a gross indignity. </p>
