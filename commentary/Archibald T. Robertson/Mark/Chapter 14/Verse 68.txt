<p><b> I neither know nor understand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτε οιδα ουτε επισταμα</span></span>). This denial is fuller in Mark, briefest in John.</p>
<p><b>What thou sayest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ τ λεγεις</span></span>). Can be understood as a direct question. Note position of</p>
<p><b>thou </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ</span></span>), proleptical.</p>
<p><b>Into the porch </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το προαυλιον</span></span>). Only here in the New Testament. Plato uses it of a prelude on a flute. It occurs also in the plural for preparations the day before the wedding. Here it means the vestibule to the court. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:71">Matthew 26:71</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυλωνα</span></span>, a common word for gate or front porch.</p>
<p><b>And the cock crew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αλεκτωρ εφωνησεν</span></span>). Omitted by Aleph B L Sinaitic Syriac. It is genuine in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:72">Mark 14:72</span> where "the second time" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ δευτερου</span></span>) occurs also. It is possible that because of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:72">Mark 14:72</span> it crept into verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:68">Mark 14:68</span>. Mark alone alludes to the cock crowing twice, originally (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:30">Mark 14:30</span>), and twice in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:72">Mark 14:72</span>, besides verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:68">Mark 14:68</span> which is hardly genuine. </p>
