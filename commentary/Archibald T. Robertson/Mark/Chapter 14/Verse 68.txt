 I neither know nor understand  (ουτε οιδα ουτε επισταμα). This denial is fuller in Mark, briefest in John.What thou sayest  (συ τ λεγεις). Can be understood as a direct question. Note position ofthou  (συ), proleptical.Into the porch  (εις το προαυλιον). Only here in the New Testament. Plato uses it of a prelude on a flute. It occurs also in the plural for preparations the day before the wedding. Here it means the vestibule to the court. Matthew 26:71 has πυλωνα, a common word for gate or front porch.And the cock crew  (κα αλεκτωρ εφωνησεν). Omitted by Aleph B L Sinaitic Syriac. It is genuine in verse Mark 14:72 where "the second time" (εκ δευτερου) occurs also. It is possible that because of verse Mark 14:72 it crept into verse Mark 14:68. Mark alone alludes to the cock crowing twice, originally (Mark 14:30), and twice in verse Mark 14:72, besides verse Mark 14:68 which is hardly genuine.
