<p><b> To them that stood by </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις παρεστωσιν</span></span>). This talk about Peter was overheard by him. "This fellow (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος</span></span>) is one of them." So in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:70">Mark 14:70</span> the talk is directly to Peter as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:73">Matthew 26:73</span>, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:59">Luke 22:59</span> it is about him. Soon the bystanders (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο παρεστωτες</span></span>) will join in the accusation to Peter (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:70">Mark 14:70</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:73">Matthew 26:73</span>), with the specially pungent question in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:26">John 18:26</span> which was the climax. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:69-75">Matthew 26:69-75</span> for discussion of similar details. </p>
