<p><b> Curse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθεματιζειν</span></span>). Our word <i>anathema</i> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα, θεμα</span></span>, an offering, then something devoted or a curse). Finally the two meanings were distinguished by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθημα</span></span> for offering and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθεμα</span></span> for curse. Deissmann has found examples at Megara of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθεμα</span></span> in the sense of curse. Hence the distinction observed in the N.T. was already in the <i>Koine</i>. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:74">Matthew 26:74</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταθεματιζειν</span></span>, which is a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαξ λεγομενον</span></span> in the N.T., though common in the LXX. This word has the notion of calling down curses on one's self if the thing is not true. </p>
