<p><b> Called to mind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεμνησθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:75">Matthew 26:75</span> has the uncompounded verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμνησθη</span></span> while <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:61">Luke 22:61</span> has another compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεμνησθη</span></span>, was reminded.</p>
<p><b>When he thought thereon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιβαλων</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιβαλλω</span></span>. It is used absolutely here, though there is a reference to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ρημα</span></span> above, the word of Jesus, and the idiom involves <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον νουν</span></span> so that the meaning is to put the mind upon something. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:12">Luke 15:12</span> there is another absolute use with a different sense. Moulton (<i>Prolegomena</i>, p. 131) quotes a Ptolemaic papyrus Tb P 50 where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιβαλων</span></span> probably means "set to," put his mind on.</p>
