 Called to mind  (ανεμνησθη). First aorist passive indicative. Matthew 26:75 has the uncompounded verb εμνησθη while Luke 22:61 has another compound υπεμνησθη, was reminded.When he thought thereon  (επιβαλων). Second aorist active participle of επιβαλλω. It is used absolutely here, though there is a reference to το ρημα above, the word of Jesus, and the idiom involves τον νουν so that the meaning is to put the mind upon something. In Luke 15:12 there is another absolute use with a different sense. Moulton (Prolegomena, p. 131) quotes a Ptolemaic papyrus Tb P 50 where επιβαλων probably means "set to," put his mind on.Wept  (εκλαιεν). Inchoative imperfect, began to weep. Matthew 26:75 has the ingressive aorist εκλαυσεν, burst into tears.
