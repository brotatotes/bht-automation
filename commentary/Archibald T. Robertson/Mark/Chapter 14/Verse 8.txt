<p><b> She hath done what she could </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εσχεν εποιησεν</span></span>). This alone in Mark. Two aorists. Literally, "what she had she did." Mary could not comprehend the Lord's death, but she at least showed her sympathy with him and some understanding of the coming tragedy, a thing that not one of her critics had done.</p>
<p><b>She hath anointed my body aforehand for the burying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προελαβεν μυρισα το σωμα μου εις τον ενταφιασμον</span></span>). Literally, "she took beforehand to anoint my body for the burial." She anticipated the event. This is Christ's justification of her noble deed. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:12">Matthew 26:12</span> also speaks of the burial preparation by Mary, using the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενταφιασα</span></span>. </p>
