<p><b> In the morning </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρω</span></span>). The ratification meeting after day. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:1-5">Matthew 26:1-5</span> for details.</p>
<p><b>Held a consultation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμβουλιον ποιησαντες</span></span>). So text of Westcott and Hort (Vulgate <i>consilium facientes</i>), though they give <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετοιμασαντες</span></span> in the margin. The late and rare word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμβουλιον</span></span> is like the Latin <i>consilium</i>. If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετοιμασαντες</span></span> is the correct text, the idea would be rather to prepare a concerted plan of action (Gould). But their action was illegal on the night before and they felt the need of this ratification after dawn which is described in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:66-71">Luke 22:66-71</span>, who does not give the illegal night trial.</p>
<p><b>Bound Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δησαντες τον Ιησουν</span></span>). He was bound on his arrest (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:12">John 18:12</span>) when brought before Annas who sent him on bound to Caiaphas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:24">John 18:24</span>) and now he is bound again as he is sent to Pilate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:1">Mark 15:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:2">Matthew 27:2</span>). It is implied that he was unbound while before Annas and then before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin. </p>
