<p><b> He perceived </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγινωσκεν</span></span>). Imperfect tense descriptive of Pilate's growing apprehension from their conduct which increased his intuitive impression at the start. It was gradually dawning on him. Both Mark and Matthew give "envy" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθονον</span></span>) as the primary motive of the Sanhedrin. Pilate probably had heard of the popularity of Jesus by reason of the triumphal entry and the temple teaching.</p>
<p><b>Had delivered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδεδωκεισαν</span></span>). Past perfect indicative without augment where <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:18">Matthew 27:18</span> has the first aorist (kappa aorist) indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδωκαν</span></span>, not preserving the distinction made by Mark. The aorist is never used "as" a past perfect. </p>
