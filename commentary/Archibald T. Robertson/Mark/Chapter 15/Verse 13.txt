<p><b> Crucify him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σταυρωσον αυτον</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:21">Luke 23:21</span> repeats the verb. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:22">Matthew 27:22</span> has it, "Let him be crucified." There was a chorus and a hubbub of confused voices all demanding crucifixion for Christ. Some of the voices beyond a doubt had joined in the hallelujahs to the Son of David in the triumphal entry. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:23">Matthew 27:23</span> for discussion of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:14">Mark 15:14</span>. </p>
