<p><b> The Praetorium </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πραιτωριον</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:27">Matthew 27:27</span> this same word is translated "palace." That is its meaning here also, the palace in which the Roman provincial governor resided. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:13">Philippians 1:13</span> it means the Praetorian Guard in Rome. Mark mentions here "the court" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της αυλης</span></span>) inside of the palace into which the people passed from the street through the vestibule. See further on Matthew about the "band." </p>
