 The Praetorium  (πραιτωριον). In Matthew 27:27 this same word is translated "palace." That is its meaning here also, the palace in which the Roman provincial governor resided. In Philippians 1:13 it means the Praetorian Guard in Rome. Mark mentions here "the court" (της αυλης) inside of the palace into which the people passed from the street through the vestibule. See further on Matthew about the "band."
