 They offered him  (εδιδουν αυτω). Imperfect tense where Matthew has the aorist εδωκαν.Mingled with myrrh  (εσμυρνισμενον). Perfect passive participle. The verb means flavoured with myrrh, myrrhed wine. It is not inconsistent with Matthew 27:34 "mingled with gall," which see.But he received it not  (ος δε ουκ ελαβεν). Note the demonstrative ος with δε. Matthew has it that Jesus was not willing to take. Mark's statement is that he refused it.
