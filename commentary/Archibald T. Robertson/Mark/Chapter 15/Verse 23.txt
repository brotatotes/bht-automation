<p><b> They offered him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιδουν αυτω</span></span>). Imperfect tense where Matthew has the aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκαν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Mingled with myrrh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσμυρνισμενον</span></span>). Perfect passive participle. The verb means flavoured with myrrh, myrrhed wine. It is not inconsistent with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:34">Matthew 27:34</span> "mingled with gall," which see.</p>
<p><b>But he received it not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος δε ουκ ελαβεν</span></span>). Note the demonstrative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>. Matthew has it that Jesus was not willing to take. Mark's statement is that he refused it. </p>
