<p><b> The sixth hour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωρας εκτης</span></span>). That is, noon (Jewish time), as the third hour was nine A.M. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:25">Mark 15:25</span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:45">Matthew 27:45</span> for discussion. Given also by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:44">Luke 23:44</span>. Mark gives the Aramaic transliteration as does B in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:45">Matthew 27:45</span>, which see for discussion.</p>
<p><b>Forsaken </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγκατελιπες</span></span>). Some MSS. give <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωνειδισας</span></span> (reproached). We are not able to enter into the fulness of the desolation felt by Jesus at this moment as the Father regarded him as sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>). This desolation was the deepest suffering. He did not cease to be the Son of God. That would be impossible. </p>
