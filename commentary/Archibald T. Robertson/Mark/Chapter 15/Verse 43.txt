<p><b> A councillor of honourable estate </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευσχημων βουλευτης</span></span>). A senator or member of the Sanhedrin of high standing, rich (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:57">Matthew 27:57</span>).</p>
<p><b>Looking for the Kingdom of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην προσδεχομενος την βασιλειαν του θεου</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect. Also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:51">Luke 23:51</span>. The very verb used by Luke of Simeon and Anna (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:25">Luke 2:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:38">Luke 2:38</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:57">Matthew 27:57</span> calls him "Jesus' disciple" while <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:38">John 19:38</span> adds "secretly for fear of the Jews." He had evidently taken no public stand for Jesus before now.</p>
<p><b>Boldly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τολμησας</span></span>). Aorist (ingressive) active participle, becoming bold. It is the glory of Joseph and Nicodemus, secret disciples of Jesus, that they took a bold stand when the rest were in terror and dismay. That is love psychology, paradoxical as it may seem. </p>
