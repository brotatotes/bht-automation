<p><b> If he were already dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε ηδη τεθνηκεν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> after a verb of wondering, a classical idiom, a kind of indirect question just as we say "I wonder if." Usually death by crucifixion was lingering. This item is only in Mark.</p>
<p><b>Whether he had been any while dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε παλα απεθανεν</span></span>). B D read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη</span></span> (already) again here instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλα</span></span> (a long time). Mark does not tell the request of the Jews to Pilate that the legs of the three might be broken (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:31-37">John 19:31-37</span>). Pilate wanted to make sure that Jesus was actually dead by official report. </p>
