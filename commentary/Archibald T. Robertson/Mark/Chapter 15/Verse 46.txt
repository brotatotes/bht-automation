<p><b> Wound </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενειλησεν</span></span>). This word is only here in the N.T. As <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντυλισσω</span></span> is only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:59">Matthew 27:59</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:53">Luke 23:53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:7">John 20:7</span>. Both verbs occur in the papyri, Plutarch, etc. They both mean to wrap, wind, roll in. The body of Jesus was wound in the linen cloth bought by Joseph and the hundred pounds of spices brought by Nicodemus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:39">John 19:39</span>) for burying were placed in the folds of the linen and the linen was bound around the body by strips of cloth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:40">John 19:40</span>). The time was short before the sabbath began and these two reverently laid the body of the Master in Joseph's new tomb, hewn out of a rock. The perfect passive participle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λελατομημενον</span></span>) is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λατομος</span></span>, a stonecutter (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λως</span></span>, stone, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεμνω</span></span>, to cut). For further details see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:57-60">Matthew 27:57-60</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:53">Luke 23:53</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:41">John 19:41</span> also tell of the new tomb of Joseph. Some modern scholars think that this very tomb has been identified in Gordon's Calvary north of the city.</p>
<p><b>Against the door </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ την θυραν</span></span>). Matthew has the dative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη θυρα</span></span> without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> and adds the adjective "great" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγαν</span></span>). </p>
