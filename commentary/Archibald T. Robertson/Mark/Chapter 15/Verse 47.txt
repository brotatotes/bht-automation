<p><b> Beheld </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθεωρουν</span></span>). Imperfect tense picturing the two Marys "sitting over against the sepulchre" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:61">Matthew 27:61</span>) and watching in silence as the shadows fell upon all their hopes and dreams. Apparently these two remained after the other women who had been beholding from afar the melancholy end (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:40">Mark 15:40</span>) had left and "were watching the actions of Joseph and Nicodemus" (Swete). Probably also they saw the body of Jesus carried and hence they knew where it was laid and saw that it remained there (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεθειτα</span></span>, perfect passive indicative, state of completion). "It is evident that they constituted themselves a party of observation" (Gould). </p>
