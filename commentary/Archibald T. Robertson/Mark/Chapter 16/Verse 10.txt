<p><b> She </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινη</span></span>). Only instance of this pronoun (=<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλλα</span></span>) absolutely in Mark, though a good Greek idiom. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:35">John 19:35</span>.) See also verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:11">Mark 16:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:20">Mark 16:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>Went </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορευθεισα</span></span>). First aorist passive participle. Common word for going, but in Mark so far only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:30">Mark 9:30</span> in the uncompounded form. Here also in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:12">Mark 16:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15">Mark 16:15</span>.</p>
<p><b>Them that had been with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις μετ' αυτου γενομενοις</span></span>). This phrase for the disciples occurs here alone in Mark and the other Gospels if the disciples (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαθητα</span></span>) are meant. All these items suggest another hand than Mark for this closing portion.</p>
<p><b>As they mourned and wept </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πενθουσιν κα κλαιουσιν</span></span>). Present active participles in dative plural agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις ... γενομενοις</span></span> and describing the pathos of the disciples in their utter bereavement and woe. </p>
