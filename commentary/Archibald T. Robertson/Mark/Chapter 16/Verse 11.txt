 Disbelieved  (ηπιστησαν). This verb is common in the ancient Greek, but rare in the N.T. and here again verse Mark 16:16 and nowhere else in Mark. The usual N.T. word is απειθεω. Luke 24:11 uses this verb (ηπιστουν) of the disbelief of the report of Mary Magdalene and the other women. The verb εθεαθη (from θεαωμα) occurs only here and in verse Mark 16:14 in Mark.
