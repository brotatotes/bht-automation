<p><b> After these things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα ταυτα</span></span>). Only here in Mark. Luke tells us that it was on the same day (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:13">Luke 24:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>In another form </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ετερα μορφη</span></span>). It was not a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταμορφωσις</span></span> or transfiguration like that described in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:2">Mark 9:2</span>. Luke explains that their eyes were holden so that they could not recognize Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:16">Luke 24:16</span>). This matchless story appears in full in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:13-32">Luke 24:13-32</span>. </p>
