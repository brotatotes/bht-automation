<p><b> And is baptized </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα βαπτισθεις</span></span>). The omission of <b>baptized </b>with "disbelieveth" would seem to show that Jesus does not make baptism essential to salvation. Condemnation rests on disbelief, not on baptism. So salvation rests on belief. Baptism is merely the picture of the new life not the means of securing it. So serious a sacramental doctrine would need stronger support anyhow than this disputed portion of Mark. </p>
