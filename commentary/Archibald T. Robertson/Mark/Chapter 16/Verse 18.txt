<p><b> They shall take up serpents </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφεις αρουσιν</span></span>). Jesus had said something like this in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:19">Luke 10:19</span> and Paul was unharmed by the serpent in Malta (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:3">Acts 28:3</span>).</p>
<p><b>If they drink any deadly thing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κ'αν θανασιμον τ πιωσιν</span></span>). This is the only N.T. instance of the old Greek word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θανασιμος</span></span> (deadly). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:8">James 3:8</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θανατηφορος</span></span>, deathbearing. Bruce considers these verses in Mark "a great lapse from the high level of Matthew's version of the farewell words of Jesus" and holds that "taking up venomous serpents and drinking deadly poison seem to introduce us into the twilight of apocryphal story." The great doubt concerning the genuineness of these verses (fairly conclusive proof against them in my opinion) renders it unwise to take these verses as the foundation for doctrine or practice unless supported by other and genuine portions of the N.T. </p>
