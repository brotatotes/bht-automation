<p><b> Was received up into heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανελημπθη εις τον ουρανον</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative.

We should not know when it took place nor where but for Luke who locates it on Olivet (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:50">Luke 24:50</span>) at the close of the forty days (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:3">Acts 1:3</span>) and so after the return from Galilee (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:16">Matthew 28:16</span>).</p>
