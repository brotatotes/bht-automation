<p><b> The Lord working with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του κυριου συνεργουντος</span></span>). Genitive absolute. This participle not in Gospels elsewhere nor is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεβαιουντος</span></span> nor the compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επακολουθουντων</span></span>, all in Paul's Epistles. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πανταχου</span></span> once in Luke. Westcott and Hort give the alternative ending found in L: "And they announced briefly to Peter and those around him all the things enjoined. And after these things Jesus himself also sent forth through them from the east even unto the west the holy and incorruptible proclamation of the eternal salvation." </p>
