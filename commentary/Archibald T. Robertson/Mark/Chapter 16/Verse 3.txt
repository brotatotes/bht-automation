The opposite of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυλιω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:46">Mark 15:46</span>.

Both verbs occur in <i>Koine</i> writers and in the papyri. Clearly the women have no hope of the resurrection of Jesus for they were raising the problem (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεγον</span></span>, imperfect) as they walked along. </p>
