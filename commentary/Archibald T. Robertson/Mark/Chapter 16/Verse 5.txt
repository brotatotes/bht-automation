<p><b> Entering into the tomb </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισελθουσα εις το μνημειον</span></span>). Told also by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:3">Luke 24:3</span>, though not by Matthew.</p>
<p><b>A young man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεανισκον</span></span>). An angel in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:5">Matthew 28:5</span>, two men in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:24">Mark 16:24</span>. These and like variations in details show the independence of the narrative and strengthen the evidence for the general fact of the resurrection. The angel sat upon the stone (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:2">Matthew 28:2</span>), probably at first. Mark here speaks of the young man</p>
<p><b>sitting on the right side </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθημενον εν τοις δεξιοις</span></span>) inside the tomb. Luke has the two men standing by them on the inside (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:4">Luke 24:4</span>). Possibly different aspects and stages of the incident.</p>
<p><b>Arrayed in a white robe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιβεβλημενον στολην λευκην</span></span>). Perfect passive participle with the accusative case of the thing retained (verb of clothing). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:4">Luke 24:4</span> has "in dazzling apparel."</p>
<p><b>They were amazed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεθαμβηθησαν</span></span>). They were utterly (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span> in composition) amazed. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:5">Luke 24:5</span> has it "affrighted." <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:3">Matthew 28:3</span> tells more of the raiment white as snow which made the watchers quake and become as dead men. But this was before the arrival of the women. Mark, like Matthew and Luke, does not mention the sudden departure of Mary Magdalene to tell Peter and John of the grave robbery as she supposed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:1-10">John 20:1-10</span>). </p>
