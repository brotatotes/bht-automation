<p><b> Be not amazed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη εκθαμβεισθε</span></span>). The angel noted their amazement (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:5">Mark 16:5</span>) and urges the cessation of it using this very word.</p>
<p><b>The Nazarene </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον Ναζαρηνον</span></span>). Only in Mark, to identify "Jesus" to the women.</p>
<p><b>The crucified one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον εσταυρωμενον</span></span>). This also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:5">Matthew 28:5</span>. This description of his shame has become his crown of glory, for Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:14">Galatians 6:14</span>), and for all who look to the Crucified and Risen Christ as Saviour and Lord. He is risen (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγερθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative, the simple fact. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:4">1 Corinthians 15:4</span> Paul uses the perfect passive indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγηγερτα</span></span> to emphasize the permanent state that Jesus remains risen.</p>
<p><b>Behold the place </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδε ο τοπος</span></span>). Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδε</span></span> is used as an interjection with no effect on the case (nominative). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:6">Matthew 28:6</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδετε</span></span> is the verb with the accusative. See Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 302. </p>
