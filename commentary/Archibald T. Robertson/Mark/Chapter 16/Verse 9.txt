 When he had risen early on the first day of the week  (αναστας πρω πρωτη σαββατου). It is probable that this note of time goes with "risen" (αναστας), though it makes good sense with "appeared" (εφανη). Jesus is not mentioned by name here, though he is clearly the one meant. Mark uses μια in verse Mark 16:2, but πρωτη in Mark 14:12 and the plural σαββατων in verse Mark 16:2, though the singular here.First  (πρωτον). Definite statement that Jesusappeared  (εφανη) to Mary Magdalene first of all. The verb εφανη (second aorist passive of φαινω) is here alone of the Risen Christ (cf. Ελειας εφανη, Luke 9:8), the usual verb being ωφθη (Luke 24:34; 1 Corinthians 15:5).From whom  (παρ' ης). Only instance of παρα with the casting out of demons, εκ being usual (Mark 1:25; Mark 1:26; Mark 5:8; Mark 7:26; Mark 7:29; Mark 9:25). Εκβεβληκε is past perfect indicative without augment. This description of Mary Magdalene is like that in Luke 8:2 and seems strange in Mark at this point, described as a new character here, though mentioned by Mark three times just before (Mark 15:40; Mark 15:47; Mark 16:1). The appearance to Mary Magdalene is given in full by John 20:11-18.
