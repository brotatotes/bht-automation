 Again into Capernaum after some days  (παλιν εις Καφαρναουμ δι' ημερων). After the first tour of Galilee when Jesus is back in the city which is now the headquarters for the work in Galilee. The phrase δι' ημερων means days coming in between (δια, δυο, two) the departure and return.In the house  (εν οικω). More exactly,at home , in the home of Peter, now the home of Jesus. Another picture directly from Peter's discourse. Some of the manuscripts have here εις οικον, illustrating the practical identity in meaning of εν and εις (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 591-6).It was noised  (ηκουσθη). It was heard (first aorist, passive indicative from ακουω, to hear). People spread the rumour, "He is at home, he is indoors."
