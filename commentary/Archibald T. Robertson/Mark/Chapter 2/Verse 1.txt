<p><b> Again into Capernaum after some days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν εις Καφαρναουμ δι' ημερων</span></span>). After the first tour of Galilee when Jesus is back in the city which is now the headquarters for the work in Galilee. The phrase <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ημερων</span></span> means days coming in between (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια, δυο</span></span>, two) the departure and return.</p>
<p><b>In the house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν οικω</span></span>). More exactly,</p>
<p><b>at home </b>, in the home of Peter, now the home of Jesus. Another picture directly from Peter's discourse. Some of the manuscripts have here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις οικον</span></span>, illustrating the practical identity in meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 591-6).</p>
<p><b>It was noised </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσθη</span></span>). It was heard (first aorist, passive indicative from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span>, to hear). People spread the rumour, "He is at home, he is indoors." </p>
