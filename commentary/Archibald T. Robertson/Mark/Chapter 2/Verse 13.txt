<p><b> By the seaside </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα την θαλασσαν</span></span>). A pretty picture of Jesus walking by the sea and a walk that Jesus loved (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:16">Mark 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18">Matthew 4:18</span>). Probably Jesus went out from the crowd in Peter's house as soon as he could. It was a joy to get a whiff of fresh air by the sea. But it was not long till all the crowd began to come to Jesus (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρχετο</span></span>, imperfect) and Jesus was teaching them (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιδασκεν</span></span>, imperfect). It was the old story over again, but Jesus did not run away. </p>
