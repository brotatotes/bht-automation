<p><b> The righteous </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιους</span></span>). Jesus for the sake of argument accepts the claim of the Pharisees to be righteous, though, as a matter of fact, they fell very far short of it. Elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:23">Mark 2:23</span>) Jesus shows that the Pharisees were extortionate and devoured widows' houses and wore a cloak of pride and hypocritical respectability. The words "unto repentance" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις μετανοιαν</span></span>) are not genuine in Mark, but are in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:32">Luke 5:32</span>. Jesus called men to new spiritual life and away from sin and so to repentance. But this claim stopped their mouths against what Jesus was doing. The well or the strong (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυοντες</span></span>) are not those who need the physician in an epidemic. </p>
