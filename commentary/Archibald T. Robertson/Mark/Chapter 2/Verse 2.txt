<p><b> So that there was no longer room for them, no, not even about the door </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε μηκετ χωρειν μηδε τα προς την θυραν</span></span>). Another graphic Markan detail seen through Peter's eyes. The double compound negative in the Greek intensifies the negative. This house door apparently opened into the street, not into a court as in the larger houses. The house was packed inside and there was a jam outside.</p>
<p><b>And he spake the word unto them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ελαλε αυτοις τον λογον</span></span>). And he was speaking the word unto them, Mark's favourite descriptive imperfect tense (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλε</span></span>). Note this word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span> about the preaching of Jesus (originally just sounds like the chatter of birds, the prattling of children, but here of the most serious kind of speech. As contrasted with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span> (to say) it is rather an onomatopoetic word with some emphasis on the sound and manner of speaking. The word is com- mon in the vernacular papyri examples of social inter-course. </p>
