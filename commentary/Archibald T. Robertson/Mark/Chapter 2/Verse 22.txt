<p><b> But new wine into fresh wineskins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα οινον νεον εις ασκους καινους</span></span>). Westcott and Hort bracket this clause as a Western non-interpolation though omitted only in D and some old Latin MSS. It is genuine in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:38">Luke 5:38</span> and may be so here. </p>
