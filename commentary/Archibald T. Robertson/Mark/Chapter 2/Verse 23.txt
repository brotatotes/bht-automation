<p><b> Through the cornfields </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια των σποριμων</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:1">Matthew 12:1</span>. So Matt. and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:1">Luke 6:1</span>. But Mark uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραπορευεσθα</span></span>, to go along beside, unless <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαπορευεσθα</span></span> (BCD) is accepted. Perhaps now on the edge, now within the grain. Mark uses also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδον ποιειν</span></span>, to</p>
<p><b>make a way </b> like the Latin <i>iter facere</i>, as if through the standing grain,</p>
<p><b>plucking the ears </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιλλοντες τους σταχυας</span></span>). Work of preparing food the rabbis called it. The margin of the Revised Version has it correctly: They began to make their way plucking the ears of corn (grain, wheat or barley, we should say). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:1-8">Matthew 12:1-8</span> for discussion of this passage, parallel also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:15">Luke 6:15</span>. </p>
