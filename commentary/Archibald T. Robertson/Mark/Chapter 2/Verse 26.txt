<p><b> The house of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον οικον του θεου</span></span>). The tent or tabernacle at Nob, not the temple in Jerusalem built by Solomon.</p>
<p><b>When Abiathar was high priest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ Αβιαθαρ αρχιερεως</span></span>). Neat Greek idiom, in the time of Abiathar as high priest. There was confusion in the Massoretic text and in the LXX about the difference between Ahimelech (Abimelech) and Abiathar (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2sa+8:17">2 Samuel 8:17</span>), Ahimelech's son and successor (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+21:2">1 Samuel 21:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+22:20">1 Samuel 22:20</span>). Apparently Ahimelech, not Abiathar was high priest at this time. It is possible that both father and son bore both names (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+22:20">1 Samuel 22:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2sa+8:17">2 Samuel 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ch+18:16">1 Chronicles 18:16</span>), Abiathar mentioned though both involved. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Επ</span></span> may so mean in the passage about Abiathar. Or we may leave it unexplained. They had the most elaborate rules for the preparation of the shewbread (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους αρτους της προθεσεως</span></span>), the loaves of presentation, the loaves of the face or presence of God. It was renewed on the commencement of the sabbath and the old bread deposited on the golden table in the porch of the Sanctuary. This old bread was eaten by the priests as they came and went. This is what David ate. </p>
