<p><b> Even of the sabbath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα του σαββατου</span></span>). Mark, Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:8">Matthew 12:8</span>), and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:5">Luke 6:5</span>) all give this as a climax in the five reasons given by Christ on the occasion for the conduct of the disciples, but Mark has the little word "even" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>) not in the others, showing that Jesus knew that he was making a great claim as the Son of Man, the Representative Man, the Messiah looked at from his human interest, to lordship (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριος</span></span>) even of the sabbath. He was not the slave of the sabbath, but the master of it. "Even of the sabbath, so invaluable in your eyes. Lord, not to abolish, but to interpret and keep in its own place, and give it a new name" (Bruce). </p>
