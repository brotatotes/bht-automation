<p><b> And they come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ερχοντα</span></span>). Fine illustration of Mark's vivid dramatic historical present preserved by Luke <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:18">Luke 5:18</span>, but not by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:2">Matthew 9:2</span> (imperfect).</p>
<p><b>Borne by four </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιρομενον υπο τεσσαρων</span></span>). Another picturesque Markan detail not in the others. </p>
