<p><b> Come nigh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεγγισα</span></span>). But Westcott and Hort read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσενεγκα</span></span>, to bring to, after Aleph, B, L, 33, 63 (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:18">John 5:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>They uncovered the roof </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστεγασαν την στεγην</span></span>). They unroofed the roof (note paronomasia in the Greek and cognate accusative). The only instance of this verb in the N.T. A rare word in late Greek, no papyrus example given in Moulton and Milligan <i>Vocabulary</i>. They climbed up a stairway on the outside or ladder to the flat tile roof and dug out or broke up (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξορυξαντες</span></span>) the tiles (the roof). There were thus tiles (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια των κεραμων</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:19">Luke 5:19</span>) of laths and plaster and even slabs of stone stuck in for strength that had to be dug out. It is not clear where Jesus was (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου ην</span></span>), either downstairs, (Holtzmann) or upstairs (Lightfoot), or in the quadrangle (<i>atrium</i> or <i>compluvium</i>, if the house had one). "A composition of mortar, tar, ashes and sand is spread upon the roofs, and rolled hard, and grass grows in the crevices. On the houses of the poor in the country the grass grows more freely, and goats may be seen on the roofs cropping it" (Vincent).</p>
<p><b>They let down the bed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλωσ τον κραβαττον</span></span>), historical present again, aorist tense in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:19">Luke 5:19</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθηκαν</span></span>). The verb means to lower from a higher place as from a boat. Probably the four men had a rope fastened to each corner of the pallet or poor man's bed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραβαττον</span></span>, Latin <i>grabatus</i>. So one of Mark's Latin words). Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:2">Matthew 9:2</span>) has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλινη</span></span>, general term for bed. Luke has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλινιδιον</span></span> (little bed or couch). Mark's word is common in the papyri and is spelled also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραββατος</span></span>, sometimes <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραβατος</span></span>, while W, Codex Washingtonius, has it <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραββατον</span></span>. </p>
