<p><b> Their faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την πιστιν αυτων</span></span>). The faith of the four men and of the man himself. There is no reason for excluding his faith. They all had confidence in the power and willingness of Jesus to heal this desperate case.</p>
<p><b>Are forgiven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιεντα</span></span>, aoristic present passive, cf. punctiliar action, Robertson's <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 864ff.). So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:3">Matthew 9:3</span>, but <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:20">Luke 5:20</span> has the Doric perfect passive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεωντα</span></span>. The astonishing thing both to the paralytic and to the four friends is that Jesus forgave his sins instead of healing him. The sins had probably caused the paralysis. </p>
