 Their faith  (την πιστιν αυτων). The faith of the four men and of the man himself. There is no reason for excluding his faith.

So Matthew 9:3, but Luke 5:20 has the Doric perfect passive αφεωντα. The astonishing thing both to the paralytic and to the four friends is that Jesus forgave his sins instead of healing him. The sins had probably caused the paralysis.
