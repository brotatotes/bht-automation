<p><b> Sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκε καθημενο κα διαλογιζομενο εν ταις καρδιαις αυτων</span></span>). Another of Mark's pictures through Peter's eyes. These scribes (and Pharisees, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:21">Luke 5:21</span>) were there to cause trouble, to pick flaws in the teaching and conduct of Jesus. His popularity and power had aroused their jealousy. There is no evidence that they spoke aloud the murmur in their hearts, "within themselves" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:3">Matthew 9:3</span>). It was not necessary, for their looks gave them away and Jesus knew their thoughts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:4">Matthew 9:4</span>) and perceived their reasoning (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:22">Luke 5:22</span>).</p>
<p><b>Instantly Jesus recognized it in his own spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευθυς επιγνους ο Ιησους τω πνευματ αυτου</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:8">Mark 2:8</span>). The Master at once recognizes the hostile atmosphere in the house. The debate (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαλογιζομενο</span></span>) in their hearts was written on their faces. No sound had come, but feeling did. </p>
