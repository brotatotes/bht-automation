<p><b>That they might touch him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα αυτου αψωντα</span></span>). If only that much. They hoped for a cure by contact with Christ. Aorist subjunctive. It was a really pathetic scene and a tremendous strain on Jesus.</p>
<p><b>As many as had plagues </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσο ειχον μαστιγας</span></span>). Strokes or scourges, terms used by us today as a paralytic stroke, the influenza scourge. Our word plague is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληγη</span></span> (Latin <i>plaga</i>), from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληγνυμ</span></span>, to strike a blow. Common in ancient Greek in this sense.
