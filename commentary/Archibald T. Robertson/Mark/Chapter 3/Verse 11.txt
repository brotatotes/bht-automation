<p><b> Whensoever they beheld him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν αυτον εθεωρουν</span></span>). Imperfect indicative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> of repeated action. They kept falling down before him (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεπιπτον</span></span>) and crying, (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκραζον</span></span>) and he kept charging or rebuking (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτιμα</span></span>) them, all imperfects. The unclean spirits (demons) recognize Jesus as the Son of God, as before. Jesus charged them not to make him known as he had also done before. He did not wish this testimony. It was a most exciting ordeal and is given only by Mark. Note non-final use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>. </p>
