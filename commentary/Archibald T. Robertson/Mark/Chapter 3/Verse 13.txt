<p><b> He goeth up into the mountain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινε εις το ορος</span></span>). So Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span>) and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:12">Luke 6:12</span>), "to pray" Luke adds. Historical present so common in Mark's vivid narrative. Neither Gospel gives the name of the mountain, assuming it as well known, probably not far from the lake.</p>
<p><b>Whom he himself would </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ους ηθελεν αυτος</span></span>). Emphatic use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος</span></span> (himself) at end of sentence. Whether by personal imitation or through the disciples Jesus invites or calls to himself (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκαλειτα</span></span>, historical middle present indicative) a select number out of the vast crowds by the sea, those whom he really wished to be with him.</p>
<p><b>They went off to him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηλθον προς αυτον</span></span>). Luke states that Jesus "continued all night in prayer, to God." It was a crisis in the ministry of Christ. This select group up in the hills probably respected the long agony of Jesus though they did not comprehend his motive. They formed a sort of spiritual body-guard around the Master during his night vigil in the mountain. </p>
