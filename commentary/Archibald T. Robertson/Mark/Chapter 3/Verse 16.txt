<p><b> Simon he surnamed Peter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεθηκεν ονομα τω Σιμων Πετρον</span></span>). The Greek idiom seems awkward, but it is not. Peter is in apposition with <i>name</i> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span> (accusative). This surname Jesus gave in addition (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεθηκεν</span></span>) to Simon (dative case). Here then is a direct reference to what is told in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:42">John 1:42</span> when Jesus met Simon for the first time. Mark here reflects Peter's own words. Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:14">Luke 6:14</span>) simply says "Whom he also surnamed Peter." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> for the full explanation of the name Peter, a Rock, Cephas. </p>
