<p><b> Boanerges, which is Sons of thunder </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βοανηργες ο εστιν υιο βροντης</span></span>). This Hebrew nickname is given only by Mark and the reason for it is not clear. It may refer to the fiery temperament revealed in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:34">Luke 9:34</span> when James and John wanted to call down fire on the Samaritan villages that were unfriendly to them. The word literally means</p>
<p><b>sons of tumult, sons of thunder </b> in Syriac. No other epithets are given by Mark save descriptions to distinguish as Simon the Cananaean (or Zealot) and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:19">Mark 3:19</span>). Andrew, (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηρ</span></span>, a man) and Philip (Philippos, fond of horses) are both Greek names. Bartholomew, son of Tolmai, is the Nathanael of John's Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:2">John 21:2</span>). He probably had both names. Matthew is a Hebrew name meaning gift of God (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μαθθαιος</span></span>). Thomas is Hebrew and means Twin (Didymus, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:16">John 11:16</span>). There are two uses of the name of James (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιαχωβος</span></span>, Jacob). Thaddeus is another name for Lebbaeus. </p>
