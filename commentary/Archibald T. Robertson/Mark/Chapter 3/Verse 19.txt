 He cometh into a house  (ερχετα εις οικον). Historical present again and no article with noun. He comes home from the mountain, probably the house of Simon as in Mark 1:29. Mark passes by the Sermon on the Mount given by Matthew and Luke on the mountain (plateau on the mountain in Luke). We have to allow a reasonable interval for Mark's narrative. Mark's Gospel is full of action and does not undertake to tell all that Jesus did and said.
