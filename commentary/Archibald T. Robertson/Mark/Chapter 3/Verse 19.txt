<p><b> He cometh into a house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχετα εις οικον</span></span>). Historical present again and no article with noun. He comes home from the mountain, probably the house of Simon as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:29">Mark 1:29</span>. Mark passes by the Sermon on the Mount given by Matthew and Luke on the mountain (plateau on the mountain in Luke). We have to allow a reasonable interval for Mark's narrative. Mark's Gospel is full of action and does not undertake to tell all that Jesus did and said. </p>
