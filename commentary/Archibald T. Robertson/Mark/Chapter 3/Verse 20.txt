<p><b> So that they could not so much as eat bread </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε μη δυνασθα αυτους μηδε αρτον φαγειν</span></span>). Note infinitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span>. Apparently Jesus and the disciples indoors with the great crowd in the house and at the door as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:32">Mark 1:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:2">Mark 2:2</span> to which Mark refers by "again." The jam was so great that they could not rest, could not eat, and apparently Jesus could not even teach. The crowd reassembled at once on Christ's return from the mountain. </p>
