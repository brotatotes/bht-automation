<p><b> In parables </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν παραβολαις</span></span>). In crisp pungent thrusts that exposed the inconsistencies of the scribes and Pharisees. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:13">Mark 3:13</span> for discussion of the word</p>
<p><b>parable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολη</span></span>, placing beside for comparison). These short parabolic quips concern Satan's casting out (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλλε</span></span>, the very word used of casting out demons) Satan (rhetorical question), a kingdom divided (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μερισθη</span></span>, for a mere portion) against itself, a house divided (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μερισθη</span></span>) against itself, two conditions of the third class undetermined, but with prospect of determination. </p>
