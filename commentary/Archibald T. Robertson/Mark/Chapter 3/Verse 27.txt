<p><b> Spoil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαρπασα</span></span>). Plunder, compound verb, thoroughly ransack. Picture of Satan plundering the demons, the very tools (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκευη</span></span>) by which he carried on his business. A <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. Jesus is the conqueror of Satan, not in league with him. </p>
