<p><b> Standing without </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξω στηκοντες</span></span>). A late present from the perfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστηκα</span></span>. Pathetic picture of the mother and brothers standing on the outside of the house thinking that Jesus inside is beside himself and wanting to take him home. They were crowded out.</p>
<p><b>They sent unto him, calling him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστειλαν προς αυτον καλουντες αυτον</span></span>). They were unwilling to disclose their errand to take him home (Swete) and so get the crowd to pass word unto Jesus on the inside, "calling him" through others. Some of the MSS. add "sisters" to mother and brothers as seeking Jesus. </p>
