 Looking round on them  (περιβλεψαμενος). Another of Mark's life-like touches. Jesus calls those who do the will of God his mother, brothers, and sisters. This does not prove that the sisters were actually there. The brothers were hostile and that gives point to the tragic words of Jesus. One's heart goes out to Mary who has to go back home without even seeing her wondrous Son. What did it all mean to her at this hour?
