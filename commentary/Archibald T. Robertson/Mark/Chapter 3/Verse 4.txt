<p><b> But they held their peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε εσιωπων</span></span>). Imperfect tense. In sullen silence and helplessness before the merciless questions of Jesus as the poor man stood there before them all. Jesus by his pitiless alternatives between doing good (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθοποιεω</span></span>, late Greek word in LXX and N.T.) and doing evil (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακοποιεω</span></span>, ancient Greek word), to this man, for instance,</p>
<p><b>to save a life or to kill </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχην σωσα η αποκτεινα</span></span>), as in this case. It was a terrible exposure. </p>
