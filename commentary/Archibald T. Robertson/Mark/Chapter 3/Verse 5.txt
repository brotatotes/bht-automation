<p><b> When he had looked round on them with anger </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιβλεψαμενος αυτους μετ' οργης</span></span>). Mark has a good deal to say about the looks of Jesus with this word (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:5">Mark 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:34">Mark 3:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:37">Mark 5:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:8">Mark 9:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:23">Mark 10:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:11">Mark 11:11</span>) as here. So Luke only once, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:10">Luke 6:10</span>. The eyes of Jesus swept the room all round and each rabbinical hypocrite felt the cut of that condemnatory glance. This indignant anger was not inconsistent with the love and pity of Jesus. Murder was in their hearts and Jesus knew it. Anger against wrong as wrong is a sign of moral health (Gould).</p>
<p><b>Being grieved at the hardness of their hearts </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνλυπουμενος επ τη πωρωσε της καρδιας αυτων</span></span>). Mark alone gives this point. The anger was tempered by grief (Swete). Jesus is the Man of Sorrows and this present participle brings out the continuous state of grief whereas the momentary angry look is expressed by the aorist participle above. Their own heart or attitude was in a state of moral ossification (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πωρωσις</span></span>) like hardened hands or feet. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πωρος</span></span> was used of a kind of marble and then of the <i>callus</i> on fractured bones. "They were hardened by previous conceptions against this new truth" (Gould). See also on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:9-14">Matthew 12:9-14</span>. </p>
