<p><b> And straightway with the Herodians took council </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευθυς μετα των Hηρωιδιανων</span></span>). The Pharisees could stand no more. So out they stalked at once in a rage of madness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:11">Luke 6:11</span>) and outside of the synagogue took counsel (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμβουλιον εποιησαν</span></span>) or gave counsel (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμβουλιον εδιδουν</span></span>, as some MSS. have it, imperfect tense, offered counsel as their solution of the problem) with their bitter enemies, the Herodians, on the sabbath day still "how they might destroy him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως αυτον απολεσωσιν</span></span>), a striking illustration of the alternatives of Jesus a few moments before, "to save life or to kill." This is the first mention of the Herodians or adherents of Herod Antipas and the Herod family rather than the Romans. The Pharisees would welcome the help of their rivals to destroy Jesus. In the presence of Jesus they unite their forces as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:15">Mark 8:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:13">Mark 12:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:16">Matthew 22:16</span>. </p>
