"He and His would be safer by the open beach" (Swete). He has the disciples with him. Vincent notes that on eleven occasions Mark mentions the withdrawals of Jesus to escape his enemies, for prayer, for rest, for private conference with his disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:12">Mark 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:7">Mark 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:31">Mark 6:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:46">Mark 6:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:24">Mark 7:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:31">Mark 7:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:2">Mark 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:1">Mark 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:34">Mark 14:34</span>). But, as often, a great multitude (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολυ πληθος</span></span>) from Galilee followed him. </p>
