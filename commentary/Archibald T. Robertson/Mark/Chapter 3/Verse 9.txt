<p><b> That a little boat should wait on him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα πλοιαριον προσκαρτερη αυτω</span></span>). The boat was to keep close (note present tense subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκαρτερεω</span></span>) to the shore in constant readiness and move as Jesus did. Whether he needed it or not is not told, but it was there at hand.</p>
<p><b>Lest they should throng him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη θλιβωσιν αυτον</span></span>). Press or crush him. Jesus stayed with the crowds for they needed him. Present subjunctive again. </p>
