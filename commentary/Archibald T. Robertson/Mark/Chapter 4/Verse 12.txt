<p><b> Lest haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηποτε επιστρεψωσιν κα αφεθη αυτοις</span></span>). Luke does not have these difficult words that seem in Isaiah to have an ironical turn, though <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:15">Matthew 13:15</span> does retain them even after using <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> for the first part of the quotation. There is no way to make <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηποτε</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:12">Mark 4:12</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:15">Matthew 13:15</span> have a causal sense. It is the purpose of condemnation for wilful blindness and rejection such as suits the Pharisees after their blasphemous accusation against Jesus. Bengel says: <i>iam ante non videbant, nunc accedit iudicium divinum</i>. Jesus is pronouncing their doom in the language of Isaiah. It sounds like the dirge of the damned. </p>
