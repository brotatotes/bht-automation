<p><b> Know ye not this parable? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ οιδατε την παραβολην ταυτεν;</span></span>). They had asked Jesus his reasons for using parables. This question implies surprise at their dulness though initiated into the secret of God's Kingdom. Incapacity to comprehend this parable of the sower raises doubt about all the others on this day and at all times. </p>
