<p><b> He taught them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιδασκεν αυτους</span></span>). Imperfect tense describing it as going on.</p>
<p><b>In parables </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν παραβολαις</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:23">Mark 3:23</span>, only here more extended parables. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:13">Mark 4:13</span> for discussion concerning Christ's use of parables. Eight are given there, one (the Lamp both in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:21">Mark 4:21</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:16">Luke 8:16</span> (both Sower and the Lamp in Luke), one alone in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:26-29">Mark 4:26-29</span> (seed growing of itself) not in Matthew or Luke, ten on this occasion. Only four are mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:1-34">Mark 4:1-34</span> (The Sower, the Lamp, the Seed Growing of Itself, the Mustard Seed). But Mark adds (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:34">Mark 4:34</span>) "without a parable spake he not unto them," clearly meaning that Jesus spoke many others on this occasion and Matt. after mentioning eight (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:34">Matthew 13:34</span>) makes the same statement. Manifestly, therefore, Jesus spoke many parables on this day and all theories of exegesis or dispensations on the basis of the number of these kingdom parables are quite beside the mark. In beginning Jesus said:</p>
<p><b>Hearken </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ακουετε</span></span>). It is significant that even Jesus had to ask people to listen when he spoke. See also verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:9">Mark 4:9</span>. </p>
