<p><b> What ye hear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ακουετε</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:18">Luke 8:18</span> has it "how ye hear" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πως ακουετε</span></span>) . Both are important. Some things should not be heard at all for they besmirch the mind and heart. What is worth hearing should be heard rightly and heeded.</p>
<p><b>With what measure </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ω μετρω</span></span>). See already in the Sermon on the Mount (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:2">Matthew 7:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:38">Luke 6:38</span>). </p>
