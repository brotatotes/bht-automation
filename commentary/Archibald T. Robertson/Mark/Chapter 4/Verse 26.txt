<p><b> As if a man should cast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ανθρωπος βαλη</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> with the aorist subjunctive without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span>. It is a supposable case and so the subjunctive and the aorist tense because a single instance. Blass considers this idiom "quite impossible," but it is the true text here and makes good sense (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 968). The more common idiom would have been <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως εαν</span></span> (or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span>). </p>
