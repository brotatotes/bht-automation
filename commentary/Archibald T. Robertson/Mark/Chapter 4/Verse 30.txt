<p><b> How shall we liken? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πως ομοιωσωμεν?</span></span>) Deliberative first aorist subjunctive. This question alone in Mark. So with the other question:</p>
<p><b>In what parable shall we set it forth? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τιν αυτην παραβολη θωμεν;</span></span>). Deliberative second aorist subjunctive. The graphic question draws the interest of the hearers (<i>we</i>) by fine tact. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:18">Luke 13:18</span> retains the double question which <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:31">Matthew 13:31</span> does not have, though he has it in a very different context, probably an illustration of Christ's favourite sayings often repeated to different audiences as is true of all teachers and preachers. </p>
