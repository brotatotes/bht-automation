<p><b> But privately to his disciples he expounded all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ' ιδιαν δε τοις ιδιοις μαθηταις επελυεν παντα</span></span>). To his own (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιοις</span></span>) disciples in private, in distinction from the mass of the people Jesus was in the habit (imperfect tense, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επελυεν</span></span>) of</p>
<p><b>disclosing </b>, revealing, all things (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα</span></span>) in plain language without the parabolic form used before the crowds. This verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιλυω</span></span> occurs in the N.T. only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:39">Acts 19:39</span> where the town-clerk of Ephesus says of the troubles by the mob: "It shall be settled in the regular assembly" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη εννομω εκκλησια επιλυθησετα</span></span>). First future passive indicative from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιλυω</span></span>. The word means to give additional (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>) loosening (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυω</span></span>), so to explain, to make plainer, clearer, even to the point of revelation. This last is the idea of the substantive in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:20">2 Peter 1:20</span> where even the Revised Version has it: "No prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασα προφητεια γραφης ιδιας επιλυσεως ου γινετα</span></span>). Here the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινετα</span></span> (comes) with the ablative case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιλυσεως</span></span>) and the explanation given in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:21">2 Peter 1:21</span> shows plainly that disclosure or revelation to the prophet is what is meant, not interpretation of what the prophet said. The prophetic impulse and message came from God through the Holy Spirit. In private the further disclosures of Jesus amounted to fresh revelations concerning the mysteries of the kingdom of God. </p>
