<p><b> Even as he was </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ην</span></span>). Vulgate, <i>ita ut erat</i>. Bengel says: <i>sine apparatu</i>. That is, they take Jesus along (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαμβανουσιν</span></span>) without previous preparation.</p>
<p><b>Other boats </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα πλοια</span></span>). This detail also is given only by Mark. Some people had got into boats to get close to Jesus. There was a crowd even on the lake. </p>
