<p><b> There ariseth a great storm of wind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινετα λαιλαπς μεγαλη ανεμου</span></span>). Mark's vivid historical present again. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:24">Matthew 8:24</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span> (arose) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:23">Luke 8:23</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεβη</span></span> (came down). Luke has also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαιλαπς</span></span>, but Matthew <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεισμος</span></span> (tempest), a violent upheaval like an earthquake. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λαιλαπς</span></span> is an old word for these cyclonic gusts or storms. Luke's "came down" shows that the storm fell suddenly from Mount Hermon down into the Jordan Valley and smote the Sea of Galilee violently at its depth of 682 feet below the Mediterranean Sea. The hot air at this depth draws the storm down with sudden power. These sudden storms continue to this day on the Sea of Galilee. The word occurs in the LXX of the whirlwind out of which God answered Job (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+38:1">Job 38:1</span>) and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jon+1:4">Jonah 1:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>The waves beat into the boat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα κυματα επεβαλλεν εις το πλοιον</span></span>). Imperfect tense (were beating) vividly picturing the rolling over the sides of the boat "so that the boat was covered with the waves" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:24">Matthew 8:24</span>). Mark has it: "insomuch that the boat was now filling" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε ηδη γεμιζεσθα το πλοιον</span></span>). Graphic description of the plight of the disciples. </p>
