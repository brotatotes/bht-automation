 Asleep on the cushion  (επ το προσκεφαλαιον καθευδων). Mark also mentions the cushion or bolster and the stern of the boat (εν τη πρυμνη). Matthew 8:24 notes that Jesus was sleeping (εκαθευδεν), Luke thathe fell asleep  (αφυπνωσεν, ingressive aorist indicative). He was worn out from the toil of this day.They awake him  (εγειρουσιν αυτον). So Mark's graphic present. Matthew and Luke both have "awoke him." Mark has also what the others do not: "Carest thou not?" (ου μελε σοι;). It was a rebuke to Jesus for sleeping in such a storm. We are perishing (απολλυμεθα, linear present middle). Precisely this same form also in Matthew 8:25 and Luke 8:24.
