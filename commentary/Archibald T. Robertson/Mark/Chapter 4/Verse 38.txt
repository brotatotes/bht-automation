<p><b> Asleep on the cushion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ το προσκεφαλαιον καθευδων</span></span>). Mark also mentions the cushion or bolster and the stern of the boat (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη πρυμνη</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:24">Matthew 8:24</span> notes that Jesus was sleeping (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθευδεν</span></span>), Luke that</p>
<p><b>he fell asleep </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφυπνωσεν</span></span>, ingressive aorist indicative). He was worn out from the toil of this day.</p>
<p><b>They awake him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγειρουσιν αυτον</span></span>). So Mark's graphic present. Matthew and Luke both have "awoke him." Mark has also what the others do not: "Carest thou not?" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μελε σοι;</span></span>). It was a rebuke to Jesus for sleeping in such a storm. We are perishing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολλυμεθα</span></span>, linear present middle). Precisely this same form also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:25">Matthew 8:25</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:24">Luke 8:24</span>. </p>
