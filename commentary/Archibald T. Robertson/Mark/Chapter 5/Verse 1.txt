<p><b> The Gerasenes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των Γερασηνων</span></span>). Like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:26">Luke 8:26</span> while <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28">Matthew 8:28</span> has "the Gadarenes." The ruins of the village Khersa (Gerasa) probably point to this site which is in the district of Gadara some six miles southeastward, not to the city of Gerasa some thirty miles away. </p>
