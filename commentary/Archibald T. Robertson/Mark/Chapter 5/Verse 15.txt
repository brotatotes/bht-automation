<p><b> They come to Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχοντα προς τον Ιησουν</span></span>). Vivid present. To Jesus as the cause of it all, "to meet Jesus" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις υπαντησιν Ιησου</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:34">Matthew 8:34</span>).</p>
<p><b>And behold </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεωρουσιν</span></span>). Present tense again.</p>
<p><b>And they were afraid </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εφοβηθησαν</span></span>). They became afraid. Mark drops back to the ingressive aorist tense (passive voice). They had all been afraid of the man, but there he was "sitting clothed and in his right mind," (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθημενον ιματισμενον κα σωφρονουντα</span></span>. Note the participles). "At the feet of Jesus," Luke adds (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:35">Luke 8:35</span>). For a long time he had worn no clothes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:17">Luke 8:17</span>). Here was the healing of the wild man and the destruction of the hogs all by this same Jesus. </p>
