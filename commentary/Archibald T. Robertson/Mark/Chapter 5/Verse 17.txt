<p><b> To depart from their borders </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απελθειν απο των οριων</span></span>). Once before the people of Nazareth had driven Jesus out of the city (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:16-31">Luke 4:16-31</span>). Soon they will do it again on his return there (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:1-6">Mark 6:1-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:54-58">Matthew 13:54-58</span>). Here in Decapolis pagan influence was strong and the owners of the hogs cared more for the loss of their property than for the healing of the wild demoniac. In the clash between business and spiritual welfare business came first with them as often today. All three Gospels tell of the request for Jesus to leave. They feared the power of Jesus and wanted no further interference with their business affairs. </p>
