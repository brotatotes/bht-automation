<p><b> Go to thy house unto thy friends </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυπαγε εις τον οικον σου προς τους σους</span></span>). "To thy own folks" rather than "thy friends." Certainly no people needed the message about Christ more than these people who were begging Jesus to leave. Jesus had greatly blessed this man and so gave him the hardest task of all, to go home and witness there for Christ. In Galilee Jesus had several times forbidden the healed to tell what he had done for them because of the undue excitement and misunderstanding. But here it was different. There was no danger of too much enthusiasm for Christ in this environment. </p>
