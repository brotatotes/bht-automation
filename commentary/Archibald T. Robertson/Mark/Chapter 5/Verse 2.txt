<p><b> Out of the boat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του πλοιου</span></span>). Straightway (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευθυς</span></span>) Mark says, using the genitive absolute (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξελθοντος αυτου</span></span>) and then repeating <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span> associative instrumental after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηντησεν</span></span>. The demoniac greeted Jesus at once. Mark and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:27">Luke 9:27</span> mention only one man while Matthew notes two demoniacs, perhaps one more violent than the other. Each of the Gospels has a different phrase. Mark has "a man with an unclean spirit" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πνευματ ακαθαρτω</span></span>), <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28">Matthew 8:28</span> "two possessed with demons" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυο δαιμονιζομενο</span></span>), <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:27">Luke 8:27</span> "one having demons" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις εχων δαιμονια</span></span>). Mark has many touches about this miracle not retained in Matthew and Luke. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28">Matthew 8:28</span>. </p>
