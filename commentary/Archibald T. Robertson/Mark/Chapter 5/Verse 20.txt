<p><b> He went his way </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηλθεν</span></span>). He went off and did as Jesus told him. He heralded (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυσσειν</span></span>) or published the story till all over Decapolis men marvelled (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθαυμαζον</span></span>) at what Jesus did, kept on marvelling (imperfect tense). The man had a greater opportunity for Christ right in his home land than anywhere else. They all knew this once wild demoniac who now was a new man in Christ Jesus. Thousands of like cases of conversion under Christ's power have happened in rescue missions in our cities. </p>
