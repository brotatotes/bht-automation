 My little daughter  (το θυγατριον μου). Diminutive of θυγατηρ (Matthew 9:18). "This little endearing touch in the use of the diminutive is peculiar to Mark" (Vincent). "Is at the point of death" (εσχατως εχε). Has it in the last stages. Matthew 9:18 has: "has just died" (αρτ ετελευσεν), Luke "she lay a dying" (απεθνησκεν, imperfect, she was dying). It was a tragic moment for Jairus.I pray thee , not in the Greek. This ellipsis before ινα not uncommon, a sort of imperative use of ινα and the subjunctive in the Koine (Robertson, Grammar, p. 943).
