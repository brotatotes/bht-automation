<p><b> She felt in her body </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγνω τω σωματ</span></span>). She knew, the verb means. She said to herself,</p>
<p><b>I am healed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιαμα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιατα</span></span> retains the perfect passive in the indirect discourse. It was a vivid moment of joy for her. The plague (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαστιγος</span></span>) or scourge was a whip used in flagellations as on Paul to find out his guilt (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:24">Acts 22:24</span>, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:26">Hebrews 11:26</span>). It is an old word that was used for afflictions regarded as a scourge from God. See already on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:10">Mark 3:10</span>. </p>
