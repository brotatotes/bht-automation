<p><b> Fearing and trembling, knowing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβηθεισα κα τρεμουσα, ειδυια</span></span>). These participles vividly portray this woman who had tried to hide in the crowd. She had heard Christ's question and felt his gaze. She had to come and confess, for something "has happened" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγονεν</span></span>, second perfect active indicative, still true) to her.</p>
<p><b>Fell down before him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεπεσεν αυτω</span></span>). That was the only proper attitude now.</p>
<p><b>All the truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασαν την αληθειαν</span></span>). Secrecy was no longer possible. She told "the pitiful tale of chronic misery" (Bruce). </p>
