<p><b> While he yet spake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ετ αυτου λαλουντος</span></span>). Genitive absolute. Another vivid touch in Mark and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:49">Luke 8:49</span>. The phrase is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+29:9">Genesis 29:9</span>. Nowhere does Mark preserve better the lifelike traits of an eyewitness like Peter than in these incidents in chapter 5. The arrival of the messengers from Jairus was opportune for the woman just healed of the issue of blood (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υσε αιματος</span></span>) for it diverted attention from her. Now the ruler's daughter has died (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεθανε</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Why troublest thou the master any further? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ ετ σκυλλεις τον διδασκαλον;</span></span>). It was all over, so they felt. Jesus had raised from the dead the son of the widow of Nain (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:11-17">Luke 7:11-17</span>), but people in general did not expect him to raise the dead. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκυλλω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκυλον</span></span> (<i>skin, pelt, spoils</i>), means to skin, to flay, in Aeschylus. Then it comes to mean to vex, annoy, distress as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:36">Matthew 9:36</span>, which see. The middle is common in the papyri for bother, worry, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:6">Luke 7:6</span>. There was no further use in troubling the Teacher about the girl. </p>
