 Not heeding  (παρακουσας). This is the sense in Matthew 18:17 and uniformly so in the LXX. But here the other sense of hearing aside, overhearing what was not spoken directly to him, probably exists also. "Jesus might overhear what was said and disregard its import" (Bruce). Certainly he ignored the conclusion of the messengers. The present participle λαλουμενον suits best the idea of overhearing. Both Mark and Luke 8:50 have "Fear not, only believe" (μη φοβου, μονον πιστευε). This to the ruler of the synagogue (τω αρχισυναγωγω) who had remained and to whom the messenger had spoken.
