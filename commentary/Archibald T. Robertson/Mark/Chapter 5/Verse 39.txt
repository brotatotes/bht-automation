 Make a tumult  (θορυβεισθε). Middle voice. Jesus had dismissed one crowd (verse Mark 5:37), but finds the house occupied by the hired mourners making bedlam (θορυβος) as if that showed grief with their ostentatious noise. Matthew 9:23 spoke of flute-players (αυλητας) and the hubbub of the excited throng (θορυβουμενον. Cf. Mark 14:2; Acts 20:1; Acts 20:21; Acts 20:34). Mark, Matthew, and Luke all quote Jesus as saying that "the child is not dead, but sleepeth." Jesus undoubtedly meant that she was not dead to stay dead, though some hold that the child was not really dead. It is a beautiful word (she issleeping , καθευδε) that Jesus uses of death.
