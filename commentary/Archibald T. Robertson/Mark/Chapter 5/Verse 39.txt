<p><b> Make a tumult </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θορυβεισθε</span></span>). Middle voice. Jesus had dismissed one crowd (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:37">Mark 5:37</span>), but finds the house occupied by the hired mourners making bedlam (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θορυβος</span></span>) as if that showed grief with their ostentatious noise. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:23">Matthew 9:23</span> spoke of flute-players (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυλητας</span></span>) and the hubbub of the excited throng (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θορυβουμενον</span></span>. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:2">Mark 14:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:1">Acts 20:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:21">Acts 20:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:34">Acts 20:34</span>). Mark, Matthew, and Luke all quote Jesus as saying that "the child is not dead, but sleepeth." Jesus undoubtedly meant that she was not dead to stay dead, though some hold that the child was not really dead. It is a beautiful word (she is</p>
<p><b>sleeping </b>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθευδε</span></span>) that Jesus uses of death. </p>
