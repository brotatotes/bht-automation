<p><b> And they laughed him to scorn </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα κατεγελων</span></span>). "They jeered at him" (Weymouth). Note imperfect tense. They kept it up. And note also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ-</span></span> (perfective use). Exactly the same words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:24">Matthew 9:24</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:53">Luke 8:53</span>. The loud laughter was ill suited to the solemn occasion. But Jesus on his part (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος δε</span></span>) took charge of the situation.</p>
<p><b>Taketh the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαμβανε τον πατερα του παιδιου κα την μητερα κα τους μετ' αυτου</span></span>). Having put out (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλων</span></span>) the rest by a stern assertion of authority as if he were master of the house, Jesus takes along with him these five and enters the chamber of death "where the child was" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου ην το παιδιον</span></span>). He had to use pressure to make the hired mourners leave. The presence of some people will ruin the atmosphere for spiritual work. </p>
