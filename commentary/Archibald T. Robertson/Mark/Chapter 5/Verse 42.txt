<p><b> Rose up, and walked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεστη κα περιεπατε</span></span>). Aorist tense (single act) followed by the imperfect (<b> the walking went on </b>).</p>
<p><b>For she was twelve years old </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην γαρ ετων δωδεκα</span></span>). The age mentioned by Mark alone and here as explanation that she was old enough to walk.</p>
<p><b>Amazed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεστησαν</span></span>). We have had this word before in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:23">Matthew 12:23</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:12">Mark 2:12</span>, which see. Here the word is repeated in the substantive in the associative instrumental case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκστασε μεγαλη</span></span>), with a great ecstasy, especially on the part of the parents (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:56">Luke 8:56</span>), and no wonder. </p>
