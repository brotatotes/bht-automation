<p><b> He was crying out, and cutting himself with stones </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην κραζων κα κατακοπτων εαυτον λιθοις</span></span>). Further vivid details by Mark. Night and day his loud scream or screech could be heard like other demoniacs (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:26">Mark 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:11">Mark 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:26">Mark 9:26</span>). The verb for cutting himself occurs here only in the N.T., though an old verb. It means to <i>cut down</i> (perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα-</span></span>). We say <i>cut up</i>, gash, hack to pieces. Perhaps he was scarred all over with such gashes during his moments of wild frenzy night and day in the tombs and on the mountains. Periphrastic imperfect active with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> and the participles. </p>
