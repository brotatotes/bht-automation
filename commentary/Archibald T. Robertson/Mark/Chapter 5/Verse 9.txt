<p><b> My name is Legion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λεγιων ονομα μο</span></span>). So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:30">Luke 8:30</span>, but not Matthew. Latin word (<i>legio</i>). A full Roman legion had 6,826 men. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:53">Matthew 26:53</span>. This may not have been a full legion, for <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:13">Mark 5:13</span> notes that the number of hogs was "about two thousand." Of course, a stickler for words might say that each hog had several demons. </p>
