<p><b> For a testimony unto them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις μαρτυριον αυτοις</span></span>). Not in Matthew. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:5">Luke 9:5</span> has "for a testimony against them" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις μαρτυριον επ αυτους</span></span>). The dative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοις</span></span> in Mark is the dative of disadvantage and really carries the same idea as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> in Luke. The dramatic figure of</p>
<p><b>shaking out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτιναξατε</span></span>, effective aorist imperative, Mark and Matthew),</p>
<p><b>shaking off </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποτινασσετε</span></span>, present imperative, Luke). </p>
