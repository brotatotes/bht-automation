<p><b> John, whom I beheaded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον εγο απεκεφαλισα Ιωανην</span></span>). His fears got the best of him and so Herod settled down on this nightmare. He could still see that charger containing John's head coming towards him in his dreams. The late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκεφαλιζω</span></span> means to cut off the head. Herod had ordered it done and recognizes his guilt. </p>
