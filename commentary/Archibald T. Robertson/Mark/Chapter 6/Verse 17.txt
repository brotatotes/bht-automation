<p><b> For Herod himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αυτος γαρ ο Hηρωιδης</span></span>). Mark now proceeds to give the narrative of the death of John the Baptist some while before these nervous fears of Herod. But this <i>post eventum</i> narrative is very little out of the chronological order. The news of John's death at Machaerus may even have come at the close of the Galilean tour. "The tidings of the murder of the Baptist seem to have brought the recent circuit to an end" (Swete). The disciples of John "went and told Jesus. Now when Jesus heard it, he withdrew from thence in a boat" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:12">Matthew 14:12</span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:3-12">Matthew 14:3-12</span> for the discussion about Herod Antipas and John and Herodias. </p>
