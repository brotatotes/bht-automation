<p><b> And Herodias set herself against him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hη δε Hηρωιδιας ενειχεν αυτω</span></span>). Dative of disadvantage. Literally,</p>
<p><b>had it in for him </b>. This is modern slang, but is in exact accord with this piece of vernacular <i>Koine</i>. No object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειχεν</span></span> is expressed, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οργην</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χολον</span></span> may be implied. The tense is imperfect and aptly described the feelings of Herodias towards this upstart prophet of the wilderness who had dared to denounce her private relations with Herod Antipas. Gould suggests that she "kept her eye on him" or kept up her hostility towards him. She never let up, but bided her time which, she felt sure, would come. See the same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:23">Genesis 49:23</span>. She</p>
<p><b>desired to kill him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηθελεν αυτον αποκτεινα</span></span>). Imperfect again.</p>
<p><b>And she could not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκ ηδυνατο</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κα</span></span> here has an adversative sense, but she could not. That is, not yet. "The power was wanting, not the will" (Swete). </p>
