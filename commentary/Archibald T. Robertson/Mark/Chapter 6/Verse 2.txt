The ruler of the synagogue (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχισυναγωγος</span></span>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:22">Matthew 5:22</span>) would ask some one to speak whensoever he wished.

<p><b>by his hands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια των χειρων</span></span>). They felt that there was some hocus-pocus about it somehow and somewhere. They do not deny the wisdom of his words, nor the wonder of his works, but the townsmen knew Jesus and they had never suspected that he possessed such gifts and graces. </p>
