<p><b> Feared John </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφοβειτο τον Ιωανην</span></span>). Imperfect tense, continual state of fear. He feared John and also Herodias. Between the two Herod vacillated. He knew him to be righteous and holy (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιον κα αγιον</span></span>) and so innocent of any wrong. So he</p>
<p><b>kept him safe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνετηρε</span></span>). Imperfect tense again. Late Greek verb. From the plots and schemes of Herodias. She was another Jezebel towards John and with Herod.</p>
<p><b>Much perplexed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλα ηπορε</span></span>). This the correct text not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλα εποιε</span></span>, did many things. Imperfect tense again.</p>
<p><b>He heard him gladly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδεως ηκουεν</span></span>). Imperfect tense again. This is the way that Herod really felt when he could slip away from the meshes of Herodias. These interviews with the Baptist down in the prison at Machaerus during his occasional visits there braced "his jaded mind as with a whiff of fresh air" (Swete). But then he saw Herodias again and he was at his wits' end (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηπορε</span></span>, lose one's way, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορος</span></span>, way), for he knew that he had to live with Herodias with whom he was hopelessly entangled. </p>
