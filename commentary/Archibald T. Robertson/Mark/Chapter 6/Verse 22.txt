<p><b> The daughter of Herodias herself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της θυγατρος αυτης Hηρωιδιαδος</span></span>). Genitive absolute again. Some ancient manuscripts read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> (his, referring to Herod Antipas. So Westcott and Hort) instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτης</span></span> (herself). In that case the daughter of Herodias would also have the name Herodias as well as Salome, the name commonly given her. That is quite possible in itself. It was toward the close of the banquet, when all had partaken freely of the wine, that Herodias made her daughter come in and dance (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισελθουσης κα ορχησαμενης</span></span>) in the midst (Matthew). "Such dancing was an almost unprecedented thing for women of rank, or even respectability. It was mimetic and licentious, and performed by professionals" (Gould). Herodias stooped thus low to degrade her own daughter like a common <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εταιρα</span></span> in order to carry out her set purpose against John.</p>
<p><b>She pleased Herod and them that sat at meat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρεσεν Hηρωιδη κα τοις συνανακειμενοις</span></span>). The maudlin group lounging on the divans were thrilled by the licentious dance of the half-naked princess.</p>
<p><b>Whatsoever thou wilt </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εαν θεληις</span></span>) The drunken Tetrarch had been caught in the net of Herodias. It was a public promise. </p>
