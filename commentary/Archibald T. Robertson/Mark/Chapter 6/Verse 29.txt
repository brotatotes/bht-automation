<p><b> His corpse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πτωμα αυτου</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:28">Matthew 24:28</span>. It was a mournful time for the disciples of John. "They went and told Jesus" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:12">Matthew 14:12</span>). What else could they do? </p>
