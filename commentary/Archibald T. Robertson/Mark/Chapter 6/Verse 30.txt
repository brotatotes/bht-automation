<p><b> And the apostles gather themselves together unto Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα συναγοντα ο αποστολο προς τον Ιησουν</span></span>). Vivid historical present.</p>
<p><b>All things whatsoever they had done and whatsoever they had taught </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα οσα εποιησαν κα οσα εδιδαξαν</span></span>). Not past perfect in the Greek, just the aorist indicative, constative aorist that summed it all up, the story of this their first tour without Jesus. And Jesus listened to it all (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10">Luke 9:10</span>). He was deeply concerned in the outcome. </p>
