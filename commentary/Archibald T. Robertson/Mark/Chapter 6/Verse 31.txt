<p><b> Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest awhile </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δευτε υμεις αυτο κατ' ιδιαν εις ερημον τοπον κα αναπαυεσθε ολιγον</span></span>). It was plain that they were over-wrought and excited and needed refreshment (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπαυεσθε</span></span>, middle voice, refresh yourselves, "rest up" literally). This is one of the needed lessons for all preachers and teachers, occasional change and refreshment. Even Jesus felt the need of it.</p>
<p><b>They had no leisure so much as to eat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε φαγειν ευκαιρουν</span></span>). Imperfect tense again. Crowds were coming and going. Change was a necessity. </p>
