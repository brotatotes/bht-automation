 Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest awhile  (Δευτε υμεις αυτο κατ' ιδιαν εις ερημον τοπον κα αναπαυεσθε ολιγον). It was plain that they were over-wrought and excited and needed refreshment (αναπαυεσθε, middle voice, refresh yourselves, "rest up" literally). This is one of the needed lessons for all preachers and teachers, occasional change and refreshment. Even Jesus felt the need of it.They had no leisure so much as to eat  (ουδε φαγειν ευκαιρουν). Imperfect tense again. Crowds were coming and going. Change was a necessity.
