John says that Jesus asked Philip to find out what food they had (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:5">John 6:5</span>) probably after the disciples had suggested that Jesus send the crowd away as night was coming on (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:35">Mark 6:35</span>). On this protest to his command that they feed the crowds (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:37">Mark 6:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:16">Matthew 14:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:13">Luke 9:13</span>) Jesus said "Go see" how many loaves you can get hold of.

John's Gospel alone tells of the lad with his lunch which his mother had given him. </p>
