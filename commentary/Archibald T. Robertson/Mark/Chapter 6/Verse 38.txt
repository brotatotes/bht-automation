 Go and see  (υπαγετε ιδετε). John says that Jesus asked Philip to find out what food they had (John 6:5) probably after the disciples had suggested that Jesus send the crowd away as night was coming on (Mark 6:35). On this protest to his command that they feed the crowds (Mark 6:37; Matthew 14:16; Luke 9:13) Jesus said "Go see" how many loaves you can get hold of. Then Andrew reports the fact of the lad with five barley loaves and two fishes (John 6:8). They had suggested before that two hundred pennyworth (δηναριων διακοσιων. See on Matthew 18:28) was wholly inadequate and even that (some thirty-five dollars) was probably all that or even more than they had with them. John's Gospel alone tells of the lad with his lunch which his mother had given him.
