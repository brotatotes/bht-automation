<p><b> By companies </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμποσια συμποσια</span></span>). Distribution expressed by repetition as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:7">Mark 6:7</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυο δυο</span></span>) instead of using <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>. Literally our word <i>symposium</i> and originally a drinking party, Latin <i>convivium</i>, then the party of guests of any kind without the notion of drinking. So in Plutarch and the LXX (especially I Macca.).</p>
<p><b>Upon the green grass </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τω χλωρω χορτω</span></span>). Another Markan touch. It was passover time (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:4">John 6:4</span>) and the afternoon sun shone upon the orderly groups upon the green spring grass. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:15">Matthew 14:15</span>. They may have been seated like companies at tables, open at one end. </p>
