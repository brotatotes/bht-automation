<p><b> Wheresoever he entered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου αν εισεπορευετο</span></span>). The imperfect indicative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> used to make a general indefinite statement with the relative adverb. See the same construction at the close of the verse, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσο αν ηψαντο αυτον</span></span> (aorist indicative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> in a relative clause),</p>
<p><b>as many as touched him </b>. One must enlarge the details here to get an idea of the richness of the healing ministry of Jesus. We are now near the close of the Galilean ministry with its many healing mercies and excitement is at the highest pitch (Bruce). </p>
