<p><b> Save a staff only </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη ραβδον μονον</span></span>). Every traveller and pilgrim carried his staff. Bruce thinks that Mark has here preserved the meaning of Jesus more clearly than <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:10">Matthew 10:10</span> (nor staff) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:3">Luke 9:3</span> (neither staff). This discrepancy has given trouble to commentators. Grotius suggests no second staff for Matthew and Luke. Swete considers that Matthew and Luke report "an early exaggeration of the sternness of the command." "Without even a staff is the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of austere simplicity, and self-denial. Men who carry out the spirit of these precepts will not labour in vain" (Bruce). </p>
