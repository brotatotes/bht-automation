<p><b> Corban </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κορβαν ο εστιν δωρον</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:5">Matthew 15:5</span>.

<p><b>gift </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωρον</span></span>), but declinable <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κορβανας</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:6">Matthew 27:6</span>, meaning sacred treasury. The rabbis (<b> but ye say </b>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις δε λεγετε</span></span>) actually allowed the mere saying of this word by an unfaithful son to prevent the use of needed money for the support of father or mother. It was a home thrust to these pettifogging sticklers for ceremonial punctilios. They not only justified such a son's trickery, but held that he was prohibited from using it for father or mother, but he might use it for himself. </p>
