<p><b> Are ye so without understanding also? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hουτως κα υμεις ασυνετο εστε;</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:16">Matthew 15:16</span>. You also as well as the multitude. It was a discouraging moment for the great Teacher if his own chosen pupils (disciples) were still under the spell of the Pharisaic theological outlook. It was a riddle to them. "They had been trained in Judaism, in which the distinction between clean and unclean is ingrained, and could not understand a statement abrogating this" (Gould). They had noticed that the Pharisees stumbled at the parable of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:12">Matthew 15:12</span>). They were stumbling themselves and did not know how to answer the Pharisees. Jesus charges the disciples with intellectual dulness and spiritual stupidity. </p>
