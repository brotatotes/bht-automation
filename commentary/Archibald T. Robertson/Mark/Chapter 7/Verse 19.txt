<p><b> Making all meats clean </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαριζων παντα τα βρωματα</span></span>). This anacoluthon can be understood by repeating</p>
<p><b>he says </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγε</span></span>) from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:18">Mark 7:18</span>. The masculine participle agrees with Jesus, the speaker. The words do not come from Jesus, but are added by Mark. Peter reports this item to Mark, probably with a vivid recollection of his own experience on the housetop in Joppa when in the vision Peter declined three times the Lord's invitation to kill and eat unclean animals (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:14-16">Acts 10:14-16</span>). It was a riddle to Peter as late as that day. "Christ asserts that <i>Levitical</i> uncleanness, such as eating with unwashed hands, is of small importance compared with <i>moral</i> uncleanness" (Vincent). The two chief words in both incidents, here and in Acts, are</p>
<p><b>defile </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινοω</span></span>) and</p>
<p><b>cleanse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθαριζω</span></span>). "What God cleansed do not thou treat as defiled" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:15">Acts 10:15</span>). It was a revolutionary declaration by Jesus and Peter was slow to understand it even after the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. Jesus was amply justified in his astonished question:</p>
<p><b>Perceive ye not? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου νοειτε;</span></span>). They were making little use of their intelligence in trying to comprehend the efforts of Jesus to give them a new and true spiritual insight. </p>
