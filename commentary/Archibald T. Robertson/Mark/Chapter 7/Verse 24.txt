<p><b> Into the borders of Tyre and Sidon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τα ορια Τυρου κα Σιδωνος</span></span>). The departure from Capernaum was a withdrawal from Galilee, the second of the four withdrawals from Galilee. The first had been to the region of Bethsaida Julias in the territory of Herod Philip. This is into distinctly heathen land. It was not merely the edge of Phoenicia, but into the parts of Tyre and Sidon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:21">Matthew 15:21</span>). There was too much excitement among the people, too much bitterness among the Pharisees, too much suspicion on the part of Herod Antipas, too much dulness on the part of the disciples for Jesus to remain in Galilee.</p>
<p><b>And he could not be hid </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκ ηδυνασθη λαθειν</span></span>). Jesus wanted to be alone in the house after all the strain in Galilee. He craved a little privacy and rest. This was his purpose in going into Phoenicia. Note the adversative sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> here= "but." </p>
