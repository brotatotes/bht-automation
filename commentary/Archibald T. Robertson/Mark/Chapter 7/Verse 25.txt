<p><b> Whose little daughter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ης το θυγατριον αυτης</span></span>). Diminutive with tender touch. Note "whose" and "her" like vernacular today.</p>
<p><b>Having heard of him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουσασα περ αυτου</span></span>). Even in this heathen territory the fame of Jesus was known. When the Sermon on the Mount was preached people were there from "the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:17">Luke 6:17</span>). </p>
