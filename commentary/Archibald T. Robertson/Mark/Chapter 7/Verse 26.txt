<p><b> A Greek, a Syro-Phoenician by race </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hελληνισ, Συροφοινικισσα τω γενε</span></span>). "A Greek in religion, a Syrian in tongue, a Phoenician in race" (Bruce), from Euthymius Zigabenus. She was not a Phoenician of Carthage.</p>
<p><b>She besought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρωτα</span></span>). Imperfect tense. She kept at it. This verb, as in late Greek, is here used for a request, not a mere question. Abundant examples in the papyri in this sense. </p>
