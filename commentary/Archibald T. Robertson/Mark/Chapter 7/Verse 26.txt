 A Greek, a Syro-Phoenician by race  (Hελληνισ, Συροφοινικισσα τω γενε). "A Greek in religion, a Syrian in tongue, a Phoenician in race" (Bruce), from Euthymius Zigabenus. She was not a Phoenician of Carthage.She besought  (ηρωτα). Imperfect tense. She kept at it. This verb, as in late Greek, is here used for a request, not a mere question. Abundant examples in the papyri in this sense.
