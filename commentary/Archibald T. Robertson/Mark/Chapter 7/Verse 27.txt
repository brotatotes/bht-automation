 Let the children first be filled  (αφες πρωτον χορτασθηνα τα παιδια). The Jews had the first claim. See the command of Jesus in the third tour of Galilee to avoid the Gentiles and the Samaritans (Matthew 10:5). Paul was the Apostle to the Gentiles, but he gave the Jew the first opportunity (Romans 2:9). See on Matthew 15:24.
