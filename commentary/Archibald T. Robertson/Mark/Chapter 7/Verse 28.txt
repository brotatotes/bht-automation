<p><b> Even the dogs under the table </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τα κυναρια υποκατω της τραπεζης</span></span>). A delightful picture. Even the little dogs (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυναρια</span></span>) under the table</p>

Little dogs, little scraps of bread (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψιχιον</span></span>, diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψιχος</span></span>, <i>morsel</i>), little children (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδια</span></span>, diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παις</span></span>). Probably the little children purposely dropped a few little crumbs for the little dogs. These household dogs, pets of and loved by the children. <i>Braid Scots</i> has it: "Yet the wee dowgs aneath the table eat o' the moole o' the bairns." "A unique combination of faith and wit" (Gould). Instead of resenting Christ's words about giving the children's bread to the dogs (Gentiles) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:27">Mark 7:27</span>, she instantly turned it to the advantage of her plea for her little daughter. </p>
