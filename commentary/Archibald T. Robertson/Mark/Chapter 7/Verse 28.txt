 Even the dogs under the table  (κα τα κυναρια υποκατω της τραπεζης). A delightful picture. Even the little dogs (κυναρια) under the tableeat of the children's crumbs  (εσθιουσιν απο των ψιχιων των παιδιων). Little dogs, little scraps of bread (ψιχιον, diminutive of ψιχος, morsel), little children (παιδια, diminutive of παις). Probably the little children purposely dropped a few little crumbs for the little dogs. These household dogs, pets of and loved by the children. Braid Scots has it: "Yet the wee dowgs aneath the table eat o' the moole o' the bairns." "A unique combination of faith and wit" (Gould). Instead of resenting Christ's words about giving the children's bread to the dogs (Gentiles) in verse Mark 7:27, she instantly turned it to the advantage of her plea for her little daughter.
