<p><b> Through the midst of the borders of Decapolis </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα μεσον των οριων Δεκαπολεως</span></span>). Jesus left Phoenicia, but did not go back into Galilee. He rather went east and came down east of the Sea of Galilee into the region of the Greek cities of Decapolis. He thus kept out of the territory of Herod Antipas. He had been in this region when he healed the Gadarene demoniac and was asked to leave. </p>
