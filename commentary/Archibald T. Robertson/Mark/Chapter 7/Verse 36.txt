The command not to tell provoked these people to tell just as the leper had done (Mark 1:44). The more Jesus commanded (οσον αυτοις διεστελλετο) them not to tell the more they told. It was a continuous performance. Prohibitions always affect some people that way, especially superficial and light-headed folks. But we have to have prohibitions or anarchy.
