<p><b> So much the more a great deal they published it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτο μαλλον περισσοτερον εκηρυσσον</span></span>). Imperfect tense, continued action. Double comparative as occurs elsewhere for emphasis as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span> "much more better" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλω μαλλον κρεισσον</span></span>). See Robertson's <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 663f. Human nature is a peculiar thing. The command not to tell provoked these people to tell just as the leper had done (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:44">Mark 1:44</span>). The more Jesus commanded (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσον αυτοις διεστελλετο</span></span>) them not to tell the more they told. It was a continuous performance. Prohibitions always affect some people that way, especially superficial and light-headed folks. But we have to have prohibitions or anarchy. </p>
