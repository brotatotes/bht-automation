<p><b> From the marketplace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' αγορας</span></span>). Ceremonial defilement was inevitable in the mixing with men in public. This <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγορα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγειρω</span></span> to collect or gather, was a public forum in every town where the people gathered like the courthouse square in American towns. The disciples were already ceremonially defiled.</p>
<p><b>Wash themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισωντα</span></span>). First aorist middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτιζω</span></span>, dip or immerse. Westcott and Hort put <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραντισωντα</span></span> in the text translated "sprinkle themselves" in the margin of the Revised Version, because Aleph, B, and some of the best cursives have it. Gould terms <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραντισωντα</span></span> "a manifest emendation," to get rid of the difficulty of dipping or bathing the whole body. Meyer says: "The statement proceeds by way of climax: before eating they wash the hands always. When they come from market they take a bath before eating." This is not the place to enter into any controversy about the meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτιζω</span></span>, to dip, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραντιζω</span></span>, to sprinkle, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχχεω</span></span>, to pour, all used in the New Testament. The words have their distinctive meanings here as elsewhere. Some scribes felt a difficulty about the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισωντα</span></span> here. The Western and Syrian classes of manuscripts add "and couches" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα κλινων</span></span>) at the end of the sentence. Swete considers the immersions of beds (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισμους κλινων</span></span>) "an incongruous combination." But Gould says: "Edersheim shows that the Jewish ordinance required immersions, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισμους</span></span>, of these vessels." We must let the Jewish scrupulosity stand for itself, though "and couches" is not supported by Aleph, B L D Bohairic, probably not genuine. </p>
