<p><b> Ye leave the commandment of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεντες την εντολην του θεου</span></span>). Note the sharp contrast between the command of God and the traditions of men. Jesus here drives a keen wedge into the Pharisaic contention. They had covered up the Word of God with their oral teaching. Jesus here shows that they care more for the oral teaching of the scribes and elders than for the written law of God. The Talmud gives abundant and specific confirmation of the truthfulness of this indictment. </p>
