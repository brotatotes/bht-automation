 Into the parts of Dalmanutha  (εις τα μερη Δαλμανουθα). Matthew 15:39 calls it "the borders of Magadan." Both names are unknown elsewhere, but apparently the same region of Galilee on the western side of the lake not far from Tiberias. Mark here uses "parts" (μερη) in the same sense as "borders" (ορια) in Mark 7:24 just as Matthew reverses it with "parts" in Matthew 15:21 and "borders" here in Matthew 15:39. Mark has here "with his disciples" (μετα των μαθητων αυτου) only implied in Matthew 15:39.
