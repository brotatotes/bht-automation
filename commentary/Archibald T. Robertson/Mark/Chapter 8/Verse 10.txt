<p><b> Into the parts of Dalmanutha </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τα μερη Δαλμανουθα</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:39">Matthew 15:39</span> calls it "the borders of Magadan." Both names are unknown elsewhere, but apparently the same region of Galilee on the western side of the lake not far from Tiberias. Mark here uses "parts" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μερη</span></span>) in the same sense as "borders" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορια</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:24">Mark 7:24</span> just as Matthew reverses it with "parts" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:21">Matthew 15:21</span> and "borders" here in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:39">Matthew 15:39</span>. Mark has here "with his disciples" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα των μαθητων αυτου</span></span>) only implied in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:39">Matthew 15:39</span>. </p>
