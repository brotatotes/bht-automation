<p><b> Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hορατε, βλεπετε απο της ζυμης των Φαρισαιων κα της ζυμης Hηρωιδου</span></span>). Present imperatives. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> and the ablative case. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ζυμη</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζυμοω</span></span> and occurs already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:33">Matthew 13:33</span> in a good sense. For the bad sense see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:6">1 Corinthians 5:6</span>. He repeatedly charged (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεστελλετο</span></span>, imperfect indicative), showing that the warning was needed. The disciples came out of a Pharisaic atmosphere and they had just met it again at Dalmanutha. It was insidious. Note the combination of Herod here with the Pharisees. This is after the agitation of Herod because of the death of the Baptist and the ministry of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:14-29">Mark 6:14-29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:1-12">Matthew 14:1-12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:7-9">Luke 9:7-9</span>). Jesus definitely warns the disciples against "the leaven of Herod" (bad politics) and the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees (bad theology and also bad politics). </p>
