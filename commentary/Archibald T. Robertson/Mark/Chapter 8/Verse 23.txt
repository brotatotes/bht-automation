<p><b> Brought him out of the village </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξηνεγκεν αυτον εξω της κωμης</span></span>). It had been a village, but Philip had enlarged it and made it a town or city (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολις</span></span>), though still called a village (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:23">Mark 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:26">Mark 8:26</span>). As in the case of the deaf and dumb demoniac given also alone by Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:31-37">Mark 7:31-37</span>), so here Jesus observes the utmost secrecy in performing the miracle for reasons not given by Mark. It was the season of retirement and Jesus is making the fourth withdrawal from Galilee. That fact may explain it. The various touches here are of interest also. Jesus led him out by the hand, put spittle on his eyes (using the poetical and <i>Koine</i> papyri word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομματα</span></span> instead of the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπθαλμους</span></span>), and laid his hands upon him, perhaps all this to help the man's faith. </p>
