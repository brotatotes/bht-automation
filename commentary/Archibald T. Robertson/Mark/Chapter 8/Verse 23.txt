 Brought him out of the village  (εξηνεγκεν αυτον εξω της κωμης). It had been a village, but Philip had enlarged it and made it a town or city (πολις), though still called a village (verses Mark 8:23; Mark 8:26). As in the case of the deaf and dumb demoniac given also alone by Mark (Mark 7:31-37), so here Jesus observes the utmost secrecy in performing the miracle for reasons not given by Mark. It was the season of retirement and Jesus is making the fourth withdrawal from Galilee. That fact may explain it. The various touches here are of interest also. Jesus led him out by the hand, put spittle on his eyes (using the poetical and Koine papyri word ομματα instead of the usual οπθαλμους), and laid his hands upon him, perhaps all this to help the man's faith.
