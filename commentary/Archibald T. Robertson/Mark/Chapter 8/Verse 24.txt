 I see men, for I behold them as trees walking  (Βλεπω τους ανθρωπους οτ ως δενδρα ορω περιπατουντας). A vivid description of dawning sight. His vision was incomplete though he could tell that they were men because they were walking. This is the single case of a gradual cure in the healings wrought by Jesus. The reason for this method in this case is not given.
