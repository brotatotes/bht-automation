<p><b> I see men, for I behold them as trees walking </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βλεπω τους ανθρωπους οτ ως δενδρα ορω περιπατουντας</span></span>). A vivid description of dawning sight. His vision was incomplete though he could tell that they were men because they were walking. This is the single case of a gradual cure in the healings wrought by Jesus. The reason for this method in this case is not given. </p>
