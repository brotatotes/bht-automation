<p><b> Into the villages of Caesarea Philippi </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τας κωμας Καισαριας της Φιλιππου</span></span>). Parts (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μερη</span></span>) <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:13">Matthew 16:13</span> has, the Caesarea of Philippi in contrast to the one down on the Mediterranean Sea. Mark means the villages belonging to the district around Caesarea Philippi. This region is on a spur of Mount Hermon in Iturea ruled by Herod Philip so that Jesus is safe from annoyance by Herod Antipas or the Pharisees and Sadducees. Up here on this mountain slope Jesus will have his best opportunity to give the disciples special teaching concerning the crucifixion just a little over six months ahead.

<p><b>Who do men say that I am? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τινα με λεγουσιν ο ανθρωπο ειναι;</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:13">Matthew 16:13</span> has "the Son of Man" in place of "I" here in Mark and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:18">Luke 9:18</span>. He often described himself as "the Son of Man." Certainly here the phrase could not mean merely "a man." They knew the various popular opinions about Jesus of which Herod Antipas had heard (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:21">Mark 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:31">Mark 3:31</span>). It was time that the disciples reveal how much they had been influenced by their environment as well as by the direct instruction of Jesus. </p>
