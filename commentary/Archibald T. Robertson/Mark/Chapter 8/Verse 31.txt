They had to be told soon about the approaching death of Jesus. The confession of faith in Jesus indicated that it was a good time to begin.

Matthew 16:21 has "the third day" (τη τριτη ημερα) in the locative case of point of time (so also Luke 9:22).

In popular language "after three days" can and often does mean "on the third day," but the fourth day is impossible.
