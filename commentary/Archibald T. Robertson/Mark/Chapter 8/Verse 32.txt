<p><b> Spake the saying openly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρρησια τον λογον ελαλε</span></span>). He held back nothing, told it all (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν</span></span>, all, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρησια</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπον</span></span>, say), without reserve, to all of them. Imperfect tense <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλε</span></span> shows that Jesus did it repeatedly. Mark alone gives this item. Mark does not give the great eulogy of Peter in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:17">Matthew 16:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span> after his confession (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:29">Mark 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:16">Matthew 16:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:20">Luke 9:20</span>), but he does tell the stinging rebuke given Peter by Jesus on this occasion. See discussion on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:26">Matthew 16:26</span>. </p>
