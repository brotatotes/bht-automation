<p><b> And the gospel's sake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα του ευαγγελιου</span></span>). In Mark alone. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span> for this paradox. Two senses of "life" and "save." For the last "save" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωσε</span></span>) <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span> has "find" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρησε</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:26">Matthew 16:26</span> for "gain," "profit," and "exchange." </p>
