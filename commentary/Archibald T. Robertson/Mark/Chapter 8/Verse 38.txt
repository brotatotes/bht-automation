<p><b> For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my words </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος γαρ εαν επαισχυνθη με κα τους εμους λογους</span></span>). More exactly,</p>
<p><b>whosoever is ashamed </b> (first aorist passive subjunctive with indefinite relative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν = αν</span></span>. See Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 957-9. It is not a statement about the future conduct of one, but about his present attitude toward Jesus. The conduct of men toward Christ now determines Christ's conduct then (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαισχυνθησετα</span></span>, first future passive indicative). This passive verb is transitive and uses the accusative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με, αυτον</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>In this adulterous and sinful generation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη γενεα ταυτη τη μοιχαλιδ κα αμαρτωλω</span></span>). Only in Mark.</p>
<p><b>When he cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν ελθη</span></span>). Aorist active subjunctive with reference to the future second coming of Christ with the glory of the Father with his holy angels (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27">Matthew 16:27</span>). This is a clear prediction of the final eschatological coming of Christ. This verse could not be separated from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:1">Mark 9:1</span> as the chapter division does. These two verses in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:38">Mark 8:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:1">Mark 9:1</span> form one paragraph and should go together. </p>
