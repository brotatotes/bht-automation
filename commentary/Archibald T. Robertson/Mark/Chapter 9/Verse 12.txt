<p><b> Restoreth all things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκατιστανε παντα</span></span>). This late double compound verb, usual form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαθιστημ</span></span> in the papyri, is Christ's description of the Baptist as the promised Elijah and Forerunner of the Messiah. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:10-13">Matthew 17:10-13</span>. The disciples had not till now understood that the Baptist fulfilled the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:5">Malachi 3:5</span>. They had just seen Elijah on the mountain, but Jesus as Messiah preceded this coming of Elijah. But Jesus patiently enlightens his dull pupils as they argue about the exegesis of the scribes. </p>
