<p><b> And scribes questioning with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα γραμματεις συνζητουντες προς αυτους</span></span>). Mark alone gives this item. He is much fuller on this incident (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:14-29">Mark 9:14-29</span>) than either Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:14-20">Matthew 17:14-20</span>) or Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:37-43">Luke 9:37-43</span>). It was just like the professional scribes to take keen interest in the failure of the nine disciples to cure this poor boy. They gleefully nagged and quizzed them. Jesus and the three find them at it when they arrive in the plain. </p>
