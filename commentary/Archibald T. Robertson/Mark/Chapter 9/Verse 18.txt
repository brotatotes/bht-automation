<p><b> Wheresoever it taketh him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου εαν αυτον καταλαβη</span></span>). Seizes him down. Our word catalepsy is this same word. The word is used by Galen and Hippocrates for fits. The word is very common in the papyri in various senses as in the older Greek. Each of the verbs here in Mark is a graphic picture.</p>
<p><b>Dashes down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρησσε</span></span>). Also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρηγνυμι, μ</span></span> form. Convulses, rends, tears asunder. Old and common word.</p>
<p><b>Foameth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφριζε</span></span>). Here only in the N.T. Poetic and late word.</p>
<p><b>Grindeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τριζε</span></span>). Another <i>hapax legomenon</i> in the N.T. Old word for making a shrill cry or squeak.</p>
<p><b>Pineth away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξηραινετα</span></span>). Old word for drying or withering as of grass in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:11">James 1:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>And they were not able </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκ ισχυσαν</span></span>). They did not have the strength (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυς</span></span>) to handle this case. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:16">Matthew 17:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:40">Luke 9:40</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκ ηδυνηθησαν</span></span>, first aorist passive). It was a tragedy. </p>
