<p><b> But if thou canst </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ 'ε τ δυνη</span></span>). Jesus had asked (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:21">Mark 9:21</span>) the history of the case like a modern physician.

With touching tenderness he makes the boy's case his own as the Syrophoenician woman had said, "Have mercy on me" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:21">Matthew 15:21</span>). The leper had said: "If thou wilt" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:40">Mark 1:40</span>). This father says: "If thou canst." </p>
