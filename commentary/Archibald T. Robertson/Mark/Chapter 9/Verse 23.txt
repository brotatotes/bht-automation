<p><b> If thou canst </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ε δυνη</span></span>). The Greek has a neat idiom not preserved in the English translation. The article takes up the very words of the man and puts the clause in the accusative case of general reference. "As to the 'if thou canst,' all things can (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνατα</span></span>) to the one who believes." The word for "possible" is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνατα</span></span>, the same root as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυνη</span></span> (canst). This quick turn challenges the father's faith. On this use of the Greek article see Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 766. </p>
