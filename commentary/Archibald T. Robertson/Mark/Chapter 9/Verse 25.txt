<p><b> A multitude came running together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισυντρεχε οχλος</span></span>). A double compound here alone in the N.T. and not in the old Greek writers. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Επιτρεχω</span></span> occurs in the papyri, but not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισυντρεχω</span></span>. The double compound vividly describes the rapid gathering of the crowd to Jesus and the epileptic boy to see the outcome.</p>
<p><b>Come out of him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξελθε εξ αυτου</span></span>). Jesus addresses the demon as a separate being from the boy as he often does. This makes it difficult to believe that Jesus was merely indulging popular belief in a superstition. He evidently regards the demon as the cause in this case of the boy's misfortune. </p>
