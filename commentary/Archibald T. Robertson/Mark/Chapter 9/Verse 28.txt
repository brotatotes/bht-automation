<p><b> Privately, saying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ' ιδιαν οτ</span></span>). Indoors the nine disciples seek an explanation for their colossal failure. They had cast out demons and wrought cures before. The Revisers are here puzzled over Mark's use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> as an interrogative particle meaning</p>
<p><b>why </b> where <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:19">Matthew 17:19</span> has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τ</span></span>. Some of the manuscripts have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τ</span></span> here in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:28">Mark 9:28</span> as all do in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:19">Matthew 17:19</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:16">Mark 2:16</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:11">Mark 9:11</span>. It is probable that in these examples <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> really means</p>
<p><b>why </b>. See Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 730. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span> as interrogative "is by no means rare in the late Greek" (Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 126). </p>
