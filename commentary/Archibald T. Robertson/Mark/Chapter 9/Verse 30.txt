<p><b> He would not that any man should know it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ηθελεν ινα τις γνο</span></span>). Imperfect tense followed by ingressive aorist subjunctive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνο = γνω</span></span>, the usual form). He was not willing that any one should learn it. Back in Galilee Jesus was, but he was avoiding public work there now (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:24">Mark 7:24</span>). He was no longer the hero of Galilee. He had left Caesarea Philippi for Galilee. </p>
