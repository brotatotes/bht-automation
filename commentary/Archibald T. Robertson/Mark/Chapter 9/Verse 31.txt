He was renewing again definitely the prediction of his death in Jerusalem some six months ahead as he had done before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:31">Mark 8:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:22">Luke 9:22</span>).
