<p><b> But they understood not the saying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε ηγνοουν το ρημα</span></span>). An old word. Chiefly in Paul's Epistles in the N.T. Imperfect tense. They continued not to understand. They were agnostics on the subject of the death and resurrection even after the Transfiguration experience. As they came down from the mountain they were puzzled again over the Master's allusion to his resurrection (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:10">Mark 9:10</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:23">Matthew 17:23</span> notes that "they were exceeding sorry" to hear Jesus talk this way again, but Mark adds that they "were afraid to ask him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφοβουντο αυτον επερωτησα</span></span>). Continued to be afraid (imperfect tense), perhaps with a bitter memory of the term "Satan" hurled at Peter when he protested the other time when Jesus spoke of his death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:33">Mark 8:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:23">Matthew 16:23</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:45">Luke 9:45</span> explains that "it was concealed from them," probably partly by their own preconceived ideas and prejudices. </p>
