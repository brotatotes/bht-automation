<p><b> He sat down and called the twelve </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθισας εφωνησεν τους δωδεκα</span></span>). Deliberate action of Jesus to handle this delicate situation. Jesus gives them the rule of greatness: "If any man would be first (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτος</span></span>) he shall be last (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσχατος</span></span>) of all, and minister (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονος</span></span>) of all." This saying of Christ, like many others, he repeated at other times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:43">Mark 10:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:8">Matthew 23:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:24">Luke 22:24</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:2">Matthew 18:2</span> says that he called a little child, one there in the house, perhaps Peter's child. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:47">Luke 9:47</span> notes that he "set him by his side." Then Jesus</p>
<p><b>taking him in his arms </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εναγκαλισαμενος</span></span>, aorist middle participle, late Greek word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγκαλη</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:28">Luke 2:28</span>) spoke again to the disciples. </p>
