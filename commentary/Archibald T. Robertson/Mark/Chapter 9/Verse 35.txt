 He sat down and called the twelve  (καθισας εφωνησεν τους δωδεκα). Deliberate action of Jesus to handle this delicate situation. Jesus gives them the rule of greatness: "If any man would be first (πρωτος) he shall be last (εσχατος) of all, and minister (διακονος) of all." This saying of Christ, like many others, he repeated at other times (Mark 10:43; Matthew 23:8; Luke 22:24). Matthew 18:2 says that he called a little child, one there in the house, perhaps Peter's child. Luke 9:47 notes that he "set him by his side." Then Jesustaking him in his arms  (εναγκαλισαμενος, aorist middle participle, late Greek word from αγκαλη as in Luke 2:28) spoke again to the disciples.
