<p><b> One of such little children </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν των τοιουτων παιδιων</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:5">Matthew 18:5</span> has "one such little child" and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:48">Luke 9:48</span> "this little child." It was an object lesson to the arrogant conceit of the twelve apostles contending for primacy. They did not learn this lesson for they will again wrangle over primacy (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:33-45">Mark 10:33-45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:20-28">Matthew 20:20-28</span>) and they will be unable to comprehend easily what the attitude of Jesus was toward children (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:13-16">Mark 10:13-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:13-15">Matthew 19:13-15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:15-17">Luke 8:15-17</span>). The child was used as a rebuke to the apostles. </p>
