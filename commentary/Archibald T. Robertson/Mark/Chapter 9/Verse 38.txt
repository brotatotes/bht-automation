<p><b> Because he followed not us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ ουκ ηκολουθε ημιν</span></span>). Note vivid imperfect tense again. John evidently thought to change the subject from the constraint and embarrassment caused by their dispute. So he told about a case of extra zeal on his part expecting praise from Jesus. Perhaps what Jesus had just said in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:37">Mark 9:37</span> raised a doubt in John's mind as to the propriety of his excessive narrowness. One needs to know the difference between loyalty to Jesus and stickling over one's own narrow prejudices. </p>
