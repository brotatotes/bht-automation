<p><b> He that is not against us is with us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος ουκ εστιν καθ' ημων υπερ ημων εστιν</span></span>). This profound saying throws a flood of light in every direction. The complement of this logion is that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:30">Matthew 12:30</span>: "He that is not with me is against me." Both are needed. Some people imagine that they are really for Christ who refuse to take a stand in the open with him and for him. </p>
