 He that is not against us is with us  (ος ουκ εστιν καθ' ημων υπερ ημων εστιν). This profound saying throws a flood of light in every direction. The complement of this logion is that in Matthew 12:30: "He that is not with me is against me." Both are needed. Some people imagine that they are really for Christ who refuse to take a stand in the open with him and for him.
