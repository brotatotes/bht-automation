<p><b> Because ye are Christ's </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ Χριστου εστε</span></span>). Predicate genitive, belong to Christ. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:7">2 Corinthians 10:7</span>. That is the bond of universal brotherhood of the redeemed. It breaks over the lines of nation, race, class, sex, everything. No service is too small, even a cup of cold water, if done for Christ's sake. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:6">Matthew 18:6</span> for discussion on stumbling-blocks for these little ones that believe on Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:42">Mark 9:42</span>), a loving term of all believers, not just children. </p>
