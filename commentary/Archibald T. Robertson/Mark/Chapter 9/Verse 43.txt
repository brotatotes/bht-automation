<p><b> Into hell, into the unquenchable fire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την γεενναν, εις το πυρ το ασβεστον</span></span>). Not Hades, but Gehenna. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ασβεστον</span></span> is alpha privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σβεστος</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σβεννυμ</span></span> to quench. It occurs often in Homer. Our word asbestos is this very word. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:8">Matthew 18:8</span> has "into the eternal fire." The Valley of Hinnom had been desecrated by the sacrifice of children to Moloch so that as an accursed place it was used for the city garbage where worms gnawed and fires burned. It is thus a vivid picture of eternal punishment. </p>
