<p>The oldest and best manuscripts do not give these two verses. They came in from the Western and Syrian (Byzantine) classes. They are a mere repetition of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:48">Mark 9:48</span>. Hence we lose the numbering 44 and 46 in our verses which are not genuine. </p>
