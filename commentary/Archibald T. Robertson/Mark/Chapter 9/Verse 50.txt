<p><b> Have salt in yourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχετε εν εαυτοις αλα</span></span>). Jesus had once called them the salt of the earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:13">Matthew 5:13</span>) and had warned them against losing the saltness of the salt. If it is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναλον</span></span>, nothing can</p>
<p><b>season </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτυω</span></span>) it and it is of no use to season anything else. It is like an exploded shell, a burnt-out crater, a spent force. This is a warning for all Christians. </p>
