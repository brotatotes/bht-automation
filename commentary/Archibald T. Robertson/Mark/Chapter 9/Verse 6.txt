<p><b> For he wist not what to answer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γαρ ηιδε τ αποκριθη</span></span>). Deliberative subjunctive retained in indirect question. But why did Peter say anything? Luke says that he spoke, "not knowing what he said," as an excuse for the inappropriateness of his remarks. Perhaps Peter felt embarrassed at having been asleep (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:32">Luke 9:32</span>) and the feast of tabernacles or booths (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνα</span></span>) was near. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:4">Matthew 17:4</span>. Peter and the others apparently had not heard the talk of Moses and Elijah with Jesus about his decease (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξοδον</span></span>, exodus, departure) and little knew the special comfort that Jesus had found in this understanding of the great approaching tragedy concerning which Peter had shown absolute stupidity (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:32">Mark 8:32</span>) so recently. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:5">Matthew 17:5</span> about the overshadowing and the voice. </p>
