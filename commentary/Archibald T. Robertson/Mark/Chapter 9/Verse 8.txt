<p><b> Suddenly looking round about </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαπινα περιβλεψαμενο</span></span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:8">Matthew 17:8</span> has it "lifting up their eyes." Mark is more graphic. The sudden glance around on the mountain side when the cloud with Moses and Elijah was gone.</p>
<p><b>Jesus only with themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθ' εαυτων ε μη Ιησουν μονον</span></span>). Mark shows their surprise at the situation. They were sore afraid (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:6">Matthew 17:6</span>) before Jesus touched them. </p>
