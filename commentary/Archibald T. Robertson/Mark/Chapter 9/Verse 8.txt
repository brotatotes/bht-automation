 Suddenly looking round about  (εξαπινα περιβλεψαμενο). Matthew 17:8 has it "lifting up their eyes." Mark is more graphic. The sudden glance around on the mountain side when the cloud with Moses and Elijah was gone.Jesus only with themselves  (μεθ' εαυτων ε μη Ιησουν μονον). Mark shows their surprise at the situation. They were sore afraid (Matthew 17:6) before Jesus touched them.
