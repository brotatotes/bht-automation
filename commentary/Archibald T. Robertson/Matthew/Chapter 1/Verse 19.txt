<p><b> A Righteous Man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιος</span></span>). Or just, not benignant or merciful. The same adjective is used of Zacharias and Elizabeth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:6">Luke 1:6</span>) and Simeon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:25">Luke 2:25</span>). "An upright man," the <i>Braid Scots</i> has it. He had the Jewish conscientiousness for the observance of the law which would have been death by stoning (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+22:23">Deuteronomy 22:23</span>). Though Joseph was upright, he would not do that. "As a good Jew he would have shown his zeal if he had branded her with public disgrace" (McNeile).</p>
<p><b> And yet not willing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μη θελων</span></span>). So we must understand <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> here, "and yet." Matthew makes a distinction here between "willing" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελων</span></span>) and "wishing" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβουληθη</span></span>), that between purpose (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω</span></span>) and desire (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλομα</span></span>) a distinction not always drawn, though present here. It was not his purpose to "make her a public example" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειγματισα</span></span>), from the root (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεικνυμ</span></span> to show), a rare word (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>). The Latin Vulgate has it <i>traducere</i>, the Old Latin <i>divulgare</i>, Wycliff <i>pupplische</i> (publish), Tyndale <i>defame</i>, Moffatt <i>disgrace</i>, Braid Scots "Be i the mooth o' the public." The substantive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειγματισμος</span></span>) occurs on the Rosetta Stone in the sense of "verification." There are a few instances of the verb in the papyri though the meaning is not clear (Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>). The compound form appears (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδειγματιζω</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:6">Hebrews 6:6</span> and there are earlier instances of this compound than of the uncompounded, curiously enough. But new examples of the simple verb, like the substantive, may yet be found. The papyri examples mean to furnish a sample (P Tebt. 5.75), to make trial of (P Ryl. I. 28.32). The substantive means exposure in (P Ryl. I. 28.70). At any rate it is clear that Joseph "was minded to put her away privily." He could give her a bill of divorcement (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολυσα</span></span>), the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γητ</span></span> laid down in the Mishna, without a public trial. He had to give her the writ (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γητ</span></span>) and pay the fine (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+24:1">Deuteronomy 24:1</span>). So he proposed to do this privately (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαθρα</span></span>) to avoid all the scandal possible. One is obliged to respect and sympathize with the motives of Joseph for he evidently loved Mary and was appalled to find her untrue to him as he supposed. It is impossible to think of Joseph as the actual father of Jesus according to the narrative of Matthew without saying that Matthew has tried by legend to cover up the illegitimate birth of Jesus. The Talmud openly charges this sin against Mary. Joseph had "a short but tragic struggle between his legal conscience and his love" (McNeile). </p>
