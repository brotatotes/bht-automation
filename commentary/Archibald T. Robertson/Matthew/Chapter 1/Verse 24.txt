<p><b> Took unto him his wife </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρελαβεν την γυναικα αυτου</span></span>). The angel had told him not to be afraid to "take to his side" Mary his wife (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:20">Matthew 1:20</span>). So when he awoke from his sleep he promptly obeyed the angel and "took his wife home" (Moffatt). One can only imagine the relief and joy of Mary when Joseph nobly rose to his high duty toward her. I have tried to sketch Mary's problems in <i>Mary the Mother of Jesus: Her Problems and Her Glory.</i> </p>
