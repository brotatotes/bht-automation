<p><b> No wallet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη πηραν</span></span>). Better than "scrip." It can be either a travelling or bread bag. Deissmann (<i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, pp. 108f.) shows that it can mean the beggar's collecting bag as in an inscription on a monument at Kefr Hanar in Syria: "While Christianity was still young the beggar priest was making his rounds in the land of Syria on behalf of the national goddess." Deissmann also quotes a pun in the <i>Didaskalia=Const. Apost</i>. 3, 6 about some itinerant widows who said that they were not so much <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χηρα</span></span> (spouseless) as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πηρα</span></span> (pouchless). He cites also Shakespeare, <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> III. iii. 145: "Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back, wherein he puts alms for oblivion."</p>
<p><b>For the labourer is worthy of his food </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιος γαρ ο εργατης της τροφης αυτου</span></span>). The sermon is worth the dinner, in other words. Luke in the charge to the seventy (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:7">Luke 10:7</span>) has the same words with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισθου</span></span> (reward) instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τροφης</span></span> (food). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:18">1 Timothy 5:18</span> Paul quotes Luke's form as scripture (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η γραφη</span></span>) or as a well-known saying if confined to the first quotation. The word for workman here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργατης</span></span>) is that used by Jesus in the prayer for labourers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:38">Matthew 9:38</span>). The well-known <i>Didach</i> or <i>Teaching of the Twelve</i> (xiii) shows that in the second century there was still a felt need for care on the subject of receiving pay for preaching. The travelling sophists added also to the embarrassment of the situation. The wisdom of these restrictions was justified in Galilee at this time. Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:6-13">Mark 6:6-13</span>) and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:1-6">Luke 9:1-6</span>) vary slightly from Matthew in some of the details of the instructions of Jesus. </p>
