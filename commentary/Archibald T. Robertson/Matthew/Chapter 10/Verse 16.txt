<p><b> As sheep in the midst of wolves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως προβατα εν μεσω λυκων</span></span>). The presence of wolves on every hand was a fact then and now. Some of these very sheep (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:6">Matthew 10:6</span>) at the end will turn out to be wolves and cry for Christ's crucifixion. The situation called for consummate wisdom and courage. The serpent was the emblem of wisdom or shrewdness, intellectual keenness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:1">Genesis 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+58:5">Psalms 58:5</span>), the dove of simplicity (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ho+7:11">Hosea 7:11</span>). It was a proverb, this combination, but one difficult of realization. Either without the other is bad (rascality or gullibility). The first clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρνας</span></span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προβατα</span></span> is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:3">Luke 10:3</span> and apparently is in a <i>Fragment of a Lost Gospel</i> edited by Grenfell and Hunt. The combination of wariness and innocence is necessary for the protection of the sheep and the discomfiture of the wolves. For "harmless" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακεραιο</span></span>) Moffatt and Goodspeed have "guileless," Weymouth "innocent." The word means "unmixed" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεραννυμ</span></span>), "unadulterated," "simple," "unalloyed." </p>
