<p><b> Beelzebub </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεεζεβουλ</span></span> according to B, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεελζεβουλ</span></span> by most Greek MSS., <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεελζεβουβ</span></span> by many non-Greek MSS.). The etymology of the word is also unknown, whether "lord of a dwelling" with a pun on "the master of the house" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδεσποτην</span></span>) or "lord of flies" or "lord of dung" or "lord of idolatrous sacrifices." It is evidently a term of reproach. "An opprobrious epithet; exact form of the word and meaning of the name have given more trouble to commentators than it is all worth" (Bruce). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:24">Matthew 12:24</span>. </p>
