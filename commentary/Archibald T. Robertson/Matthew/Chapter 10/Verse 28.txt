<p><b> Destroy both soul and body in hell </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ψυχην κα σωμα απολεσα εν γεεννη</span></span>). Note "soul" here of the eternal spirit, not just life in the body. "Destroy" here is not annihilation, but eternal punishment in Gehenna (the real hell) for which see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:22">Matthew 5:22</span>. Bruce thinks that the devil as the tempter is here meant, not God as the judge, but surely he is wrong. There is no more needed lesson today than the fear of God. </p>
