 Shall confess me  (ομολογησε εν εμο). An Aramaic idiom, not Hebrew, see also Luke 12:8. So also here, "him will I also confess" (ομολογησω κ'αγω εν αυτω). Literally this Aramaic idiom reproduced in the Greek means "confess in me," indicating a sense of unity with Christ and of Christ with the man who takes the open stand for him.
