<p><b> Shall confess me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογησε εν εμο</span></span>). An Aramaic idiom, not Hebrew, see also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:8">Luke 12:8</span>. So also here, "him will I also confess" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογησω κ'αγω εν αυτω</span></span>). Literally this Aramaic idiom reproduced in the Greek means "confess in me," indicating a sense of unity with Christ and of Christ with the man who takes the open stand for him. </p>
