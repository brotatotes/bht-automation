<p><b> Shall deny me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρνησητα με</span></span>). Aorist subjunctive here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οστις</span></span>, though future indicative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογησε</span></span> above. Note accusative here (case of extension), saying "no" to Christ, complete breach. This is a solemn law, not a mere social breach, this cleavage by Christ of the man who repudiates him, public and final. </p>
