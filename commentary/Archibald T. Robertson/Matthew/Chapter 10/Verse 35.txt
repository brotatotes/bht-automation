<p><b> Set at variance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διχασα</span></span>). Literally divide in two, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διχα</span></span>. Jesus uses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mic+7:1-6">Micah 7:1-6</span> to describe the rottenness of the age as Micah had done. Family ties and social ties cannot stand in the way of loyalty to Christ and righteous living.</p>
<p><b>The daughter-in-law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυμφην</span></span>). Literally bride, the young wife who is possibly living with the mother-in-law. It is a tragedy to see a father or mother step between the child and Christ. </p>
