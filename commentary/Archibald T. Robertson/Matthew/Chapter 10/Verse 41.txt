<p><b> In the name of a prophet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ονομα προφητου</span></span>). "Because he is a prophet" (Moffatt). In an Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 37 (A.D. 49) we find <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονοματ ελευθερου</span></span> in virtue of being free-born. "He that receiveth a prophet from no ulterior motive, but simply <i>qua</i> prophet (<i>ut prophetam</i>, Jer.) would receive a reward in the coming age equal to that of his guest" (McNeile). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> here is to be noted. In reality <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> is simply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> with the same meaning. It is not proper to say that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> has always to be translated "into." Besides these examples of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ονομα</span></span> in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:41">Matthew 10:41</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:43">Matthew 10:43</span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:41">Matthew 12:41</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το κηρυγμα Ιωνα</span></span> (see Robertson's <i>Grammar</i>, p. 593).</p>
<p><b>Unto one of these little ones </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενα των μικρων τουτων</span></span>). Simple believers who are neither apostles, prophets, or particularly righteous, just "learners," "in the name of a disciple" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ονομα μαθητου</span></span>). Alford thinks that some children were present (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:2-6">Matthew 18:2-6</span>). </p>
