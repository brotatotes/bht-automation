<p><b> These twelve Jesus sent forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτους τους δωδεκα απεστειλεν ο Ιησους</span></span>). The word "sent forth" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστειλεν</span></span>) is the same root as "apostles." The same word reappears in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:16">Matthew 10:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>Way of the Gentiles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδον εθνων</span></span>). Objective genitive, way leading to the Gentiles. This prohibition against going among the Gentiles and the Samaritans was for this special tour. They were to give the Jews the first opportunity and not to prejudice the cause at this stage. Later Jesus will order them to go and disciple all the Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>). </p>
