<p><b> As ye go, preach </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορευομενο κηρυσσετε</span></span>). Present participle and present imperative. They were itinerant preachers on a "preaching tour," heralds (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυκες</span></span>) proclaiming good news. The summary message is the same as that of the Baptist (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>) that first startled the country, "the kingdom of heaven has drawn nigh." He echoed it up and down the Jordan Valley. They are to shake Galilee with it as Jesus had done (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:17">Matthew 4:17</span>). That same amazing message is needed today. But "the apprentice apostles" (Bruce) could tell not a little about the King of the Kingdom who was with them. </p>
