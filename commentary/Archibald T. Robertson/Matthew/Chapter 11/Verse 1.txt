 He departed thence to teach and preach  (μετεβη εκειθεν του διδασκειν κα κηρυσσειν). In five instances (Matthew 7:28; Matthew 11:1; Matthew 13:53; Matthew 19:1; Matthew 26:1) after great discourses by Jesus "the transition to what follows is made with the formula, 'And it came to pass when Jesus had ended'" (McNeile). This is a wrong chapter division, for Matthew 11:1 belongs with the preceding section. "Commanding" (διατασσων, complementary participle with ετελεσεν), means giving orders in detail (δια-) for each of them. Note both "teach and preach" as in Matthew 4:23. Where did Jesus go? Did he follow behind the twelve as he did with the seventy "whither he himself was about to come" (Luke 10:1)? Bruce holds with Chrysostom that Jesus avoided the places where they were, giving them room and time to do their work. But, if Jesus himself went to the chief cities of Galilee on this tour, he would be compelled to touch many of the same points. Jesus would naturally follow behind at some distance. At the end of the tour the apostles come together in Capernaum and tell Jesus all that they had done and that they had taught (Mark 6:30). Matthew follows the general outline of Mark, but the events are not grouped in chronological order here.
