<p><b> He departed thence to teach and preach </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετεβη εκειθεν του διδασκειν κα κηρυσσειν</span></span>). In five instances (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:28">Matthew 7:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:1">Matthew 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:53">Matthew 13:53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:1">Matthew 19:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:1">Matthew 26:1</span>) after great discourses by Jesus "the transition to what follows is made with the formula, 'And it came to pass when Jesus had ended'" (McNeile). This is a wrong chapter division, for <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:1">Matthew 11:1</span> belongs with the preceding section. </p>
<p>"<b>Commanding</b>" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διατασσων</span></span>, complementary participle with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετελεσεν</span></span>), means giving orders in detail (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια-</span></span>) for each of them. Note both "teach and preach" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23">Matthew 4:23</span>. Where did Jesus go? Did he follow behind the twelve as he did with the seventy "whither he himself was about to come" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:1">Luke 10:1</span>)? Bruce holds with Chrysostom that Jesus avoided the places where they were, giving them room and time to do their work. But, if Jesus himself went to the chief cities of Galilee on this tour, he would be compelled to touch many of the same points. Jesus would naturally follow behind at some distance. At the end of the tour the apostles come together in Capernaum and tell Jesus all that they had done and that they had taught (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:30">Mark 6:30</span>). Matthew follows the general outline of Mark, but the events are not grouped in chronological order here. </p>
