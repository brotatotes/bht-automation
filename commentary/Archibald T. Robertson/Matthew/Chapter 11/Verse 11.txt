<p><b> He that is but little </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μικροτερος</span></span>). The Authorized Version here has it better, "he that is least." The article with the comparative is a growing idiom in the vernacular <i>Koine</i> for the superlative as in the modern Greek it is the only idiom for the superlative (Robertson, <i>Grammar of the Greek N.T.</i>, p. 668). The papyri and inscriptions show the same construction. The paradox of Jesus has puzzled many. He surely means that John is greater (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζων</span></span>) than all others in character, but that the least in the kingdom of heaven surpasses him in privilege. John is the end of one age, "until John" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:14">Matthew 11:14</span>), and the beginning of the new era. All those that come after John stand upon his shoulders. John is the mountain peak between the old and the new. </p>
