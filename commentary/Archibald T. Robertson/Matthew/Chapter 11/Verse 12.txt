<p><b> Suffereth violence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιαζετα</span></span>). This verb occurs only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:16">Luke 16:16</span> in the N.T. It seems to be middle in Luke and Deissmann (<i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 258) quotes an inscription "where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιαζομα</span></span> is without doubt reflexive and absolute" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:16">Luke 16:16</span>. But there are numerous papyri examples where it is passive (Moulton and Milligan, <i>Vocabulary</i>, etc.) so that "there seems little that promises decisive help for the difficult Logion of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:12">Matthew 11:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:16">Luke 16:16</span>." So then in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:12">Matthew 11:12</span> the form can be either middle or passive and either makes sense, though a different sense. The passive idea is that the kingdom is forced, is stormed, is taken by men of violence like "men of violence take it by force" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιαστα αρπαζουσιν αυτην</span></span>) or seize it like a conquered city. The middle voice may mean "experiences violence" or "forces its way" like a rushing mighty wind (so Zahn holds). These difficult words of Jesus mean that the preaching of John "had led to a violent and impetuous thronging to gather round Jesus and his disciples" (Hort, <i>Judaistic Christianity</i>, p. 26). </p>
