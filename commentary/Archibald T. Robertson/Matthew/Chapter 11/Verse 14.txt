<p><b> This is Elijah </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος εστιν Ελειας</span></span>). Jesus here endorses John as the promise of Malachi. The people understood <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:1">Malachi 4:1</span> to mean the return of Elijah in person. This John denied as to himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:21">John 1:21</span>). But Jesus affirms that John is the Elijah of promise who has come already (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:12">Matthew 17:12</span>). He emphasizes the point: "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." </p>
