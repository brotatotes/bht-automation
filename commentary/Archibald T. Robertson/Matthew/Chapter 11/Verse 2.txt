<p><b> John heard in the prison </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε Ιωανης ακουσας εν τω δεσμωτηριω</span></span>). Probably (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:18">Luke 7:18</span>) the raising of the son of the widow of Nain. The word for prison here is the place where one was kept bound (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:21">Acts 5:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:23">Acts 5:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:26">Acts 16:26</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:12">Matthew 4:12</span>. It was in Machaerus east of the Dead Sea which at this time belonged to the rule of Herod Antipas (Jos. <i>Ant</i>. XVIII. v.2). John's disciples had access to him. So he sent word by (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυο</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:19">Luke 7:19</span>) them to Jesus. </p>
