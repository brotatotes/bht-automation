<p><b> Most of his mighty works </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α πλειστα δυναμεις αυτου</span></span>). Literally, "His very many mighty works" if elative as usual in the papyri (Moulton, <i>Prolegomena</i>, p. 79; Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 670). But the usual superlative makes sense here as the Canterbury translation has it. This word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις</span></span> for miracle presents the notion of <i>power</i> like our <i>dynamite</i>. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τερας</span></span> is wonder, portent, <i>miraculum</i> (miracle) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:19">Acts 2:19</span>. It occurs only in the plural and always with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημεια</span></span>. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον</span></span> means sign (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:38">Matthew 12:38</span>) and is very common in John's Gospel as well as the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργον</span></span> (work) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:36">John 5:36</span>. Other words used are <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδοξον</span></span>, our word <i>paradox</i>, strange (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:26">Luke 5:26</span>), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδοξον</span></span>, glorious (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:17">Luke 13:17</span>), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαυμασιον</span></span>, wonderful (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:15">Matthew 21:15</span>). </p>
