 Most of his mighty works  (α πλειστα δυναμεις αυτου). Literally, "His very many mighty works" if elative as usual in the papyri (Moulton, Prolegomena, p. 79; Robertson, Grammar, p. 670). But the usual superlative makes sense here as the Canterbury translation has it. This word δυναμις for miracle presents the notion of power like our dynamite. The word τερας is wonder, portent, miraculum (miracle) as in Acts 2:19. It occurs only in the plural and always with σημεια. The word σημειον means sign (Matthew 12:38) and is very common in John's Gospel as well as the word εργον (work) as in John 5:36. Other words used are παραδοξον, our word paradox, strange (Luke 5:26), ενδοξον, glorious (Luke 13:17), θαυμασιον, wonderful (Matthew 21:15).
