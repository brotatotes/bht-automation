<p><b> Chorazin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χοραζειν</span></span>). Mentioned only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:13">Luke 10:13</span>. Proof of "the meagreness of our knowledge of Judaism in the time of Christ" (Plummer) and of the many things not told in our Gospels (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:25">John 21:25</span>). We know something of Bethsaida and more about Capernaum as places of privilege. But (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλην</span></span>, howbeit) neither of these cities repented, changed their conduct. Note condition of the second class, determined as unfulfilled in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:21">Matthew 11:21</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:23">Matthew 11:23</span>. </p>
