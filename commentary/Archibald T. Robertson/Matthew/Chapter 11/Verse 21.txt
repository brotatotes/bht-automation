 Chorazin  (Χοραζειν). Mentioned only here and in Luke 10:13. Proof of "the meagreness of our knowledge of Judaism in the time of Christ" (Plummer) and of the many things not told in our Gospels (John 21:25). We know something of Bethsaida and more about Capernaum as places of privilege. But (πλην, howbeit) neither of these cities repented, changed their conduct. Note condition of the second class, determined as unfulfilled in verses Matthew 11:21 and Matthew 11:23.
