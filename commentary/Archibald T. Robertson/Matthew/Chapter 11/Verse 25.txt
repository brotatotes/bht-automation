<p><b> At that season Jesus answered and said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εκεινω τω καιρω αποκριθεις ειπεν</span></span>). Spoke to his Father in audible voice. The time and place we do not know. But here we catch a glimpse of Jesus in one of his moods of worship. "It is usual to call this golden utterance a prayer, but it is at once prayer, praise, and self-communing in a devout spirit" (Bruce). Critics are disturbed because this passage from the Logia of Jesus or Q of Synoptic criticism (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25-30">Matthew 11:25-30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21-24">Luke 10:21-24</span>) is so manifestly Johannine in spirit and very language, "the Father" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πατηρ</span></span>), "the son" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο υιος</span></span>), whereas the Fourth Gospel was not written till the close of the first century and the Logia was written before the Synoptic Gospels. The only satisfying explanation lies in the fact that Jesus did have this strain of teaching that is preserved in John's Gospel. Here he is in precisely the same mood of elevated communion with the Father that we have reflected in John 14 to 17. Even Harnack is disposed to accept this Logion as a genuine saying of Jesus. The word "thank" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογουμα</span></span>) is better rendered "praise" (Moffatt). Jesus praises the Father "not that the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σοφο</span></span> were ignorant, but that the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηπιο</span></span> knew" (McNeile). </p>
