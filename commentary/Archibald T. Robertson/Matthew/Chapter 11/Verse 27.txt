<p><b> All things have been delivered unto me of my Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα μο παρεδοθη υπο του πατρος μου</span></span>). This sublime claim is not to be whittled down or away by explanations. It is the timeless aorist like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοθη</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span> and "points back to a moment in eternity, and implies the pre-existence of the Messiah" (Plummer). The Messianic consciousness of Christ is here as clear as a bell. It is a moment of high fellowship. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγινωσκε</span></span> twice for "fully know." Note also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βουλητα</span></span> =wills, is willing. The Son retains the power and the will to reveal the Father to men. </p>
