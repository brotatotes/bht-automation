<p><b> Come unto me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευτε προς με</span></span>). Verses 28 to 30 are not in Luke and are among the special treasures of Matthew's Gospel. No sublimer words exist than this call of Jesus to the toiling and the burdened (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεφορτισμενο</span></span>, perfect passive participle, state of weariness) to come to him. He towers above all men as he challenges us. "I will refresh you" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κ'αγο αναπαυσω υμας</span></span>). Far more than mere rest, rejuvenation. The English slang expression "rest up" is close to the idea of the Greek compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα-παυω</span></span>. It is causative active voice. </p>
