<p><b> He that cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ερχομενος</span></span>). This phrase refers to the Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:9">Mark 11:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:35">Luke 13:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:38">Luke 19:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:37">Hebrews 10:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:26">Psalms 118:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span>). Some rabbis applied the phrase to some forerunner of the kingdom (McNeile). Was there to be "another" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερον</span></span>) after Jesus? John had been in prison "long enough to develop a <i>prison mood</i>" (Bruce). It was once clear enough to him, but his environment was depressing and Jesus had done nothing to get him out of Machaerus (see chapter IX in my <i>John the Loyal</i>). John longed for reassurance. </p>
