<p><b> And the dead are raised up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα νεκρο εγειροντα</span></span>). Like that of the son of the widow of Nain. Did he raise the dead also on this occasion? "Tell John your story over again and remind him of these prophetic texts, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:5">Isaiah 35:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span>" (Bruce). The items were convincing enough and clearer than mere eschatological symbolism. "The poor" in particular have the gospel, a climax. </p>
