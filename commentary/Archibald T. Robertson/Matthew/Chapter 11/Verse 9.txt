<p><b> And much more than a prophet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα περισσοτερον προφητου</span></span>). Ablative of comparison after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσοτερον</span></span> itself comparative though meaning exceeding (surrounded by, overflowing). John had all the great qualities of the true prophet: "Vigorous moral conviction, integrity, strength of will, fearless zeal for truth and righteousness" (Bruce). And then he was the Forerunner of the Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:1">Malachi 3:1</span>). </p>
