<p><b> On the sabbath day through the cornfields </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις σαββασιν δια των σποριμων</span></span>). This paragraph begins exactly like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span> "at that season" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εκεινω τω καιρω</span></span>), a general statement with no clear idea of time. So also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:1">Matthew 14:1</span>. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιρος</span></span> means a definite and particular time, but we cannot fix it. The word "cornfields" does not mean our maize or Indian corn, but simply fields of grain (wheat or even barley). </p>
