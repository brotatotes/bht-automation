 On the sabbath day through the cornfields  (τοις σαββασιν δια των σποριμων). This paragraph begins exactly like Matthew 11:25 "at that season" (εν εκεινω τω καιρω), a general statement with no clear idea of time. So also Matthew 14:1. The word καιρος means a definite and particular time, but we cannot fix it. The word "cornfields" does not mean our maize or Indian corn, but simply fields of grain (wheat or even barley).
