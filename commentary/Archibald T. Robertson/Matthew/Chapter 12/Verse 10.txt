<p><b> Is it lawful? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε εξεστιν</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> in direct questions is really elliptical and seems an imitation of the Hebrew (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 916). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:3">Matthew 19:3</span>. It is not translated in English. </p>
