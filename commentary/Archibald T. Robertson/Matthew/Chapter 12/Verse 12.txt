<p><b> How much then is a man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποσω ουν διαφερε ανθρωπος</span></span>). Another of Christ's pregnant questions that goes to the roots of things, an <i>a fortiori</i> argument. "By how much does a human being differ from a sheep? That is the question which Christian civilization has not even yet adequately answered" (Bruce). The poor pettifogging Pharisees are left in the pit. </p>
