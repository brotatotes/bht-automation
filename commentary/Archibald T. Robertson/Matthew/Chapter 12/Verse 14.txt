<p><b> Took counsel against him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμβουλιον ελαβον κατ' αυτου</span></span>). An imitation of the Latin <i>concilium capere</i> and found in papyri of the second century A.D. (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 238.) This incident marks a crisis in the hatred of the Pharisees toward Jesus. They bolted out of the synagogue and actually conspired with their hated rivals, the Herodians, how to put Jesus to death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:6">Mark 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:14">Matthew 12:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:11">Luke 6:11</span>). By "destroy" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολεσωσιν</span></span>) they meant "kill." </p>
