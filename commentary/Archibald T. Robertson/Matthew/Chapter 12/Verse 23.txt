<p><b> Is this the Son of David? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητ ουτος εστιν ο υιος Δαυειδ?</span></span>). The form of the question expects the answer "no," but they put it so because of the Pharisaic hostility towards Jesus. The multitudes "were amazed" or "stood out of themselves" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξισταντο</span></span>), imperfect tense, vividly portraying the situation. They were almost beside themselves with excitement. </p>
