<p><b> The Pharisees </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε Φαρισαιο</span></span>). Already (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:32-34">Matthew 9:32-34</span>) we have had in Matthew the charge that Jesus is in league with the prince of demons, though the incident may be later than this one. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:25">Matthew 10:25</span> about "Beelzebub." The Pharisees feel that the excited condition of the crowds and the manifest disposition to believe that Jesus is the Messiah (the Son of David) demand strenuous action on their part. They cannot deny the fact of the miracles for the blind and dumb men both saw and spoke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:22">Matthew 12:22</span>). So in desperation they suggest that Jesus works by the power of Beelzebub the prince of the demons. </p>
