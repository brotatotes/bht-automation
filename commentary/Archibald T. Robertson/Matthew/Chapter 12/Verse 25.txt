<p><b> Knowing their thoughts </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδως δε τας ενθυμησεις αυτων</span></span>). What they were revolving in their minds. They now find out what a powerful opponent Jesus is. By parables, by a series of conditions (first class), by sarcasm, by rhetorical question, by merciless logic, he lays bare their hollow insincerity and the futility of their arguments. Satan does not cast out Satan. Note timeless aorist passive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμερισθη</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:26">Matthew 12:26</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφθασεν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:28">Matthew 12:28</span> (simple sense of arriving as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:16">Philippians 3:16</span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθανω</span></span>). Christ is engaged in deathless conflict with Satan the strong man (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:29">Matthew 12:29</span>). "Goods" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκευη</span></span>) means house-gear, house furniture, or equipment as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:36">Luke 17:36</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:17">Acts 27:17</span>, the tackling of the ship. </p>
