 Knowing their thoughts  (ειδως δε τας ενθυμησεις αυτων). What they were revolving in their minds. They now find out what a powerful opponent Jesus is. By parables, by a series of conditions (first class), by sarcasm, by rhetorical question, by merciless logic, he lays bare their hollow insincerity and the futility of their arguments. Satan does not cast out Satan. Note timeless aorist passive εμερισθη in Matthew 12:26, εφθασεν in Matthew 12:28 (simple sense of arriving as in Philippians 3:16 from φθανω). Christ is engaged in deathless conflict with Satan the strong man (Matthew 12:29). "Goods" (σκευη) means house-gear, house furniture, or equipment as in Luke 17:36 and Acts 27:17, the tackling of the ship.
