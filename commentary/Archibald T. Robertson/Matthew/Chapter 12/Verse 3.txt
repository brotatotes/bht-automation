<p><b> What David did </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ εποιησεν Δαυειδ</span></span>). From the necessity of hunger. The first defence made by Christ appeals to the conduct of David (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2sa+21:6">2 Samuel 21:6</span>). David and those with him did "what was not lawful" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ουκ εξον ην</span></span>) precisely the charge made against the disciples (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ουκ εξεστιν</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:2">Matthew 12:2</span>). </p>
