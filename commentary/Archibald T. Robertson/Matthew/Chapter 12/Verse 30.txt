<p><b> He that is not with me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μη ων μετ' εμου</span></span>). With these solemn words Jesus draws the line of cleavage between himself and his enemies then and now. Jesus still has his enemies who hate him and all noble words and deeds because they sting what conscience they have into fury. But we may have our choice. We either gather with (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγων</span></span>) Christ or scatter (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκορπιζε</span></span>) to the four winds. Christ is the magnet of the ages. He draws or drives away. "Satan is the arch-waster, Christ the collector, Saviour" (Bruce). </p>
