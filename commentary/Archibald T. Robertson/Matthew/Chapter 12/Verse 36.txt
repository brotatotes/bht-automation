<p><b> Every idle word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν ρημα αργον</span></span>). An ineffective, useless word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργον</span></span>). A word that does no good and so is pernicious like pernicious anaemia. It is a solemn thought. Jesus who knows our very thoughts (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:25">Matthew 12:25</span>) insists that our words reveal our thoughts and form a just basis for the interpretation of character (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:37">Matthew 12:37</span>). Here we have judgment by words as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31-46">Matthew 25:31-46</span> where Jesus presents judgment by deeds. Both are real tests of actual character. Homer spoke of "winged words" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πτεροεντα επεα</span></span>). And by the radio our words can be heard all round the earth. Who knows where they stop? </p>
