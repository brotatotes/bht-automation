<p><b> A sign from thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο σου σημειον</span></span>). One wonders at the audacity of scribes and Pharisees who accused Jesus of being in league with Satan and thus casting out demons who can turn round and blandly ask for a "sign from thee." As if the other miracles were not signs! "The demand was impudent, hypocritical, insulting" (Bruce). </p>
