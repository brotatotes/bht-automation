<p><b> The whale </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του κητους</span></span>). Sea-monster, huge fish. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jon+2:1">Jonah 2:1</span> the LXX has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κητε μεγαλω</span></span>. "Three days and three nights" may simply mean three days in popular speech. Jesus rose "on the third day" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span>), not "on the fourth day." It is just a fuller form for "after three days" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:31">Mark 8:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:34">Mark 10:34</span>). </p>
