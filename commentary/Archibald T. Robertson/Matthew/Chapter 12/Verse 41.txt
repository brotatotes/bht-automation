 In the judgment  (εν τη κρισε). Except here and in the next verse Matthew has "day of judgment" (ημερα κρισεως) as in Matthew 10:15; Matthew 11:22; Matthew 11:24; Matthew 12:36. Luke (Luke 10:14) has εν τη κρισε.They repented at the preaching of Jonah  (μετενοησον εις το κηρυγμα Ιωνα). Note this use of εις just like εν. Note also πλειον (neuter), not πλειων (masc.). See the same idiom in Matthew 12:6 and Matthew 12:48. Jesus is something greater than the temple, than Jonah, than Solomon. "You will continue to disbelieve in spite of all I can say or do, and at last you will put me to death. But I will rise again, a sign for your confusion, if not for your conversion" (Bruce).
