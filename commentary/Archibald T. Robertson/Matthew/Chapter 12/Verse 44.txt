<p><b> Into my house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον οικον μου</span></span>). So the demon describes the man in whom he had dwelt. "The demon is ironically represented as implying that he left his victim voluntarily, as a man leaves his house to go for a walk" (McNeile). "Worse than the first" is a proverb. </p>
