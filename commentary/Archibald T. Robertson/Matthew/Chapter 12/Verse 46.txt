<p><b> His mother and his brothers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η μητηρ κα ο αδελφο αυτου</span></span>). Brothers of Jesus, younger sons of Joseph and Mary. The charge of the Pharisees that Jesus was in league with Satan was not believed by the disciples of Jesus, but some of his friends did think that he was beside himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:21">Mark 3:21</span>) because of the excitement and strain. It was natural for Mary to want to take him home for rest and refreshment. So the mother and brothers are pictured standing outside the house (or the crowd). They send a messenger to Jesus. </p>
