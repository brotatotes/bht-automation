<p>Aleph, B, L, Old Syriac, omit this verse as do Westcott and Hort. It is genuine in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:32">Mark 3:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:20">Luke 8:20</span>. It was probably copied into Matthew from Mark or Luke. </p>
