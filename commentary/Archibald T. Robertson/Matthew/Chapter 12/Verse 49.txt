<p><b> Behold my mother and my brothers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδου η μητηρ μου κα ο αδελφο μου</span></span>). A dramatic wave of the hand towards his disciples (learners) accompanied these words. Jesus loved his mother and brothers, but they were not to interfere in his Messianic work. The real spiritual family of Jesus included all who follow him. But it was hard for Mary to go back to Nazareth and leave Jesus with the excited throng so great that he was not even stopping to eat (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:20">Mark 3:20</span>). </p>
