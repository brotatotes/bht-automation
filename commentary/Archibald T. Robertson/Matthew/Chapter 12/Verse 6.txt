<p><b> One greater than the temple </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ιερου μειζον</span></span>). Ablative of comparison, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ιερου</span></span>. The Textus Receptus has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μειζων</span></span>, but the neuter is correct. Literally, "something greater than the temple." What is that? It may still be Christ, or it may be: "The work and His disciples were of more account than the temple" (Plummer). "If the temple was not subservient to Sabbath rules, how much less the Messiah!" (Allen). </p>
