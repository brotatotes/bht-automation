 One greater than the temple  (του ιερου μειζον). Ablative of comparison, του ιερου. The Textus Receptus has μειζων, but the neuter is correct. Literally, "something greater than the temple." What is that? It may still be Christ, or it may be: "The work and His disciples were of more account than the temple" (Plummer). "If the temple was not subservient to Sabbath rules, how much less the Messiah!" (Allen).
