<p><b> The guiltless </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους αναιτιους</span></span>). So in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:5">Matthew 12:5</span>. Common in ancient Greek. No real ground against, it means <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> + <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτιος</span></span>. Jesus quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:6">Hosea 6:6</span> here as he did in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:13">Matthew 9:13</span>. A pertinent prophecy that had escaped the notice of the sticklers for ceremonial literalness and the letter of the law. </p>
