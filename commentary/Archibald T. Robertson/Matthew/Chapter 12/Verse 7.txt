 The guiltless  (τους αναιτιους). So in verse Matthew 12:5. Common in ancient Greek. No real ground against, it means αν + αιτιος. Jesus quotes Hosea 6:6 here as he did in Matthew 9:13. A pertinent prophecy that had escaped the notice of the sticklers for ceremonial literalness and the letter of the law.
