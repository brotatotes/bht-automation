<p><b> On that day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη ημερα εκεινη</span></span>). So this group of parables is placed by Matthew on the same day as the blasphemous accusation and the visit of the mother of Jesus. It is called "the Busy Day," not because it was the only one, but simply that so much is told of this day that it serves as a specimen of many others filled to the full with stress and strain.</p>
<p><b>Sat by the seaside </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθητο παρα την θαλασσαν</span></span>). The accusative case need give no difficulty. Jesus came out of the stuffy house and took his seat (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθητο</span></span>, imperfect) along the shore with the crowds stretched up and down, a picturesque scene. </p>
