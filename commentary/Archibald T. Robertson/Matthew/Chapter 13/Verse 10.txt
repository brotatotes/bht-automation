<p><b> Why speakest thou unto them in parables? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τ εν παραβολαις λαλεις αυτοις</span></span>). Already the disciples are puzzled over the meaning of this parable and the reason for giving them to the people. So they "came up" closer to Jesus and asked him. Jesus was used to questions and surpassed all teachers in his replies. </p>
