<p><b> To know the mysteries </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωνα τα μυστηρια</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυστηριον</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυστης</span></span>, one initiated, and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυεω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυω</span></span>), to close or shut (Latin, <i>mutus</i>). The mystery-religions of the east had all sorts of secrets and signs as secret societies do today. But those initiated knew them. So the disciples have been initiated into the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. Paul will use it freely of the mystery once hidden, but now revealed, now made known in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>, etc.). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:12">Philippians 4:12</span> Paul says: "I have learned the secret or been initiated" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεμυημα</span></span>). So Jesus here explains that his parables are open to the disciples, but shut to the Pharisees with their hostile minds. In the Gospels <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυστηριον</span></span> is used only here and in the parallel passages (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:11">Mark 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:10">Luke 8:10</span>). </p>
