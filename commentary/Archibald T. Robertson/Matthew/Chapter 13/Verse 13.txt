<p><b> Because seeing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ βλεποντες</span></span>). In the parallel passages in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:12">Mark 4:12</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:10">Luke 8:10</span> we find <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> with the subjunctive. This does not necessarily mean that in Mark and Luke <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα=οτ</span></span> with the causal sense, though a few rare instances of such usage may be found in late Greek. For a discussion of the problem see my chapter on "The Causal Use of <i>Hina</i>" in <i>Studies in Early Christianity</i> (1928) edited by Prof. S.J. Case. Here in Matthew we have first "an adaptation of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:9">Isaiah 6:9</span> which is quoted in full in v. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:14">Matthew 13:14</span>" (McNeile). Thus Matthew presents "a striking paradox, 'though they see, they do not (really) see'" (McNeile). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:41">John 9:41</span>. The idiom here in Matthew gives no trouble save in comparison with Mark and Luke which will be discussed in due turn. The form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιουσιν</span></span> is an omega verb form (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιω</span></span>) rather than the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μ</span></span> verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιημ</span></span>) as is common in the <i>Koine</i>. </p>
