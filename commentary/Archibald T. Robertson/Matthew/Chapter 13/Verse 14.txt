<p><b> Is fulfilled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπληρουτα</span></span>). Aoristic present passive indicative. Here Jesus points out the fulfilment and not with Matthew's usual formula (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως πλωρηθη το ρηθεν</span></span> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:22">Matthew 1:22</span>). The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπληροω</span></span> occurs nowhere else in the Gospels, but occurs in the Pauline Epistles. It means to fill up like a cup, to fill another's place (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:16">1 Corinthians 14:16</span>), to fill up what is lacking (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:30">Philippians 2:30</span>). Here it means that the prophecy of Isaiah is fully satisfied in the conduct of the Pharisees and Jesus himself points it out. Note two ways of reproducing the Hebrew idiom (infinitive absolute), one by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακοη</span></span> the other by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεποντες</span></span>. Note also the strong negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span> with aorist subjunctive. </p>
