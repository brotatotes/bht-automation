<p><b> Is waxed gross </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαχυνθη</span></span>). Aorist passive tense. From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παχυς</span></span>, thick, fat, stout. Made callous or dull -- even fatty degeneration of the heart.</p>
<p><b>Dull of hearing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις ωσιν βαρεως ηκουσαν</span></span>). Another aorist. Literally, "They heard (or hear) heavily with their ears." The hard of hearing are usually sensitive.</p>
<p><b>Their eyes they have closed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους οφθαλμους αυτων εκαμμυσαν</span></span>). The epic and vernacular verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καμμυω</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταμυω</span></span> (to shut down). We say shut up of the mouth, but the eyes really shut down. The Hebrew verb in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:10">Isaiah 6:10</span> means to smear over. The eyes can be smeared with wax or cataract and thus closed. "Sealing up the eyes was an oriental punishment" (Vincent). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:10">Isaiah 29:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+44:18">Isaiah 44:18</span>.</p>
<p><b>Lest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηποτε</span></span>). This negative purpose as a judgment is left in the quotation from Isaiah. It is a solemn thought for all who read or hear the word of God.</p>
<p><b>And I should heal them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ιασομα αυτους</span></span>). Here the LXX changes to the future indicative rather than the aorist subjunctive as before. </p>
