<p><b> Hear then ye the parable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις ουν ακουσατε την παραβολην</span></span>). Jesus has given in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:13">Matthew 13:13</span> one reason for his use of parables, the condemnation which the Pharisees have brought on themselves by their spiritual dulness: "Therefore I speak to them in parables" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τουτο εν παραβωλαις αντοις λαλω</span></span>). He can go on preaching the mysteries of the kingdom without their comprehending what he is saying, but he is anxious that the disciples really get personal knowledge (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωνα</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:11">Matthew 13:11</span>) of these same mysteries. So he explains in detail what he means to teach by the Parable of the Sower. He appeals to them (note position of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις</span></span>) to listen as he explains. </p>
