<p><b> When anyone heareth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντος ακουοντος</span></span>). Genitive absolute and present participle, "while everyone is listening and not comprehending" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη συνιεντος</span></span>), "not putting together" or "not grasping." Perhaps at that very moment Jesus observed a puzzled look on some faces. </p>
<p><b> Cometh the evil one and snatcheth away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχετα ο πονηρος κα αρπαζε</span></span>). The birds pick up the seeds while the sower sows. The devil is busy with his job of snatching or seizing like a bandit or rogue the word of the kingdom before it has time even to sprout. How quickly after the sermon the impression is gone. "This is he" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος εστιν</span></span>). Matthew, like Mark, speaks of the people who hear the words as the seed itself. That creates some confusion in this condensed form of what Jesus actually said, but the real point is clear.</p>
<p><b>The seed sown in his heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το εσπαρμενον εν τη καρδια αυτου</span></span>, perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπειρω</span></span>, to sow) and "the man sown by the wayside" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο παρα την οδον σπαρεις</span></span>, aorist passive participle, along the wayside) are identified. The seed in the heart is not of itself responsible, but the man who lets the devil snatch it away. </p>
