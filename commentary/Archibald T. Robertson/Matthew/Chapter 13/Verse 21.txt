<p><b> Yet hath he not root in himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εχε δε ριζαν εν εαυτω</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:7">Colossians 2:7</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:18">Ephesians 3:18</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερριζωμεμο</span></span>. Stability like a tree. Here the man has a mushroom growth and "endureth for a while" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκαιρος</span></span>), temporary, quick to sprout, quick to stumble (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκανδαλιζετα</span></span>). What a picture of some converts in our modern revivals. They drop away overnight because they did not have the root of the matter in them. This man does not last or hold out. </p>
<p><b> Tribulation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιψεως</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιβω</span></span>, to press, to oppress, to squeeze (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:14">Matthew 7:14</span>). The English word is from the Latin <i>tribulum</i>, the roller used by the Romans for pressing wheat. Cf. our "steam roller" Trench (<i>Synonyms of the N.T.</i>, pp. 202-4): "When, according to the ancient law of England, those who wilfully refused to plead, had heavy weights placed on their breasts, and were pressed and crushed to death, this was literally <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιψις</span></span>." The iron cage was <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στενοχωρια</span></span>. </p>
