<p><b> Choke the word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνπνιγε τον λογον</span></span>). We had <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεπνιξαν</span></span> (choked off) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:7">Matthew 13:7</span>. Here it is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνπνιγε</span></span> (choke together), historical present and singular with both subjects lumped together. "Lust for money and care go together and between them spoil many an earnest religious nature" (Bruce), "thorns" indeed. The thorns flourish and the character sickens and dies, choked to death for lack of spiritual food, air, sunshine. </p>
