<p><b> While men slept </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω καθευδειν τους ανθρωπους</span></span>). Same use of the articular present infinitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> and the accusative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:4">Matthew 13:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>Sowed tares also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεσπειρεν τα ζιζανια</span></span>). Literally "sowed upon," "resowed" (Moffatt). The enemy deliberately sowed "the darnel" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζιζανια</span></span> is not "tares," but "darnel," a bastard wheat) over (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>) the wheat, "in the midst of the wheat." This bearded darnel, <i>lolium temulentum</i>, is common in Palestine and resembles wheat except that the grains are black. In its earlier stages it is indistinguishable from the wheat stalks so that it has to remain till near the harvest. Modern farmers are gaining more skill in weeding it out. </p>
