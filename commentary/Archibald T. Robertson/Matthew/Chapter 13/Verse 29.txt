<p><b> Ye root up the wheat with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκριζωσητε αμα αυτοις τον σιτον</span></span>). Literally, "root out." Easy to do with the roots of wheat and darnel intermingled in the field. So <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συλλεγοντες</span></span> is not "gather up," but "gather together," here and verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:28">Matthew 13:28</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:30">Matthew 13:30</span>. Note other compound verbs here, "grow together" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναυξανεσθα</span></span>), "burn up" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακαυσα</span></span>, burn down or completely), "bring together" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγετε</span></span>). </p>
