<p><b> Many things in parables </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλα εν παραβολαις</span></span>). It was not the first time that Jesus had used parables, but the first time that he had spoken so many and some of such length. He will use a great many in the future as in Luke 12 to 18 and Matt. 24 and 25. The parables already mentioned in Matthew include the salt and the light (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:13-16">Matthew 5:13-16</span>), the birds and the lilies (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:26-30">Matthew 6:26-30</span>), the splinter and the beam in the eye (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:3-5">Matthew 7:3-5</span>), the two gates (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:13">Matthew 7:13</span>), the wolves in sheep's clothing (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:15">Matthew 7:15</span>), the good and bad trees (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:17-19">Matthew 7:17-19</span>), the wise and foolish builders (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:24-27">Matthew 7:24-27</span>), the garment and the wineskins (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:16">Matthew 9:16</span>), the children in the market places (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:16">Matthew 11:16</span>). It is not certain how many he spoke on this occasion. Matthew mentions eight in this chapter (the Sower, the Tares, the Mustard Seed, the Leaven, the Hid Treasure, the Pearl of Great Price, the Net, the Householder). Mark adds the Parable of the Lamp (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:21">Mark 4:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:16">Luke 8:16</span>), the Parable of the Seed Growing of Itself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:26-29">Mark 4:26-29</span>), making ten of which we know. But both Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:33">Mark 4:33</span>) and Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:34">Matthew 13:34</span>) imply that there were many others. "Without a parable spake he nothing unto them" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:34">Matthew 13:34</span>), on this occasion, we may suppose. The word parable (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολη</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβαλλω</span></span>, to place alongside for measurement or comparison like a yardstick) is an objective illustration for spiritual or moral truth. The word is employed in a variety of ways (a) as for sententious sayings or proverbs (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:15">Matthew 15:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:23">Mark 3:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:23">Luke 4:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:36-39">Luke 5:36-39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:39">Luke 6:39</span>), for a figure or type (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:9">Matthew 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:19">Matthew 11:19</span>); (b) a comparison in the form of a narrative, the common use in the Synoptic Gospels like the Sower; (c) "A narrative illustration not involving a comparison" (Broadus), like the Rich Fool, the Good Samaritan, etc. "The oriental genius for picturesque speech found expression in a multitude of such utterances" (McNeile). There are parables in the Old Testament, in the Talmud, in sermons in all ages. But no one has spoken such parables as these of Jesus. They hold the mirror up to nature and, as all illustrations should do, throw light on the truth presented. The fable puts things as they are not in nature, Aesop's Fables, for instance. The parable may not be actual fact, but it could be so. It is harmony with the nature of the case. The allegory (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλληγορια</span></span>) is a speaking parable that is self-explanatory all along like Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>. All allegories are parables, but not all parables are allegories. The Prodigal Son is an allegory, as is the story of the Vine and Branches (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:15">Matthew 13:15</span>). John does not use the word parable, but only <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παροιμια</span></span>, a saying by the way (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:6">John 10:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:25">John 16:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:29">John 16:29</span>). As a rule the parables of Jesus illustrate one main point and the details are more or less incidental, though sometimes Jesus himself explains these. When he does not do so, we should be slow to interpret the minor details. Much heresy has come from fantastic interpretations of the parables. In the case of the Parable of the Sower (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:3-8">Matthew 13:3-8</span>) we have also the careful exposition of the story by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:18-23">Matthew 13:18-23</span>) as well as the reason for the use of parables on this occasion by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:9-17">Matthew 13:9-17</span>). </p>
<p><b> Behold, the sower went forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδου ηλθεν ο σπειρων</span></span>). Matthew is very fond of this exclamation <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδου</span></span>. It is "the sower," not "a sower." Jesus expects one to see the man as he stepped forth to begin scattering with his hand. The parables of Jesus are vivid word pictures. To understand them one must see them, with the eyes of Jesus if he can. Christ drew his parables from familiar objects. </p>
