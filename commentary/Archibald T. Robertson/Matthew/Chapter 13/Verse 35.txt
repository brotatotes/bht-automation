<p><b> I will utter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερευξομα</span></span>). To cast forth like a river, to gurgle, to disgorge, the passion of a prophet. From <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+19:2">Psalms 19:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:2">Psalms 78:2</span>. The Psalmist claims to be able to utter "things hidden from the foundation of the world" and Matthew applies this language to the words of Jesus. Certain it is that the life and teaching of Jesus throw a flood of light on the purposes of God long kept hidden (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεκρυμμενα</span></span>). </p>
