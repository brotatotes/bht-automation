<p><b> As he sowed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω σπειρειν αυτον</span></span>). Literally, "in the sowing as to him," a neat Greek idiom unlike our English temporal conjunction. Locative case with the articular present infinitive.</p>
<p><b>By the wayside </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα την οδον</span></span>). People will make paths along the edge of a ploughed field or even across it where the seed lies upon the beaten track.</p>
<p><b>Devoured </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεφαγεν</span></span>). "Ate down." We say, "ate up." Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεσθιω</span></span> (defective verb). </p>
