<p><b> Out of his kingdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ της βασιλειας αυτου</span></span>). Out from the midst of the kingdom, because in every city the good and the bad are scattered and mixed together. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ μεσου των δικαιων</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:49">Matthew 13:49</span> "from the midst of the righteous." What this means is that, just as the wheat and the darnel are mixed together in the field till the separation at harvest, so the evil are mixed with the good in the world (the field). Jesus does not mean to say that these "stumbling-blocks" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα σκανδαλα</span></span>) are actually in the Kingdom of heaven and really members of the Kingdom. They are simply mixed in the field with the wheat and God leaves them in the world till the separation comes. Their destiny is "the furnace of fire" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την καμινον του πυρος</span></span>). </p>
