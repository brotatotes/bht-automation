<p><b> A net </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαγηνη</span></span>). Drag-net. Latin, <i>sagena</i>, English, seine. The ends were stretched out and drawn together. Only example of the word in the N.T. Just as the field is the world, so the drag-net catches all the fish that are in the sea. The separation comes afterwards. Vincent pertinently quotes Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> (xxii. 384-389) where the slain suitors in the halls of Ulysses are likened to fishes on the shore caught by nets with myriad meshes. </p>
