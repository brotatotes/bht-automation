<p><b> Made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαθετευθεις τη βασιλεια των ουρανων</span></span>). First aorist passive participle. The verb is transitive in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>. Here a scribe is made a learner to the kingdom. "The mere scribe, Rabbinical in spirit, produces only the old and stale. The disciple of the kingdom like the Master, is always fresh-minded, yet knows how to value all old spiritual treasures of Holy Writ, or Christian tradition" (Bruce). So he uses things fresh (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινα</span></span>) and ancient (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλαια</span></span>). "He hurls forth" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλλε</span></span>) both sorts. </p>
