<p><b> Is not this the carpenter's son? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ ουτος εστιν ο του τεκτωνος υιοσ?</span></span>). The well-known, the leading, or even for a time the only carpenter in Nazareth till Jesus took the place of Joseph as the carpenter. What the people of Nazareth could not comprehend was how one with the origin and environment of Jesus here in Nazareth could possess the wisdom which he appeared to have in his teaching (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιδασκεν</span></span>). That has often puzzled people how a boy whom they knew could become the man he apparently is after leaving them. They knew Joseph, Mary, the brothers (four of them named) and sisters (names not given). Jesus passed here as the son of Joseph and these were younger brothers and sisters (half brothers and sisters technically). </p>
