<p><b> And they were offended in him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εσκανδαλιζοντο εν αυτω</span></span>). Graphic imperfect passive. Literally, "They stumbled at him," "They were repelled by him" (Moffatt), "They turned against him" (Weymouth). It was unpardonable for Jesus not to be commonplace like themselves.</p>
<p><b>Not without honour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν ατιμος</span></span>). This is a proverb found in Jewish, Greek, and Roman writers. Seen also in the <i>Logia of Jesus</i> (<i>Oxyr. Papyri</i> i. 3). </p>
