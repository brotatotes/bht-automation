<p><b> The thorns grew up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεβησαν α ακανθα</span></span>). Not "sprang up" as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:5">Matthew 13:5</span>, for a different verb occurs meaning "came up" out of the ground, the seeds of the thorns being already in the soil, "upon the thorns" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τας ακανθας</span></span>) rather than "among the thorns." But the thorns got a quick start as weeds somehow do and "choked them" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεπνιξαν αυτα</span></span>, effective aorist of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποπνιγω</span></span>), "choked them off" literally. Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:33">Luke 8:33</span>) uses it of the hogs in the water. Who has not seen vegetables and flowers and corn made yellow by thorns and weeds till they sicken and die? </p>
