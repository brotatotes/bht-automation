 Yielded fruit  (εδιδου καρπον). Change to imperfect tense of διδωμ, to give, for it was continuous fruit-bearing.Some a hundredfold  (ο μεν εκατον). Variety, but fruit. This is the only kind that is worth while. The hundredfold is not an exaggeration (cf. Genesis 26:12). Such instances are given by Wetstein for Greece, Italy, and Africa. Herodotus (i. 93) says that in Babylonia grain yielded two hundredfold and even to three hundredfold. This, of course, was due to irrigation as in the Nile Valley.
