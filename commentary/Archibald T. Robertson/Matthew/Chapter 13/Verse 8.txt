<p><b> Yielded fruit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιδου καρπον</span></span>). Change to imperfect tense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>, to give, for it was continuous fruit-bearing.</p>
<p><b>Some a hundredfold </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μεν εκατον</span></span>). Variety, but fruit. This is the only kind that is worth while. The hundredfold is not an exaggeration (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+26:12">Genesis 26:12</span>). Such instances are given by Wetstein for Greece, Italy, and Africa. Herodotus (i. 93) says that in Babylonia grain yielded two hundredfold and even to three hundredfold. This, of course, was due to irrigation as in the Nile Valley. </p>
