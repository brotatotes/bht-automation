<p><b> She brought it to her mother </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηνεγκεν τη μητρ αυτης</span></span>). A gruesome picture as Herodias with fiendish delight witnesses the triumph of her implacable hatred of John for daring to reprove her for her marriage with Herod Antipas. A woman scorned is a veritable demon, a literal she-devil when she wills to be. Kipling's "female of the species" again. Legends actually picture Salome as in love with John, sensual lust, of which there is no proof. </p>
