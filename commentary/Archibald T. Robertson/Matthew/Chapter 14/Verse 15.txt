<p><b> When even was come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψιας γενομενης</span></span>). Genitive absolute. Not sunset about 6 P.M. as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:16">Matthew 8:16</span> and as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:23">Matthew 14:23</span>, but the first of the two "evenings" beginning at 3 P.M.</p>
<p><b>The place is desert </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερημος εστιν ο τοπος</span></span>). Not a desolate region, simply lonely, comparatively uninhabited with no large towns near. There were "villages" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωμας</span></span>) where the people could buy food, but they would need time to go to them. Probably this is the idea of the disciples when they add:</p>
<p><b>The time is already past </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ωρα ηδη παρηλθεν</span></span>). They must hurry. </p>
