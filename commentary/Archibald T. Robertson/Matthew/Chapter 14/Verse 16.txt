<p><b> Give ye them to eat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοτε αυτοις υμεις φαγειν</span></span>). The emphasis is on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις</span></span> in contrast (note position) with their "send away" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολυσον</span></span>). It is the urgent aorist of instant action (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοτε</span></span>). It was an astounding command. The disciples were to learn that "no situation appears to Him desperate, no crisis unmanageable" (Bruce). </p>
