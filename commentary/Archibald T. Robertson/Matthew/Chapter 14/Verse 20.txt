<p><b> Were filled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχορτασθησαν</span></span>). Effective aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χορταζω</span></span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:6">Matthew 5:6</span>. From the substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χορτος</span></span> grass. Cattle were filled with grass and people usually with other food. They all were satisfied.</p>
<p><b>Broken pieces </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των κλασματων</span></span>). Not the scraps upon the ground, but the pieces broken by Jesus and still in the "twelve baskets" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωδεκα κοφινους</span></span>) and not eaten. Each of the twelve had a basketful left over (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το περισσευον</span></span>). One hopes that the boy (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:9">John 6:9</span>) who had the five loaves and two fishes to start with got one of the basketsful, if not all of them. Each of the Gospels uses the same word here for baskets (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοφινος</span></span>), a wicker-basket, called "coffins" by Wycliff. Juvenal (<i>Sat</i>. iii. 14) says that the grove of Numa near the Capenian gate of Rome was "let out to Jews whose furniture is a basket (<i>cophinus</i>) and some hay" (for a bed). In the feeding of the Four Thousand (Matthew and Mark) the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφυρις</span></span> is used which was a sort of hamper or large provisions basket. </p>
