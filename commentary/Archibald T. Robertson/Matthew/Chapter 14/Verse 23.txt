<p><b> Into the mountain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ορος</span></span>). After the dismissal of the crowd Jesus went up alone into the mountain on the eastern side of the lake to pray as he often did go to the mountains to pray. If ever he needed the Father's sympathy, it was now. The masses were wild with enthusiasm and the disciples wholly misunderstood him. The Father alone could offer help now. </p>
