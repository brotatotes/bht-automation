<p><b> Walking upon the sea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιπατων επ την θαλασσαν</span></span>). Another nature miracle. Some scholars actually explain it all away by urging that Jesus was only walking along the beach and not on the water, an impossible theory unless Matthew's account is legendary. Matthew uses the accusative (extension) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:25">Matthew 14:25</span> and the genitive (specifying case) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:26">Matthew 14:26</span>. </p>
