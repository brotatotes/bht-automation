<p><b> They were troubled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εταραχθησαν</span></span>). Much stronger than that. They were literally "terrified" as they saw Jesus walking on the sea.</p>
<p><b>An apparition </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαντασμα</span></span>), or "ghost," or "spectre" from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανταζω</span></span> and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαινω</span></span>. They cried out "from fear" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο του φοβου</span></span>) as any one would have done. "A little touch of sailor superstition" (Bruce). </p>
