<p><b> Seeing the wind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπων τον ανεμον</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:18">Exodus 20:18</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:12">Revelation 1:12</span> "to see the voice" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την φωνην</span></span>). "It is one thing to see a storm from the deck of a stout ship, another to see it in the midst of the waves" (Bruce). Peter was actually beginning to sink (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταποντιζεσθα</span></span>) to plunge down into the sea, "although a fisherman and a good swimmer" (Bengel). It was a dramatic moment that wrung from Peter the cry: "Lord, save me" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριε, σωσον με</span></span>), and do it quickly the aorist means. He could walk on the water till he saw the wind whirl the water round him. </p>
