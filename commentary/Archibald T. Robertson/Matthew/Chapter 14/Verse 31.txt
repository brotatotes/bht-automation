 Didst thou doubt?  (εδιστασασ?). Only here and Matthew 28:17 in the N.T. From δισταζω and that from δις (twice). Pulled two ways. Peter's trust in the power of Christ gave way to his dread of the wind and waves. Jesus had to take hold of Peter (επελαβετο, middle voice) and pull him up while still walking on the water.
