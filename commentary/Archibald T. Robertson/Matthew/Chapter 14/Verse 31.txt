<p><b> Didst thou doubt? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιστασασ?</span></span>). Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:17">Matthew 28:17</span> in the N.T. From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δισταζω</span></span> and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δις</span></span> (twice). Pulled two ways. Peter's trust in the power of Christ gave way to his dread of the wind and waves. Jesus had to take hold of Peter (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επελαβετο</span></span>, middle voice) and pull him up while still walking on the water. </p>
