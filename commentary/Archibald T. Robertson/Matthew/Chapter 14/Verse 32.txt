<p><b> Ceased </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκοπασεν</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπος</span></span>, toil. The wind grew weary or tired, exhausted itself in the presence of its Master (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:39">Mark 4:39</span>). Not a mere coincidence that the wind ceased now. </p>
