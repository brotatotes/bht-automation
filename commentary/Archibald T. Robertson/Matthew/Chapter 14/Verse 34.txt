<p><b> Gennesaret </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γεννησαρετ</span></span>). A rich plain four miles long and two broad. The first visit of Jesus apparently with the usual excitement at the cures. People were eager to touch the hem of Christ's mantle like the woman in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:20">Matthew 9:20</span>. Jesus honoured their superstitious faith and "as many as touched were made whole" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσο ηψαντο διεσωθεσαν</span></span>), completely (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι-</span></span>) healed. </p>
