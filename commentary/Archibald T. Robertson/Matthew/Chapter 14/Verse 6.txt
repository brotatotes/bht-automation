<p><b> When Herod's birthday came </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσιοις γενομενοις του Hηρωιδου</span></span>). Locative of time (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:21">Mark 6:21</span>) without the genitive absolute. The earlier Greeks used the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσια</span></span> for funeral commemorations (birthdays of the dead), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεθλια</span></span> being the word for birthday celebrations of living persons. But that distinction has disappeared in the papyri. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενεσια</span></span> in the papyri (<i>Fayum Towns</i>, 114-20, 115-8, 119-30) is always a birthday feast as here in Matthew and Mark. Philo used both words of birthday feasts. Persius, a Roman satirist (<i>Sat</i>. V. 180-183), describes a banquet on Herod's Day.</p>
<p><b>Danced in the midst </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωρχησατο εν τω μεσω</span></span>). This was Salome, daughter of Herodias by her first marriage. The root of the verb means some kind of rapid motion. "Leaped in the middle," Wycliff puts it. It was a shameful exhibition of lewd dancing prearranged by Herodias to compass her purpose for John's death. Salome had stooped to the level of an <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλμε</span></span>, or common dancer. </p>
