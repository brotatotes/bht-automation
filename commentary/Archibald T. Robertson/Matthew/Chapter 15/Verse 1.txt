<p><b> From Jerusalem </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο Ιεροσολυμων</span></span>). Jerusalem is the headquarters of the conspiracy against Jesus with the Pharisees as the leaders in it. Already we have seen the Herodians combining with the Pharisees in the purpose to put Jesus to death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:6">Mark 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:14">Matthew 12:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:11">Luke 6:11</span>). Soon Jesus will warn the disciples against the Sadducees also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:6">Matthew 16:6</span>). Unusual order here, "Pharisees and scribes." "The guardians of tradition in the capital have their evil eye on Jesus and co-operate with the provincial rigorists" (Bruce), if the Pharisees were not all from Jerusalem. </p>
