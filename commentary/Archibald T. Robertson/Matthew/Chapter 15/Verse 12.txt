<p><b> Were offended </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσκανδαλισθησαν</span></span>). First aorist passive. "Were caused to stumble," "have taken offence" (Moffatt), "have turned against you" (Weymouth), "were shocked" (Goodspeed), "War ill-pleased" (Braid Scots). They took umbrage at the public rebuke and at such a scorpion sting in it all. It cut to the quick because it was true. It showed in the glowering countenances of the Pharisees so plainly that the disciples were uneasy. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29">Matthew 5:29</span>. </p>
