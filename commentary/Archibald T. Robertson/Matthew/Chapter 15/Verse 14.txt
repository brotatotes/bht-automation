<p><b> They are blind guides </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυφλο εισιν οδηγο</span></span>). Graphic picture. Once in Cincinnati a blind man introduced me to his blind friend. He said that he was showing him the city. Jesus is not afraid of the Pharisees. Let them alone to do their worst. Blind leaders and blind victims will land in the ditch. A proverbial expression in the O.T. </p>
