<p><b> Perceive ye not? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου νοειτε</span></span>). Christ expects us to make use of our <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νους</span></span>, intellect, not for pride, but for insight. The mind does not work infallibly, but we should use it for its God-given purpose. Intellectual laziness or flabbiness is no credit to a devout soul. </p>
