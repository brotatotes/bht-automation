<p><b> Ye also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υμεις</span></span>). Jesus admits that the disciples had transgressed the rabbinical traditions. Jesus treats it as a matter of no great importance in itself save as they had put the tradition of the elders in the place of the commandment of God. When the two clashed, as was often the case, the rabbis transgress the commandment of God "because of your tradition" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια την παραδοσιν υμων</span></span>). The accusative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> means that, not "by means of." Tradition is not good or bad in itself. It is merely what is handed on from one to another. Custom tended to make these traditions binding like law. The Talmud is a monument of their struggle with tradition. There could be no compromise on this subject and Jesus accepts the issue. He stands for real righteousness and spiritual freedom, not for bondage to mere ceremonialism and tradition. The rabbis placed tradition (the oral law) above the law of God. </p>
