<p><b> Three days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερα τρεις</span></span>). A parenthetic nominative (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 460).</p>
<p><b>What to eat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ φαγωσιν</span></span>). Indirect question with the deliberative subjunctive retained. In the feeding of the five thousand Jesus took compassion on the people and healed their sick (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:14">Matthew 14:14</span>). Here the hunger of the multitude moves him to compassion (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπλαγχνιζομα</span></span>, in both instances). So he is unwilling (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου θελω</span></span>) to send them away hungry.</p>
<p><b>Faint </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλυθωσιν</span></span>). Unloosed, (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλυω</span></span>) exhausted. </p>
