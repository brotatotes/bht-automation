<p><b> And the disciples say to him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα λεγουσιν αυτω ο μαθητα</span></span>). It seems strange that they should so soon have forgotten the feeding of the five thousand (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:13-21">Matthew 14:13-21</span>), but they did. Soon Jesus will remind them of both these demonstrations of his power (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:9">Matthew 16:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:10">Matthew 16:10</span>). They forgot both of them, not just one. Some scholars scout the idea of two miracles so similar as the feeding of the five thousand and the four thousand, though both are narrated in detail by both Mark and Matthew and both are later mentioned by Jesus. Jesus repeated his sayings and wrought multitudes of healings. There is no reason in itself why Jesus should not on occasion repeat a nature miracle like this elsewhere. He is in the region of Decapolis, not in the country of Philip (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τραχονιτις</span></span>). </p>
