<p><b> Gave thanks </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστησας</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:19">Matthew 14:19</span> the word used for "grace" or "blessing" is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευλογησεν</span></span>. Vincent notes that the Jewish custom was for the head of the house to say the blessing only if he shared the meal unless the guests were his own household. But we need not think of Jesus as bound by the peccadilloes of Jewish customs. </p>
