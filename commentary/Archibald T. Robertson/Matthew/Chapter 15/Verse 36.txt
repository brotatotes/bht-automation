 Gave thanks  (ευχαριστησας). In Matthew 14:19 the word used for "grace" or "blessing" is ευλογησεν. Vincent notes that the Jewish custom was for the head of the house to say the blessing only if he shared the meal unless the guests were his own household. But we need not think of Jesus as bound by the peccadilloes of Jewish customs.
