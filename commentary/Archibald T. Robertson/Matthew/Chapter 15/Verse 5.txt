<p><b> But ye say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις δε λεγετε</span></span>). In sharp contrast to the command of God. Jesus had quoted the fifth commandment (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:12">Exodus 20:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:16">Exodus 20:16</span>) with the penalty "die the death" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θανατω τελευτατω</span></span>), "go on to his end by death," in imitation of the Hebrew idiom. They dodged this command of God about the penalty for dishonouring one's father or mother by the use "Corban" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κορβαν</span></span>) as Mark calls it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:11">Mark 7:11</span>). All one had to do to evade one's duty to father or mother was to say "Corban" or "Gift" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δωρον</span></span>) with the idea of using the money for God. By an angry oath of refusal to help one's parents, the oath or vow was binding. By this magic word one set himself free (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη τιμησε</span></span>, he shall not honour) from obedience to the fifth commandment. Sometimes unfilial sons paid graft to the rabbinical legalists for such dodges. Were some of these very faultfinders guilty? </p>
