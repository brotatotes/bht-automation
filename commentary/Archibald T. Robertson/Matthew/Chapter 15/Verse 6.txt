<p><b> Ye have made void the word of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκυρωσατε τον λογον του θεου</span></span>). It was a stinging indictment that laid bare the hollow pretence of their quibbles about handwashing. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυρος</span></span> means force or authority, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακυρος</span></span> is without authority, null and void. It is a late verb, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακυροω</span></span> but in the LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:17">Galatians 3:17</span>; and in the papyri Adjective, verb, and substantive occur in legal phraseology like cancelling a will, etc. The moral force of God's law is annulled by their hairsplitting technicalities and immoral conduct. </p>
