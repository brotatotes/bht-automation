<p><b> Well did Isaiah prophesy of you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλως επροφητευσεν περ υμων Εσαιας</span></span>). There is sarcasm in this pointed application of Isaiah's words (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:13">Isaiah 29:13</span>) to these rabbis. He "beautifully pictured" them. The portrait was to the very life, "teaching as their doctrines the commandments of men." They were indeed far from God if they imagined that God would be pleased with such gifts at the expense of duty to one's parents. </p>
