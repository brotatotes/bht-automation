<p><b> And they said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε ειπαν</span></span>). They were ready to respond for they knew that popular opinion was divided on that point (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:1">Matthew 14:1</span>). They give four different opinions. It is always a risky thing for a pastor to ask for people's opinions of him. But Jesus was not much concerned by their answers to this question. He knew by now that the Pharisees and Sadducees were bitterly hostile to him. The masses were only superficially following him and they looked for a political Messiah and had vague ideas about him. How much did the disciples understand and how far have they come in their development of faith? Are they still loyal? </p>
