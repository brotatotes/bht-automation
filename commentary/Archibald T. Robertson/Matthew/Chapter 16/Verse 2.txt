<p><b> Fair weather </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδια</span></span>). An old poetic word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ζευς</span></span> as the ruler of the air and giver of fair weather. So men today say "when the sky is red at sunset." It occurs on the Rosetta Stone and in a fourth century A.D. Oxyr. papyrus for "calm weather" that made it impossible to sail the boat. Aleph and B and some other MSS. omit verses 2 and 3. W omits part of verse 2. These verses are similar to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:54-56">Luke 12:54-56</span>. McNeile rejects them here. Westcott and Hort place in brackets. Jesus often repeated his sayings. Zahn suggests that Papias added these words to Matthew. </p>
