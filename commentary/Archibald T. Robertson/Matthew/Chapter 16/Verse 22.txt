<p><b> Peter took him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσλαβομενος αυτον ο Πετρος</span></span>). Middle voice, "taking to himself," aside and apart, "as if by a right of his own. He acted with greater familiarity after the token of acknowledgment had been given. Jesus, however, reduces him to his level" (Bengel). "Peter here appears in a new character; a minute ago speaking under inspiration from heaven, now under inspiration from the opposite quarter" (Bruce). Syriac Sinaitic for <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:32">Mark 8:32</span> has it "as though pitying him." But this exclamation and remonstrance of Peter was soon interrupted by Jesus.</p>
<p><b>God have mercy on thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλεως</span></span>. Supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειη</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστω ο θεος</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>This shall never be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη εστα σο τουτο</span></span>). Strongest kind of negation, as if Peter would not let it happen. Peter had perfect assurance. </p>
