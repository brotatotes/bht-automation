<p><b> Gain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδηση</span></span>) and</p>
<p><b>profit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζημιωθη</span></span>). Both aorist subjunctives (one active, the other passive) and so punctiliar action, condition of third class, undetermined, but with prospect of determination. Just a supposed case. The verb for "forfeit" occurs in the sense of being fined or mulcted of money. So the papyri and inscriptions.</p>
<p><b>Exchange </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανταλλαγμα</span></span>). As an exchange, accusative in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span>. The soul has no market price, though the devil thinks so. "A man must give, surrender, his life, and nothing less to God; no <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανταλλαγμα</span></span> is possible" (McNeile). This word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανταλλαγμα</span></span> occurs twice in the <i>Wisdom of Sirach</i>: "There is no exchange for a faithful friend" (6:15); "There is no exchange for a well-instructed soul" (26:14). </p>
