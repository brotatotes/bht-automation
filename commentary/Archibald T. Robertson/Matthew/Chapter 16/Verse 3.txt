<p><b> Lowring </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στυγναζων</span></span>). A sky covered with clouds. Used also of a gloomy countenance as of the rich young ruler in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:22">Mark 10:22</span>. Nowhere else in the New Testament. This very sign of a rainy day we use today. The word for "foul weather" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειμων</span></span>) is the common one for winter and a storm.</p>
<p><b>The signs of the times </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα σημεια των καιρων</span></span>). How little the Pharisees and Sadducees understood the situation. Soon Jerusalem would be destroyed and the Jewish state overturned. It is not always easy to discern (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακρινειν</span></span>, discriminate) the signs of our own time. Men are numerous with patent keys to it all. But we ought not to be blind when others are gullible. </p>
