<p><b> Came </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελθοντες</span></span>). Probably= "went" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:20">Luke 15:20</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιρε</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ςενιρε</span></span>). So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:13">Mark 8:13</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηλθεν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Forgot </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επελαθοντο</span></span>). Perhaps in the hurry to leave Galilee, probably in the same boat by which they came across from Decapolis. </p>
