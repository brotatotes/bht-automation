Jesus asks four pungent questions about the intellectual dulness, refers to the feeding of the five thousand and uses the word κοφινους (Matthew 14:20) for it and σφυριδας for the four thousand (Matthew 15:37), and repeats his warning (Matthew 16:11). Every teacher understands this strain upon the patience of this Teacher of teachers.
