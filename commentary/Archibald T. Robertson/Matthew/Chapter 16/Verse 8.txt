<p>Jesus asks four pungent questions about the intellectual dulness, refers to the feeding of the five thousand and uses the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοφινους</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:20">Matthew 14:20</span>) for it and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφυριδας</span></span> for the four thousand (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:37">Matthew 15:37</span>), and repeats his warning (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:11">Matthew 16:11</span>). Every teacher understands this strain upon the patience of this Teacher of teachers. </p>
