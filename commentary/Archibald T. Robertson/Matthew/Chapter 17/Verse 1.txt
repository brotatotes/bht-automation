<p><b> After six days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεθ' ημερας εξ</span></span>). This could be on the sixth day, but as Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:28">Luke 9:28</span>) puts it "about eight days" one naturally thinks of a week as the probable time, though it is not important.</p>
<p><b>Taketh with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαμβανε</span></span>). Literally,</p>
<p><b>takes along </b>. Note historical present. These three disciples form an inner group who have shown more understanding of Jesus. So at Gethsemane.</p>
<p><b>Apart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ' ιδιαν</span></span>) means "by themselves" (<b>alone </b>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονους</span></span>, Mark has it) up (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναφερε</span></span>) into a high mountain, probably Mount Hermon again, though we do not really know. "The Mount of Transfiguration does not concern geography" (Holtzmann). </p>
