<p><b> Elijah must first come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ελειαν δε ελθειν πρωτον</span></span>). So this piece of theology concerned them more than anything else. They had just seen Elijah, but Jesus the Messiah had come before Elijah. The scribes used <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:5">Malachi 4:5</span>. Jesus had also spoken again of his death (resurrection). So they are puzzled. </p>
