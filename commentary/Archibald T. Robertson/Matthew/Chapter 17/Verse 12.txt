<p><b> Elijah is come already </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ελειας ηδη ηλθεν</span></span>). Thus Jesus identifies John the Baptist with the promise in Malachi, though not the real Elijah in person which John denied (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:21">John 1:21</span>).</p>
<p><b>They knew him not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ επιγνωσαν αυτον</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγινωσκω</span></span>, to recognize. Just as they do not know Jesus now (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:26">John 1:26</span>). They killed John as they will Jesus the Son of Man. </p>
