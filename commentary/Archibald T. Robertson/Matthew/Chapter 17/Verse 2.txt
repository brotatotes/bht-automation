 He was transfigured before them  (μετεμορφωθη εμπροσθεν αυτων). The word is the same as the metamorphoses (cf. Ovid) of pagan mythology. Luke does not use it. The idea is change (μετα-) of form (μορφη). It really presents the essence of a thing as separate from the σχημα (fashion), the outward accident. So in Romans 12:2 Paul uses both verbs, συνσχεματιζεσθε (be not fashioned) and μεταμορφουσθε (be ye transformed in your inner life). So in 1 Corinthians 7:31 σχημα is used for the fashion of the world while in Mark 16:12 μορφη is used of the form of Jesus after his resurrection. The false apostles are described by μετασχηματισομα in 2 Corinthians 11:13-15. In Philippians 2:6 we have εν μορφη used of the Preincarnate state of Christ and μορφην δουλου of the Incarnate state (Philippians 2:7), while σχηματ ως ανθρωπος emphasizes his being found "in fashion as a man." But it will not do in Matthew 17:2 to use the English transliteration μεταμορφωσις because of its pagan associations. So the Latin transfigured (Vulgate transfiguratus est) is better. "The deeper force of μεταμορφουσθα is seen in 2 Corinthians 3:18 (with reference to the shining on Moses' face), Romans 12:2" (McNeile). The word occurs in a second-century papyrus of the pagan gods who are invisible. Matthew guards against the pagan idea by adding and explaining about the face of Christ "as the sun" and his garments "as the light."
