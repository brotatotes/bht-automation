<p><b> He was transfigured before them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετεμορφωθη εμπροσθεν αυτων</span></span>). The word is the same as the metamorphoses (cf. Ovid) of pagan mythology. Luke does not use it. The idea is change (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα-</span></span>) of form (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μορφη</span></span>). It really presents the essence of a thing as separate from the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχημα</span></span> (fashion), the outward accident. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:2">Romans 12:2</span> Paul uses both verbs, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνσχεματιζεσθε</span></span> (be not fashioned) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταμορφουσθε</span></span> (be ye transformed in your inner life). So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:31">1 Corinthians 7:31</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχημα</span></span> is used for the fashion of the world while in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:12">Mark 16:12</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μορφη</span></span> is used of the form of Jesus after his resurrection. The false apostles are described by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετασχηματισομα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:13-15">2 Corinthians 11:13-15</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν μορφη</span></span> used of the Preincarnate state of Christ and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μορφην δουλου</span></span> of the Incarnate state (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>), while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχηματ ως ανθρωπος</span></span> emphasizes his being found "in fashion as a man." But it will not do in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:2">Matthew 17:2</span> to use the English transliteration <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταμορφωσις</span></span> because of its pagan associations. So the Latin <i>transfigured</i> (Vulgate <i>transfiguratus est</i>) is better. "The deeper force of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταμορφουσθα</span></span> is seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span> (with reference to the shining on Moses' face), <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:2">Romans 12:2</span>" (McNeile). The word occurs in a second-century papyrus of the pagan gods who are invisible. Matthew guards against the pagan idea by adding and explaining about the face of Christ "as the sun" and his garments "as the light." </p>
