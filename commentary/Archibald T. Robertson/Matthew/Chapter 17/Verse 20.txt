<p><b> Little faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολιγοπιστιαν</span></span>). A good translation. It was less than "a grain of mustard seed" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοκκον σιναπεως</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:31">Matthew 13:31</span> for this phrase. They had no miracle faith. Bruce holds "this mountain" to be the Mount of Transfiguration to which Jesus pointed. Probably so. But it is a parable. Our trouble is always with "this mountain" which confronts our path. Note the form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταβα</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βηθ</span></span>). </p>
