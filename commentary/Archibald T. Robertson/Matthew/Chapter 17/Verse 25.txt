<p><b> Jesus spake first to him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προεφθασεν αυτον ο Ιησους λεγων</span></span>). Here only in the N.T. One example in a papyrus B.C. 161 (Moulton and Milligan, <i>Vocabulary</i>). The old idiomatic use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθανω</span></span> with the participle survives in this example of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφθανω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:25">Matthew 17:25</span>, meaning to anticipate, to get before one in doing a thing. The <i>Koine</i> uses the infinitive thus with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθανω</span></span> which has come to mean simply to arrive. Here the anticipation is made plain by the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ-</span></span>. See Robertson's <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1120. The "prevent" of the Authorized Version was the original idea of <i>praevenire</i>, to go before, to anticipate. Peter felt obliged to take the matter up with Jesus. But the Master had observed what was going on and spoke to Peter first.</p>
<p><b>Toll or tribute </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελη η κηνσον</span></span>). Customs or wares collected by the publicans (like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορος</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:7">Romans 13:7</span>) and also the capitation tax on persons, indirect and direct taxation. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κηνσος</span></span> is the Latin <i>census</i>, a registration for the purpose of the appraisement of property like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η απογραφη</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:2">Luke 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:37">Acts 5:37</span>. By this parable Jesus as the Son of God claims exemption from the temple tax as the temple of his Father just as royal families do not pay taxes, but get tribute from the foreigners or aliens, subjects in reality. </p>
