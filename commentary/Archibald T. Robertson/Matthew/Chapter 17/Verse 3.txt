<p><b> There appeared </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφθη</span></span>). Singular aorist passive verb with Moses (to be understood also with Elijah), but the participle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνλαλουντες</span></span> is plural agreeing with both. "Sufficient objectivity is guaranteed by the vision being enjoyed by all three" (Bruce). The Jewish apocalypses reveal popular expectations that Moses and Elijah would reappear. Both had mystery connected with their deaths. One represented law, the other prophecy, while Jesus represented the gospel (grace). They spoke of his decease (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:31">Luke 9:31</span>), the cross, the theme uppermost in the mind of Christ and which the disciples did not comprehend. Jesus needed comfort and he gets it from fellowship with Moses and Elijah. </p>
