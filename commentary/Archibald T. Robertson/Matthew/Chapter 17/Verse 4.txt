<p><b> And Peter answered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκριθεις δε ο Πετρος</span></span>). "Peter to the front again, but not greatly to his credit" (Bruce). It is not clear what Peter means by his saying: "It is good for us to be here" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλον εστιν ημας ωδε εινα</span></span>). Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:33">Luke 9:33</span>) adds "not knowing what he said," as they "were heavy with sleep." So it is not well to take Peter too seriously on this occasion. At any rate he makes a definite proposal.</p>
<p><b>I will make </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιησω</span></span>). Future indicative though aorist subjunctive has same form.</p>
<p><b>Tabernacles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκηνας</span></span>), booths. The Feast of Tabernacles was not far away. Peter may have meant that they should just stay up here on the mountain and not go to Jerusalem for the feast. </p>
