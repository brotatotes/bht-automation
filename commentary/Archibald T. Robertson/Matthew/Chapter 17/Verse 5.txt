<p><b> Overshadowed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεσκιασεν</span></span>). They were up in cloud-land that swept round and over them. See this verb used of Mary (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:35">Luke 1:35</span>) and of Peter's shadow (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:15">Acts 5:15</span>).</p>
<p><b>This is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος εστιν</span></span>). At the baptism (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>) these words were addressed to Jesus. Here the voice out of the bright cloud speaks to them about Jesus.</p>
<p><b>Hear ye him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουετε αυτου</span></span>). Even when he speaks about his death. A sharp rebuke to Peter for his consolation to Jesus about his death. </p>
