<p><b>Their angels </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αγγελο αυτων</span></span>). The Jews believed that each nation had a guardian angel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+10:13">Daniel 10:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+10:20">Daniel 10:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1">Daniel 12:1</span>). The seven churches in Revelation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>) have angels, each of them, whatsoever the meaning is. Does Jesus mean to teach here that each little child or child of faith had a special angel who appears in God's presence, "see the face of my Father" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπουσιν το προσωπον του πατρος μου</span></span>) in special intimacy? Or does he simply mean that the angels do take an interest in the welfare of God's people (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>)? There is comfort to us in that thought. Certainly Jesus means that the Father takes special care of his "little ones" who believe in Him. There are angels in God's presence (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:19">Luke 1:19</span>). </p>
