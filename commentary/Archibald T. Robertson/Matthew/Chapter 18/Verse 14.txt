 The will of your Father  (θελημα εμπροσθεν). Observe that Westcott and Hort read μου here rather than υμων after B Sahidic Coptic. Either makes good sense, though "your" carries on the picture of God's care for "each one of these little ones" (εν των μικρων τουτων) among God's children. The use of εμπροσθεν with θελημα is a Hebraism like εμπροσθεν σου in Matthew 11:25 with ευδοκια, "before the face" of God.
