<p><b> The will of your Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελημα εμπροσθεν</span></span>). Observe that Westcott and Hort read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μου</span></span> here rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμων</span></span> after B Sahidic Coptic. Either makes good sense, though "your" carries on the picture of God's care for "each one of these little ones" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν των μικρων τουτων</span></span>) among God's children. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπροσθεν</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελημα</span></span> is a Hebraism like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπροσθεν σου</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδοκια</span></span>, "before the face" of God. </p>
