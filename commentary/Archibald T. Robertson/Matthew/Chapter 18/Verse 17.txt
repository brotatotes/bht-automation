<p><b> Refuse to hear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακουση</span></span>). Like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:12">Isaiah 65:12</span>. Many papyri examples for ignoring, disregarding, hearing without heeding, hearing aside (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα-</span></span>), hearing amiss, overhearing (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:36">Mark 5:36</span>).</p>
<p><b>The church </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εκκλησια</span></span>). The local body, not the general as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> which see for discussion. The problem here is whether Jesus has in mind an actual body of believers already in existence or is speaking prophetically of the local churches that would be organized later (as in Acts). There are some who think that the Twelve Apostles constituted a local <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλησια</span></span>, a sort of moving church of preachers. That could only be true in essence as they were a band of ministers and not located in any one place. Bruce holds that they were "the nucleus" of a local church at any rate. </p>
