Future passive periphrastic perfect indicative as in "shall be loosed" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστα λελυμενα</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span> this same unusual form occurs. The binding and the loosing is there addressed to Peter, but it is here repeated for the church or for the disciples as the case may be. </p>
