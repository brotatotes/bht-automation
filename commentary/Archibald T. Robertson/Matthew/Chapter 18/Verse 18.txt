 Shall be bound in heaven  (εστα δεδεμενα εν ουρανω). Future passive periphrastic perfect indicative as in "shall be loosed" (εστα λελυμενα). In Matthew 16:19 this same unusual form occurs. The binding and the loosing is there addressed to Peter, but it is here repeated for the church or for the disciples as the case may be.
