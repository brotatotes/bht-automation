<p><b> There am I </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκε ειμ</span></span>). This blessed promise implies that those gathered together are really disciples with the spirit of Christ as well as "in his name" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το εμον ονομα</span></span>). One of the Oxyrhynchus <i>Sayings of Our Lord</i> is: "Wherever there are (two) they are not without God, and wherever there is one alone I say I am with him." Also this: "Raise the stone and there thou shalt find me, cleave the wood and there am I." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:16">Malachi 3:16</span>. </p>
