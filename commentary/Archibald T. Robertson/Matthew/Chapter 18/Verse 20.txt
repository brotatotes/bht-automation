 There am I  (εκε ειμ). This blessed promise implies that those gathered together are really disciples with the spirit of Christ as well as "in his name" (εις το εμον ονομα). One of the Oxyrhynchus Sayings of Our Lord is: "Wherever there are (two) they are not without God, and wherever there is one alone I say I am with him." Also this: "Raise the stone and there thou shalt find me, cleave the wood and there am I." See Malachi 3:16.
