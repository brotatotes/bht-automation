<p><b> Until seven times? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως επτακισ?</span></span>) Peter thought that he was generous as the Jewish rule was three times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="am+1:6">Amos 1:6</span>). His question goes back to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:15">Matthew 18:15</span>. "Against me" is genuine here. "The man who asks such a question does not really know what forgiveness means" (Plummer). </p>
