<p><b> Until seventy times seven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως εβδομηκοντακις επτα</span></span>). It is not clear whether this idiom means seventy-seven or as the Revised Version has it (490 times). If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επτακις</span></span> were written it would clearly be 490 times. The same ambiguity is seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:24">Genesis 4:24</span>, the LXX text by omitting <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>. In the <i>Test. of the Twelve Patriarchs, Benj.</i> vii. 4, it is used in the sense of seventy times seven. But it really makes little difference because Jesus clearly means unlimited forgiveness in either case. "The unlimited revenge of primitive man has given place to the unlimited forgiveness of Christians" (McNeile). </p>
