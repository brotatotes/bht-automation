 Make a reckoning  (συναρα λογον). Seen also in Matthew 25:19. Perhaps a Latinism, rationes conferre. First aorist active infinitive of συναιρω, to cast up accounts, to settle, to compare accounts with. Not in ancient Greek writers, but in two papyri of the second century A.D. in the very sense here and the substantive appears in an ostracon from Nubia of the early third century (Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East, p. 117).
