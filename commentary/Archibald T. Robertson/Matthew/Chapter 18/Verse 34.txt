The papyri give various instances of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασανιζω</span></span>, to torture, used of slaves and others. "Livy (ii. 23) pictures an old centurion complaining that he was taken by his creditor, not into servitude, but to a workhouse and torture, and showing his back scarred with fresh wounds" (Vincent).</p>
<p><b>Till he should pay all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως [ου] αποδω παν</span></span>). Just as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:30">Matthew 18:30</span>, his very words. But this is not purgatorial, but punitive, for he could never pay back that vast debt. </p>
