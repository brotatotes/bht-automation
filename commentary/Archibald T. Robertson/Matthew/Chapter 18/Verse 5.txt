<p><b> In my name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τω ονοματ μου</span></span>). For "one such little child" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανψ βελιεςερ ιν Χριστ</span></span>) Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:48">Luke 9:48</span>) has "this little child" as a representative or symbol. "On the basis or ground of my name," "for my sake." Very much like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ονομα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:41">Matthew 10:41</span> which does not differ greatly from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ονοματ</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:48">Acts 10:48</span>). </p>
