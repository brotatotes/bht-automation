<p><b> These little ones </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των μικρων τουτων</span></span>). In the same sense as "one such little one" above. The child is the type of believers.</p>
<p><b>A great millstone </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυλος ονικος</span></span>), literally, "a millstone turned by an ass." The upper millstone was turned by an ass (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονος</span></span>). There were no examples of the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονικος</span></span> (turned by an ass) outside the N.T. until the papyri revealed several for loads requiring an ass to carry them, stones requiring an ass to move them, etc. Deissmann (<i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 81) notes it also in papyri examples about the sale of an ass and tax for an ass's burden of goods.</p>
<p><b>The depth of the sea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω πελαγε της θαλασσης</span></span>). "The sea of the sea." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πελαγος</span></span> probably from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλησσο</span></span>, to beat, and so the beating, splashing waves of the sea. "Far out into the open sea, a vivid substitute for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την θαλασσαν</span></span>" (McNeile). </p>
