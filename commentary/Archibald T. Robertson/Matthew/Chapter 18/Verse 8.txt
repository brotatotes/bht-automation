<p>In verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:8">Matthew 18:8</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:9">Matthew 18:9</span> we have one of the dualities or doublets in Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29-30">Matthew 5:29-30</span>). Jesus repeated his pungent sayings many times. Instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις γεενναν</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29">Matthew 5:29</span>) we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το πυρ το αιωνιον</span></span> and at the end of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:9">Matthew 18:9</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του πυρος</span></span> is added to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την γεενναν</span></span>. This is the first use in Matthew of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιωνιος</span></span>. We have it again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:16">Matthew 19:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:29">Matthew 19:29</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζοη</span></span>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:41">Matthew 25:41</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρ</span></span>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46">Matthew 25:46</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολασιν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζοην</span></span>. The word means ageless, without beginning or end as of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:26">Romans 16:26</span>), without beginning as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>, without end as here and often. The effort to make it mean "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αεονιαν</span></span>" fire will make it mean "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αεονιαν</span></span>" life also. If the punishment is limited, <i>ipso facto</i> the life is shortened. In verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:9">Matthew 18:9</span> also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονοφθαλμον</span></span> occurs. It is an Ionic compound in Herodotus that is condemned by the Atticists, but it is revived in the vernacular <i>Koine</i>. Literally one-eyed. Here only and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:47">Mark 9:47</span> in the New Testament. </p>
