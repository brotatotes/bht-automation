<p><b> He departed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετηρεν</span></span>). Literally, to lift up, change something to another place. Transitive in the LXX and in a Cilician rock inscription. Intransitive in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:53">Matthew 13:53</span> and here, the only N.T. instances. Absence of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εγενετο</span></span>, one of the clear Hebraisms in the N.T. (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1042f.). This verse is a sort of formula in Matthew at the close of important groups of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογια</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:28">Matthew 7:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:1">Matthew 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:53">Matthew 13:53</span>.</p>
<p><b>The borders of Judea beyond Jordan </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τα ορια της Ιουδαιας περαν του Ιορδανου</span></span>). This is a curious expression. It apparently means that Jesus left Galilee to go to Judea by way of Perea as the Galileans often did to avoid Samaria. Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:11">Luke 17:11</span>) expressly says that he passed through Samaria and Galilee when he left Ephraim in Northern Judea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:54">John 11:54</span>). He was not afraid to pass through the edge of Galilee and down the Jordan Valley in Perea on this last journey to Jerusalem. McNeile is needlessly opposed to the trans-Jordanic or Perean aspect of this phase of Christ's work. </p>
