<p><b> The disciples say unto him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγουσιν αυτω ο μαθητα</span></span>). "Christ's doctrine on marriage not only separated Him <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτο χαελο</span></span> from Pharisaic opinions of all shades, but was too high even for the Twelve" (Bruce).</p>
<p><b>The case </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αιτια</span></span>). The word may refer to the use in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:3">Matthew 19:3</span> "for every cause." It may have a vague idea here = <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρες</span></span>, condition. But the point clearly is that "it is not expedient to marry" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου συμφερε γαμησα</span></span>) if such a strict view is held. If the bond is so tight a man had best not commit matrimony. It is a bit unusual to have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυνη</span></span> contrasted rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηρ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυνη</span></span>. </p>
