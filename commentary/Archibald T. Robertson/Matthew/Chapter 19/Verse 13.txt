<p><b> Rebuked them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επετιμησεν αυτοις</span></span>). No doubt people did often crowd around Jesus for a touch of his hand and his blessing. The disciples probably felt that they were doing Jesus a kindness. How little they understood children and Jesus. It is a tragedy to make children feel that they are in the way at home and at church. These men were the twelve apostles and yet had no vision of Christ's love for little children. The new child world of today is due directly to Jesus. </p>
