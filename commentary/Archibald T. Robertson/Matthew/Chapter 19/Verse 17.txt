<p><b> Concerning that which is good </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ του αγαθου</span></span>). He had asked Jesus in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:16">Matthew 19:16</span> "what good thing" he should do. He evidently had a light idea of the meaning of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθος</span></span>. "This was only a teacher's way of leading on a pupil" (Bruce). So Jesus explains that "One there is who is good," one alone who is really good in the absolute sense. </p>
