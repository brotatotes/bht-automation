 Concerning that which is good  (περ του αγαθου). He had asked Jesus in verse Matthew 19:16 "what good thing" he should do. He evidently had a light idea of the meaning of αγαθος. "This was only a teacher's way of leading on a pupil" (Bruce). So Jesus explains that "One there is who is good," one alone who is really good in the absolute sense.
