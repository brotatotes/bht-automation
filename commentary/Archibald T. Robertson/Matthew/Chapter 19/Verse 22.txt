<p><b> Went away sorrowful </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηλθεν λυπουμενος</span></span>). "Went away grieved." He felt that Jesus had asked too much of him. He worshipped money more than God when put to the test. Does Jesus demand this same test of every one? Not unless he is in the grip of money. Different persons are in the power of different sins. One sin is enough to keep one away from Christ. </p>
