<p><b> It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευκοπωτερον εστιν καμηλον δια τρηματος ραφιδος εισελθειν</span></span>). Jesus, of course, means by this comparison, whether an eastern proverb or not, to express the impossible. The efforts to explain it away are jejune like a ship's cable, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καμιλον</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραφις</span></span> as a narrow gorge or gate of entrance for camels which recognized stooping, etc. All these are hopeless, for Jesus pointedly calls the thing "impossible" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:26">Matthew 19:26</span>). The Jews in the Babylonian Talmud did have a proverb that a man even in his dreams did not see an elephant pass through the eye of a needle (Vincent). The Koran speaks of the wicked finding the gates of heaven shut "till a camel shall pass through the eye of a needle." But the Koran may have got this figure from the New Testament. The word for an ordinary needle is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραφις</span></span>, but, Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:25">Luke 18:25</span>) employs <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βελονη</span></span>, the medical term for the surgical needle not elsewhere in the N.T. </p>
