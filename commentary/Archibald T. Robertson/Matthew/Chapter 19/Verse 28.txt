<p><b> In the regeneration </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη παλινγενεσια</span></span>). The new birth of the world is to be fulfilled when Jesus sits on his throne of glory. This word was used by the Stoics and the Pythagoreans. It is common also in the mystery religions (Angus, <i>Mystery Religions and Christianity</i>, pp. 95ff.). It is in the papyri also. We must put no fantastic ideas into the mouth of Jesus. But he did look for the final consummation of his kingdom. What is meant by the disciples also sitting on twelve thrones is not clear. </p>
