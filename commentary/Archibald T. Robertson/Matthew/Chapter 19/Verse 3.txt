<p><b> Pharisees tempting him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φαρισαιο πειραζοντες αυτον</span></span>). They "could not ask a question of Jesus without sinister motives" (Bruce). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:1">Matthew 4:1</span> for the word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>For every cause </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα πασαν αιτιαν</span></span>). This clause is an allusion to the dispute between the two theological schools over the meaning of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+24:1">Deuteronomy 24:1</span>. The school of Shammai took the strict and unpopular view of divorce for unchastity alone while the school of Hillel took the liberal and popular view of easy divorce for any passing whim if the husband saw a prettier woman (modern enough surely) or burnt his biscuits for breakfast. It was a pretty dilemma and meant to do Jesus harm with the people. There is no real trouble about the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> here in the sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προπτερ</span></span> or because of (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 509). </p>
