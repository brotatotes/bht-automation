 Shall cleave  (κολληθησετα). First future passive, "shall be glued to," the verb means.The twain shall become one flesh  (εσοντα ο δυο εις σαρκα μιαν). This use of εις after ειμ is an imitation of the Hebrew, though a few examples occur in the older Greek and in the papyri. The frequency of it is due to the Hebrew and here the LXX is a direct translation of the Hebrew idiom.
