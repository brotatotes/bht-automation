<p><b> Shall cleave </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολληθησετα</span></span>). First future passive, "shall be glued to," the verb means.</p>
<p><b>The twain shall become one flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσοντα ο δυο εις σαρκα μιαν</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span> is an imitation of the Hebrew, though a few examples occur in the older Greek and in the papyri. The frequency of it is due to the Hebrew and here the LXX is a direct translation of the Hebrew idiom. </p>
