<p><b> Opening their treasures </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιξαντες τους θησαυρους αυτων</span></span>). Here "treasures" means "caskets" from the verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>), receptacle for valuables. In the ancient writers it meant "treasury" as in 1Macc. 3:29. So a "storehouse" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:52">Matthew 13:52</span>. Then it means the things laid up in store, treasure in heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:20">Matthew 6:20</span>), in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:3">Colossians 2:3</span>). In their "caskets" the Magi had gold, frankincense, and myrrh, all found at that time in Arabia, though gold was found in Babylon and elsewhere. </p>
