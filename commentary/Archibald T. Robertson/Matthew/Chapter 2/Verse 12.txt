<p><b> Warned in a dream </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρηματισθεντες κατ' οναρ</span></span>). The verb means to transact business (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρηματιζω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρημα</span></span>, and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χραομα</span></span>, to use. Then to consult, to deliberate, to make answer as of magistrates or an oracle, to instruct, to admonish. In the Septuagint and the New Testament it occurs with the idea of being warned by God and also in the papyri (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 122). Wycliff puts it here: "An answer taken in sleep." </p>
