<p><b> Slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανειλεν παντας τους παιδας τους εν Βηθλεεμ</span></span>). The flight of Joseph was justified, for Herod was violently enraged (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθυμωθη λιαν</span></span>) that he had been mocked by the Magi, deluded in fact (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεπαιχθη</span></span>). Vulgate <i>illusus esset</i>. Herod did not know, of course, how old the child was, but he took no chances and included all the little boys (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους παιδας</span></span>, masculine article) in Bethlehem two years old and under, perhaps fifteen or twenty. It is no surprise that Josephus makes no note of this small item in Herod's chamber of horrors. It was another fulfilment of the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:15">Jeremiah 31:15</span>. The quotation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:18">Matthew 2:18</span>) seems to be from the Septuagint. It was originally written of the Babylonian captivity but it has a striking illustration in this case also. Macrobius (<i>Sat</i>. II. iv. II) notes that Augustus said that it was better to be Herod's sow (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υς</span></span>) than his son (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος</span></span>), for the sow had a better chance of life. </p>
