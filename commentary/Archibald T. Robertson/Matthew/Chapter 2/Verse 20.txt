<p><b> For they are dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεθνηκασιν</span></span>). Only Herod had sought to kill the young child, but it is a general statement of a particular fact as is common with people who say: "They say." The idiom may be suggested by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:19">Exodus 4:19</span>: "For all are dead that sought thy life." </p>
