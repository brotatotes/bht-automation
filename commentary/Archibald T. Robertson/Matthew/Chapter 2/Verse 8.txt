 Sent them to Bethlehem and said  (πεμψας αυτους εις Βηθλεεμ ειπεν). Simultaneous aorist participle, "sending said." They were to "search out accurately" (εξετασατε ακριβως) concerning the child. Then "bring me word, that I also may come and worship him." The deceit of Herod seemed plausible enough and might have succeeded but for God's intervention to protect His Son from the jealous rage of Herod.
