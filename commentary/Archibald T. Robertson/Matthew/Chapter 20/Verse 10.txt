<p><b> Every man a penny </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα δηναριον κα αυτο</span></span>). Literally, "themselves also a denarius apiece" (distributive use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανα</span></span>). Bruce asks if this householder was a humorist when he began to pay off the last first and paid each one a denarius according to agreement. False hopes had been raised in those who came first who got only what they had agreed to receive. </p>
