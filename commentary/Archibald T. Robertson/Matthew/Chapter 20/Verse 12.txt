<p><b> Equal unto us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισους αυτους ημιν</span></span>). Associative instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημιν</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισους</span></span>. It was a regular protest against the supposed injustice of the householder.</p>
<p><b>The burden of the day and the scorching wind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το βαρος της ημερας κα τον καυσωνα</span></span>). These last "did" work for one hour. Apparently they worked as hard as any while at it. A whole day's work on the part of these sweat-stained men who had stood also the sirocco, the hot, dry, dust-laden east wind that blasted the grain in Pharaoh's dream (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+41:6">Genesis 41:6</span>), that withered Jonah's gourd (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jon+4:8">Jonah 4:8</span>), that blighted the vine in Ezekiel's parable (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+17:10">Ezekiel 17:10</span>). They seemed to have a good case. </p>
