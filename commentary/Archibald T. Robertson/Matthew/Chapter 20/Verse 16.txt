<p><b> The last first and the first last </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εσχατο πρωτο κα ο πρωτο εσχατο</span></span>). The adjectives change places as compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:30">Matthew 19:30</span>. The point is the same, though this order suits the parable better. After all one's work does not rest wholly on the amount of time spent on it. "Even so hath Rabbi Bun bar Chija in twenty-eight years wrought more than many studious scholars in a hundred years" (Jer. <i>Berak.</i> ii. 5c). </p>
