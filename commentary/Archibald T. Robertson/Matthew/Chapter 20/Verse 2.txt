<p><b> For a penny a day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ δηναριου την ημεραν</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:28">Matthew 18:28</span>. "Penny" is not adequate, "shilling" Moffatt has it. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> with the ablative represents the agreement (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνφωνησας</span></span>) with the workmen (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργατων</span></span>). "The day" the Greek has it, an accusative of extent of time. </p>
