<p><b> Then </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε</span></span>). Surely an inopportune time for such a request just after the pointed prediction of Christ's crucifixion. Perhaps their minds had been preoccupied with the words of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>) about their sitting on twelve thrones taking them in a literal sense. The mother of James and John, probably Salome, possibly a sister of the Master's mother (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:25">John 19:25</span>), apparently prompted her two sons because of the family relationship and now speaks for them.</p>
<p><b>Asking a certain thing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιτουσα τ</span></span>). "Asking something," "plotting perhaps when their Master was predicting" (Bruce). The "something" put forward as a small matter was simply the choice of the two chief thrones promised by Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>). </p>
