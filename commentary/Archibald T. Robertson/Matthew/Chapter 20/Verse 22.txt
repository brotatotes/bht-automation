 Ye know not what ye ask  (ουκ οιδατε τ αιτεισθε). How often that is true. Αιτεισθε is indirect middle voice, "ask for yourselves," "a selfish request."We are able  (δυναμεθα). Amazing proof of their ignorance and self-confidence. Ambition had blinded their eyes. They had not caught the martyr spirit.
