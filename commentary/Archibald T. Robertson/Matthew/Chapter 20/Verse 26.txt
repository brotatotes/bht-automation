<p><b> Would become great </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος αν θελη μεγας γενεσθα</span></span>). Jesus does not condemn the desire to become great. It is a laudable ambition. There are "great ones" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγαλο</span></span>) among Christians as among pagans, but they do not "lord it over" one another (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακυριευουσιν</span></span>), a LXX word and very expressive, or "play the tyrant" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεξουσιαζουσιν</span></span>), another suggestive word.</p>
<p><b>Your minister </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμων διακονος</span></span>). This word may come from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κονις</span></span> (dust), to raise a dust by one's hurry, and so to minister. It is a general word for servant and is used in a variety of ways including the technical sense of our "deacon" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>. But it more frequently is applied to ministers of the Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5">1 Corinthians 3:5</span>). The way to be "first" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτος</span></span>), says Jesus, is to be your "servant" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span>), "bond-servant" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:27">Matthew 20:27</span>). This is a complete reversal of popular opinion then and now. </p>
