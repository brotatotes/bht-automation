<p><b> From Jericho </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο Ιερειχω</span></span>). So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:46">Mark 10:46</span>. But Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:35">Luke 18:35</span>) places the incident as they were drawing near to Jericho (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Ιερειχω</span></span>). It is probable that Mark and Matthew refer to the old Jericho, the ruins of which have been discovered, while Luke alludes to the new Roman Jericho. The two blind men were apparently between the two towns. Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:46">Mark 10:46</span>) and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:35">Luke 18:35</span>) mention only one blind man, Bartimaeus (Mark). In Kentucky there are two towns about a half mile apart both called Pleasureville (one Old Pleasureville, the other New Pleasureville). </p>
