<p><b> That Jesus was passing by </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ Ιησους παραγε</span></span>). These men "were sitting by the wayside" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθημενο παρα τεν οδον</span></span>) at their regular stand. They heard the crowd yelling that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραγε</span></span>, present indicative of direct discourse retained in the indirect). It was their one opportunity, now or never. They had heard of what he had done for other blind men. They hail him as "the son of David" (the Messiah). It is just one of many such incidents when Jesus stood still and opened their eyes, so many that even the multitude was impatient with the cries of these poor men that their eyes be opened (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιγωσιν</span></span>, second aorist passive subjunctive). </p>
