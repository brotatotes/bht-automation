<p><b> Unto Bethphage </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Βεθφαγη</span></span>). An indeclinable Aramaic name here only in O.T. or N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:1">Mark 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:29">Luke 19:29</span>). It means "house of unripe young figs." It apparently lay on the eastern slope of Olivet or at the foot of the mountain, a little further from Jerusalem than Bethany. Both Mark and Luke speak of Christ's coming "unto Bethphage and Bethany" as if Bethphage was reached first. It is apparently larger than Bethany.</p>
<p><b>Unto the Mount of Olives </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ορος των Ελαιων</span></span>). Matthew has thus three instances of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> with Jerusalem, Mount of Olives. Mark and Luke use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> with Mount of Olives, the Mount of Olive trees (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαιων</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαια</span></span>, olive tree), the mountain covered with olive trees. </p>
