<p><b> Hearest thou </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουεις</span></span>). In a rage at the desecration of the temple by the shouts of the boys they try to shame Jesus, as responsible for it. </p>
<p><b> Thou hast perfected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηρτισω</span></span>). The quotation is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:3">Psalms 8:3</span> (LXX text). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:21">Matthew 4:21</span> where the same verb is used for mending nets. Here it is the timeless aorist middle indicative with the perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα-</span></span>. It was a stinging rebuke. </p>
