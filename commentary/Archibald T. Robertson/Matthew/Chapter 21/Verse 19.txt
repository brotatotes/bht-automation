<p><b> A fig tree </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συκην μιαν</span></span>). "A single fig tree" (Margin of Rev. Version). But <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> was often used = <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις</span></span> or like our indefinite article. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:10">Matthew 8:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:69">Matthew 26:69</span>. The Greek has strictly no indefinite article as the Latin has no definite article.</p>
<p><b>Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μηκετ σου καρπος γενητα εις τον αιωνα</span></span>). Strictly speaking this is a prediction, not a prohibition or wish as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:14">Mark 11:14</span> (optative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαγο</span></span>). "On you no fruit shall ever grow again" (Weymouth). The double negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span> with the aorist subjunctive (or future indicative) is the strongest kind of negative prediction. It sometimes amounts to a prohibition like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> and the future indicative (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 926f.). The early figs start in spring before the leaves and develop after the leaves. The main fig crop was early autumn (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:14">Mark 11:14</span>). There should have been figs on the tree with the crop of leaves. It was a vivid object lesson. Matthew does not distinguish between the two mornings as Mark does (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:13">Mark 11:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:20">Mark 11:20</span>), but says "immediately" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραχρημα</span></span>) twice (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:19">Matthew 21:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:20">Matthew 21:20</span>). This word is really <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα το χρημα</span></span> like our "on the spot" (Thayer). It occurs in the papyri in monetary transactions for immediate cash payment. </p>
