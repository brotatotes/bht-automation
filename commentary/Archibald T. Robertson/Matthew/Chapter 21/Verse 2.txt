<p><b> Into the village that is over against you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την κωμην την κατεναντ υμων</span></span>). Another use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>. If it means "into" as translated, it could be Bethany right across the valley and this is probably the idea.</p>
<p><b>And a colt with her </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα πωλον μετ' αυτης</span></span>). The young of any animal. Here to come with the mother and the more readily so. </p>
