<p><b> Doubt not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη διακριθητε</span></span>). First aorist passive subjunctive, second-class condition. To be divided in mind, to waver, to doubt, the opposite of "faith" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστιν</span></span>), trust, confidence.</p>
<p><b>What is done to the fig tree </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το της συκης</span></span>). The Greek means "the matter of the fig tree," as if a slight matter in comparison with</p>
<p><b>this mountain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω ορε τουτω</span></span>). Removing a mountain is a bigger task than blighting a fig tree. "The cursing of the fig-tree has always been regarded as of symbolic import, the tree being in Christ's mind an emblem of the Jewish people, with a great show of religion and no fruit of real godliness. This hypothesis is very credible" (Bruce). Plummer follows Zahn in referring it to the Holy City. Certainly "this mountain" is a parable and one already reported in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:20">Matthew 17:20</span> (cf. sycamine tree in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:6">Luke 17:6</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+17:4">Zechariah 17:4</span>. </p>
