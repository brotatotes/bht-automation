<p><b> I will not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου θελω</span></span>). So many old manuscripts, though the Vatican manuscript (B) has the order of the two sons reversed. Logically the "I, sir" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω, κυριε</span></span>) suits better for the second son (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:30">Matthew 21:30</span>) with a reference to the blunt refusal of the first. So also the manuscripts differ in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:31">Matthew 21:31</span> between the first (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πρωτος</span></span>) and the last (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο υστερος</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσχατος</span></span>). But the one who actually did the will of the father is the one who</p>
<p><b>repented and went </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταμεληθεις απηλθεν</span></span>). This word really means "repent," to be sorry afterwards, and must be sharply distinguished from the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοεω</span></span> used 34 times in the N.T. as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοια</span></span> used 24 times as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:8">Matthew 3:8</span>. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταμελομα</span></span> occurs in the N.T. only five times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:29">Matthew 21:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:32">Matthew 21:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:3">Matthew 27:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:8">2 Corinthians 7:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:21">Hebrews 7:21</span> from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+109:4">Psalms 109:4</span>). Paul distinguishes sharply between mere sorrow and the act "repentance" which he calls <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοιαν</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:9">2 Corinthians 7:9</span>). In the case of Judas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:3">Matthew 27:3</span>) it was mere remorse. Here the boy got sorry for his stubborn refusal to obey his father and went and obeyed. Godly sorrow leads to repentance (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοιαν</span></span>), but mere sorrow is not repentance. </p>
