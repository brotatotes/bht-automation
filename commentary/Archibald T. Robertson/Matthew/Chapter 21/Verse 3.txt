<p><b> The Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κυριος</span></span>). It is not clear how the word would be understood here by those who heard the message though it is plain that Jesus applies it to himself. The word is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυρος</span></span>, power or authority. In the LXX it is common in a variety of uses which appear in the N.T. as master of the slave (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:24">Matthew 10:24</span>), of the harvest (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:38">Matthew 9:38</span>), of the vineyard (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:8">Matthew 20:8</span>), of the emperor (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:27">Acts 13:27</span>), of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:20">Matthew 11:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span>), and often of Jesus as the Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:36">Acts 10:36</span>). Note <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:25">Matthew 8:25</span>. This is the only time in Matthew where the words <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κυριος</span></span> are applied to Jesus except the doubtful passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:6">Matthew 28:6</span>. A similar usage is shown by Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i> and Deissmann's <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>. Particularly in Egypt it was applied to "the Lord Serapis" and Ptolemy and Cleopatra are called "the lords, the most great gods" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κυριο θεο μεγιστο</span></span>). Even Herod the Great and Herod Agrippa I are addressed as "Lord King." In the west the Roman emperors are not so termed till the time of Domitian. But the Christians boldly claimed the word for Christ as Jesus is here represented as using it with reference to himself. It seems as if already the disciples were calling Jesus "Lord" and that he accepted the appellative and used it as here. </p>
