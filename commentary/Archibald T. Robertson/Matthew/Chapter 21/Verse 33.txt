<p><b> A hedge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φραγμον</span></span>). Or fence as a protection against wild beasts.</p>
<p><b>Digged a winepress </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωρυξεν ληνον</span></span>). Out of the solid rock to hold the grapes and wine as they were crushed. Such wine-vats are to be seen today in Palestine.</p>
<p><b>Built a tower </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωικοδομησεν πυργον</span></span>). This for the vinedressers and watchmen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+26:10">2 Chronicles 26:10</span>). Utmost care was thus taken. Note "a booth in a vineyard" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:8">Isaiah 1:8</span>). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+24:20">Isaiah 24:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+27:18">Job 27:18</span>. Let it out (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεδετο, εξεδοτο</span></span> the usual form). For hire, the terms not being given. The lease allowed three forms, money-rent, a proportion of the crop, or a definite amount of the produce whether it was a good or bad year. Probably the last form is that contemplated here. </p>
