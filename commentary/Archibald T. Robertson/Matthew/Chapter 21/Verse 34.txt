<p><b> His servants </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους δουλους αυτου</span></span>). These slaves are distinguished from</p>
<p><b>the husbandmen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεωργο</span></span>, workers of the soil) or workers of the vineyard who had leased it from the householder before he went away. The conduct of the husbandmen towards the householder's slaves portrays the behaviour of the Jewish people and the religious leaders in particular towards the prophets and now towards Christ. The treatment of God's prophets by the Jews pointedly illustrates this parable. </p>
