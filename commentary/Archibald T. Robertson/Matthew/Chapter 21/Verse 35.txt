<p><b> They will reverence my son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντραπησοντα τον υιον μου</span></span>). Second future passive from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντρεπω</span></span>, to turn at, but used transitively here as though active or middle. It is the picture of turning with respect when one worthy of it appears. </p>
