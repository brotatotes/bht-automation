<p><b> By the prophet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του προφητου</span></span>). The first line is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+62:11">Isaiah 62:11</span>, the rest from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:9">Zechariah 9:9</span>. John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:14">John 12:14</span>) makes it clear that Jesus did not quote the passage himself. In Matthew it is not so plain, but probably it is his own comment about the incident. It is not Christ's intention to fulfil the prophecy, simply that his conduct did fulfil it. </p>
