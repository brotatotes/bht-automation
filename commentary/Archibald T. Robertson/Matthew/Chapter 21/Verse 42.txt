<p><b> The stone which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθον ον</span></span>). Inverse attraction of the antecedent into the case of the relative.</p>
<p><b>The builders rejected </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεδοκιμασαν ο οικοδομουντες</span></span>). From <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span>. A most telling quotation. These experts in building God's temple had rejected the corner-stone chosen by God for his own house. But God has the last word and sets aside the building experts and puts his Son as the Head of the corner. It was a withering indictment. </p>
