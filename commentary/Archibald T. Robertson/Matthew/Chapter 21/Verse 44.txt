<p><b> Shall be broken to pieces </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνθλασθησετα</span></span>). Some ancient manuscripts do not have this verse. But it graphically pictures the fate of the man who rejects Christ. The verb means to shatter. We are familiar with an automobile that dashes against a stone wall, a tree, or a train and the ruin that follows.</p>
<p><b>Will scatter him as dust </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λικμησε</span></span>). The verb was used of winnowing out the chaff and then of grinding to powder. This is the fate of him on whom this Rejected Stone falls. </p>
