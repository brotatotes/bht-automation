<p><b> The daughter of Zion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη θυγατρ Σιων</span></span>). Jerusalem as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+22:4">Isaiah 22:4</span> (daughter of my people). So Babylon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+47:1">Isaiah 47:1</span>), daughter of Tyre for Tyre (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:12">Psalms 45:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>Riding </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιβεβηκως</span></span>). Perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιβαινω</span></span>, "having gone upon."</p>
<p><b>And upon a colt the foal of an ass </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα επ πωλον υιον υποζυγιου</span></span>). These words give trouble if <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> is here taken to mean "and." Fritzsche argues that Jesus rode alternately upon each animal, a possible, but needless interpretation. In the Hebrew it means by common Hebrew parallelism "upon an ass, even upon a colt." That is obviously the meaning here in Matthew. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποζυγιου</span></span> (a beast of burden, under a yoke) for ass is common in the LXX and in the papyri (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i> p. 161). </p>
