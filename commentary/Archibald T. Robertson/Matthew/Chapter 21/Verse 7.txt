<p><b> And he sat thereon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα επεκαθισεν επανω αυτων</span></span>), Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:7">Mark 11:7</span>) and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:35">Luke 19:35</span>) show that Jesus rode the colt. Matthew does not contradict that, referring to the garments (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα ιματια</span></span>) put on the colt by "them" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτων</span></span>). not to the two asses. The construction is somewhat loose, but intelligible. The garments thrown on the animals were the outer garments (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιματια</span></span>), Jesus "took his seat" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεκαθισεν</span></span>, ingressive aorist active) upon the garments. </p>
