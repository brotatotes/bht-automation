<p><b> Again in parables </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν εν παραβολαις</span></span>). Matthew has already given two on this occasion (The Two Sons, The Wicked Husbandmen). He alone gives this Parable of the Marriage Feast of the King's Son. It is somewhat similar to that of The Supper in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:16-23">Luke 14:16-23</span> given on another occasion. Hence some scholars consider this merely Matthew's version of the Lucan parable in the wrong place because of Matthew's habit of grouping the sayings of Jesus. But that is a gratuitous indictment of Matthew's report which definitely locates the parable here by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παλιν</span></span>. Some regard it as not spoken by Jesus at all, but an effort on the part of the writer to cover the sin and fate of the Jews, the calling of the Gentiles, and God's demand for righteousness. But here again it is like Jesus and suits the present occasion. </p>
