<p><b> For many are called, but few chosen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλο γαρ εισιν κλητο ολιγο δε εκλεκτο</span></span>). This crisp saying of Christ occurs in various connections. He evidently repeated many of his sayings many times as every teacher does. There is a distinction between the called (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλητο</span></span>) and the chosen (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεκτο</span></span>) called out from the called. </p>
