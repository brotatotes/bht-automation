<p><b> Went </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορευθεντες</span></span>). So-called deponent passive and redundant use of the verb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:13">Matthew 9:13</span>: "Go and learn."</p>
<p><b>Took counsel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμβουλιον ελαβον</span></span>). Like the Latin <i>consilium capere</i> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:14">Matthew 12:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>Ensnare in his talk </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παγιδευσωσιν εν λογω</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παγις</span></span>, a snare or trap. Here only in the N.T. In the LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+28:9">1 Kings 28:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ec+9:12">Ecclesiastes 9:12</span>; Test. of Twelve Patriarchs, <i>Joseph</i> 7:1). Vivid picture of the effort to trip Jesus in his speech like a bird or wild beast. </p>
