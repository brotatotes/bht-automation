<p><b> Their disciples </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους μαθητας αυτων</span></span>). Students, pupils, of the Pharisees as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:18">Mark 2:18</span>. There were two Pharisaic theological seminaries in Jerusalem (Hillel, Shammai).</p>
<p><b>The Herodians </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των Hερωιδιανων</span></span>). Not members of Herod's family or Herod's soldiers, but partisans or followers of Herod. The form in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ιανος</span></span> is a Latin termination like that in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστιανος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>). Mentioned also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:6">Mark 3:6</span> combining with the Pharisees against Jesus.</p>
<p><b>The person of men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσωπον ανθρωπων</span></span>). Literally, face of men. Paying regard to appearance is the sin of partiality condemned by James (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1">James 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:9">James 2:9</span>) when <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσωπολημψια, προσωπολημπτειν</span></span> are used, in imitation of the Hebrew idiom. This suave flattery to Jesus implied "that Jesus was a reckless simpleton" (Bruce). </p>
