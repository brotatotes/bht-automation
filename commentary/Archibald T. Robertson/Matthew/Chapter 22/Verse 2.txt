<p><b> A marriage feast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαμους</span></span>). The plural, as here (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:2">Matthew 22:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:3">Matthew 22:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:4">Matthew 22:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:9">Matthew 22:9</span>), is very common in the papyri for the wedding festivities (the several acts of feasting) which lasted for days, seven in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jdg+14:17">Judges 14:17</span>. The very phrase here, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαμους ποιειν</span></span>, occurs in the Doric of Thera about B.C. 200. The singular <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαμος</span></span> is common in the papyri for the wedding contract, but Field (<i>Notes</i>, p. 16) sees no difference between the singular here in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:8">Matthew 22:8</span> and the plural (see also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+29:22">Genesis 29:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="es+9:22">Esther 9:22</span>; Macc. 10:58). </p>
