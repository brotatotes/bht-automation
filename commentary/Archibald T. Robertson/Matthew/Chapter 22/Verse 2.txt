 A marriage feast  (γαμους). The plural, as here (Matthew 22:2; Matthew 22:3; Matthew 22:4; Matthew 22:9), is very common in the papyri for the wedding festivities (the several acts of feasting) which lasted for days, seven in Judges 14:17. The very phrase here, γαμους ποιειν, occurs in the Doric of Thera about B.C. 200. The singular γαμος is common in the papyri for the wedding contract, but Field (Notes, p. 16) sees no difference between the singular here in Matthew 22:8 and the plural (see also Genesis 29:22; Esther 9:22; Macc. 10:58).
