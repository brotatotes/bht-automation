<p><b> This image and superscription </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η εικων αυτη κα η επιγραφη</span></span>). Probably a Roman coin because of the image (picture) on it. The earlier Herods avoided this practice because of Jewish prejudice, but the Tetrarch Philip introduced it on Jewish coins and he was followed by Herod Agrippa I. This coin was pretty certainly stamped in Rome with the image and name of Tiberius Caesar on it. </p>
