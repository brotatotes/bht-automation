 Shall marry  (επιγαμβρευσε). The Sadducees were "aiming at amusement rather than deadly mischief" (Bruce). It was probably an old conundrum that they had used to the discomfiture of the Pharisees. This passage is quoted from Deuteronomy 25:5; Deuteronomy 25:6. The word appears here only in the N.T. and elsewhere only in the LXX. It is used of any connected by marriage as in Genesis 34:9; 1 Samuel 18:22. But in Genesis 38:8 and Deuteronomy 25:5 it is used specifically of one marrying his brother's widow.
