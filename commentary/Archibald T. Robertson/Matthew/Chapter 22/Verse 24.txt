<p><b> Shall marry </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγαμβρευσε</span></span>). The Sadducees were "aiming at amusement rather than deadly mischief" (Bruce). It was probably an old conundrum that they had used to the discomfiture of the Pharisees. This passage is quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+25:5">Deuteronomy 25:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+25:6">Deuteronomy 25:6</span>. The word appears here only in the N.T. and elsewhere only in the LXX. It is used of any connected by marriage as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+34:9">Genesis 34:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+18:22">1 Samuel 18:22</span>. But in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+38:8">Genesis 38:8</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+25:5">Deuteronomy 25:5</span> it is used specifically of one marrying his brother's widow. </p>
