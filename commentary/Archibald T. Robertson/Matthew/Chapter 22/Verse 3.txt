<p><b> To call them that were bidden </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλεσα τους κεκλημενους</span></span>). "Perhaps an unconscious play on the words, lost in both A.V. and Rev.,</p>
<p><b>to call the called </b>" (Vincent). It was a Jewish custom to invite a second time the already invited (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="es+5:8">Esther 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="es+6:14">Esther 6:14</span>). The prophets of old had given God's invitation to the Jewish people. Now the Baptist and Jesus had given the second invitation that the feast was ready.</p>
<p><b>And they would not come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκ ηθελον ελθειν</span></span>). This negative imperfect characterizes the stubborn refusal of the Jewish leaders to accept Jesus as God's Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span>). This is "The Hebrew Tragedy" (Conder). </p>
