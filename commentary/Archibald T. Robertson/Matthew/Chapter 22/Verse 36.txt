<p><b> The great commandment in the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντολη μεγαλη εν τω νομω</span></span>). The positive adjective is sometimes as high in rank as the superlative. See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγας</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:19">Matthew 5:19</span> in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαχιστος</span></span>. The superlative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγιστος</span></span> occurs in the N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>. Possibly this scribe wishes to know which commandment stood first (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:28">Mark 12:28</span>) with Jesus. "The scribes declared that there were 248 affirmative precepts, as many as the members of the human body; and 365 negative precepts, as many as the days in the year, the total being 613, the number of letters in the Decalogue" (Vincent). But Jesus cuts through such pettifogging hair-splitting to the heart of the problem. </p>
