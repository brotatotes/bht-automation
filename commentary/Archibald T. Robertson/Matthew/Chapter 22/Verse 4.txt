<p><b> My dinner </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το αριστον μου</span></span>). It is breakfast, not dinner. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:12">Luke 14:12</span> both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αριστον</span></span> (breakfast) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειπνον</span></span> (dinner) are used. This noon or midday meal, like the French breakfast at noon, was sometimes called <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειπνον μεσημβρινον</span></span> (midday dinner or luncheon). The regular dinner (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειπνον</span></span>) came in the evening. The confusion arose from applying <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αριστον</span></span> to the early morning meal and then to the noon meal (some not eating an earlier meal). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:12">John 21:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15">John 21:15</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρισταω</span></span> is used of the early morning meal, "Break your fast" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αριστησατε</span></span>). When <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αριστον</span></span> was applied to luncheon, like the Latin <i>prandium</i>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακρατισμα</span></span> was the term for the early breakfast.</p>
<p><b>My fatlings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα σιτιστα</span></span>). Verbal from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σιτιζω</span></span>, to feed with wheat or other grain, to fatten. Fed-up or fatted animals. </p>
