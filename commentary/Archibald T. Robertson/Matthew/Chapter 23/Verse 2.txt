<p><b> Sit on Moses' seat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ της Μωυσεως καθεδρας εκαθισαν</span></span>). The gnomic or timeless aorist tense, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθισαν</span></span>, not the aorist "for" the perfect. The "seat of Moses" is a brief form for the chair of the professor whose function it is to interpret Moses. "The heirs of Moses' authority by an unbroken tradition can deliver <i>ex cathedra</i> pronouncements on his teaching" (McNeile). </p>
