<p><b> Ye tithe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδεκατουτε</span></span>). The tithe had to be paid upon "all the increase of thy seed" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+14:22">Deuteronomy 14:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+27:30">Leviticus 27:30</span>). The English word tithe is tenth. These small aromatic herbs, mint (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ηδυοσμον</span></span>, sweet-smelling), anise or dill (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανηθον</span></span>), cummin (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυμινον</span></span>, with aromatic seeds), show the Pharisaic scrupulous conscientiousness, all marketable commodities. "The Talmud tells of the ass of a certain Rabbi which had been so well trained as to refuse corn of which the tithes had not been taken" (Vincent).</p>
<p><b>These ye ought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτα εδε</span></span>). Jesus does not condemn tithing. What he does condemn is doing it to the neglect of the</p>
