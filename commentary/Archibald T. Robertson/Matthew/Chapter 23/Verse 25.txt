<p><b> From extortion and excess </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ αρπαγης κα ακρασιας</span></span>). A much more serious accusation. These punctilious observers of the external ceremonies did not hesitate at robbery (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαγες</span></span>) and graft (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακρασιας</span></span>), lack of control. A modern picture of wickedness in high places both civil and ecclesiastical where the moral elements in life are ruthlessly trodden under foot. Of course, the idea is for both the outside <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτος</span></span> and the inside (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντος</span></span>) of the cup and the platter (fine side dish). But the inside is the more important. Note the change to singular in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:26">Matthew 23:26</span> as if Jesus in a friendlier tone pleads with a Pharisee to mend his ways. </p>
