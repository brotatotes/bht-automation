 From extortion and excess  (εξ αρπαγης κα ακρασιας). A much more serious accusation. These punctilious observers of the external ceremonies did not hesitate at robbery (αρπαγες) and graft (ακρασιας), lack of control. A modern picture of wickedness in high places both civil and ecclesiastical where the moral elements in life are ruthlessly trodden under foot. Of course, the idea is for both the outside εκτος and the inside (εντος) of the cup and the platter (fine side dish). But the inside is the more important. Note the change to singular in verse Matthew 23:26 as if Jesus in a friendlier tone pleads with a Pharisee to mend his ways.
