<p><b> Whited sepulchre </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταφοις κεκονιαμενοις</span></span>). The perfect passive participle is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κονιαω</span></span> and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κονια</span></span>, dust or lime. Whitened with powdered lime dust, the sepulchres of the poor in the fields or the roadside. Not the rock-hewn tombs of the well-to-do. These were whitewashed a month before the passover that travellers might see them and so avoid being defiled by touching them (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:16">Numbers 19:16</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:3">Acts 23:3</span> Paul called the high priest a whited wall. When Jesus spoke the sepulchres had been freshly whitewashed. We today speak of whitewashing moral evil. </p>
