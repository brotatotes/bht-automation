<p><b> The tombs of the prophets </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους ταφους των προφητων</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:48-52">Luke 11:48-52</span>. They were bearing witness against themselves (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτοις</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:31">Matthew 23:31</span>) to "the murder-taint in your blood" (Allen). "These men who professed to be so distressed at the murdering of the Prophets, were themselves compassing the death of Him who was far greater than any Prophet" (Plummer). There are four monuments called Tombs of the Prophets (Zechariah, Absalom, Jehoshaphat, St. James) at the base of the Mount of Olives. Some of these may have been going up at the very time that Jesus spoke. In this seventh and last woe Jesus addresses the Jewish nation and not merely the Pharisees. </p>
