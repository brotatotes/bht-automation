<p><b> Fill ye up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρωσατε</span></span>). The keenest irony in this command has been softened in some MSS. to the future indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρωσετε</span></span>). "Fill up the measure of your fathers; crown their misdeeds by killing the prophet God has sent to you. Do at last what has long been in your hearts. The hour is come" (Bruce). </p>
