 Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers  (οφεις γεννηματα εχιδνων). These blistering words come as a climax and remind one of the Baptist (Matthew 3:17) and of the time when the Pharisees accused Jesus of being in league with Beelzebub (Matthew 12:34). They cut to the bone like whip-cords.How shall ye escape  (πως φυγητε). Deliberate subjunctive. There is a curse in the Talmud somewhat like this: "Woe to the house of Annas! Woe to their serpent-like hissings."
