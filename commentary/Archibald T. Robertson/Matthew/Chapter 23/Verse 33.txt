<p><b> Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφεις γεννηματα εχιδνων</span></span>). These blistering words come as a climax and remind one of the Baptist (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>) and of the time when the Pharisees accused Jesus of being in league with Beelzebub (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:34">Matthew 12:34</span>). They cut to the bone like whip-cords.</p>
<p><b>How shall ye escape </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πως φυγητε</span></span>). Deliberate subjunctive. There is a curse in the Talmud somewhat like this: "Woe to the house of Annas! Woe to their serpent-like hissings." </p>
