<p><b> Zachariah son of Barachiah </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ζαχαριου υιου Βαραχιου</span></span>). Broadus gives well the various alternatives in understanding and explaining the presence of "son of Barachiah" here which is not in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:51">Luke 11:51</span>. The usual explanation is that the reference is to Zachariah the son of Jehoiada the priest who was slain in the court of the temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:20">2 Chronicles 24:20</span>). How the words, "son of Barachiah," got into Matthew we do not know. A half-dozen possibilities can be suggested. In the case of Abel a reckoning for the shedding of his blood was foretold (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:10">Genesis 4:10</span>) and the same thing was true of the slaying of Zachariah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:22">2 Chronicles 24:22</span>). </p>
