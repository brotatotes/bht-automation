<p><b> How often would I have gathered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποσακις ηθελησα επισυναγειν</span></span>). More exactly, how often did I long to gather to myself (double compound infinitive). The same verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισυναγε</span></span>) is used of the hen with the compound preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποκατω</span></span>. Everyone has seen the hen quickly get together the chicks under her wings in the time of danger. These words naturally suggest previous visits to Jerusalem made plain by John's Gospel. </p>
