 How often would I have gathered  (ποσακις ηθελησα επισυναγειν). More exactly, how often did I long to gather to myself (double compound infinitive). The same verb (επισυναγε) is used of the hen with the compound preposition υποκατω. Everyone has seen the hen quickly get together the chicks under her wings in the time of danger. These words naturally suggest previous visits to Jerusalem made plain by John's Gospel.
