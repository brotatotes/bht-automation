<p><b> Call no man your father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατερα μη καλεσητε υμων</span></span>). Jesus meant the full sense of this noble word for our heavenly Father. "Abba was not commonly a mode of address to a living person, but a title of honour for Rabbis and great men of the past" (McNeile). In Gethsemane Jesus said: "Abba, Father" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:36">Mark 14:36</span>). Certainly the ascription of "Father" to pope and priest seems out of harmony with what Jesus here says. He should not be understood to be condemning the title to one's real earthly father. Jesus often leaves the exceptions to be supplied. </p>
