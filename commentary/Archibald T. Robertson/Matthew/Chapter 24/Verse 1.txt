<p><b> Went out from the temple </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξελθων απο του ιερου</span></span>). All the discourses since <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:23">Matthew 21:23</span> have been in the temple courts (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερον</span></span>, the sacred enclosure). But now Jesus leaves it for good after the powerful denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees in chapter 23. His public teaching is over. It was a tragic moment. As he was going out (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επορευετο</span></span>, descriptive imperfect) the disciples, as if to relieve the thought of the Master came to him (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσηλθον</span></span>) to show (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιδειξα</span></span>, ingressive aorist infinitive) the buildings of the temple (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας οικοδομας του ιερου</span></span>). They were familiar to Jesus and the disciples, but beautiful like a snow mountain (Josephus, <i>Wars</i> V,5,6), the monument that Herod the Great had begun and that was not yet complete (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:20">John 2:20</span>). Great stones were there of polished marble. </p>
