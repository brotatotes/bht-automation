 Went out from the temple  (εξελθων απο του ιερου). All the discourses since Matthew 21:23 have been in the temple courts (ιερον, the sacred enclosure). But now Jesus leaves it for good after the powerful denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees in chapter 23. His public teaching is over. It was a tragic moment. As he was going out (επορευετο, descriptive imperfect) the disciples, as if to relieve the thought of the Master came to him (προσηλθον) to show (επιδειξα, ingressive aorist infinitive) the buildings of the temple (τας οικοδομας του ιερου). They were familiar to Jesus and the disciples, but beautiful like a snow mountain (Josephus, Wars V,5,6), the monument that Herod the Great had begun and that was not yet complete (John 2:20). Great stones were there of polished marble.
