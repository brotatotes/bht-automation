<p><b> The abomination of desolation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το βδελυγμα της ερεμωσεως</span></span>). An allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+9:27">Daniel 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+11:31">Daniel 11:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+12:11">Daniel 12:11</span>. Antiochus Epiphanes erected an altar to Zeus on the altar of Jehovah (1Macc. 1:54,59; 6:7; 2Macc. 6:1-5). The desolation in the mind of Jesus is apparently the Roman army (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:20">Luke 21:20</span>) in the temple, an application of the words of Daniel to this dread event. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βδελυσσομα</span></span> is to feel nausea because of stench, to abhor, to detest. Idolatry was a stench to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:15">Luke 16:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:4">Revelation 17:4</span>). Josephus tells us that the Romans burned the temple and offered sacrifices to their ensigns placed by the eastern gate when they proclaimed Titus as Emperor. </p>
<p><b> Let him that readeth understand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αναγινοσκων νοειτω</span></span>). This parenthesis occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:14">Mark 13:14</span>. It is not to be supposed that Jesus used these words. They were inserted by Mark as he wrote his book and he was followed by Matthew. </p>
