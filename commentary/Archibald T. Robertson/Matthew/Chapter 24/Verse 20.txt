<p><b> In winter nor on a sabbath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειμωνος</span></span>, genitive of time, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδε σαββατω</span></span>, locative of time). In winter because of the rough weather. On a sabbath because some would hesitate to make such a journey on the sabbath. Josephus in his <i>Wars</i> gives the best illustration of the horrors foretold by Jesus in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:21">Matthew 24:21</span>. </p>
