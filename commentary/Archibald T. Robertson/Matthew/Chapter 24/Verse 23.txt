<p><b> Lo, here is the Christ, or here </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδου ωδε ο Χριστος η ωδε</span></span>). The false prophets (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:11">Matthew 24:11</span>) create the trouble and now false Christs (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψευδο-Χριστο</span></span>, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>) offer a way out of these troubles. The deluded victims raise the cries of "Lo, here," when these false Messiahs arise with their panaceas for public ills (political, religious, moral, and spiritual). </p>
