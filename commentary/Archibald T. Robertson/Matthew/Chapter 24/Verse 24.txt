<p><b> Great signs and wonders </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημεια μεγαλα κα τερατα</span></span>). Two of the three words so often used in the N.T. about the works (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργα</span></span>) of Jesus, the other being <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμεις</span></span> (powers). They often occur together of the same work (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:48">John 4:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22">Acts 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:30">Acts 4:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:12">2 Corinthians 12:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τερας</span></span> is a wonder or prodigy, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις</span></span>, a mighty work or power, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον</span></span>, a sign of God's purpose. Miracle (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιραχυλυμ</span></span>) presents only the notion of wonder or portent. The same deed can be looked at from these different angles. But the point to note here is that mere "signs and wonders" do not of themselves prove the power of God. These charlatans will be so skilful that they will,</p>
<p><b>if possible </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δυνατον</span></span>), lead astray the very elect. The implication is that it is not possible. People become excited and are misled and are unable to judge of results. Often it is <i>post hoc, sed non propter hoc</i>. Patent-medicine men make full use of the credulity of people along this line as do spiritualistic mediums. Sleight-of-hand men can deceive the unwary. </p>
