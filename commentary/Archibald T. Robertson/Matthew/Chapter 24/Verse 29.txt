 Immediately  (ευθεως). This word, common in Mark's Gospel as ευθυς, gives trouble if one stresses the time element. The problem is how much time intervenes between "the tribulation of those days" and the vivid symbolism of verse Matthew 24:29. The use of εν ταχε in Revelation 1:1 should make one pause before he decides. Here we have a prophetic panorama like that with foreshortened perspective. The apocalyptic pictures in verse Matthew 24:29 also call for sobriety of judgment. One may compare Joel's prophecy as interpreted by Peter in Acts 21:16-22. Literalism is not appropriate in this apocalyptic eschatology.
