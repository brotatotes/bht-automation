<p><b> Immediately </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευθεως</span></span>). This word, common in Mark's Gospel as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευθυς</span></span>, gives trouble if one stresses the time element. The problem is how much time intervenes between "the tribulation of those days" and the vivid symbolism of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span>. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ταχε</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span> should make one pause before he decides. Here we have a prophetic panorama like that with foreshortened perspective. The apocalyptic pictures in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span> also call for sobriety of judgment. One may compare Joel's prophecy as interpreted by Peter in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:16-22">Acts 21:16-22</span>. Literalism is not appropriate in this apocalyptic eschatology. </p>
