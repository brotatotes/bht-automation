<p><b> The sign of the Son of Man in heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το σημειον του υιου του ανθρωπου εν ουρανω</span></span>). Many theories have been suggested like the cross in the sky, etc. Bruce sees a reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span> "one like the Son of man" and holds that Christ himself is the sign in question (the genitive of apposition). This is certainly possible. It is confirmed by the rest of the verse: "They shall see the Son of man coming." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27">Matthew 16:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>. The Jews had repeatedly asked for such a sign (Broadus) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:38">Matthew 12:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:18">John 2:18</span>. </p>
