 With a great sound of a trumpet  (μετα σαλπιγγος φωνης μεγαλης). Some MSS. omit (φωνης) "sound." The trumpet was the signal employed to call the hosts of Israel to march as to war and is common in prophetic imagery (Isaiah 27:13). Cf. the seventh angel (Revelation 11:15). Clearly "the coming of the son of man is not to be identified with the judgment of Jerusalem but rather forms its preternatural background" (Bruce).
