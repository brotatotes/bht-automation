<p><b> With a great sound of a trumpet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα σαλπιγγος φωνης μεγαλης</span></span>). Some MSS. omit (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνης</span></span>) "sound." The trumpet was the signal employed to call the hosts of Israel to march as to war and is common in prophetic imagery (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+27:13">Isaiah 27:13</span>). Cf. the seventh angel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>). Clearly "the coming of the son of man is not to be identified with the judgment of Jerusalem but rather forms its preternatural background" (Bruce). </p>
