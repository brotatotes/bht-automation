 This generation  (η γενεα αυτη). The problem is whether Jesus is here referring to the destruction of Jerusalem or to the second coming and end of the world. If to the destruction of Jerusalem, there was a literal fulfilment. In the Old Testament a generation was reckoned as forty years. This is the natural way to take verse Matthew 24:34 as of Matthew 24:33 (Bruce), "all things" meaning the same in both verses.
