<p><b> The days of Noah </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α ημερα του Νωε</span></span>). Jesus had used this same imagery before to the Pharisees (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:26-30">Luke 17:26-30</span>). In Noah's day there was plenty of warning, but utter unpreparedness. Most people are either indifferent about the second coming or have fanciful schemes or programs about it. Few are really eager and expectant and leave to God the time and the plans. </p>
