<p><b> Lead you astray </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμας πλανηση</span></span>). This warning runs all through the discourse. It is amazing how successful deceivers have been through the ages with their eschatological programs. The word in the passive appears in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:12">Matthew 18:12</span> when the one sheep wanders astray. Here it is the active voice with the causative sense to lead astray. Our word planet comes from this root. </p>
