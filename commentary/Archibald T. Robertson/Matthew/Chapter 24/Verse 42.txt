<p><b> Watch therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γρηγωρειτε ουν</span></span>). A late present imperative from the second perfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγρηγορα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγειρω</span></span>. Keep awake, be on the watch "therefore" because of the uncertainty of the time of the second coming. Jesus gives a half dozen parables to enforce the point of this exhortation (the Porter, the Master of the House, the Faithful Servant and the Evil Servants, the Ten Virgins, the Talents, the Sheep and the Goats). Matthew does not give the Parable of the Porter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:35-37">Mark 13:35-37</span>). </p>
