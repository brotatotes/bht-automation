<p><b> That ye think not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ου δοκειτε ωρα</span></span>). It is useless to set the day and hour for Christ's coming. It is folly to neglect it. This figure of the thief will be used also by Paul concerning the unexpectedness of Christ's second coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:2">1 Thessalonians 5:2</span>). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:50">Matthew 24:50</span> for the unexpectedness of the coming with punishment for the evil servant. </p>
