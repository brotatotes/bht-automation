<p><b> My lord tarrieth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρονιζε μου ο κυριος</span></span>). That is the temptation and to give way to indulge in fleshly appetites or to pride of superior intellect. Within a generation scoffers will be asking where is the promise of the coming of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:4">2 Peter 3:4</span>). They will forget that God's clock is not like our clock and that a day with the Lord may be a thousand years or a thousand years as one day (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:8">2 Peter 3:8</span>). </p>
