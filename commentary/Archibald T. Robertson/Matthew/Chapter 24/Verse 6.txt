<p><b> See that ye be not troubled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορατε μη θροεισθε</span></span>). Asyndeton here with these two imperatives as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:15">Mark 8:15</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορατε βλεπετε</span></span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 949). Look out for the wars and rumours of wars, but do not be scared out of your wits by them. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θροεω</span></span> means to cry aloud, to scream, and in the passive to be terrified by an outcry. Paul uses this very verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδε θροεισθα</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span> as a warning against excitement over false reports that he had predicted the immediate second coming of Christ.</p>
<p><b>But the end is not yet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ουπω εστιν το τελος</span></span>). It is curious how people overlook these words of Jesus and proceed to set dates for the immediate end. That happened during the Great War and it has happened since. </p>
