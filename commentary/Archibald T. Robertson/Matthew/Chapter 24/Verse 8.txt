<p><b> The beginning of travail </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχη οδινων</span></span>). The word means birth-pangs and the Jews used the very phrase for the sufferings of the Messiah which were to come before the coming of the Messiah (Book of Jubilees, 23:18; Apoc. of Baruch 27-29). But the word occurs with no idea of birth as the pains of death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:5">Psalms 18:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:24">Acts 2:24</span>). These woes, says Jesus, are not a proof of the end, but of the beginning. </p>
