<p><b> Ye shall be hated </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσεσθε μισουμενο</span></span>). Periphrastic future passive to emphasize the continuous process of the linear action. For tribulation (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιψιν</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:21">Matthew 13:21</span>), a word common in the Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypse for the oppression (pressure) that the Christians received.</p>
<p><b>For my name's sake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το ονομα μου</span></span>). The most glorious name in the world today, but soon to be a byword of shame (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:41">Acts 5:41</span>). The disciples would count it an honour to be dishonoured for the Name's sake. </p>
