<p><b> Watch therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γρηγορειτε ουν</span></span>). This is the refrain with all the parables. Lack of foresight is inexcusable. Ignorance of the time of the second coming is not an excuse for neglect, but a reason for readiness. Every preacher goes up against this trait in human nature, putting off till another time what should be done today. </p>
