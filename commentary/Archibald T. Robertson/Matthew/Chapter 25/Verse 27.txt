<p><b> Thou oughtest therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδσ σε ουν</span></span>). His very words of excuse convict him. It was a necessity (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδε</span></span>) that he did not see.</p>
<p><b>The bankers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις τραπεζειταις</span></span>). The benchers, money-changers, brokers, who exchanged money for a fee and who paid interest on money. Word common in late Greek.</p>
<p><b>I should have received back </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω εκομισαμην αν</span></span>). Conclusion of a condition of the second class (determined as unfulfilled). The condition is not expressed, but it is implied. "If you had done that."</p>
<p><b>With interest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν τοκω</span></span>). Not with "usury" in the sense of extortion or oppression. Usury only means "use" in itself. The word is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τικτω</span></span>, to bring forth. Compound interest at six per cent doubles the principal every twenty years. It is amazing how rapidly that piles up if one carries it on for centuries and millenniums. "In the early Roman Empire legal interest was eight per cent, but in usurious transactions it was lent at twelve, twenty-four, and even forty-eight" (Vincent). Such practices exist today in our cities. The Mosaic law did not allow interest in dealings between Hebrews, but only with strangers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+23:19">Deuteronomy 23:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+23:20">Deuteronomy 23:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+15:5">Psalms 15:5</span>). </p>
