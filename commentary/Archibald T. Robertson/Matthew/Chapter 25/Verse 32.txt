<p><b> All the nations </b> (panta ta ethn). Not just Gentiles, but Jews also. Christians and non-Christians. This program for the general judgment has been challenged by some scholars who regard it as a composition by the evangelist to exalt Christ. But why should not Christ say this if he is the Son of Man and the Son of God and realized it? A "reduced" Christ has trouble with all the Gospels, not merely with the Fourth Gospel, and no less with Q and Mark than with Matthew and Luke.

<p><b>As the shepherd separates </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωσπερ ο ποιμην αφοριζε</span></span>). A common figure in Palestine. The sheep are usually white and the goats black. There are kids (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εριφων, εριφια</span></span>) which have grazed together. The goats devastate a field of all herbage. "Indeed they have extirpated many species of trees which once covered the hills" (Tristram, <i>Natural History of the Bible</i>, pp. 89f.). The shepherd stands at the gate and taps the sheep to go to the right and the goats to the left. </p>
