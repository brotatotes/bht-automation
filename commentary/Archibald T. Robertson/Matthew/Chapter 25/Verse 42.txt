<p><b> No meat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εδωκατε μο φαγειν</span></span>). You did not give me anything to eat. The repetition of the negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:42">Matthew 25:42</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:43">Matthew 25:43</span> is like the falling of clods on the coffin or the tomb. It is curious the surprise here shown both by the sheep and the goats. Some sheep will think that they are goats and some goats will think that they are sheep. </p>
