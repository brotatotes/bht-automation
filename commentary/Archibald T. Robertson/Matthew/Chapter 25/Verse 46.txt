<p><b> Eternal punishment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολασιν αιωνιον</span></span>). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολασιν</span></span> comes from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολαζω</span></span>, to mutilate or prune. Hence those who cling to the larger hope use this phrase to mean age-long pruning that ultimately leads to salvation of the goats, as disciplinary rather than penal. There is such a distinction as Aristotle pointed out between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωρια</span></span> (vengeance) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολασις</span></span>. But the same adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιωνιος</span></span> is used with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολασιν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωην</span></span>. If by etymology we limit the scope of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολασιν</span></span>, we may likewise have only age-long <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωην</span></span>. There is not the slightest indication in the words of Jesus here that the punishment is not coeval with the life. We can leave all this to the King himself who is the Judge. The difficulty to one's mind about conditional chastisement is to think how a life of sin in hell can be changed into a life of love and obedience. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιωνιος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιων</span></span>, age, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αεςυμ, αε</span></span>) means either without beginning or without end or both. It comes as near to the idea of eternal as the Greek can put it in one word. It is a difficult idea to put into language. Sometimes we have "ages of ages" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιωνες των αιωνων</span></span>). </p>
