<p><b> There is a cry </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραυγη γεγονεν</span></span>). A cry has come. Dramatic use of the present perfect (second perfect active) indicative, not the perfect for the aorist. It is not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span>, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγονεν</span></span> which emphasizes the sudden outcry which has rent the air. The very memory of it is preserved by this tense with all the bustle and confusion, the rushing to the oil-venders.</p>
<p><b>Come ye forth to meet him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξερχεσθε εις απαντησιν</span></span>). Or, Go out for meeting him, dependent on whether the cry comes from outside the house or inside the house where they were sleeping because of the delay. It was a ceremonial salutation neatly expressed by the Greek phrase. </p>
