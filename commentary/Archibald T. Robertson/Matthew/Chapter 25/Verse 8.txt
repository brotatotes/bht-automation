<p><b> Are going out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σβεννυντα</span></span>). Present middle indicative of linear action, not punctiliar or aoristic. When the five foolish virgins lit their lamps, they discovered the lack of oil. The sputtering, flickering, smoking wicks were a sad revelation. "And <i>perhaps</i> we are to understand that there is something in the coincidence of the lamps going out just as the Bridegroom arrived. Mere outward religion is found to have no illuminating power" (Plummer). </p>
