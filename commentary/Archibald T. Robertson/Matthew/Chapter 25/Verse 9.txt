<p><b> Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηποτε ου μη αρκεσε ημιν κα υμιν</span></span>). There is an elliptical construction here that is not easy of explanation. Some MSS. Aleph A L Z have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span>. But even so <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ποτε</span></span> has to be explained either by supplying an imperative like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινεσθω</span></span> or by a verb of fearing like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φοβουμεθα</span></span> (this most likely). Either <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span> would be proper with the futuristic subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρκεσε</span></span> (Moulton, <i>Prolegomena</i>, p. 192; Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 1161,1174). "We are afraid that there is no possibility of there being enough for us both." This is a denial of oil by the wise virgins because there was not enough for both. "It was necessary to show that the foolish virgins could not have the consequences of their folly averted at the last moment" (Plummer). It is a courteous reply, but it is decisive. The compound Greek negatives are very expressive, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηποτε--ου μη</span></span>. </p>
