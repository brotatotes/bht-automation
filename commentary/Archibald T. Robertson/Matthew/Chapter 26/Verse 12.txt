<p><b> To prepare me for burial </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς το ενταφιασα με</span></span>). Mary alone had understood what Jesus had repeatedly said about his approaching death. The disciples were so wrapped up in their own notions of a political kingdom that they failed utterly to sympathize with Jesus as he faced the cross. But Mary with the woman's fine intuitions did begin to understand and this was her way of expressing her high emotions and loyalty. The word here is the same used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:40">John 19:40</span> about what Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus did for the body of Jesus before burial with the addition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς το</span></span> showing the purpose of Mary (the infinitive of purpose). Mary was vindicated by Jesus and her noble deed has become a "memorial of her" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις μνημοσυμον αυτης</span></span>) as well as of Jesus. </p>
