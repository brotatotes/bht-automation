<p><b> To such a man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς τον δεινα</span></span>). The only instance in the N.T. of this old Attic idiom. The papyri show it for "Mr. X" and the modern Greek keeps it. Jesus may have indicated the man's name. Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:13">Mark 14:13</span>) and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:10">Luke 22:10</span>) describe him as a man bearing a pitcher of water. It may have been the home of Mary the mother of John Mark.</p>
<p><b>I keep the passover at thy house </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς σε ποιω το πασχα</span></span>). Futuristic present indicative. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς σε</span></span> for "at thy house" is neat Greek of the classic period. Evidently there was no surprise in this home at the command of Jesus. It was a gracious privilege to serve him thus. </p>
