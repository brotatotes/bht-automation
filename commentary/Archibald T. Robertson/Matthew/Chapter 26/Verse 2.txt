<p><b> Cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινετα</span></span>). Futuristic use of the present middle indicative. This was probably our Tuesday evening (beginning of Jewish Wednesday). The passover began on our Thursday evening (beginning of Jewish Friday).</p>
<p><b>After two days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα δυο ημερας</span></span>) is just the familiar popular mode of speech. The passover came technically on the second day from this time.</p>
<p><b>Is delivered up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδοτα</span></span>). Another instance of the futuristic present passive indicative. The same form occurs in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:24">Matthew 26:24</span>. Thus Jesus sets a definite date for the coming crucifixion which he has been predicting for six months. </p>
