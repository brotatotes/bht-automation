<p><b> Is it I, Lord? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μητ εγω ειμι, Κυριε;</span></span>). The negative expects the answer No and was natural for all save Judas. But he had to bluff it out by the same form of question (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:25">Matthew 26:25</span>). The answer of Jesus,</p>
<p><b>Thou hast said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ ειπας</span></span>), means Yes. </p>
