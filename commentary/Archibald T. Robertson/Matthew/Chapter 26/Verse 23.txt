<p><b> He that dipped </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εμβαψας</span></span>). They all dipped their hands, having no knives, forks, or spoons. The aorist participle with the article simply means that the betrayer is the one who dips his hand in the dish (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω τρυβλιω</span></span>) or platter with the broth of nuts and raisins and figs into which the bread was dipped before eating. It is plain that Judas was not recognized by the rest as indicated by what Jesus has said. This language means that one of those who had eaten bread with him had violated the rights of hospitality by betraying him. The Arabs today are punctilious on this point. Eating one's bread ties your hands and compels friendship. But Judas knew full well as is shown in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:25">Matthew 26:25</span> though the rest apparently did not grasp it. </p>
