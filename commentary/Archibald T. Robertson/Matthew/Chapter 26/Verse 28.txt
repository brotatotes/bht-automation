<p><b> The Covenant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της διαθηκης</span></span>). The adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινης</span></span> in Textus Receptus is not genuine. The covenant is an agreement or contract between two (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια, δυο, θηκε</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>). It is used also for will (Latin, <i>testamentum</i>) which becomes operative at death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15-17">Hebrews 9:15-17</span>). Hence our <i>New Testament</i>. Either covenant or will makes sense here. Covenant is the idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:22">Hebrews 7:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:8">Hebrews 8:8</span> and often. In the Hebrew to make a covenant was to cut up the sacrifice and so ratify the agreement (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:9-18">Genesis 15:9-18</span>). Lightfoot argues that the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαθηκε</span></span> means covenant in the N.T. except in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15-17">Hebrews 9:15-17</span>. Jesus here uses the solemn words of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:8">Exodus 24:8</span> "the blood of the covenant" at Sinai. "My blood of the covenant" is in contrast with that. This is the New Covenant of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:31">Matthew 26:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:8">Matthew 26:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>Which is shed for many </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το περ πολλων εκχυννομενον</span></span>). A prophetic present passive participle. The act is symbolized by the ordinance. Cf. the purpose of Christ expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>. There <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span> and here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Unto remission of sins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις αφεσιν αμαρτιων</span></span>). This clause is in Matthew alone but it is not to be restricted for that reason. It is the truth. This passage answers all the modern sentimentalism that finds in the teaching of Jesus only pious ethical remarks or eschatological dreamings. He had the definite conception of his death on the cross as the basis of forgiveness of sin. The purpose of the shedding of his blood of the New Covenant was precisely to remove (forgive) sins. </p>
