 The Covenant  (της διαθηκης). The adjective καινης in Textus Receptus is not genuine. The covenant is an agreement or contract between two (δια, δυο, θηκε, from τιθημ). It is used also for will (Latin, testamentum) which becomes operative at death (Hebrews 9:15-17). Hence our New Testament. Either covenant or will makes sense here. Covenant is the idea in Hebrews 7:22; Hebrews 8:8 and often. In the Hebrew to make a covenant was to cut up the sacrifice and so ratify the agreement (Genesis 15:9-18). Lightfoot argues that the word διαθηκε means covenant in the N.T. except in Hebrews 9:15-17. Jesus here uses the solemn words of Exodus 24:8 "the blood of the covenant" at Sinai. "My blood of the covenant" is in contrast with that. This is the New Covenant of Matthew 26:31; Matthew 26:8.Which is shed for many  (το περ πολλων εκχυννομενον). A prophetic present passive participle. The act is symbolized by the ordinance. Cf. the purpose of Christ expressed in Matthew 20:28. There αντ and here περ.Unto remission of sins  (εις αφεσιν αμαρτιων). This clause is in Matthew alone but it is not to be restricted for that reason. It is the truth. This passage answers all the modern sentimentalism that finds in the teaching of Jesus only pious ethical remarks or eschatological dreamings. He had the definite conception of his death on the cross as the basis of forgiveness of sin. The purpose of the shedding of his blood of the New Covenant was precisely to remove (forgive) sins.
