<p><b> Then were gathered together the chief priests and elders of the people </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τοτε συνηχθησαν ο αρχιερεις κα ο πρεσβυτερο του λαου</span></span>). A meeting of the Sanhedrin as these two groups indicate (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:23">Matthew 21:23</span>).</p>
<p><b>Unto the court </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την αυλην</span></span>). The <i>atrium</i> or court around which the palace buildings were built. Here in this open court this informal meeting was held. Caiaphas was high priest A.D. 18 to 36. His father-in-law Annas had been high priest A.D. 6 to 15 and was still called high priest by many. </p>
