<p><b> He took with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραλαβων</span></span>). Taking along, by his side (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα-</span></span>), as a mark of special favour and privilege, instead of leaving this inner circle of three (Peter, James, and John) with the other eight. The eight would serve as a sort of outer guard to watch by the gate of the garden for the coming of Judas while the three would be able to share the agony of soul already upon Jesus so as at least to give him some human sympathy which he craved as he sought help from the Father in prayer. These three had been with Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration and now they are with him in this supreme crisis. The grief of Christ was now severe. The word for</p>
<p><b>sore troubled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδημονειν</span></span>) is of doubtful etymology. There is an adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδημος</span></span> equal to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδημος</span></span> meaning "not at home," "away from home," like the German <i>unheimisch, unheimlich</i>. But whatever the etymology, the notion of intense discomfort is plain. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδημονειν</span></span> occurs in P.Oxy. II, 298,456 of the first century A.D. where it means "excessively concerned." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:26">Philippians 2:26</span> where Paul uses it of Epaphroditus. Moffatt renders it here "agitated." The word occurs sometimes with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απορεω</span></span> to be at a loss as to which way to go. The <i>Braid Scots</i> has it "sair putten-aboot." Here Matthew has also "to be sorrowful" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυπεισθα</span></span>), but Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:33">Mark 14:33</span>) has the startling phrase</p>
<p><b>greatly amazed and sore troubled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκθαμβεισθα κα αδημονειν</span></span>), a "feeling of terrified surprise." </p>
