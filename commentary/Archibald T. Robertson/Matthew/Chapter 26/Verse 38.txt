<p><b> Watch with me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γρηγορειτε μετ' εμου</span></span>). This late present from the perfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγρηγορα</span></span> means to keep awake and not go to sleep. The hour was late and the strain had been severe, but Jesus pleaded for a bit of human sympathy as he wrestled with his Father. It did not seem too much to ask. He had put his sorrow in strong language, "even unto death" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως θανατου</span></span>) that ought to have alarmed them. </p>
