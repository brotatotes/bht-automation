<p><b> Watch and pray </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γρηγορειτε κα προσευχεσθε</span></span>). Jesus repeats the command of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:38">Matthew 26:38</span> with the addition of prayer and with the warning against the peril of temptation. He himself was feeling the worst of all temptations of his earthly life just then. He did not wish then to enter such temptation (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειρασμον</span></span>, here in this sense, not mere trial). Thus we are to understand the prayer in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:13">Matthew 6:13</span> about leading (being led) into temptation. Their failure was due to weakness of the flesh as is often the case.</p>
<p><b>Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span>) here is the moral life (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιντελλεχτ, wιλλ, εμοτιονς</span></span>) as opposed to the flesh (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+31:3">Isaiah 31:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:25">Romans 7:25</span>).</p>
<p><b>Except I drink it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν μη αυτο πιω</span></span>). Condition of the third class undetermined, but with likelihood of determination, whereas</p>
<p><b>if this cannot pass away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε ου δυνατα τουτο παρελθειν</span></span>) is first-class condition, determined as fulfilled, assumed to be true. This delicate distinction accurately presents the real attitude of Jesus towards this subtle temptation. </p>
