 He is at hand  (ηγγικεν). The same verb and tense used of the hour above, present perfect active of εγγιζω, to draw near, the very form used by John the Baptist of the coming of the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 3:2).

Weiss), we do not know and it matters little. The scene is pictured as it happened with lifelike power.
