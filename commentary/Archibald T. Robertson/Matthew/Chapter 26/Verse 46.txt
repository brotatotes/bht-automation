<p><b> He is at hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγγικεν</span></span>). The same verb and tense used of the hour above, present perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγγιζω</span></span>, to draw near, the very form used by John the Baptist of the coming of the kingdom of heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>). Whether Jesus heard the approach of the betrayer with the crowd around him or saw the lights or just felt the proximity of the traitor before he was there (J. Weiss), we do not know and it matters little. The scene is pictured as it happened with lifelike power. </p>
