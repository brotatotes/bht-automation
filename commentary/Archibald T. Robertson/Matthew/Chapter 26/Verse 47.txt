<p><b> While he yet spake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετ αυτου λαλουντος</span></span>). It was an electric moment as Jesus faced Judas with his horde of helpers as if he turned to meet an army.</p>
<p><b>Let us go </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγωμεν</span></span>), Jesus had said. And here he is. The eight at the gate seemed to have given no notice. Judas is described here as "one of the twelve" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις των δωδεκα</span></span>) in all three Synoptic Gospels (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:43">Mark 14:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:47">Matthew 26:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:47">Luke 22:47</span>). The very horror of the thing is thus emphasized, that one of the chosen twelve apostles should do this dastardly deed.</p>
<p><b>A great multitude </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλος πολυς</span></span>). The chief priests and Pharisees had furnished Judas a band of soldiers from the garrison in Antonia (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:3">John 18:3</span>) and the temple police (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:52">Luke 22:52</span>) with swords (knives) and staves (clubs) with a hired rabble who had lanterns also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:3">John 18:3</span>) in spite of the full moon. Judas was taking no chances of failure for he well knew the strange power of Jesus. </p>
