Like the other Synoptics Matthew conceals the name of Peter, probably for prudential reasons as he was still living before A.D. 68. John writing at the end of the century mentions Peter's name (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:10">John 18:10</span>). The sword or knife was one of the two that the disciples had (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:38">Luke 22:38</span>).

He may have been the leader of the band. His name, Malchus, is also given by John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:10">John 18:10</span>) because Peter was then dead and in no danger. </p>
