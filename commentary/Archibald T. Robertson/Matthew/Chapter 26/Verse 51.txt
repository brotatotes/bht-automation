 One of them that were with Jesus  (εις των μετα Ιησου). Like the other Synoptics Matthew conceals the name of Peter, probably for prudential reasons as he was still living before A.D. 68. John writing at the end of the century mentions Peter's name (John 18:10). The sword or knife was one of the two that the disciples had (Luke 22:38). Bruce suggests that it was a large knife used in connexion with the paschal feast. Evidently Peter aimed to cut off the man's head, not his ear (ωτιον is diminutive in form, but not in sense, as often in the Koine). He may have been the leader of the band. His name, Malchus, is also given by John (John 18:10) because Peter was then dead and in no danger.
