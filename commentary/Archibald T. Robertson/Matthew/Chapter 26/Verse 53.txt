<p><b>Legions </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγιωνας</span></span>). A Latin word. Roman soldiers in large numbers were in Palestine later in A.D. 66, but they were in Caesarea and in the tower of Antonia in Jerusalem. A full Roman legion had 6,100 foot and 726 horse in the time of Augustus. But Jesus sees more than twelve legions at his command (one for each apostle) and shows his undaunted courage in this crisis. One should recall the story of Elisha at Dothan (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+6:17">2 Kings 6:17</span>). </p>
