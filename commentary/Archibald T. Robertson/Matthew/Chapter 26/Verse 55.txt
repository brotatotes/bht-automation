<p><b> As against a robber </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως επ ληιστην</span></span>). As a robber, not as a thief, but a robber hiding from justice. He will be crucified between two robbers and on the very cross planned for their leader, Barabbas. They have come with no warrant for any crime, but with an armed force to seize Jesus as if a highway robber. Jesus reminds them that he used to sit (imperfect, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθεζομην</span></span>) in the temple and teach. But he sees God's purpose in it all for the prophets had foretold his "cup." The desertion of Jesus by the disciples followed this rebuke of the effort of Peter. Jesus had surrendered. So they fled. </p>
