<p><b> I am able to destroy the temple of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμα καταλυσα τον ναον του θεου</span></span>). What he had said (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span>) referred to the temple of his body which they were to destroy (and did) and which he would raise again in three days as he did. It was a pitiful perversion of what Jesus had said and even so the two witnesses disagreed in their misrepresentation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:59">Mark 14:59</span>). </p>
