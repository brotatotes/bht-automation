<p><b> Thou hast said </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ ειπας</span></span>). This is a Greek affirmative reply. Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:62">Mark 14:62</span>) has it plainly, "I am" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span>). But this is not all that Jesus said to Caiaphas. He claims that the day will come when Jesus will be the Judge and Caiaphas the culprit using the prophetic language in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+109:1">Psalms 109:1</span>. It was all that Caiaphas wanted. </p>
