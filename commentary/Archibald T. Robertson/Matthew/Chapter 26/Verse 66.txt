<p><b> He is worthy of death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενοχος θανατου εστιν</span></span>). Held in the bonds of death (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν, εχω</span></span>) as actually guilty with the genitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θανατου</span></span>).
