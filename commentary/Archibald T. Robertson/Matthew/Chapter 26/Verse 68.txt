 Thou Christ  (Χριστε). With definite sneer at his claims under oath in Matthew 26:63. With uncontrolled glee and abandon like a lot of hoodlums these doctors of divinity insulted Jesus. They actually spat in his face, buffeted him on the neck (εκολαφισαν, from κολαφος the fist), and struck him in the face with the palms of their hands (εραπισαν, from ραπις, a rod), all personal indignities after the legal injustice already done. They thus gave vent to their spite and hatred.
