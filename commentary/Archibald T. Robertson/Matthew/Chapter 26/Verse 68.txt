<p><b> Thou Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστε</span></span>). With definite sneer at his claims under oath in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:63">Matthew 26:63</span>. With uncontrolled glee and abandon like a lot of hoodlums these doctors of divinity insulted Jesus. They actually spat in his face, buffeted him on the neck (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκολαφισαν</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κολαφος</span></span> the fist), and struck him in the face with the palms of their hands (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εραπισαν</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ραπις</span></span>, a rod), all personal indignities after the legal injustice already done. They thus gave vent to their spite and hatred. </p>
