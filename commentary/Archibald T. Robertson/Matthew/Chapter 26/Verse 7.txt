<p><b> An alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλαβαστρον μυρου βαρυτιμου</span></span>). The flask was of alabaster, a carbonate of lime or sulphate of lime, white or yellow stone, named alabaster from the town in Egypt where it was chiefly found. It was used for a phial employed for precious ointments in ancient writers, inscriptions and papyri just as we speak of a glass for the vessel made of glass. It had a cylindrical form at the top, as a rule, like a closed rosebud (Pliny). Matthew does not say what the ointment (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυρου</span></span>) was, only saying that it was "exceeding precious" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρυτιμου</span></span>), of weighty value, selling at a great price. Here only in the N.T. "An alabaster of nard (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυρου</span></span>) was a present for a king" (Bruce). It was one of five presents sent by Cambyses to the King of Ethiopia (Herodotus, iii. 20).</p>
<p><b>She poured it upon his head </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεχεεν επ της κεφαλης αυτου</span></span>). So Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:3">Mark 14:3</span>), while John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:3">John 12:3</span>) says that she "anointed the feet of Jesus." Why not both? The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεχεεν</span></span> is literally to pour down. It is the first aorist active indicative, unusual form. </p>
