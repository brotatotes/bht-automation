<p><b> With an oath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα ορκου</span></span>). This time Peter added an oath, probably a former habit so common to the Jews at that time, and denied acquaintance with Jesus. He even refers to Jesus as "the man" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον ανθρωπον</span></span>), an expression that could convey contempt, "the fellow." </p>
