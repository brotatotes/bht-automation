<p><b> They that stood by </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εστωτες</span></span>). The talk about Peter continued. Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:59">Luke 22:59</span>) states that the little while was about an hour. The bystanders came up to Peter and bluntly assert that he was "of a truth" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθως</span></span>) one of the followers of Jesus for his speech betrayed him. Even the Revised Version retains "bewrayeth," quaint old English for "betrayeth." The Greek has it simply "makes thee evident" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δηλον σε ποιε</span></span>). His dialect (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλια</span></span>) clearly revealed that he was a Galilean. The Galileans had difficulty with the gutterals and Peter's second denial had exposed him to the tormenting raillery of the loungers who continued to nag him. </p>
