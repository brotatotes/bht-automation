<p><b> This waste </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η απωλεια αυτη</span></span>). Dead loss (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απωλεια</span></span>) they considered it, nothing but sentimental aroma. It was a cruel shock to Mary of Bethany to hear this comment. Matthew does not tell as John does (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:4">John 12:4</span>) that it was Judas who made the point which the rest endorsed. Mark explains that they mentioned "three hundred pence," while Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:9">Matthew 26:9</span>) only says "for much" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλου</span></span>). </p>
