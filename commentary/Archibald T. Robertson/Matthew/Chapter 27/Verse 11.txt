<p><b> Now Jesus stood before the governor </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε Ιησους εσταθη εμπροσθεν του ηγεμονος</span></span>). Here is one of the dramatic episodes of history. Jesus stood face to face with the Roman governor. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσταθη</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστη</span></span> (second aorist active), is first aorist passive and can mean "was placed" there, but he stood, not sat. The term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγεμων</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγεομα</span></span>, to lead) was technically a <i>legatus Caesaris</i>, an officer of the Emperor, more exactly procurator, ruler under the Emperor of a less important province than propraetor (as over Syria). The senatorial provinces like Achaia were governed by proconsuls. Pilate represented Roman law.</p>
<p><b>Art thou the King of the Jews? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συ ε ο βασιλευς των Ιουδαιων;</span></span>). This is what really mattered. Matthew does not give the charges made by the Sanhedrin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:2">Luke 23:2</span>) nor the private interview with Pilate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:28-32">John 18:28-32</span>). He could not ignore the accusation that Jesus claimed to be King of the Jews. Else he could be himself accused to Caesar for disloyalty. Rivals and pretenders were common all over the empire. So here was one more. By his answer (<b> thou sayest </b>) Jesus confesses that he is. So Pilate has a problem on his hands. What sort of a king does this one claim to be?</p>
<p><b>Thou </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ</span></span>) the King of the Jews? </p>
