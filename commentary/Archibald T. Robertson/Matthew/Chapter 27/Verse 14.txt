<p><b> And he gave him no answer, not even to one word </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκ απεκριθη αυτω προς ουδε εν ρημα</span></span>). Jesus refused to answer the charges of the Jews (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:12">Matthew 27:12</span>). Now he continued silent under the direct question of Pilate. The Greek is very precise besides the double negative. "He did not reply to him up to not even one word." This silent dignity amazed Pilate and yet he was strangely impressed. </p>
