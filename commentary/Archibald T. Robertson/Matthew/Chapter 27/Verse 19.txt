<p><b> His wife </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η γυνη αυτου</span></span>). Poor Pilate was getting more entangled every moment as he hesitated to set Jesus free whom he knew to be free of any crime against Caesar. Just at the moment when he was trying to enlist the people in behalf of Jesus against the schemes of the Jewish leaders, his wife sent a message about her dream concerning Jesus. She calls Jesus "that righteous man" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω δικαιω εκεινω</span></span>) and her psychical sufferings increased Pilate's superstitious fears. Tradition names her Procla and even calls her a Christian which is not probable. But it was enough to unnerve the weak Pilate as he sat on the judgment-seat (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ του βηματος</span></span>) up over the pavement. </p>
