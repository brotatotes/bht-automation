<p><b> What then shall I do unto Jesus which is called Christ? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ουν ποιησω Ιησουν τον λεγομενον Χριστον;</span></span>). They had asked for Barabbas under the tutelage of the Sanhedrin, but Pilate pressed home the problem of Jesus with the dim hope that they might ask for Jesus also. But they had learned their lesson. Some of the very people who shouted "Hosannah" on the Sunday morning of the Triumphal Entry now shout</p>
<p><b>Let him be crucified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταυρωθητω</span></span>). The tide has now turned against Jesus, the hero of Sunday, now the condemned criminal of Friday. Such is popular favour. But all the while Pilate is shirking his own fearful responsibility and trying to hide his own weakness and injustice behind popular clamour and prejudice. </p>
