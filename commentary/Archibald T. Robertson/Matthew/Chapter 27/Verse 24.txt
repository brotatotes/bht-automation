<p><b> Washed his hands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απενιψατο τας χειρας</span></span>). As a last resort since the hubbub (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θορυβος</span></span>) increased because of his vacillation. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απονιπτω</span></span> means to wash off and the middle voice means that he washed off his hands for himself as a common symbol of cleanliness and added his pious claim with a slap at them.</p>
<p><b>I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man </b> (or</p>
<p><b>this blood </b>);</p>
<p><b>see ye to it </b>. (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αθωιος ειμ απο του αιματος του δικαιου τουτου</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του αιματος τουτου</span></span> as some manuscripts have it, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμεις οψεσθε</span></span>.) The Jews used this symbol (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+21:6">Deuteronomy 21:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+26:6">Psalms 26:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+73:13">Psalms 73:13</span>). Plummer doubts if Pilate said these words with a direct reference to his wife's message (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:19">Matthew 26:19</span>), but I fail to see the ground for that scepticism. The so-called <i>Gospel of Peter</i> says that Pilate washed his hands because the Jews refused to do so. </p>
