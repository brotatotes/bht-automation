<p><b> Into the palace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το πραιτωριον</span></span>). In Rome the praetorium was the camp of the praetorian (from praetor) guard of soldiers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:13">Philippians 1:13</span>), but in the provinces it was the palace in which the governor resided as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:35">Acts 23:35</span> in Caesarea. So here in Jerusalem Pilate ordered Jesus and all the band or cohort (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολην την σπειραν</span></span>) of soldiers to be led into the palace in front of which the judgment-seat had been placed. The Latin <i>spira</i> was anything rolled into a circle like a twisted ball of thread. These Latin words are natural here in the atmosphere of the court and the military environment. The soldiers were gathered together for the sport of seeing the scourging. These heathen soldiers would also enjoy showing their contempt for the Jews as well as for the condemned man. </p>
