<p><b> A scarlet robe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χλαμυδα κοκκινην</span></span>). A kind of short cloak worn by soldiers, military officers, magistrates, kings, emperors (2Macc. 12:35; Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. V. 1,10), a soldier's <i>sagum</i> or scarf. Carr (<i>Cambridge Gk. Test.</i>) suggests that it may have been a worn-out scarf of Pilate's. The scarlet colour (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοκκινην</span></span>) was a dye derived from the female insect (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερμες</span></span>) which gathered on the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλεξ χοχχιφερα</span></span> found in Palestine. These dried clusters of insects look like berries and form the famous dye. The word occurs in Plutarch, Epictetus, Herodas, and late papyri besides the Septuagint and New Testament. Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:17">Mark 15:17</span>) has "purple" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορφυραν</span></span>). There are various shades of purple and scarlet and it is not easy to distinguish these colours or tints. The manuscripts vary here between "stripped" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκδυσαντες</span></span>) and "clothed" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενδυσαντες</span></span>). He had been stripped for the scourging. If "clothed" is correct, the soldiers added the scarlet (purple) mantle. Herodotus (iii. 139) relates that Darius richly rewarded a Samian exile for a rare scarlet robe which he obtained from him. This scarlet mantle on Jesus was mock imitation of the royal purple. </p>
