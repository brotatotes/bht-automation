<p><b> Repented himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταμεληθεις</span></span>). Probably Judas saw Jesus led away to Pilate and thus knew that the condemnation had taken place. This verb (first aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταμελομα</span></span>) really means to be sorry afterwards like the English word <i>repent</i> from the Latin <i>repoenitet</i>, to have pain again or afterwards. See the same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταμεληθεις</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:30">Matthew 21:30</span> of the boy who became sorry and changed to obedience. The word does not have an evil sense in itself. Paul uses it of his sorrow for his sharp letter to the Corinthians, a sorrow that ceased when good came of the letter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:8">2 Corinthians 7:8</span>). But mere sorrow avails nothing unless it leads to change of mind and life (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοια</span></span>), the sorrow according to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:9">2 Corinthians 7:9</span>). This sorrow Peter had when he wept bitterly. It led Peter back to Christ. But Judas had only remorse that led to suicide. </p>
