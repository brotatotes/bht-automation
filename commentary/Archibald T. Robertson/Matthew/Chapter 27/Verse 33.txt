<p><b> Golgotha </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γολγοθα</span></span>). Chaldaic or Aramaic <i>Gulgatha</i>, Hebrew <i>Gulgoleth</i>, place of a skull-shaped mount, not place of skulls. Latin Vulgate <i>Calvariae locus</i>, hence our Calvary. Tyndale misunderstood it as a place of dead men's skulls. Calvary or Golgotha is not the traditional place of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, but a place outside of the city, probably what is now called Gordon's Calvary, a hill north of the city wall which from the Mount of Olives looks like a skull, the rock-hewn tombs resembling eyes in one of which Jesus may have been buried. </p>
