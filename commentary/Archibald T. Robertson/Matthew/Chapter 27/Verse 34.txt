<p><b> Wine mingled with gall </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οινον μετα χολης μεμιγμενον</span></span>). Late MSS. read</p>
<p><b>vinegar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οξος</span></span>) instead of wine and Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:23">Mark 15:23</span>) has myrrh instead of gall. The myrrh gave the sour wine a better flavour and like the bitter gall had a narcotic and stupefying effect. Both elements may have been in the drink which Jesus tasted and refused to drink. Women provided the drink to deaden the sense of pain and the soldiers may have added the gall to make it disagreeable. Jesus desired to drink to the full the cup from his Father's hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:11">John 18:11</span>). </p>
