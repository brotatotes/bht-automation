<p><b> Robbers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ληιστα</span></span>). Not thieves (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλεπτα</span></span>) as in Authorized Version. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:55">Matthew 26:55</span>. These two robbers were probably members of the band of Barabbas on whose cross Jesus now hung. </p>
