<p><b> See thou to it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ οψη</span></span>). Judas made a belated confession of his sin in betraying innocent blood to the Sanhedrin, but not to God, nor to Jesus. The Sanhedrin ignore the innocent or righteous blood (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιμα αθωιον</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιον</span></span>) and tell Judas to look after his own guilt himself. They ignore also their own guilt in the matter. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ οψη</span></span> as a volitive future, an equivalent of the imperative, is commoner in Latin (<i>tu videris</i>) than in Greek, though the <i>Koine</i> shows it also. The sentiment is that of Cain (Grotius, Bruce). </p>
