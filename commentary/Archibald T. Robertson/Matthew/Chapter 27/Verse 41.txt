<p><b> The chief priests mocking </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αρχιερεις εμπαιζοντες</span></span>). The Sanhedrin in fact, for "the scribes and elders" are included. The word for mocking (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμπαιζοντεσ, εν,</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιζω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παις</span></span>, child) means acting like silly children who love to guy one another. These grave and reverend seniors had already given vent to their glee at the condemnation of Jesus by themselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:67">Matthew 26:67</span>). </p>
