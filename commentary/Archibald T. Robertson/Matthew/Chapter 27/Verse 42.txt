<p><b> He saved others; himself he cannot save </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλους εσωσεν; εαυτον ου δυνατα σωσα</span></span>). The sarcasm is true, though they do not know its full significance. If he had saved himself now, he could not have saved any one. The paradox is precisely the philosophy of life proclaimed by Jesus himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:39">Matthew 10:39</span>).</p>
<p><b>Let him now come down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβατω νυν</span></span>). Now that he is a condemned criminal nailed to the Cross with the claim of being "the King of Israel" (the Jews) over his head. Their spiteful assertion that they would then believe upon Jesus (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ' αυτον</span></span>) is plainly untrue. They would have shifted their ground and invented some other excuse. When Jesus wrought his greatest miracles, they wanted "a sign from heaven." These "pious scoffers" (Bruce) are like many today who make factitious and arbitrary demands of Christ whose character and power and deity are plain to all whose eyes are not blinded by the god of this world. Christ will not give new proofs to the blind in heart. </p>
