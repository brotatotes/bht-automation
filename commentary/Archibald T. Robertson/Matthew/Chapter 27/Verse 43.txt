<p><b> Let him deliver him now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυσασθω νυν</span></span>). They add the word "now" to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:21">Matthew 27:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:8">Matthew 22:8</span>. That is the point of the sneer at Christ's claim to be God's son thrown in his teeth again and at the willingness and power of God to help his "son." The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω</span></span> here may mean</p>
<p><b>love </b> as in the Septuagint (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:20">Psalms 18:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+41:12">Psalms 41:12</span>) or "cares for" (Moffatt), "gin he cares ocht for him" (<i>Braid Scots</i>). </p>
