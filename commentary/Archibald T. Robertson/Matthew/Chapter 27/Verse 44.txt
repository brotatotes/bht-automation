<p><b> The robbers also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο ληιστα</span></span>). Probably "even the robbers" (Weymouth) who felt a momentary superiority to Jesus thus maligned by all. So the inchoative imperfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωνειδιζον</span></span> means "began to reproach him." </p>
