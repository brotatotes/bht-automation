<p><b> From the sixth hour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο εκτης ωρας</span></span>). Curiously enough McNeile takes this to mean the trial before Pilate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:14">John 18:14</span>). But clearly John uses Roman time, writing at the close of the century when Jewish time was no longer in vogue. It was six o'clock in the morning Roman time when the trial occurred before Pilate. The crucifixion began at the third hour (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:25">Mark 15:25</span>) Jewish time or nine A.M. The darkness began at noon, the sixth hour Jewish time and lasted till 3 P.M. Roman time, the ninth hour Jewish time (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:33">Mark 15:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:45">Matthew 27:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:44">Luke 23:44</span>). The dense darkness for three hours could not be an eclipse of the sun and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:45">Luke 23:45</span>) does not so say, only "the sun's light failing." Darkness sometimes precedes earthquakes and one came at this time or dense masses of clouds may have obscured the sun's light. One need not be disturbed if nature showed its sympathy with the tragedy of the dying of the Creator on the Cross (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:22">Romans 8:22</span>), groaning and travailing until now. </p>
