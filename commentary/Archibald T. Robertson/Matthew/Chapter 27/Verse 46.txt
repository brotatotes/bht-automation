<p><b> My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θεε μου, θεε μου, ινα τ με εγκατελιπεσ;</span></span>). Matthew first transliterates the Aramaic, according to the Vatican manuscript (B), the words used by Jesus: <i>Eloi, eloi, lema sabachthanei</i>; Some of the MSS. give the transliteration of these words from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:1">Psalms 22:1</span> in the Hebrew (<i>Eli, Eli, lama Zaphthanei</i>). This is the only one of the seven sayings of Christ on the Cross given by Mark and Matthew. The other six occur in Luke and John. This is the only sentence of any length in Aramaic preserved in Matthew, though he has Aramaic words like amen, corban, mammon, pascha, raca, Satan, Golgotha. The so-called Gospel of Peter preserves this saying in a Docetic (Cerinthian) form: "My power, my power, thou hast forsaken me!" The Cerinthian Gnostics held that the <i>aeon</i> Christ came on the man Jesus at his baptism and left him here on the Cross so that only the man Jesus died. Nothing from Jesus so well illustrates the depth of his suffering of soul as he felt himself regarded as sin though sinless (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span> comes to our relief here as we see the Son of God bearing the sin of the world. This cry of desolation comes at the close of the three hours of darkness. </p>
