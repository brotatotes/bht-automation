<p><b> Whether Elijah cometh to save him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε ερχετα Ελειας σωσων αυτον</span></span>). The excuse had a pious sound as they misunderstood the words of Jesus in his outcry of soul anguish. We have here one of the rare instances (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωσων</span></span>) of the future participle to express purpose in the N.T. though a common Greek idiom. Some ancient MSS. add here what is genuine in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:34">John 19:34</span>, but what makes complete wreck of the context for in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:50">Matthew 27:50</span> Jesus cried with a loud voice and was not yet dead in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:49">Matthew 27:49</span>. It was a crass mechanical copying by some scribe from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:34">John 19:34</span>.
