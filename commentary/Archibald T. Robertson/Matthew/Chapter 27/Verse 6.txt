<p><b> Into the treasury </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον κορβαναν</span></span>). Josephus (<i>War</i> II. 9,4) uses this very word for the sacred treasury. <i>Korban</i> is Aramaic for <i>gift</i> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωρον</span></span>) as is plain in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:11">Mark 7:11</span>. The price of blood (blood-money) was pollution to the treasury (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+23:18">Deuteronomy 23:18</span>). So they took the money out and used it for a secular purpose. The rabbis knew how to split hairs about <i>Korban</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:1-23">Mark 7:1-23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:1-20">Matthew 15:1-20</span>), but they balk at this blood-money. </p>
