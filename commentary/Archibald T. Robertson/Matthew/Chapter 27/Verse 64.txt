<p><b> The last error </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η εσχατη πλανη</span></span>). The last delusion, imposture (Weymouth), fraud (Moffatt). Latin <i>error</i> is used in both senses, from <i>errare</i>, to go astray. The first fraud was belief in the Messiahship of Jesus, the second belief in his resurrection. </p>
