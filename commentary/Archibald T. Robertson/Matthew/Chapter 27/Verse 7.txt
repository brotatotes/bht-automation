<p><b> The potter's field </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του αγρου του κεραμεως</span></span>). Grotius suggests that it was a small field where potter's clay was obtained, like a brickyard (Broadus). Otherwise we do not know why the name exists. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:18">Acts 1:18</span> we have another account of the death of Judas by bursting open (possibly falling after hanging himself) after he obtained the field by the wages of iniquity. But it is possible that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκτησατο</span></span> there refers to the rabbinical use of <i>Korban</i>, that the money was still that of Judas though he was dead and so he really "acquired" the field by his blood-money. </p>
