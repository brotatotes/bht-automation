 The field of blood  (αγρος αιματος). This name was attached to it because it was the price of blood and that is not inconsistent with Acts 1:18. Today potter's field carries the idea here started of burial place for strangers who have no where else to lie (εις ταφην τοις ξενοις), probably at first Jews from elsewhere dying in Jerusalem. In Acts 1:19 it is calledAceldama  orplace of blood  (χωριον αιματος) for the reason that Judas' blood was shed there, here because it was purchased by blood money. Both reasons could be true.
