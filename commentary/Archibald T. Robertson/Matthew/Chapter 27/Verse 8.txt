<p><b> The field of blood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγρος αιματος</span></span>). This name was attached to it because it was the price of blood and that is not inconsistent with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:18">Acts 1:18</span>. Today potter's field carries the idea here started of burial place for strangers who have no where else to lie (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ταφην τοις ξενοις</span></span>), probably at first Jews from elsewhere dying in Jerusalem. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:19">Acts 1:19</span> it is called</p>
<p><b>Aceldama </b> or</p>
<p><b>place of blood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωριον αιματος</span></span>) for the reason that Judas' blood was shed there, here because it was purchased by blood money. Both reasons could be true. </p>
