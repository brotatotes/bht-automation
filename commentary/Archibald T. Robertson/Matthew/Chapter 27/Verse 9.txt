<p><b> By Jeremiah the prophet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια Ιερεμιου</span></span>). This quotation comes mainly from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+11:13">Zechariah 11:13</span> though not in exact language. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+18:18">Jeremiah 18:18</span> the prophet tells of a visit to a potter's house and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+32:6">Jeremiah 32:6</span> of the purchase of a field. It is in Zechariah that the thirty pieces of silver are mentioned. Many theories are offered for the combination of Zechariah and Jeremiah and attributing it all to Jeremiah as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:2">Mark 1:2</span> the quotation from Isaiah and Malachi is referred wholly to Isaiah as the more prominent of the two. Broadus and McNeile give a full discussion of the various theories from a mere mechanical slip to the one just given above. Matthew has here (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:10">Matthew 27:10</span>) "the field of the potter" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον αγρον του κεραμεως</span></span>) for "the potter the house of the Lord" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+11:13">Zechariah 11:13</span>. That makes it more parallel with the language of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:7">Matthew 27:7</span>. </p>
