<p><b> Now late on the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψε δε σαββατων, τη επιφωσκουση εις μιαν σαββατων</span></span>). This careful chronological statement according to Jewish days clearly means that before the sabbath was over, that is before six P.M., this visit by the women was made "to see the sepulchre" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεορησα τον ταφον</span></span>). They had seen the place of burial on Friday afternoon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:47">Mark 15:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:61">Matthew 27:61</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:55">Luke 23:55</span>). They had rested on the sabbath after preparing spices and ointments for the body of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:56">Luke 23:56</span>), a sabbath of unutterable sorrow and woe. They will buy other spices after sundown when the new day has dawned and the sabbath is over (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:1">Mark 16:1</span>). Both Matthew here and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:54">Luke 23:54</span>) use dawn (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιφωσκω</span></span>) for the dawning of the twenty-four hour-day at sunset, not of the dawning of the twelve-hour day at sunrise. The Aramaic used the verb for dawn in both senses. The so-called Gospel of Peter has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιφωσκω</span></span> in the same sense as Matthew and Luke as does a late papyrus. Apparently the Jewish sense of "dawn" is here expressed by this Greek verb. Allen thinks that Matthew misunderstands Mark at this point, but clearly Mark is speaking of sunrise and Matthew of sunset. Why allow only one visit for the anxious women? </p>
