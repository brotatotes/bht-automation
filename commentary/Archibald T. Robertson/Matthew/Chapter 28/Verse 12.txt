<p><b> They gave large money </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αργυρια ικανα εδωκαν</span></span>). The use of the plural for pieces of silver (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αργυρια</span></span>) is common. The papyri have many instances of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικανα</span></span> for considerable (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ικανω</span></span>, to reach to, attain to). These pious Sanhedrists knew full well the power of bribes. They make a contract with the Roman soldiers to tell a lie about the resurrection of Jesus as they paid Judas money to betray him.
