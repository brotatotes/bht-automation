<p><b> But some doubted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δε εδιστασαν</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δις</span></span> (in two, divided in mind). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:31">Matthew 14:31</span>. The reference is not to the eleven who were all now convinced after some doubt, but to the others present. Paul states that over five hundred were present, most of whom were still alive when he wrote (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:6">1 Corinthians 15:6</span>). It is natural that some should hesitate to believe so great a thing at the first appearance of Jesus to them. Their very doubt makes it easier for us to believe. This was the mountain where Jesus had promised to meet them. This fact explains the large number present. Time and place were arranged beforehand. It was the climax of the various appearances and in Galilee where were so many believers. They worshipped (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεκυνησαν</span></span>) Jesus as the women had done (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:9">Matthew 28:9</span>). He is now their Risen Lord and Saviour. </p>
