<p><b> All authority </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασα εξουσια</span></span>). Jesus came close to them (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσελθων</span></span>) and made this astounding claim. He spoke as one already in heaven with a world-wide outlook and with the resources of heaven at his command. His authority or power in his earthly life had been great (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:29">Matthew 7:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:23">Matthew 21:23</span>).

<p><b>Hath been given </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοθη</span></span>) is a timeless aorist (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 836f.).

Pentecost is still to come, but dynamic faith rules on this mountain in Galilee. </p>
