<p><b> All the nations </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα τα εθνη</span></span>). Not just the Jews scattered among the Gentiles, but the Gentiles themselves in every land. And not by making Jews of them, though this point is not made plain here. It will take time for the disciples to grow into this <i>Magna Charta</i> of the missionary propaganda. But here is the world program of the Risen Christ and it should not be forgotten by those who seek to foreshorten it all by saying that Jesus expected his second coming to be very soon, even within the lifetime of those who heard. He did promise to come, but he has never named the date. Meanwhile we are to be ready for his coming at any time and to look for it joyfully. But we are to leave that to the Father and push on the campaign for world conquest. This program includes making disciples or learners (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαθητευσατε</span></span>) such as they were themselves. That means evangelism in the fullest sense and not merely revival meetings. Baptism in (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>, not <i>into</i>) the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, in the name of the Trinity. Objection is raised to this language in the mouth of Jesus as too theological and as not a genuine part of the Gospel of Matthew for the same reason. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>, where Jesus speaks of the Father and the Son as here. But it is all to no purpose. There is a chapter devoted to this subject in my <i>The Christ of the Logia</i> in which the genuineness of these words is proven. The name of Jesus is the essential part of it as is shown in the Acts. Trine immersion is not taught as the Greek Church holds and practices, baptism in the name of the Father, then of the Son, then of the Holy Spirit. The use of name (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span>) here is a common one in the Septuagint and the papyri for power or authority. For the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span> in the sense here employed, not meaning <i>into</i>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:41">Matthew 10:41</span> (cf. also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:41">Matthew 12:41</span>). </p>
