<p><b> Unto the women </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταις γυναιξιν</span></span>). According to John, Mary Magdalene had left to go and tell Peter and John of the supposed grave robbery (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:1">John 20:1</span>). But the other women remained and had the interview with the angel (or men, Luke) about the empty tomb and the Risen Christ.</p>
<p><b>Jesus the Crucified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησουν τον εσταυρωμενον</span></span>). Perfect passive participle, state of completion. This he will always be. So Paul will preach as essential to his gospel "and this one crucified" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τουτον εσταυρωμενον</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:2">1 Corinthians 2:2</span>). </p>
