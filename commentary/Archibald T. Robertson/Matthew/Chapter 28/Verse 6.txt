<p><b> Risen from the dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγερθη απο των νεκρων</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Jesus the Risen </b>. This is the heart of the testimony of the angel to the women. It is what Paul wishes Timothy never to forget (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:8">2 Timothy 2:8</span>), "Jesus Christ risen from the dead" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησουν Χριστον εγηγερμενον εκ νεκρων</span></span>). They were afraid and dazzled by the glory of the scene, but the angel said, "Come, see the place where the Lord lay" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευτε ιδετε τον τοπον οπου εκειτο ο Κυριος</span></span>). Some MSS. do not have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Κυριος</span></span>, but he is the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκειτο</span></span>. His body was not there. It will not do to say that Jesus arose in spirit and appeared alive though his body remained in the tomb. The empty tomb is the first great fact confronting the women and later the men. Various theories were offered then as now. But none of them satisfy the evidence and explain the survival of faith and hope in the disciples that do not rest upon the fact of the Risen Christ whose body was no longer in the tomb. </p>
