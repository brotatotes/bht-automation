<p><b> He goeth before you into Galilee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προαγε υμας εις την Γαλιλαιαν</span></span>). Jesus did appear to the disciples in Galilee on two notable occasions (by the beloved lake, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:21">Matthew 28:21</span>, and on the mountain, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:16-20">Matthew 28:16-20</span>). Probably before the women were permitted to tell this story in full to the disciples who scouted as idle talk (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+24:11">John 24:11</span>) their first accounts, Jesus appeared to various disciples in Jerusalem on this first great Sunday. Jesus did not say that he would not see any of them in Jerusalem. He merely made a definite appointment in Galilee which he kept. </p>
