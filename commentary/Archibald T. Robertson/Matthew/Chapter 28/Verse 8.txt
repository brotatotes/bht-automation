<p><b> With fear and great joy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα φοβου κα χαρας μεγαλης</span></span>). A touch of life was this as the excited women ran quickly (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταχυ εδραμον</span></span>) as they had been told "to bring his disciples word" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαγγειλα τοις μαθηταις αυτου</span></span>). They had the greatest piece of news that it was possible to have. Mark calls it fear and ecstasy. Anything seemed possible now. Mark even says that at first they told no one anything for they were afraid (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:9">Mark 16:9</span>), the tragic close of the text of Mark in Aleph and B, our two oldest manuscripts. But these mingled emotions of ecstasy and dread need cause no surprise when all things are considered. </p>
