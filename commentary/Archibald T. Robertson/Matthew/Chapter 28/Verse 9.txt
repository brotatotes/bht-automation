<p><b> Jesus met them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησους υπηντησεν αυταις</span></span>). Came suddenly face to face (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανταω, υπο</span></span>) with them as they brooded over the message of the angel and the fact of the empty tomb (associative instrumental, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυταις</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:34">Matthew 8:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:1-6">Matthew 24:1-6</span>. Probably the lost portion of Mark's Gospel contained the story of this meeting with Jesus which changed their fears into joy and peace. His greeting was the ordinary "Hail" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρετε</span></span>). They fell at his feet and held them in reverence while they worshipped him. Jesus allowed this act of worship though he forbade eager handling of his body by Mary Magdalene (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:17">John 20:17</span>). It was a great moment of faith and cheer. </p>
