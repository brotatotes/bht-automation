<p><b> Is the axe laid </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αξινη κειτα</span></span>). This verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κειτα</span></span> is used as the perfect passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>. But the idea really is, "the axe lies at (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span>, before) the root of the trees." It is there ready for business. The prophetic present occurs also with "is hewn down" and "cast." </p>
