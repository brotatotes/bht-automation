<p><b> Will burn up with unquenchable fire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακαυσε πυρ ασβεστω</span></span>). Note perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>. The threshing floor, the fan, the wheat, the garner, the chaff (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχυρον</span></span>, chaff, straw, stubble), the fire furnish a life-like picture. The "fire" here is probably judgment by and at the coming of the Messiah just as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>. The Messiah "will thoroughly cleanse" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακαθαριε</span></span>, Attic future of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ιζω</span></span> and note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια-</span></span>). He will sweep from side to side to make it clean. </p>
