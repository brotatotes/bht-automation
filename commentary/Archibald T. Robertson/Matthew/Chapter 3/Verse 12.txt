 Will burn up with unquenchable fire  (κατακαυσε πυρ ασβεστω). Note perfective use of κατα. The threshing floor, the fan, the wheat, the garner, the chaff (αχυρον, chaff, straw, stubble), the fire furnish a life-like picture. The "fire" here is probably judgment by and at the coming of the Messiah just as in verse Matthew 3:11. The Messiah "will thoroughly cleanse" (διακαθαριε, Attic future of -ιζω and note δια-). He will sweep from side to side to make it clean.
