<p><b> Then cometh Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε παραγινετα ο Ιησους</span></span>). The same historical present used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:1">Matthew 3:1</span>. He comes all the way from Galilee to Jordan "to be baptized by him" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του βαπτισθηνα υπο αυτου</span></span>). The genitive articular infinitive of purpose, a very common idiom. The fame of John had reached Nazareth and the hour has come for which Jesus has waited. </p>
