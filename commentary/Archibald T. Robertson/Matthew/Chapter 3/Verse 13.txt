 Then cometh Jesus  (τοτε παραγινετα ο Ιησους). The same historical present used in Matthew 3:1. He comes all the way from Galilee to Jordan "to be baptized by him" (του βαπτισθηνα υπο αυτου). The genitive articular infinitive of purpose, a very common idiom. The fame of John had reached Nazareth and the hour has come for which Jesus has waited.
