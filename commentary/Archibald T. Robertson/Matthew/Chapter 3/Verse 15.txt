The explanation of Jesus satisfies John and he baptizes the Messiah though he has no sins to confess. It was proper (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεπον</span></span>) to do so else the Messiah would seem to hold aloof from the Forerunner. Thus the ministries of the two are linked together. </p>
