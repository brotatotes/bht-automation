<p><b> The Spirit of God descending as a dove </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα θεου καταβαινον ωσε περιστεραν</span></span>). It is not certain whether Matthew means that the Spirit of God took the form of a dove or came upon Jesus as a dove comes down. Either makes sense, but Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:22">Luke 3:22</span>) has it "in bodily form as a dove" and that is probably the idea here. The dove in Christian art has been considered the symbol of the Holy Spirit. </p>
