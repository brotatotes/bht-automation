<p><b> A voice out of the heavens </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνη εκ των ουρανων</span></span>). This was the voice of the Father to the Son whom he identifies as His Son, "my beloved Son." Thus each person of the Trinity is represented (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) at this formal entrance of Jesus upon his Messianic ministry. John heard the voice, of course, and saw the dove. It was a momentous occasion for John and for Jesus and for the whole world. The words are similar to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span> and the voice at the Transfiguration (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:5">Matthew 17:5</span>). The good pleasure of the Father is expressed by the timeless aorist (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδοκησα</span></span>). </p>
