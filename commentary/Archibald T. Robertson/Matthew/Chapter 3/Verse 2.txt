<p><b> Repent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοειτε</span></span>). Broadus used to say that this is the worst translation in the New Testament. The trouble is that the English word "repent" means "to be sorry again" from the Latin <i>repoenitet</i> (impersonal). John did not call on the people to be sorry, but to change (think afterwards) their mental attitudes (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετανοειτε</span></span>) and conduct. The Vulgate has it "do penance" and Wycliff has followed that. The Old Syriac has it better: "Turn ye." The French (Geneva) has it "Amendez vous." This is John's great word (Bruce) and it has been hopelessly mistranslated. The tragedy of it is that we have no one English word that reproduces exactly the meaning and atmosphere of the Greek word. The Greek has a word meaning to be sorry (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεταμελομα</span></span>) which is exactly our English word repent and it is used of Judas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:3">Matthew 27:3</span>). John was a new prophet with the call of the old prophets: "Turn ye" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:12">Joel 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joe+55:7">Joel 55:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+33:11">Ezekiel 33:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+33:15">Ezekiel 33:15</span>). </p>
<p><b> For the kingdom of heaven is at hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγγικεν γαρ η Βασιλεια των ουρανων</span></span>). Note the position of the verb and the present perfect tense. It was a startling word that John thundered over the hills and it re-echoed throughout the land. The Old Testament prophets had said that it would come some day in God's own time. John proclaims as the herald of the new day that it has come, has drawn near. How near he does not say, but he evidently means very near, so near that one could see the signs and the proof. The words "the kingdom of heaven" he does not explain. The other Gospels use "the kingdom of God" as Matthew does a few times, but he has "the kingdom of heaven" over thirty times. He means "the reign of God," not the political or ecclesiastical organization which the Pharisees expected. His words would be understood differently by different groups as is always true of popular preachers. The current Jewish apocalypses had numerous eschatological ideas connected with the kingdom of heaven. It is not clear what sympathy John had with these eschatological features. He employs vivid language at times, but we do not have to confine John's intellectual and theological horizon to that of the rabbis of his day. He has been an original student of the Old Testament in his wilderness environment without any necessary contact with the Essenes who dwelt there. His voice is a new one that strikes terror to the perfunctory theologians of the temple and of the synagogue. It is the fashion of some critics to deny to John any conception of the spiritual content of his words, a wholly gratuitous criticism. </p>
<p><b> For this is he that was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτος γαρ εστιν ο ρηθεις δια Εσαιου του προφητου</span></span>). This is Matthew's way of interpreting the mission and message of the Baptist. He quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:3">Isaiah 40:3</span> where "the prophet refers to the return of Israel from the exile, accompanied by their God" (McNeile). He applies it to the work of John as "a voice crying in the wilderness" for the people to make ready the way of the Lord who is now near. He was only a voice, but what a voice he was. He can be heard yet across the centuries. </p>
