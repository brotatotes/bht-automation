<p><b> Now John himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος δε ο Ιωανης</span></span>). Matthew thus introduces the man himself and draws a vivid sketch of his dress (note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειχεν</span></span>, imperfect tense), his habit, and his food. Would such an uncouth figure be welcome today in any pulpit in our cities? In the wilderness it did not matter. It was probably a matter of necessity with him, not an affectation, though it was the garb of the original Elijah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+1:8">2 Kings 1:8</span>), rough sackcloth woven from the hair of camels. Plummer holds that "John consciously took Elijah as a model." </p>
