<p><b> And they were baptized </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εβαπτιζοντο</span></span>). It is the imperfect tense to show the repetition of the act as the crowds from Judea and the surrounding country kept going out to him (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεπορευετο</span></span>), imperfect again, a regular stream of folks going forth. Moffatt takes it as causative middle, "got baptized," which is possible. "The movement of course was gradual. It began on a small scale and steadily grew till it reached colossal proportions" (Bruce). It is a pity that baptism is now such a matter of controversy. Let Plummer, the great Church of England commentator on Matthew, speak here of John's baptising these people who came in throngs: "It is his office to bind them to a new life, symbolized by immersion in water." That is correct, symbolized, not caused or obtained. The word "river" is in the correct text, "river Jordan." They came "confessing their sins" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξομολογουμενο</span></span>), probably each one confessing just before he was baptized, "making open confession" (Weymouth). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span>. It was a never to be forgotten scene here in the Jordan. John was calling a nation to a new life. They came from all over Judea and even from the other side of El Ghor (the Jordan Gorge), Perea. Mark adds that finally all Jerusalem came. </p>
