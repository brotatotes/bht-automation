<p><b> The Pharisees and Sadducees </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των Φαρισαιων κα Σαδδουκαιων</span></span>). These two rival parties do not often unite in common action, but do again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span>. "Here a strong attraction, there a strong repulsion, made them for the moment forget their differences" (McNeile). John saw these rival ecclesiastics "coming for baptism" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομενους επ το βαπτισμα</span></span>). Alford speaks of "the Pharisees representing hypocritical superstition; the Sadducees carnal unbelief." One cannot properly understand the theological atmosphere of Palestine at this time without an adequate knowledge of both Pharisees and Sadducees. The books are numerous besides articles in the Bible dictionaries. I have pictured the Pharisees in my first (1916) Stone Lectures, <i>The Pharisees and Jesus</i>. John clearly grasped the significance of this movement on the part of the Pharisees and Sadducees who had followed the crowds to the Jordan. He had welcomed the multitudes, but right in the presence of the crowds he exposes the hypocrisy of the ecclesiastics.</p>
<p><b> Ye offspring of vipers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεννηματα εχιδνων</span></span>). Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:34">Matthew 12:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:33">Matthew 23:33</span>) will use the same language to the Pharisees. Broods of snakes were often seen by John in the rocks and when a fire broke out they would scurry (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυγειν</span></span>) to their holes for safety. "The coming wrath" was not just for Gentiles as the Jews supposed, but for all who were not prepared for the kingdom of heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:10">1 Thessalonians 1:10</span>). No doubt the Pharisees and Sadducees winced under the sting of this powerful indictment. </p>
