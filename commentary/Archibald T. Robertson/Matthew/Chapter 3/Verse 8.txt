 Fruit worthy of repentance  (Καρπον αξιον της μετανοιας). John demands proof from these men of the new life before he administers baptism to them. "The fruit is not the change of heart, but the acts which result from it" (McNeile). It was a bold deed for John thus to challenge as unworthy the very ones who posed as lights and leaders of the Jewish people. "Any one can do (ποιησατε, ςιδε Genesis 1:11) acts externally good but only a good man can grow a crop of right acts and habits" (Bruce).
