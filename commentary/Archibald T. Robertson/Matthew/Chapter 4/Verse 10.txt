<p><b> Get thee hence, Satan </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυπαγε, Σατανα</span></span>). The words "behind me" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπισω μου</span></span>) belong to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:23">Matthew 16:23</span>, not here. "Begone" Christ says to Satan. This temptation is the limit of diabolical suggestion and argues for the logical order in Matthew. "Satan" means the adversary and Christ so terms the devil here. The third time Jesus quotes Deuteronomy, this time <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+6:13">Deuteronomy 6:13</span>, and repels the infamous suggestion by Scripture quotation. The words "him alone thou shalt serve" need be recalled today. Jesus will warn men against trying to serve God and mammon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:24">Matthew 6:24</span>). The devil as the lord of the evil world constantly tries to win men to the service of the world and God. This is his chief camouflage for destroying a preacher's power for God. The word here in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:10">Matthew 4:10</span> for serve is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λατρευσεις</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λατρις</span></span> a hired servant, one who works for hire, then render worship. </p>
