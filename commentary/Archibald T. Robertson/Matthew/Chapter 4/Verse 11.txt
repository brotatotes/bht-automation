<p><b> Then the devil leaveth him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε αφιησιν αυτον ο διαβολος</span></span>). Note the use of "then" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε</span></span>) again and the historical present. The movement is swift. "And behold" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ιδου</span></span>) as so often in Matthew carries on the life-like picture. "<b> </b></p>
<p><b> Angels came </b> (aorist tense <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσηλθον</span></span> punctiliar action)</p>
<p><b> and were ministering </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διηκονουν</span></span>, picturesque imperfect, linear action)</p>
<p><b> unto him </b>." The victory was won in spite of the fast of forty days and the repeated onsets of the devil who had tried every avenue of approach. The angels could cheer him in the inevitable nervous and spiritual reaction from the strain of conflict, and probably also with food as in the case of Elijah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:6">1 Kings 19:6</span>). The issues at stake were of vast import as the champions of light and darkness grappled for the mastery of men. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:13">Luke 4:13</span> adds, that the devil left Jesus only "until a good opportunity" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ καιρου</span></span>). </p>
