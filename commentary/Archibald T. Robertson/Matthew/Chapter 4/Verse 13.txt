<p><b> Dwelt in Capernaum </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κατωικησεν εις Καφαρναουμ</span></span>). He went first to Nazareth, his old home, but was rejected there (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:16-31">Luke 4:16-31</span>). In Capernaum (probably the modern <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τελλ Hυμ</span></span>) Jesus was in a large town, one of the centres of Galilean political and commercial life, a fishing mart, where many Gentiles came. Here the message of the kingdom would have a better chance than in Jerusalem with its ecclesiastical prejudices or in Nazareth with its local jealousies. So Jesus "made his home" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατωικησεν</span></span>) here. </p>
