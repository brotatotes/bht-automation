<p><b> Saw a great light </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φως ειδεν μεγα</span></span>). Matthew quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:1">Isaiah 9:1</span>, and applies the words about the deliverer from Assyria to the Messiah. "The same district lay in spiritual darkness and death and the new era dawned when Christ went thither" (McNeile). Light sprang up from those who were sitting in the region and shadow of death (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν χορα κα σκια θανατου</span></span>). Death is personified. </p>
