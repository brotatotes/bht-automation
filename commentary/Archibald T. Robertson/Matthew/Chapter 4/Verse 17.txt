<p><b> Began Jesus to preach </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρξατο ο Ιησους κηρυσσειν</span></span>). In Galilee. He had been preaching for over a year already elsewhere. His message carries on the words of the Baptist about "repentance" and the "kingdom of heaven" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>) being at hand. The same word for "preaching" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυσσειν</span></span>) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κηρυξ</span></span>, herald, is used of Jesus as of John. Both proclaimed the good news of the kingdom. Jesus is more usually described as the Teacher, (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο διδασκαλος</span></span>) who taught (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιδασκεν</span></span>) the people. He was both herald and teacher as every preacher should be. </p>
