<p><b> Had fasted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηστευσας</span></span>). No perfunctory ceremonial fast, but of communion with the Father in complete abstention from food as in the case of Moses during forty days and forty nights (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:28">Exodus 34:28</span>). "The period of the fast, as in the case of Moses was spent in a spiritual ecstasy, during which the wants of the natural body were suspended" (Alford). "He afterward hungered" and so at the close of the period of forty days. </p>
