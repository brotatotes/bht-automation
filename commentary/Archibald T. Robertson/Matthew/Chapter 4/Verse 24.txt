<p><b> The report of him went forth into all Syria </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηλθεν η ακοη αυτου εις ολην την Σψριαν</span></span>). Rumour (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακοη</span></span>) carries things almost like the wireless or radio. The Gentiles all over Syria to the north heard of what was going on in Galilee. The result was inevitable. Jesus had a moving hospital of patients from all over Galilee and Syria. "<b> Those that were sick </b>" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους κακως εχοντας</span></span>), literally "those who had it bad," cases that the doctors could not cure. "<b> </b></p>
<p><b> Holden with divers diseases and torments </b>" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποικιλαις νοσοις κα βασανοις συνεχομενους</span></span>). "Held together" or "compressed" is the idea of the participle. The same word is used by Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:50">Luke 12:50</span> and by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span> and of the crowd pressing on Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:45">Luke 8:45</span>). They brought these difficult and chronic cases (present tense of the participle here) to Jesus. Instead of "divers" say "various" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποικιλαις</span></span>) like fever, leprosy, blindness. The adjective means literally many colored or variegated like flowers, paintings, jaundice, etc. Some had "torments" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασανοις</span></span>). The word originally (oriental origin) meant a touchstone, "Lydian stone" used for testing gold because pure gold rubbed on it left a peculiar mark. Then it was used for examination by torture. Sickness was often regarded as "torture." These diseases are further described "in a descending scale of violence" (McNeile) as "demoniacs, lunatics, and paralytics" as Moffatt puts it, "demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics" as Weymouth has it, (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονιζομενους κα σεληνιαζομενους κα παραλυτικους</span></span>), people possessed by demons, lunatics or "moon-struck" because the epileptic seizures supposedly followed the phases of the moon (Bruce) as shown also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:15">Matthew 17:15</span>, paralytics (our very word). Our word "lunatic" is from the Latin <i>luna</i> (moon) and carries the same picture as the Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεληνιαζομα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεληνη</span></span> (moon). These diseases are called "torments." </p>
