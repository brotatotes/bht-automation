<p><b> Great multitudes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλο πολλο</span></span>). Note the plural, not just one crowd, but crowds and crowds. And from all parts of Palestine including Decapolis, the region of the Ten Greek Cities east of the Jordan. No political campaign was equal to this outpouring of the people to hear Jesus and to be healed by Jesus. </p>
