<p><b> And showeth him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα δεικνυσιν αυτω</span></span>). This wonderful panorama had to be partially mental and imaginative, since the devil caused to pass in review "all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them." But this fact does not prove that all phases of the temptations were subjective without any objective presence of the devil. Both could be true. Here again we have the vivid historical present (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεικνυσιν</span></span>). The devil now has Christ upon a very high mountain whether the traditional Quarantania or not. It was from Nebo's summit that Moses caught the vision of the land of Canaan (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+34:1-3">Deuteronomy 34:1-3</span>). Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:5">Luke 4:5</span>) says that the whole panorama was "in a moment of time" and clearly psychological and instantaneous. </p>
