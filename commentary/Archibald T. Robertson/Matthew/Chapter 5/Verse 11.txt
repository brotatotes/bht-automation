 Falsely, for my sake  (ψευδομενο ενεκεν εμου). Codex Bezae changes the order of these last Beatitudes, but that is immaterial. What does matter is that the bad things said of Christ's followers shall be untrue and that they are slandered for Christ's sake. Both things must be true before one can wear a martyr's crown and receive the great reward (μισθος) in heaven. No prize awaits one there who deserves all the evil said of him and done to him here.
