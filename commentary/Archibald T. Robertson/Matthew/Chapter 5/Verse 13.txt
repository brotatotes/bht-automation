<p><b> Lost its savour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωρανθη</span></span>). The verb is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωρος</span></span> (dull, sluggish, stupid, foolish) and means to play the fool, to become foolish, of salt become tasteless, insipid (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:50">Mark 9:50</span>). It is common in Syria and Palestine to see salt scattered in piles on the ground because it has lost its flavour, "hae tint its tang" (<i>Braid Scots</i>), the most worthless thing imaginable. Jesus may have used here a current proverb. </p>
