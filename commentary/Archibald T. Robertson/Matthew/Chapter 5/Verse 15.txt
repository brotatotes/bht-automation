<p><b> Under the bushel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο τον μοδιον</span></span>). Not a bushel. "The figure is taken from lowly cottage life. There was a projecting stone in the wall on which the lamp was set. The house consisted of a single room, so that the tiny light sufficed for all" (Bruce). It was not put under the bushel (the only one in the room) save to put it out or to hide it. The bushel was an earthenware grain measure. "<b> </b></p>
<p><b> The stand </b>" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την λυχνιαν</span></span>), not "candlestick." It is "lamp-stand" in each of the twelve examples in the Bible. There was the one lamp-stand for the single room. </p>
