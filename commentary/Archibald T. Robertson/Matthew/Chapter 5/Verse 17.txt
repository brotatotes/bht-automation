<p><b> I came not to destroy, but to fulfil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ηλθον καταλυσα αλλα πληρωσα</span></span>). The verb "destroy" means to "loosen down" as of a house or tent (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>). Fulfil is to fill full. This Jesus did to the ceremonial law which pointed to him and the moral law he kept. "He came to fill the law, to reveal the full depth of meaning that it was intended to hold" (McNeile). </p>
