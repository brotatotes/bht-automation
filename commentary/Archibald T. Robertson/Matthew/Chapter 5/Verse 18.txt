<p><b> One jot or one tittle </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιωτα εν η μια κερεα</span></span>). "Not an iota, not a comma" (Moffatt), "not the smallest letter, not a particle" (Weymouth). The iota is the smallest Greek vowel, which Matthew here uses to represent the Hebrew <i>yod</i> (jot), the smallest Hebrew letter. "Tittle" is from the Latin <i>titulus</i> which came to mean the stroke above an abbreviated word, then any small mark. It is not certain here whether <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερεα</span></span> means a little horn, the mere point which distinguishes some Hebrew letters from others or the "hook" letter <i>Vav</i>. Sometimes <i>yod</i> and <i>vav</i> were hardly distinguishable. "In <i>Vay</i>. R. 19 the guilt of altering one of them is pronounced so great that if it were done the world would be destroyed" (McNeile). </p>
