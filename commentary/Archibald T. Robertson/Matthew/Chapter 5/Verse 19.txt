<p><b> Shall do and teach </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιηση κα διδαξη</span></span>). Jesus puts practice before preaching. The teacher must apply the doctrine to himself before he is qualified to teach others. The scribes and Pharisees were men who "say and do not" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:3">Matthew 23:3</span>), who preach but do not perform. This is Christ's test of greatness. </p>
