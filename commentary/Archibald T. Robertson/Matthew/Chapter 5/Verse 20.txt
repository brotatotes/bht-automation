 Shall exceed  (περισσευση πλειον). Overflow like a river out of its banks and then Jesus adds "more" followed by an unexpressed ablative (της δικαιοσυνης), brachylogy. A daring statement on Christ's part that they had to be better than the rabbis. They must excel the scribes, the small number of regular teachers (Matthew 5:21-48), and the Pharisees in the Pharisaic life (Matthew 6:1-18) who were the separated ones, the orthodox pietists.
