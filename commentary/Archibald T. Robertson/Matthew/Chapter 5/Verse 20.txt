<p><b> Shall exceed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσευση πλειον</span></span>). Overflow like a river out of its banks and then Jesus adds "more" followed by an unexpressed ablative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της δικαιοσυνης</span></span>), brachylogy. A daring statement on Christ's part that they had to be better than the rabbis. They must excel the scribes, the small number of regular teachers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:21-48">Matthew 5:21-48</span>), and the Pharisees in the Pharisaic life (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1-18">Matthew 6:1-18</span>) who were the separated ones, the orthodox pietists. </p>
