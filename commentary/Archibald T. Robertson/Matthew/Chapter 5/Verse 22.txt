 But I say unto you  (εγω δε λεγω υμιν). Jesus thus assumes a tone of superiority over the Mosaic regulations and proves it in each of the six examples. He goes further than the Law into the very heart. "Raca" (Ρακα) and "Thou fool" (Μωρε). The first is probably an Aramaic word meaning "Empty," a frequent word for contempt. The second word is Greek (dull, stupid) and is a fair equivalent of "raca." It is urged by some that μωρε is a Hebrew word, but Field (Otium Norvicense) objects to that idea. "Raca expresses contempt for a man's head=you stupid! More expresses contempt for his heart and character=you scoundrel" (Bruce). "The hell of fire" (την γεενναν του πυρος), "the Gehenna of fire," the genitive case (του πυρος) as the genus case describing Gehenna as marked by fire. Gehenna is the Valley of Hinnom where the fire burned continually. Here idolatrous Jews once offered their children to Molech (2 Kings 23:10). Jesus finds one cause of murder to be abusive language. Gehenna "should be carefully distinguished from Hades (αιδης) which is never used for the place of punishment, but for the place of departed spirits, without reference to their moral condition" (Vincent). The place of torment is in Hades (Luke 16:23), but so is heaven.
