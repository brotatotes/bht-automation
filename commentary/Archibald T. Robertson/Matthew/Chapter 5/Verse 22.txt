<p><b> But I say unto you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω δε λεγω υμιν</span></span>). Jesus thus assumes a tone of superiority over the Mosaic regulations and proves it in each of the six examples. He goes further than the Law into the very heart. </p>
<p>"<b>Raca</b>" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ρακα</span></span>) and </p>
<p>"<b>Thou fool</b>" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μωρε</span></span>). The first is probably an Aramaic word meaning "Empty," a frequent word for contempt. The second word is Greek (dull, stupid) and is a fair equivalent of "raca." It is urged by some that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωρε</span></span> is a Hebrew word, but Field (<i>Otium Norvicense</i>) objects to that idea. "<i>Raca</i> expresses contempt for a man's head=you stupid! <i>More</i> expresses contempt for his heart and character=you scoundrel" (Bruce). </p>
<p>"<b>The hell of fire</b>" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την γεενναν του πυρος</span></span>), "the Gehenna of fire," the genitive case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του πυρος</span></span>) as the genus case describing Gehenna as marked by fire. Gehenna is the Valley of Hinnom where the fire burned continually. Here idolatrous Jews once offered their children to Molech (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+23:10">2 Kings 23:10</span>). Jesus finds one cause of murder to be abusive language. Gehenna "should be carefully distinguished from Hades (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιδης</span></span>) which is never used for the place of punishment, but for the <i>place of departed spirits</i>, without reference to their moral condition" (Vincent). The place of torment is in Hades (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:23">Luke 16:23</span>), but so is heaven. </p>
