<p><b> First be reconciled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτον διαλλαγηθ</span></span>). Second aorist passive imperative. Get reconciled (ingressive aorist, take the initiative). Only example of this compound in the New Testament where usually <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλλασσω</span></span> occurs. Deissmann (<i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 187, New Ed.) gives a papyrus example second century A.D. A prodigal son, Longinus, writes to his mother Nilus: "I beseech thee, mother, be reconciled (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαλαγητ</span></span>) with me." The boy is a poor speller, but with a broken heart he uses the identical form that Jesus does. "The verb denotes mutual concession after mutual hostility, an idea absent from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλλασσω</span></span>" (Lightfoot). This because of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> (two, between two). </p>
