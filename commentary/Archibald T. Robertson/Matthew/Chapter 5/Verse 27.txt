 Thou shalt not commit adultery  (ου μοιχευσεις). These quotations (verses Matthew 5:21; Matthew 5:27; Matthew 5:33) from the Decalogue (Matthew 5:20 and Matthew 5:5) are from the Septuagint and use ου and the future indicative (volitive future, common Greek idiom). In Matthew 5:43 the positive form, volitive future, occurs (αγαπησεις). In Matthew 5:41 the third person (δοτω) singular second aorist active imperative is used. In Matthew 5:38 no verb occurs.
