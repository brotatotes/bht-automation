<p><b> A writing of divorcement </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστασιον</span></span>), "a divorce certificate" (Moffatt), "a written notice of divorce" (Weymouth). The Greek is an abbreviation of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιβλιον αποστασιου</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+19:7">Malachi 19:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:4">Mark 10:4</span>). Vulgate has here <i>libellum repudii</i>. The papyri use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συγγραφη αποστασιου</span></span> in commercial transactions as "a bond of release" (see Moulton and Milligan's <i>Vocabulary</i>, etc.) The written notice (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιβλιον</span></span>) was a protection to the wife against an angry whim of the husband who might send her away with no paper to show for it. </p>
