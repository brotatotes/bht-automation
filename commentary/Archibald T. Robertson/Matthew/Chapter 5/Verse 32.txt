<p><b> Saving for the cause of fornication </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεκτος λογου πορνειας</span></span>). An unusual phrase that perhaps means "except for a matter of unchastity." "Except on the ground of unchastity" (Weymouth), "except unfaithfulness" (Goodspeed), and is equivalent to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη επ πορνεια</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:9">Matthew 19:9</span>. McNeile denies that Jesus made this exception because Mark and Luke do not give it. He claims that the early Christians made the exception to meet a pressing need, but one fails to see the force of this charge against Matthew's report of the words of Jesus. It looks like criticism to meet modern needs. </p>
