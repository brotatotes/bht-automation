<p><b> Swear not at all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ομοσα ολως</span></span>). More exactly "not to swear at all" (indirect command, and aorist infinitive). Certainly Jesus does not prohibit oaths in a court of justice for he himself answered Caiaphas on oath. Paul made solemn appeals to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:27">1 Thessalonians 5:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:31">1 Corinthians 15:31</span>). Jesus prohibits all forms of profanity. The Jews were past-masters in the art of splitting hairs about allowable and forbidden oaths or forms of profanity just as modern Christians employ a great variety of vernacular "cuss-words" and excuse themselves because they do not use the more flagrant forms. </p>
