<p><b> An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφθαλμον αντ οφθαλμου κα οδοντα αντ οδοντος</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span> with the notion of exchange or substitution. The quotation is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:24">Exodus 21:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+19:21">Deuteronomy 19:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+24:20">Leviticus 24:20</span>. Like divorce this <i>jus talionis</i> is a restriction upon unrestrained vengeance. "It limited revenge by fixing an exact compensation for an injury" (McNeile). A money payment is allowed in the Mishna. The law of retaliation exists in Arabia today. </p>
