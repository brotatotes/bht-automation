<p><b> They that mourn </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πενθουντες</span></span>). This is another paradox. This verb "is most frequent in the LXX for mourning for the dead, and for the sorrows and sins of others" (McNeile). "There can be no comfort where there is no grief" (Bruce). Sorrow should make us look for the heart and hand of God and so find the comfort latent in the grief. </p>
