<p><b> Thy coat ... thy cloke also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον χιτωνα σου κα το ιματιον</span></span>). The "coat" is really a sort of shirt or undergarment and would be demanded at law. A robber would seize first the outer garment or cloke (one coat). If one loses the undergarment at law, the outer one goes also (the more valuable one). </p>
