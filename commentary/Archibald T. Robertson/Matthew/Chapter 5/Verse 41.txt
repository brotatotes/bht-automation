<p><b> Shall compel thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγαρευσε</span></span>). The Vulgate has <i>angariaverit</i>. The word is of Persian origin and means public couriers or mounted messengers (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγαρο</span></span>) who were stationed by the King of Persia at fixed localities, with horses ready for use, to send royal messages from one to another. So if a man is passing such a post-station, an official may rush out and compel him to go back to another station to do an errand for the king. This was called impressment into service. This very thing was done to Simon of Cyrene who was thus compelled to carry the cross of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:32">Matthew 27:32</span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγγαρευσαν</span></span>). </p>
