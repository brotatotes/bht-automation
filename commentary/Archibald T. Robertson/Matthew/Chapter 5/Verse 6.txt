<p><b> They that hunger and thirst after righteousness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πεινωντες κα διψωντες την δικαιοσυνην</span></span>). Here Jesus turns one of the elemental human instincts to spiritual use. There is in all men hunger for food, for love, for God. It is passionate hunger and thirst for goodness, for holiness. The word for "filled" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χορτασθησοντα</span></span>) means to feed or to fatten cattle from the word for fodder or grass like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:39">Mark 6:39</span> "green grass" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χορτος χλωρος</span></span>). </p>
