<p><b> Shall see God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον θεον οψοντα</span></span>). Without holiness no man will see the Lord in heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:14">Hebrews 12:14</span>). The Beatific Vision is only possible here on earth to those with pure hearts. No other can see the King now. Sin befogs and beclouds the heart so that one cannot see God. Purity has here its widest sense and includes everything. </p>
