<p><b> The peacemakers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ειρηνοποιο</span></span>). Not merely "peaceable men" (Wycliff) but "makkers up o' strife" (<i>Braid Scots</i>). It is hard enough to keep the peace. It is still more difficult to bring peace where it is not. "The perfect peacemaker is the Son of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:14">Ephesians 2:14</span>)" (McNeile). Thus we shall be like our Elder Brother. </p>
