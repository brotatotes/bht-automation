<p><b> Take heed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεχετε</span></span>). The Greek idiom includes "mind" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουν</span></span>) which is often expressed in ancient Greek and once in the Septuagint (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+7:17">Job 7:17</span>). In the New Testament the substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νους</span></span> is understood. It means to "hold the mind on a matter," take pains, take heed. "Righteousness" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνην</span></span>) is the correct text in this verse. Three specimens of the Pharisaic "righteousness" are given (alms, prayer, fasting).</p>
<p><b>To be seen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεαθηνα</span></span>). First aorist passive infinitive of purpose. Our word <i>theatrical</i> is this very word, spectacular performance.</p>
<p><b>With your Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα τω πατρ υμων</span></span>). Literally "beside your Father," standing by his side, as he looks at it. </p>
