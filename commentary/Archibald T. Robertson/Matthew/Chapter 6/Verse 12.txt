<p><b> Our debts </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα οφειληματα ημων</span></span>). Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:4">Luke 11:4</span>) has "sins" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτιας</span></span>). In the ancient Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειλημα</span></span> is common for actual legal debts as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:4">Romans 4:4</span>, but here it is used of moral and spiritual debts to God. "Trespasses" is a mistranslation made common by the Church of England Prayer Book. It is correct in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:14">Matthew 6:14</span> in Christ's argument about prayer, but it is not in the Model Prayer itself. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:28">Matthew 18:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:30">Matthew 18:30</span> for sin pictured again by Christ "as debt and the sinner as a debtor" (Vincent). We are thus described as having wronged God. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειλη</span></span> for moral obligation was once supposed to be peculiar to the New Testament. But it is common in that sense in the papyri (Deismann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 221; <i>Light from the Ancient East,</i> New ed., p. 331). We ask forgiveness "in proportion as" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span>) we <i>also</i> have forgiven those in debt to us, a most solemn reflection. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αφηκαμεν</span></span> is one of the three k aorists (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθηκα, εδωκα, ηκα</span></span>). It means to send away, to dismiss, to wipe off. </p>
