<p><b> Trespasses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραπτωματα</span></span>). This is no part of the Model Prayer. The word "trespass" is literally "falling to one side," a lapse or deviation from truth or uprightness. The ancients sometimes used it of intentional falling or attack upon one's enemy, but "slip" or "fault" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:1">Galatians 6:1</span>) is the common New Testament idea. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παραβασις</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:14">Romans 5:14</span>) is a positive violation, a transgression, conscious stepping aside or across. </p>
