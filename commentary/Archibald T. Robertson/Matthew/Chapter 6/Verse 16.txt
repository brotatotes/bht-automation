<p><b> Of a sad countenance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκυθρωπο</span></span>). Only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:17">Luke 24:17</span> in the N.T. It is a compound of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκυθρος</span></span> (sullen) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπς</span></span> (countenance). These actors or hypocrites "put on a gloomy look" (Goodspeed) and, if necessary, even "disfigure their faces" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφανιζουσιν τα προσωπα αυτων</span></span>), that they may look like they are fasting. It is this pretence of piety that Jesus so sharply ridicules. There is a play on the Greek words <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφανιζουσ</span></span> (disfigure) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανωσιν</span></span> (figure). They conceal their real looks that they may seem to be fasting, conscious and pretentious hypocrisy. </p>
