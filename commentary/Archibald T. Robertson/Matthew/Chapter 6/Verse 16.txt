 Of a sad countenance  (σκυθρωπο). Only here and Luke 24:17 in the N.T. It is a compound of σκυθρος (sullen) and οπς (countenance). These actors or hypocrites "put on a gloomy look" (Goodspeed) and, if necessary, even "disfigure their faces" (αφανιζουσιν τα προσωπα αυτων), that they may look like they are fasting. It is this pretence of piety that Jesus so sharply ridicules. There is a play on the Greek words αφανιζουσ (disfigure) and φανωσιν (figure). They conceal their real looks that they may seem to be fasting, conscious and pretentious hypocrisy.
