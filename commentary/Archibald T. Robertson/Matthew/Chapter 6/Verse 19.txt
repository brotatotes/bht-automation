 Lay not up for yourselves treasures  (μη θησαυριζετε υμιν θησαυρους). Do not have this habit (μη and the present imperative). See on Matthew 2:11 for the word "treasure." Here there is a play on the word, "treasure not for yourselves treasures." Same play in verse Matthew 6:20 with the cognate accusative. In both verses υμιν is dative of personal interest and is not reflexive, but the ordinary personal pronoun. Wycliff has it: "Do not treasure to you treasures."  Break through  (διορυσσουσιν). Literally "dig through." Easy to do through the mud walls or sun-dried bricks. Today they can pierce steel safes that are no longer safe even if a foot thick. The Greeks called a burglar a "mud-digger" (τοιχορυχος).
