<p><b> Lay not up for yourselves treasures </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη θησαυριζετε υμιν θησαυρους</span></span>). Do not have this habit (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the present imperative). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:11">Matthew 2:11</span> for the word "treasure." Here there is a play on the word, "treasure not for yourselves treasures." Same play in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:20">Matthew 6:20</span> with the cognate accusative. In both verses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν</span></span> is dative of personal interest and is not reflexive, but the ordinary personal pronoun. Wycliff has it: "Do not treasure to you treasures." </p>
<p><b> Break through </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διορυσσουσιν</span></span>). Literally "dig through." Easy to do through the mud walls or sun-dried bricks. Today they can pierce steel safes that are no longer safe even if a foot thick. The Greeks called a burglar a "mud-digger" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοιχορυχος</span></span>). </p>
