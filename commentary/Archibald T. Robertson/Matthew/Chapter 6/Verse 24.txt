 No man can serve two masters  (ουδεις δυνατα δυσ κυριοις δουλευειν). Many try it, but failure awaits them all. Men even try "to be slaves to God and mammon" (Θεω δουλευειν κα μαμωνα). Mammon is a Chaldee, Syriac, and Punic word like Plutus for the money-god (or devil). The slave of mammon will obey mammon while pretending to obey God. The United States has had a terrible revelation of the power of the money-god in public life in the Sinclair-Fall-Teapot-Air-Dome-Oil case. When the guide is blind and leads the blind, both fall into the ditch. The man who cannot tell road from ditch sees falsely as Ruskin shows in Modern Painters. He will hold to one (ενος ανθεξετα). The word means to line up face to face (αντ) with one man and so against the other.
