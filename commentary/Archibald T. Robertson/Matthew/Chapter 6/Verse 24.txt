<p><b> No man can serve two masters </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεις δυνατα δυσ κυριοις δουλευειν</span></span>). Many try it, but failure awaits them all. Men even try "to be slaves to God and mammon" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θεω δουλευειν κα μαμωνα</span></span>). Mammon is a Chaldee, Syriac, and Punic word like <i>Plutus</i> for the money-god (or devil). The slave of mammon will obey mammon while pretending to obey God. The United States has had a terrible revelation of the power of the money-god in public life in the Sinclair-Fall-Teapot-Air-Dome-Oil case. When the guide is blind and leads the blind, both fall into the ditch. The man who cannot tell road from ditch sees falsely as Ruskin shows in <i>Modern Painters</i>. He will hold to one (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενος ανθεξετα</span></span>). The word means to line up face to face (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντ</span></span>) with one man and so against the other. </p>
