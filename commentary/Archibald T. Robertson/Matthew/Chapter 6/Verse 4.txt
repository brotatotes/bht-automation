<p><b> In secret </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω κρυπτω</span></span>). The Textus Receptus added the words <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω φανερω</span></span> (openly) here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:6">Matthew 6:6</span>, but they are not genuine. Jesus does not promise a <i>public</i> reward for private piety. </p>
