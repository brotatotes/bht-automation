 Into thy closet  (εις το ταμειον). The word is a late syncopated form of ταμιειον from ταμιας (steward) and the root ταμ- from τεμνω, to cut. So it is a store-house, a separate apartment, one's private chamber, closet, or "den" where he can withdraw from the world and shut the world out and commune with God.
