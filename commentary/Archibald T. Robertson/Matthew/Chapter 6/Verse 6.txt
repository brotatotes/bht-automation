<p><b> Into thy closet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το ταμειον</span></span>). The word is a late syncopated form of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταμιειον</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταμιας</span></span> (steward) and the root <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταμ-</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεμνω</span></span>, to cut. So it is a store-house, a separate apartment, one's private chamber, closet, or "den" where he can withdraw from the world and shut the world out and commune with God. </p>
