<p><b> Judge not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη κρινετε</span></span>). The habit of censoriousness, sharp, unjust criticism. Our word critic is from this very word. It means to separate, distinguish, discriminate. That is necessary, but pre-judice (prejudgment) is unfair, captious criticism. </p>
