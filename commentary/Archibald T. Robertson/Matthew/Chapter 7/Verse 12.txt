<p><b> That men should do unto you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ποιωσιν υμιν ο ανθρωπο</span></span>). Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:31">Luke 6:31</span>) puts the Golden Rule parallel with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:42">Matthew 5:42</span>. The negative form is in Tobit 4:15. It was used by Hillel, Philo, Isocrates, Confucius. "The Golden Rule is the distilled essence of that 'fulfilment' (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17">Matthew 5:17</span>) which is taught in the sermon" (McNeile). Jesus puts it in positive form. </p>
