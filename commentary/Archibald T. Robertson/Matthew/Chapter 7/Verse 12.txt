 That men should do unto you  (ινα ποιωσιν υμιν ο ανθρωπο). Luke (Luke 6:31) puts the Golden Rule parallel with Matthew 5:42. The negative form is in Tobit 4:15. It was used by Hillel, Philo, Isocrates, Confucius. "The Golden Rule is the distilled essence of that 'fulfilment' (Matthew 5:17) which is taught in the sermon" (McNeile). Jesus puts it in positive form.
