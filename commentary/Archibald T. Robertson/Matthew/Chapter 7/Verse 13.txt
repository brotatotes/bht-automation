<p><b> By the narrow gate </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια της στενης πυλης</span></span>). The Authorized Version "at the strait gate" misled those who did not distinguish between "strait" and "straight." The figure of the Two Ways had a wide circulation in Jewish and Christian writings (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+30:19">Deuteronomy 30:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+21:8">Jeremiah 21:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+21:1">Jeremiah 21:1</span>). See the <i>Didache</i> i-vi; Barnabas xviii-xx. "The narrow gate" is repeated in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:14">Matthew 7:14</span> and</p>
<p><b>straitened the way </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεθλιμμενη η οδος</span></span>) added. The way is "compressed," narrowed as in a defile between high rocks, a tight place like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στενοχωρια</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:35">Romans 8:35</span>. "The way that leads to life involves straits and afflictions" (McNeile). Vincent quotes the <i>Pinax</i> or <i>Tablet</i> of Cebes, a contemporary of Socrates: "Seest thou not, then, a little door, and a way before the door, which is not much crowded, but very few travel it? This is the way that leadeth unto true culture." "The broad way" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρυχωρος</span></span>) is in every city, town, village, with the glaring white lights that lure to destruction. </p>
