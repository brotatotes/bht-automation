<p><b> False prophets </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των ψευδοπροφητων</span></span>). There were false prophets in the time of the Old Testament prophets. Jesus will predict "false Messiahs and false prophets" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>) who will lead many astray. They came in due time posing as angels of light like Satan, Judaizers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:13">2 Corinthians 11:13</span>.) and Gnostics (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span>). Already false prophets were on hand when Jesus spoke on this occasion (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:6">Acts 13:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>). In outward appearance they look like sheep in the sheep's clothing which they wear, but within they are "ravening wolves" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυκο αρπαγες</span></span>), greedy for power, gain, self. It is a tragedy that such men and women reappear through the ages and always find victims. Wolves are more dangerous than dogs and hogs. </p>
