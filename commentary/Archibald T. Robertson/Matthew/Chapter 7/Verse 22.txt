<p><b> Did we not prophesy in thy name? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου τω σω ονοματ επροφητευσαμεν;</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> in the question expects the affirmative answer. They claim to have prophesied (preached) in Christ's name and to have done many miracles. But Jesus will tear off the sheepskin and lay bare the ravening wolf. "I never knew you" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεποτε εγνων υμας</span></span>). "I was never acquainted with you" (experimental knowledge). Success, as the world counts it, is not a criterion of one's knowledge of Christ and relation to him. "I will profess unto them" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογησω αυτοις</span></span>), the very word used of profession of Christ before men (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:32">Matthew 10:32</span>). This word Jesus will use for public and open announcement of their doom. </p>
