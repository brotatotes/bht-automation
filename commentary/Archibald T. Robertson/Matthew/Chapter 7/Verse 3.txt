<p><b> The mote </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το καρφος</span></span>). Not dust, but a piece of dried wood or chaff, splinter (Weymouth, Moffatt), speck (Goodspeed), a very small particle that may irritate.</p>
<p><b>The beam </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την δοκον</span></span>). A log on which planks in the house rest (so papyri), joist, rafter, plank (Moffatt), pole sticking out grotesquely. Probably a current proverb quoted by Jesus like our people in glass houses throwing stones. Tholuck quotes an Arabic proverb: "How seest thou the splinter in thy brother's eye, and seest not the cross-beam in thine eye?" </p>
