<p><b> The sons of the kingdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο υιο της βασιλειας</span></span>). A favourite Hebrew idiom like "son of hell" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:15">Matthew 23:15</span>), "sons of this age" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:8">Luke 16:8</span>). The Jews felt that they had a natural right to the privileges of the kingdom because of descent from Abraham (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span>). But mere natural birth did not bring spiritual sonship as the Baptist had taught before Jesus did. </p>
<p><b> Into the outer darkness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το σκοτος το εξωτερον</span></span>). Comparative adjective like our "further out," the darkness outside the limits of the lighted palace, one of the figures for hell or punishment (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:13">Matthew 23:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:30">Matthew 25:30</span>). The repeated article makes it bolder and more impressive, "the darkness the outside," there where the wailing and gnashing of teeth is heard in the thick blackness of night. </p>
