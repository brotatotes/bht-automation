<p><b> Lying sick of a fever </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιβλημενην κα πυρεσσουσαν</span></span>). Two participles, bedridden (perfect passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλω</span></span>) and burning with fever (present active). How long the fever had had her we have no means of knowing, possibly a sudden and severe attack (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:30">Mark 1:30</span>), as they tell Jesus about her on reaching the house of Peter. We are not told what kind of fever it was. Fever itself was considered a disease. "Fever" is from German feuer (fire) like the Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρ</span></span>. </p>
