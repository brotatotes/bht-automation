 When even was come  (οψιας γενομενης). Genitive absolute. A beautiful sunset scene at the close of the Sabbath day (Mark 1:21). Then the crowds came as Jesus stood in the door of Peter's house (Mark 1:33; Matthew 8:14) as all the city gathered there with the sick, "all those who had it bad" (see on Matthew 4:24) and he healed them "with a word" (λογω). It was a never to be forgotten memory for those who saw it.
