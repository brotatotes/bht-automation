<p><b> A scribe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις γραμματευς</span></span>). One (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>)="a," indefinite article. Already a disciple as shown by "another of the disciples" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερος των μαθητων</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:21">Matthew 8:21</span>. He calls Jesus "Teacher" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκαλε</span></span>), but he seems to be a "bumptious" brother full of self-confidence and self-complacency. "Even one of that most unimpressionable class, in spirit and tendency utterly opposed to the ways of Jesus" (Bruce). Yet Jesus deals gently with him. </p>
