<p><b> Leave the dead to bury their own dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφες τους νεκρους θαψα τους εαυτων νεκρους</span></span>). The spiritually dead are always on hand to bury the physically dead, if one's real duty is with Jesus. Chrysostom says that, while it is a good deed to bury the dead, it is a better one to preach Christ. </p>
