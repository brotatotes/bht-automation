<p><b> The country of the Gadarenes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεν χωραν των Γαδαρηνων</span></span>). This is the correct text in Matthew while in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:1">Mark 5:1</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:26">Luke 8:26</span> it is "the country of the Gerasenes." Dr. Thomson discovered by the lake the ruins of Khersa (Gerasa). This village is in the district of the city of Gadara some miles southeastward so that it can be called after Gerasa or Gadara. So Matthew speaks of "two demoniacs" while Mark and Luke mention only one, the leading one. "<b>The tombs </b>" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των μνημειων</span></span>) were chambers cut into the mountain side common enough in Palestine then and now. On the eastern side of the lake the precipitous cliffs are of limestone formation and full of caves. It is one of the proofs that one is a maniac that he haunts the tombs. People shunned the region as dangerous because of the madmen. </p>
