<p><b> Thou Son of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιε του θεου</span></span>). The recognition of Jesus by the demons is surprising. The whole subject of demonology is difficult. Some hold that it is merely the ancient way of describing disease. But that does not explain the situation here. Jesus is represented as treating the demons as real existences separate from the human personality. Missionaries in China today claim that they have seen demons cast out. The devil knew Jesus clearly and it is not strange that Jesus was recognized by the devil's agents. They know that there is nothing in common between them and the Son of God (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημιν κα σο</span></span>, ethical dative) and they fear torment "before the time" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ καιρου</span></span>). Usually <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα δαιμονια</span></span> is the word in the New Testament for demons, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:31">Matthew 8:31</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δαιμονες</span></span> (the only example in the N.T.). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δαιμονιον</span></span> is a diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμων</span></span>. In Homer <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμων</span></span> is used synonymously with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεα</span></span>. Hesiod employed <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμων</span></span> of men of the golden age as tutelary deities. Homer has the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δαιμονιος</span></span> usually in an evil sense. Empedocles considered the demons both bad and good. They were thus used to relieve the gods and goddesses of much rascality. Grote (<i>History of Greece</i>) notes that the Christians were thus by pagan usage justified in calling idolatry the worship of demons. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:20">1 Corinthians 10:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:20">Revelation 9:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:13">Revelation 16:13</span>. In the Gospels demons are the same as unclean spirits (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:12">Mark 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:15">Mark 5:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:22">Mark 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:30">Mark 3:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:33">Luke 4:33</span>). The demons are disturbers (Vincent) of the whole life of man (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:2">Mark 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:25">Mark 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:45">Matthew 12:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:11">Luke 13:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:16">Luke 13:16</span>). </p>
