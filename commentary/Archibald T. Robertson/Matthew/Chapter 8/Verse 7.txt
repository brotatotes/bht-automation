 I will come and heal him  (εγω ελθων θεραπευσω αυτον). Future indicative, not deliberative subjunctive in question (McNeile). The word here for heal (θεραπευσω) means first to serve, give medical attention, then cure, restore to health. The centurion uses the more definite word for healing (ιαθησετα Matthew 8:8) as Matthew does in Matthew 8:13 (ιαθη). Luke (Luke 9:11), like a physician, says that Jesus healed (ιατο) those in need of treatment (θεραπειας), but the distinction is not always observed. In Acts 28:8 Luke uses ιασατο of the miraculous healings in Malta by Paul while he employs εθεραπευοντο (Acts 28:9) apparently of the practice of Luke the physician (so W. M. Ramsay). Matthew represents the centurion himself as speaking to Jesus while Luke has it that two committees from the centurion brought the messages, apparently a more detailed narrative. What one does through others he does himself as Pilate "scourged Jesus" (had him scourged).
