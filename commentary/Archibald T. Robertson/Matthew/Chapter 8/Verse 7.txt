<p><b> I will come and heal him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω ελθων θεραπευσω αυτον</span></span>). Future indicative, not deliberative subjunctive in question (McNeile). The word here for heal (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεραπευσω</span></span>) means first to serve, give medical attention, then cure, restore to health. The centurion uses the more definite word for healing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιαθησετα</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:8">Matthew 8:8</span>) as Matthew does in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:13">Matthew 8:13</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιαθη</span></span>). Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:11">Luke 9:11</span>), like a physician, says that Jesus healed (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιατο</span></span>) those in need of treatment (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεραπειας</span></span>), but the distinction is not always observed. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:8">Acts 28:8</span> Luke uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιασατο</span></span> of the miraculous healings in Malta by Paul while he employs <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθεραπευοντο</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:9">Acts 28:9</span>) apparently of the practice of Luke the physician (so W. M. Ramsay). Matthew represents the centurion himself as speaking to Jesus while Luke has it that two committees from the centurion brought the messages, apparently a more detailed narrative. What one does through others he does himself as Pilate "scourged Jesus" (had him scourged). </p>
