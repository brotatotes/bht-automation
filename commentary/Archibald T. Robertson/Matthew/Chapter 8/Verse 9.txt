<p><b> For I also am a man under authority </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα γαρ εγω ανθρωπος υπο εξουσιαν</span></span>). "Also" is in the text, though the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> here may mean "even," even I in my subordinate position have soldiers under me. As a military man he had learned obedience to his superiors and so expected obedience to his commands, instant obedience (aorist imperatives and aoristic present indicatives). Hence his faith in Christ's power over the illness of the boy even without coming. Jesus had only to speak with a word (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:8">Matthew 8:8</span>), say the word, and it would be done. </p>
