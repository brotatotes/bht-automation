<p><b> Publicans and sinners </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελωνα κα αμαρτωλο</span></span>). Often coupled together in common scorn and in contrast with the righteous (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιο</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:13">Matthew 9:13</span>). It was a strange medley at Levi's feast (Jesus and the four fisher disciples, Nathanael and Philip; Matthew Levi and his former companions, publicans and sinners; Pharisees with their scribes or students as on-lookers; disciples of John the Baptist who were fasting at the very time that Jesus was feasting and with such a group). The Pharisees criticize sharply "your teacher" for such a social breach of "reclining" together with publicans at Levi's feast. </p>
