<p><b> The disciples of John </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μαθητα Ιωανου</span></span>). One is surprised to find disciples of the Baptist in the role of critics of Christ along with the Pharisees. But John was languishing in prison and they perhaps were blaming Jesus for doing nothing about it. At any rate John would not have gone to Levi's feast on one of the Jewish fast-days. "The strict asceticism of the Baptist (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:18">Matthew 11:18</span>) and of the Pharisaic rabbis (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:12">Luke 18:12</span>) was imitated by their disciples" (McNeile). </p>
