<p><b> Old wineskins </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασκους παλαιους</span></span>). Not glass "<b>bottles</b>" but wineskins used as bottles as is true in Palestine yet, goatskins with the rough part inside. "Our word <i>bottle</i> originally carried the true meaning, being a bottle of leather. In Spanish <i>bota</i> means a <i>leather bottle</i>, a <i>boot</i>, and a <i>butt</i>. In Spain wine is still brought to market in pig-skins " (Vincent). The new wine will ferment and crack the dried-up old skins.</p>
<p><b>The wine is spilled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκχειτα</span></span>), poured out. </p>
