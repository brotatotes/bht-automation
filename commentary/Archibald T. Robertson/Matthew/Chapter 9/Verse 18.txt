<p><b> Is even now dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτ ετελευτησεν</span></span>). Aorist tense with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρτ</span></span> and so better, "just now died," "just dead" (Moffatt). Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:23">Mark 5:23</span>) has it "at the point of death," Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:42">Luke 8:42</span>) "lay a dying." It is not always easy even for physicians to tell when actual death has come. Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:24">Matthew 9:24</span> pointedly said, "The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth," meaning that she did not die to stay dead. </p>
