 Is even now dead  (αρτ ετελευτησεν). Aorist tense with αρτ and so better, "just now died," "just dead" (Moffatt). Mark (Mark 5:23) has it "at the point of death," Luke (Luke 8:42) "lay a dying." It is not always easy even for physicians to tell when actual death has come. Jesus in Matthew 9:24 pointedly said, "The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth," meaning that she did not die to stay dead.
