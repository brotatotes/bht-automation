<p><b> The border of his garment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του κρασπεδου του ιματιου</span></span>). The hem or fringe of a garment, a tassel or tuft hanging from the edge of the outer garment according to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+15:38">Numbers 15:38</span>. It was made of twisted wool. Jesus wore the dress of other people with these fringes at the four corners of the outer garment. The Jews actually counted the words <i>Jehovah One</i> from the numbers of the twisted white threads, a refinement that Jesus had no concern for. This poor woman had an element of superstition in her faith as many people have, but Jesus honours her faith and cures her. </p>
