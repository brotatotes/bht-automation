<p><b> The flute-players </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους αυλητας</span></span>). The girl was just dead, but already a crowd "making a tumult" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θορυβουμενον</span></span>) with wild wailing and screaming had gathered in the outer court, "brought together by various motives, sympathy, money, desire to share in the meat and drink going at such a time" (Bruce). Besides the several flute-players (voluntary or hired) there were probably "some hired mourning women (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+9:17">Jeremiah 9:17</span>) <i>praeficae</i>, whose duty it was to sing <i>naenia</i> in praise of the dead" (Bruce). These when put out by Jesus, "laughed him to scorn" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεγελων</span></span>), in a sort of loud and repeated (imperfect) guffaw of scorn. Jesus overcame all this repellent environment. </p>
