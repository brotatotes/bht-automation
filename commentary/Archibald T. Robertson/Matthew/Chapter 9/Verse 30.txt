<p><b> Were opened </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηνεωιχθησαν</span></span>). Triple augment (on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οι=ωι, ε</span></span> and then on preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν = ην</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Strictly charged them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεβριμηθη αυτοις</span></span>). A difficult word, compound of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βριμαομα</span></span> (to be moved with anger). It is used of horses snorting (Aeschylus, <i>Theb</i>. 461), of men fretting or being angry (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+11:30">Daniel 11:30</span>). Allen notes that it occurs twice in Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:43">Mark 1:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:5">Mark 14:5</span>) when Matthew omits it. It is found only here in Matthew. John has it twice in a different sense (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:33">John 11:33</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν εαυτω</span></span>). Here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:32">Mark 1:32</span> it has the notion of commanding sternly, a sense unknown to ancient writers. Most manuscripts have the middle <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεβριμησατο</span></span>, but Aleph and B have the passive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεβριμηθη</span></span> which Westcott and Hort accept, but without the passive sense (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκριθη</span></span>). "The word describes rather a rush of deep feeling which in the synoptic passages showed itself in a vehement injunctive and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:33">John 11:33</span> in look and manner" (McNeile). Bruce translates Euthymius Zigabenus on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:32">Mark 1:32</span>: "Looked severely, contracting His eyebrows, and shaking His head at them as they are wont to do who wish to make sure that secrets will be kept." "See to it, let no one know it" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορατε, μηδεις γινωσκετω</span></span>). Note elliptical change of persons and number in the two imperatives. </p>
