<p><b> A dumb man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κωφον</span></span>). Literally blunted in tongue as here and so dumb, in ear as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:5">Matthew 11:5</span> and so deaf. Homer used it of a blunted dart (<i>Iliad</i> xi. 390). Others applied it to mental dulness. </p>
