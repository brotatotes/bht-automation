<p><b> That he send forth labourers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπως εκβαλη εργατας</span></span>). Jesus turns from the figure of the shepherdless sheep to the harvest field ripe and ready for the reapers. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλλω</span></span> really means to drive out, to push out, to draw out with violence or without. Prayer is the remedy offered by Jesus in this crisis for a larger ministerial supply. How seldom do we hear prayers for more preachers. Sometimes God literally has to push or force a man into the ministry who resists his known duty. </p>
