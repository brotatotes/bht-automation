<p><b> That ye may know </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ειδητε</span></span>). Jesus accepts the challenge in the thoughts of the scribes and performs the miracle of healing the paralytic, who so far only had his sins forgiven, to prove his Messianic power on earth to forgive sins even as God does. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσια</span></span> may mean either power or authority. He had both as a matter of fact. Note same word in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:8">Matthew 9:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>Then saith he to the sick of the palsy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε λεγε τω παραλυτικω</span></span>). These words of course, were not spoken by Jesus. Curiously enough Matthew interjects them right in the midst of the sayings of Jesus in reply to the scorn of the scribes. Still more remarkable is the fact that Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:10">Mark 2:10</span>) has precisely the same words in the same place save that Matthew has added <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοτε</span></span>, of which he is fond, to what Mark already had. Mark, as we know, largely reports Peter's words and sees with Peter's eyes. Luke has the same idea in the same place without the vivid historical present <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγε (ειπεν τω παραλελυμενωι)</span></span> with the participle in place of the adjective. This is one of the many proofs that both Matthew and Luke made use of Mark's Gospel each in his own way.</p>
<p><b>Take up thy bed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρον σου την κλινην</span></span>). Pack up at once (aorist active imperative) the rolled-up pallet. </p>
