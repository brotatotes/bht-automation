<p><b> At the place of toll </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ το τελωνιον</span></span>).

Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:14">Mark 2:14</span>) and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:27">Luke 5:27</span>) call this man Levi. He had two names as was common, Matthew Levi. The publicans (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελωνα</span></span>) get their name in English from the Latin <i>publicanus</i> (a man who did public duty), not a very accurate designation. They were detested because they practised graft. Even Gabinius the proconsul of Syria was accused by Cicero of relieving Syrians and Jews of legitimate taxes for graft. He ordered some of the tax-officers removed. Already Jesus had spoken of the publican (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:46">Matthew 5:46</span>) in a way that shows the public disfavour in which they were held. </p>
