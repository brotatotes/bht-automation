<p><b> A prisoner of Christ Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεσμιος Χριστου Ιησου</span></span>). As verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:9">Philemon 1:9</span> and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>. Old adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεσμος</span></span> (bond, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεω</span></span>, to bind). Apparently used here on purpose rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολος</span></span> as more effective with Philemon and a more touching occasion of pride as Paul writes with his manacled right hand.</p>
<p><b>Timothy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τιμοθεος</span></span>). With Paul in Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>) and probably known to Philemon. Associated with Paul also in I and II Thess., II Cor., Philipp., Col.</p>
<p><b>To Philemon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φιλημον</span></span>). A resident of Colossae and a convert of Paul's (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:19">Philemon 1:19</span>), perhaps coming to Ephesus while Paul was there when his ministry had so much influence over the province of Asia (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:9">Acts 19:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:26">Acts 19:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:19">1 Corinthians 16:19</span>). The name Philemon occurs in the legend of Baucis and Philemon (Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>), but with no connection with the brother here. He was active in the church in Colossae ("our co-worker," <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεργω ημων</span></span>) and was beloved (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπητω</span></span>) by Paul. </p>
