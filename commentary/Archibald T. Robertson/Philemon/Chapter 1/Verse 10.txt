<p><b> For my child </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περ του εμου τεκνου</span></span>). Tender and affectionate reference to Onesimus as his spiritual child.</p>
<p><b>Whom I have begotten in my bonds </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον εγεννησα εν τοις δεσμοις</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενναω</span></span>, to beget. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:15">1 Corinthians 4:15</span> for this figurative sense. Paul is evidently proud of winning Onesimus to Christ though a prisoner himself. </p>
