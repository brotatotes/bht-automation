<p><b> I have sent back </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεπεμψα</span></span>). Epistolary aorist. As it will look when Onesimus arrives.</p>
<p><b>In his own person </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον</span></span>). "Himself," intensive pronoun with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον</span></span> (whom).</p>
<p><b>My very heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα εμα σπλαγχνα</span></span>). As in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:7">Philemon 1:7</span>. He almost loves Onesimus as his own son. </p>
