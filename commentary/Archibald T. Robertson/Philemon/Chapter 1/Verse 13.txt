<p><b> I would fain have kept </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβουλομην κατεχειν</span></span>). Imperfect middle and present infinitive, "I was wishing to hold back." Again from the standpoint of the arrival of Onesimus.</p>
<p><b>In thy behalf </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ σου</span></span>). So "in thy stead," "in place of thee."</p>
<p><b>He might minister </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονη</span></span>). Present active subjunctive (retained after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβουλομην</span></span>) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>, purpose continued, "that he might keep on ministering." </p>
