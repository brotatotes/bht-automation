<p><b> Perhaps </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταχα</span></span>). Old adverb, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:7">Romans 5:7</span>.</p>
<p><b>That thou shouldst have him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα αυτον απεχηις</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεχω</span></span>, to have back, "that thou might keep on having him back."</p>
<p><b>For ever </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιωνιον</span></span>). "Eternal," here and hereafter. Surely a noble thing for Paul to say and a word that would touch the best in Philemon. </p>
