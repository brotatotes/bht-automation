<p><b> Write </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγραψα</span></span>). Epistolary aorist.</p>
<p><b>With mine hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εμη χειρ</span></span>). Instrumental case and a note of hand that can be collected. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:21">1 Corinthians 16:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:18">Colossians 4:18</span>.</p>
<p><b>I will repay it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω αποτισω</span></span>). Future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποτινω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποτιω</span></span>) to pay back, to pay off. The more usual word was <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποδωσω</span></span>. This is Paul's promissory note. Deissmann (<i>Light, etc.</i>, p. 331) notes how many of the papyri are concerning debts.</p>
<p><b>That I say not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη λεγω</span></span>). Neat idiom as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:4">2 Corinthians 9:4</span>, delicately reminding Philemon that Paul had led him also to Christ.</p>
<p><b>Thou owest to me even thine own self besides </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα σεαυτον μο προσοφειλεις</span></span>). Old verb, only here in N.T., Paul using the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειλω</span></span> of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:18">Philemon 1:18</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> added. He used every available argument to bring Philemon to see the higher ground of brotherhood in Christ about Onesimus. </p>
