<p><b> Obedience </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπακοη</span></span>). "Compliance" seems less harsh to us in the light of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:9">Philemon 1:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>I write </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγραψα</span></span>). Epistolary aorist again.</p>
<p><b>Even beyond what I say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υπερ α λεγω</span></span>). That can only mean that Paul "knows" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδως</span></span>, second perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα</span></span>) that Philemon will set Onesimus free. He prefers that it come as Philemon's idea and wish rather than as a command from Paul. Paul has been criticized for not denouncing slavery in plain terms. But, when one considers the actual conditions in the Roman empire, he is a wise man who can suggest a better plan than the one pursued here for the ultimate overthrow of slavery. </p>
