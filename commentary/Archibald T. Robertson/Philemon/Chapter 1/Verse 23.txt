 Epaphras  (Επαφρας). The Colossian preacher who apparently started the work in Colossae, Hierapolis, and Laodicea, and who had come to Rome to enlist Paul's help in the fight against incipient Gnosticism in the Lycus Valley.My fellow-prisoner  (ο συναιχμαλωτος μου). See on Romans 16:7 for this word, also in Colossians 4:10. Used metaphorically like the verb αιχμαλωτιζω in 2 Corinthians 10:5, though some hold that Epaphras became a prisoner with Paul in Rome.
