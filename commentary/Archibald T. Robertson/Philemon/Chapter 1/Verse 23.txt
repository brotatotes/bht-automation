<p><b> Epaphras </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Επαφρας</span></span>). The Colossian preacher who apparently started the work in Colossae, Hierapolis, and Laodicea, and who had come to Rome to enlist Paul's help in the fight against incipient Gnosticism in the Lycus Valley.</p>
<p><b>My fellow-prisoner </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο συναιχμαλωτος μου</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:7">Romans 16:7</span> for this word, also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>. Used metaphorically like the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιχμαλωτιζω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:5">2 Corinthians 10:5</span>, though some hold that Epaphras became a prisoner with Paul in Rome. </p>
