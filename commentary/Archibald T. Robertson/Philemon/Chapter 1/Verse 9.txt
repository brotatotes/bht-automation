<p><b> Paul the aged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παυλος πρεσβυτης</span></span>). Paul is called <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεανιας</span></span> (a young man) at the stoning of Stephen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:58">Acts 7:58</span>). He was perhaps a bit under sixty now. Hippocrates calls a man <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτης</span></span> from 49 to 56 and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γερων</span></span> after that. The papyri use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτης</span></span> for old man as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:18">Luke 1:18</span> of Zacharias and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:2">Titus 2:2</span>. But in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:20">Ephesians 6:20</span> Paul says <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβευω εν αλυσε</span></span> (I am an ambassador in a chain). Hence Lightfoot holds that here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτης</span></span> = <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβευτης</span></span> because of common confusion by the scribes between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ</span></span>. In the LXX four times the two words are used interchangeably. There is some confusion also in the papyri and the inscriptions. Undoubtedly ambassador (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβευτης</span></span>) is possible here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:20">Ephesians 6:20</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβευω</span></span>) though there is no real reason why Paul should not term himself properly "Paul the aged." </p>
