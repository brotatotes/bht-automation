<p><b> Paul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παυλος</span></span>). He does not mention his apostleship as he usually does. Omitted also in I and II Thess. and Philemon.</p>
<p><b>Timothy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τιμοθεος</span></span>). In no sense the author, but associated with Paul because with him here in Rome as in Corinth when I and II Thessalonians written and in Ephesus when I Corinthians sent and in Macedonia when II Corinthians written. Timothy was with Paul when the Philippian church was founded (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:13">Acts 16:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:14">Acts 17:14</span>). He had been there twice since (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:3">Acts 20:3</span>).</p>
<p><b>To all the saints </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασ τοις αγιοις</span></span>). The word saint (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιος</span></span>) here is used for the professing Christians as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:2">1 Corinthians 1:2</span> which see as well as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span> for the origin of the word. The word "all" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασ</span></span>) means that all individual believers are included. Paul employs this word frequently in Philippians.</p>
<p><b>In Christ Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Χριστω Ιησου</span></span>). The centre for all Christian relations and activities for Paul and for us.</p>
<p><b>In Philippi </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Φιλιπποις</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:12">Acts 16:12</span> for discussion of this name.</p>
<p><b>With the bishops </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν επισκοποις</span></span>). "Together with bishops," thus singled out from "all the saints." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17">Acts 20:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span> for the use of this most interesting word as equivalent to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτερος</span></span> (elder). It is an old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισκεπτομα</span></span>, to look upon or after, to inspect, so the overseer or superintendent. In the second century <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισχοπος</span></span> (Ignatius) came to mean one superior to elders, but not so in the N.T. The two New Testament church officers are here mentioned (bishops or elders and deacons). The plural is here employed because there was usually one church in a city with several pastors (bishops, elders).</p>
<p><b>And deacons </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα διακονοις</span></span>). Technical sense here of the other church officers as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8-13">1 Timothy 3:8-13</span>, not the general use as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:13">Matthew 22:13</span>. The origin of the office is probably seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1-6">Acts 6:1-6</span>. The term is often applied to preachers (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5">1 Corinthians 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>). The etymology (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια, κονις</span></span>) suggests raising a dust by hastening. </p>
