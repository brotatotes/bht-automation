 Paul  (Παυλος). He does not mention his apostleship as he usually does. Omitted also in I and II Thess. and Philemon.Timothy  (Τιμοθεος). In no sense the author, but associated with Paul because with him here in Rome as in Corinth when I and II Thessalonians written and in Ephesus when I Corinthians sent and in Macedonia when II Corinthians written. Timothy was with Paul when the Philippian church was founded (Acts 16:1; Acts 16:13; Acts 17:14). He had been there twice since (Acts 19:22; Acts 20:3).To all the saints  (πασ τοις αγιοις). The word saint (αγιος) here is used for the professing Christians as in 1 Corinthians 1:2 which see as well as Romans 1:7 for the origin of the word. The word "all" (πασ) means that all individual believers are included. Paul employs this word frequently in Philippians.In Christ Jesus  (εν Χριστω Ιησου). The centre for all Christian relations and activities for Paul and for us.In Philippi  (εν Φιλιπποις). See on Acts 16:12 for discussion of this name.With the bishops  (συν επισκοποις). "Together with bishops," thus singled out from "all the saints." See Acts 20:17; Acts 20:28 for the use of this most interesting word as equivalent to πρεσβυτερος (elder). It is an old word from επισκεπτομα, to look upon or after, to inspect, so the overseer or superintendent. In the second century επισχοπος (Ignatius) came to mean one superior to elders, but not so in the N.T. The two New Testament church officers are here mentioned (bishops or elders and deacons). The plural is here employed because there was usually one church in a city with several pastors (bishops, elders).And deacons  (κα διακονοις). Technical sense here of the other church officers as in 1 Timothy 3:8-13, not the general use as in Matthew 22:13. The origin of the office is probably seen in Acts 6:1-6. The term is often applied to preachers (1 Corinthians 3:5; 2 Corinthians 3:6). The etymology (δια, κονις) suggests raising a dust by hastening.
