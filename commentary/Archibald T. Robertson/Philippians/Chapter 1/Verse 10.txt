<p><b> So that ye may </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το υμας</span></span>). Either purpose or result (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το</span></span> plus infinitive as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:11">Romans 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:26">Romans 3:26</span>, etc.).</p>
<p><b>Approve the things that are excellent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμαζειν τα διαφεροντα</span></span>). Originally, "test the things that differ." Cf. same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:28">Romans 2:28</span>. The verb was used for assaying metals. Either sense suits this context, but the first step is to distinguish between good and evil and that is not always easy in our complex civilization.</p>
<p><b>Sincere </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειλικρινεις</span></span>). Old word of uncertain origin from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>, to judge, by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειλη</span></span> (sunlight) or to sift by rapid rolling (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειλος</span></span>). At any rate it means pure, unsullied.</p>
<p><b>Void of offence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απροσκοπο</span></span>). Alpha privative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπτω</span></span>, to cut, "not stumbled against" (not causing others to stumble) or if active "not stumbling against." Passive sense probably, not active as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:32">1 Corinthians 10:32</span>. Common in the papyri, though not in ancient Greek writers. </p>
