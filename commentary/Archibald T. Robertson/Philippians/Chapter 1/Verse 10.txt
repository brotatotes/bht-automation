 So that ye may  (εις το υμας). Either purpose or result (εις το plus infinitive as in Romans 1:11; Romans 1:20; Romans 3:26, etc.).Approve the things that are excellent  (δοκιμαζειν τα διαφεροντα). Originally, "test the things that differ." Cf. same idiom in Romans 2:28. The verb was used for assaying metals. Either sense suits this context, but the first step is to distinguish between good and evil and that is not always easy in our complex civilization.Sincere  (ειλικρινεις). Old word of uncertain origin from κρινω, to judge, by ειλη (sunlight) or to sift by rapid rolling (ειλος). At any rate it means pure, unsullied.Void of offence  (απροσκοπο). Alpha privative προς and κοπτω, to cut, "not stumbled against" (not causing others to stumble) or if active "not stumbling against." Passive sense probably, not active as in 1 Corinthians 10:32. Common in the papyri, though not in ancient Greek writers.
