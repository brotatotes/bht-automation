<p><b> The things which happened unto me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα κατ' εμε</span></span>). "The things concerning me" = "my affairs" as common in Josephus.</p>
<p><b>Have fallen out rather </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαλλον εληλυθεν</span></span>). "Have come rather." Second perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Unto the progress </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις προκοπην</span></span>). Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προκοπτω</span></span>, common verb, to cut or strike forward, but this late substantive does not occur in classical Greek. It is a technical term in Stoic philosophy for "progress toward wisdom" and it appears also in the papyri and the LXX. In N.T. only here, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:25">Philippians 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:15">1 Timothy 4:15</span>. </p>
