 The things which happened unto me  (τα κατ' εμε). "The things concerning me" = "my affairs" as common in Josephus.Have fallen out rather  (μαλλον εληλυθεν). "Have come rather." Second perfect active indicative of ερχομα.Unto the progress  (εις προκοπην). Late word from προκοπτω, common verb, to cut or strike forward, but this late substantive does not occur in classical Greek. It is a technical term in Stoic philosophy for "progress toward wisdom" and it appears also in the papyri and the LXX. In N.T. only here, verse Philippians 1:25; 1 Timothy 4:15.
