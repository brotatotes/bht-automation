<p><b> Throughout the whole praetorian guard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ολω τω πραιτωριω</span></span>). There were originally ten thousand of these picked soldiers, concentrated in Rome by Tiberius. They had double pay and special privileges and became so powerful that emperors had to court their favour. Paul had contact with one after another of these soldiers. It is a Latin word, but the meaning is not certain, for in the other New Testament examples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:27">Matthew 27:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:16">Mark 15:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:28">John 18:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:33">John 18:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:9">John 19:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:35">Acts 23:35</span>) it means the palace of the provincial governor either in Jerusalem or Caesarea. In Rome "palace" would have to be the emperor's palace, a possible meaning for Paul a provincial writing to provincials (Kennedy). Some take it to mean the camp or barracks of the praetorian guard. The Greek, "in the whole praetorium," allows this meaning, though there is no clear example of it. Mommsen and Ramsay argue for the judicial authorities (<i>praefecti praetorio</i>) with the assessors of the imperial court. At any rate Paul, chained to a soldier, had access to the soldiers and the officials. </p>
