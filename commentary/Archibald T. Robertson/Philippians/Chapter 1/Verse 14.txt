<p><b> The most of the brethren </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους πλειονας των αδελφων</span></span>). "The more part of the brethren." The comparative with the article with the sense of the superlative as often in the <i>Koine</i>.</p>
<p><b>In the Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Κυριω</span></span>). It is not clear whether this phrase is to be connected with "brethren" or with "being confident" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεποιθοτας</span></span>), probably with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεποιθοτας</span></span>. If so, then "through my bonds" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις δεσμοις μου</span></span>) would be the instrumental case and mean that by means of Paul's bonds the brethren "are more abundantly bold" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσοτερως τολμαιν</span></span>). </p>
