 The most of the brethren  (τους πλειονας των αδελφων). "The more part of the brethren." The comparative with the article with the sense of the superlative as often in the Koine.In the Lord  (εν Κυριω). It is not clear whether this phrase is to be connected with "brethren" or with "being confident" (πεποιθοτας), probably with πεποιθοτας. If so, then "through my bonds" (τοις δεσμοις μου) would be the instrumental case and mean that by means of Paul's bonds the brethren "are more abundantly bold" (περισσοτερως τολμαιν).
