<p><b> Even of envy and strife </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα δια φθονον κα εριν</span></span>). "Even because of" (accusative after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>). Surely the lowest of motives for preaching Christ. Envy is an old word and an old sin and strife (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερις</span></span>) is more rivalry than schism. It is petty and personal jealousy of Paul's power and prowess by the Judaizers in Rome whom Paul has routed in the east, but who now exult at the opportunity of annoying their great antagonist by their interpretation of Christ. Jealousy is always against those of one's own class or profession as preachers with preachers, doctors with doctors.</p>
<p><b>Of goodwill </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ευδοκιαν</span></span>). Because of goodwill toward Paul. </p>
