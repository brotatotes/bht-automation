<p><b> What then? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ γαρ?</span></span>). Sharp problem put up to Paul by the conduct of the Judaizers.</p>
<p><b>Only that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλην οτ</span></span>). Same idiom in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:23">Acts 20:23</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πλην</span></span> is adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεον</span></span> (more besides). As a preposition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλην</span></span> means "except." This essential thing Paul sees in spite of all their envy and selfishness that Christ is preached.</p>
<p><b>Whether in pretence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειτε προφασε</span></span>). Either from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφαινω</span></span>, to shew forth, or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφημ</span></span>, to speak forth, the ostensible presentation often untrue. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:30">Acts 27:30</span>. Paul sees clearly through the pious pretence of these Judaizers and rejoices that people get some knowledge of Christ. Some Christ is better than no Christ.</p>
<p><b>Yea, and will rejoice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα κα χαρησομα</span></span>). Note affirmative, not adversative, use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα</span></span>. Volitive use of the future (second future passive) indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρησομα</span></span>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρω</span></span>. Paul is determined to rejoice in spite of the efforts of the Judaizers to prod him to anger. </p>
