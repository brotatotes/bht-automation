 Will turn  (αποβησετα). Future middle indicative of αποβαινω, old verb, to come from, to come back, to turn out.To my salvation  (εις σωτηριαν). For his release from prison as he strongly hopes to see them again (Philippians 1:26). Lightfoot takes the word to be Paul's eternal salvation and it must be confessed that verse Philippians 1:20 (the close of this sentence) does suit that idea best. Can it be that Paul carried both conceptions in the word here?Supply  (επιχορηγιας). Late and rare word (one example in inscription of first century A.D.). In N.T. only here and Ephesians 4:16. From the late verb επιχορηγεω (double compound, επι, χοροσ, ηγεομα, to furnish supply for the chorus) which see in 2 Corinthians 9:10; Galatians 3:5.
