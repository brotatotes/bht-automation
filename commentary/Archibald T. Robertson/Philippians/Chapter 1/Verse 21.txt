<p><b> For to me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμο γαρ</span></span>). Fine example of the ethical dative. Paul gives his own view of living.</p>
<p><b>To live is Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ζηιν Χριστος</span></span>). No copula (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span>), but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ζηιν</span></span> (the act of living present active infinitive) is the subject as is shown by the article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το</span></span>. Living is coextensive with Christ.</p>
<p><b>Gain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδος</span></span>). Old word for any gain or profit, interest on money (so in papyri). In N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:7">Philippians 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:11">Titus 1:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>To die </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το αποθανειν</span></span>, second aorist active infinitive, single act) is to cash in both principal and interest and so to have more of Christ than when living. So Paul faces death with independence and calm courage. </p>
