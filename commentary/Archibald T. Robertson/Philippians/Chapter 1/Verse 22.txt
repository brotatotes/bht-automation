<p><b> If this is the fruit of my work </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο μο καρπος εργου</span></span>). There is no <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> (if) here in the Greek, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο</span></span> (this) seems to be resumptive and to repeat the conditional clause just before. If so, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> just after means</p>
<p><b>then </b> and introduces the conclusion of the condition. Otherwise <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο</span></span> introduces the conclusion and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> means</p>
<p><b>and </b>.</p>
<p><b>I wot not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γνωριζω</span></span>). "I know not." It seems odd to preserve the old English word "wot" here. But it is not clear that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωριζω</span></span> (old causative verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>) means just to know. Elsewhere in the N.T., as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:15">Luke 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:22">Romans 9:22</span>, it means to make known, to declare. The papyri examples mean to make known. It makes perfectly good sense to take its usual meaning here, "I do not declare what I shall choose." </p>
