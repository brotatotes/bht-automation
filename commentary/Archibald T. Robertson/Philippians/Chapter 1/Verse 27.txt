<p><b> Let your manner of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολιτευεσθε</span></span>). Old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολιτης</span></span>, citizen, and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολις</span></span>, city, to be a citizen, to manage a state's affairs, to live as a citizen. Only twice in N.T., here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:1">Acts 23:1</span>. Philippi as a colony possessed Roman citizenship and Paul was proud of his own possession of this right. The Authorized Version missed the figure completely by the word "conversation" which did refer to conduct and not mere talk as now, but did not preserve the figure of citizenship. Better render, "Only do ye live as citizens."</p>
<p><b>Striving </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναθλουντες</span></span>). Rather, "striving together" as in an athletic contest. Late and rare word (Diodorus). "The very energy of the Christian faith to produce energetic individualities" (Rainy). "Striving in concert" (Lightfoot).</p>
<p><b>For the faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη πιστε</span></span>). For the teaching of the gospel, objective sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span> (faith). </p>
