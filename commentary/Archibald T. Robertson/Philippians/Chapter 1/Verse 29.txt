<p><b> In the behalf of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το υπερ Χριστου</span></span>). Literally, "the in behalf of Christ." But Paul divides the idea and uses the article to again both with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευειν</span></span> and with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασχειν</span></span>. Suffering in behalf of Christ is one of God's gifts to us. </p>
