 For your fellowship  (επ τη κοινωνια υμων). "On the basis of your contribution" as in 2 Corinthians 8:4; 2 Corinthians 9:13; Acts 2:42. The particular kind of "partnership" or "fellowship" involved is the contribution made by the Philippians for the spread of the gospel (Philippians 1:7 συγκοινωνους and Philippians 4:14 where συγκοινωνησαντες occurs).In furtherance of the gospel  (εις το ευαγγελιον). "For the gospel."From the first day until now  (απο της πρωτης ημερας αχρ του νυν). As when in Thessalonica (Philippians 4:15), in Corinth (Acts 18:5; 2 Corinthians 11:7-10), and now in Rome.
