<p><b> Because I have you in my heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το εχειν με εν τη καρδια υμας</span></span>). Or "because you hold me in your heart." Literally, "because of the holding me (or you) in the heart as to you (or me)." One accusative is the object of the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχειν</span></span>, the other is the accusative of general reference. There is no way to decide which is the idea meant except to say that love begets love. The pastor who, like Paul, holds his people in his heart will find them holding him in their hearts.</p>
<p><b>In the defence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη απολογια</span></span>). Old word (our word apology, but not our idea of apologizing), in the original sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:1">Acts 22:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:16">Acts 25:16</span>. So also in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:16">Philippians 1:16</span> below.</p>
<p><b>Confirmation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεβαιωσε</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεβαιοω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βεβαιοσ, βαινω</span></span>), to make stable. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:16">Hebrews 6:16</span> about oath.</p>
<p><b>Partakers with me of grace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συγκοινωνους μου της χαριτος</span></span>). Literally, "my co-sharers in grace" (objective genitive). "Grace prompted them to alleviate his imprisonment, to cooperate with him in defending and propagating the gospel, and to suffer for its sake" (Vincent, <i>Int. Crit. Comm</i>.). </p>
