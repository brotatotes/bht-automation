<p><b> Should confess </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξομολογησητα</span></span>). First aorist middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξομολογεομα</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> for purpose.</p>
<p><b>Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span>). Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36">Acts 2:36</span>) claimed that God made Christ "Lord." See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:6">1 Corinthians 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:9">Romans 10:9</span>. Kennedy laments that the term Lord has become one of the most lifeless in the Christian vocabulary, whereas it really declares the true character and dignity of Jesus Christ and "is the basis and the object of worship." </p>
