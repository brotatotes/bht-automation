<p><b> Not as in my presence only </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ως εν τη παρουσια μονον</span></span>). B and a few other MSS. omit <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span>. The negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> goes with the imperative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεργαζεσθε</span></span> (work out), not with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπηκουσατε</span></span> (obeyed) which would call for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Much more </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλω μαλλον</span></span>). They are not to render eye-service only when Paul is there, but much more when he is away.</p>
<p><b>Work out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεργαζεσθε</span></span>). Perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> (down) in composition, work on to the finish. This exhortation assumes human free agency in the carrying on the work of one's salvation.</p>
<p><b>With fear and trembling </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα φοβου κα τρομου</span></span>). "Not slavish terror, but wholesome, serious caution" (Vincent). "A nervous and trembling anxiety to do right" (Lightfoot). Paul has no sympathy with a cold and dead orthodoxy or formalism that knows nothing of struggle and growth. He exhorts as if he were an Arminian in addressing men. He prays as if he were a Calvinist in addressing God and feels no inconsistency in the two attitudes. Paul makes no attempt to reconcile divine sovereignty and human free agency, but boldly proclaims both. </p>
