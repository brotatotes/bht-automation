 Which worketh in you  (ο ενεργων εν υμιν). Articular present active participle of ενεργεω from ενεργος (εν, εργον) one at work, common verb from Aristotle on, to be at work, to energize. God is the Energy and the Energizer of the universe. Modern scientists, like Eddington, Jeans, and Whitney, are not afraid to agree with Paul and to put God back of all activity in nature.Both to will and to work  (κα το θελειν κα το ενεργειν). "Both the willing and the working (the energizing)." God does it all, then. Yes, but he puts us to work also and our part is essential, as he has shown in verse Philippians 2:12, though secondary to that of God.For his good-pleasure  (υπερ της ευδοκιας). So Whitney puts "the will of God" behind gravitation and all the laws of nature.
