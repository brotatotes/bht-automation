<p><b> Which worketh in you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ενεργων εν υμιν</span></span>). Articular present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργεω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεργος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν, εργον</span></span>) one at work, common verb from Aristotle on, to be at work, to energize. God is the Energy and the Energizer of the universe. Modern scientists, like Eddington, Jeans, and Whitney, are not afraid to agree with Paul and to put God back of all activity in nature.</p>
<p><b>Both to will and to work </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα το θελειν κα το ενεργειν</span></span>). "Both the willing and the working (the energizing)." God does it all, then. Yes, but he puts us to work also and our part is essential, as he has shown in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:12">Philippians 2:12</span>, though secondary to that of God.</p>
<p><b>For his good-pleasure </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ της ευδοκιας</span></span>). So Whitney puts "the will of God" behind gravitation and all the laws of nature. </p>
