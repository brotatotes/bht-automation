<p><b> As lights in the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως φωστηρες εν κοσμω</span></span>). As luminaries like the heavenly bodies. Christians are the light of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:14">Matthew 5:14</span>) as they reflect the light from Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>), but here the word is not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φως</span></span> (light), but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωστηρες</span></span> (luminaries, stars). The place for light is the darkness where it is needed.</p>
<p><b>Holding forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεχοντες</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεχω</span></span>. Probably not connected with the preceding metaphor in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωστηρες</span></span>. The old meaning of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεχω</span></span> is to hold forth or to hold out (the word of life as here). The context seems to call for "holding fast." It occurs also with the sense of attending to (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:5">Acts 3:5</span>).</p>
<p><b>That I may have </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμο</span></span>). Ethical dative, "to me as a ground of boasting." </p>
