 And if I am offered  (ε κα σπενδομα). Though I am poured out as a libation. Old word. In N.T. only here and 2 Timothy 4:6. Paul pictures his life-blood as being poured upon (uncertain whether heathen or Jewish offerings meant and not important) the sacrifice and service of the faith of the Philippians in mutual service and joy (both χαιρω and συνχαιρω twice in the sentence). Joy is mutual when the service is mutual. Young missionaries offer their lives as a challenge to other Christians to match their money with their blood.
