<p><b> Fulfil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρωσατε</span></span>). Better here, "fill full." Paul's cup of joy will be full if the Philippians will only keep on having unity of thought and feeling (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το αυτο φρονητε</span></span>, present active subjunctive, keep on thinking the same thing).</p>
<p><b>Being of one accord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνψυχο</span></span>). Late word here for the first time, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span>, harmonious in soul, souls that beat together, in tune with Christ and with each other.</p>
<p><b>Of one mind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το εν φρονουντες</span></span>). "Thinking the one thing." Like clocks that strike at the same moment. Perfect intellectual telepathy. Identity of ideas and harmony of feelings. </p>
