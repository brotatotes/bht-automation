 So soon as I shall see  (ως αν αφιδω). Indefinite temporal clause with ως αν and the second aorist active subjunctive of αφοραω. The oldest MSS. (Aleph A B D) have αφιδω (old aspirated form) rather than απιδω.How it will go with me  (τα περ εμε). On the force of απο with οραω (look away) see Hebrews 12:2. "The things concerning me," the outcome of the trial. Cf. 1 Corinthians 4:17; 1 Corinthians 4:19.
