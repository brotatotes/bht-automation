<p><b> He longed after </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιποθων ην</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιποθεω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:8">Philippians 1:8</span>), "he was yearning after."</p>
<p><b>You all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντας υμας</span></span>). So again (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:5">Philippians 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:7">Philippians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:8">Philippians 1:8</span>).</p>
<p><b>Was sore troubled </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδημονων</span></span>). Periphrastic imperfect again (repeat <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span>) of the old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδημονεω</span></span> either from an unused <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδημων</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δημος</span></span>, away from home, homesick) or from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδημων, αδησα</span></span> (discontent, bewilderment). The <i>Vocabulary</i> of Moulton and Milligan gives one papyrus example in line with the latter etymology. See already <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:37">Matthew 26:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:33">Mark 14:33</span>. In any case the distress of Epaphroditus was greatly increased when he knew that the Philippians (the home-folks) had learned of his illness, "because ye had heard that he was sick" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διοτ ηκουσατε οτ ησθενησε</span></span>), "because ye heard that he fell sick" (ingressive aorist).</p>
<p><b>He was sick </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ησθενησε</span></span>). Ingressive aorist, "he did become sick."</p>
<p><b>Nigh unto death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραπλησιον θανατω</span></span>). Only example in N.T. of this compound adverbial preposition (from the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραπλησιος</span></span>) with the dative case. </p>
