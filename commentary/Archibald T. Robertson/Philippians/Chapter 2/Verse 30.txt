<p><b> Hazarding his life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολευσαμενος τη ψυχη</span></span>). First aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολευω</span></span> (from the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολος</span></span>), to place beside. The old Greek writers used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβαλλομα</span></span>, to expose oneself to danger. But Deissmann (<i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, p. 88) cites an example of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολευσαμενος</span></span> from an inscription at Olbia or the Black Sea of the second century A.D. where it plainly means "exposing himself to danger" as here. Lightfoot renders it here "having gambled with his life." The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραβολαν</span></span> (riskers) was applied to the Christians who risked their lives for the dying and the dead. </p>
