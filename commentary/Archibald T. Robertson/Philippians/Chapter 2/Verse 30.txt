 Hazarding his life  (παραβολευσαμενος τη ψυχη). First aorist middle participle of παραβολευω (from the adjective παραβολος), to place beside. The old Greek writers used παραβαλλομα, to expose oneself to danger. But Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, p. 88) cites an example of παραβολευσαμενος from an inscription at Olbia or the Black Sea of the second century A.D. where it plainly means "exposing himself to danger" as here. Lightfoot renders it here "having gambled with his life." The word παραβολαν (riskers) was applied to the Christians who risked their lives for the dying and the dead.
