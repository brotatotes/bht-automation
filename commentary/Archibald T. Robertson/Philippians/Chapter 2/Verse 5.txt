<p><b> Have this mind in you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο φρονειτε εν υμιν</span></span>). "Keep on thinking this in you which was also in Christ Jesus" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κα εν Χριστω Ιησου</span></span>). What is that? Humility. Paul presents Jesus as the supreme example of humility. He urges humility on the Philippians as the only way to secure unity. </p>
