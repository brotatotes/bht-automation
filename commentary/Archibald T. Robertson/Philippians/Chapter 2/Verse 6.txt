<p><b> Being </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαρχων</span></span>). Rather, "existing," present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαρχω</span></span>. In the form of God (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν μορφη θεου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μορφη</span></span> means the essential attributes as shown in the form. In his preincarnate state Christ possessed the attributes of God and so appeared to those in heaven who saw him. Here is a clear statement by Paul of the deity of Christ.</p>
<p><b>A prize </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαγμον</span></span>). Predicate accusative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγησατο</span></span>. Originally words in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-μος</span></span> signified the act, not the result (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-μα</span></span>). The few examples of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαγμος</span></span> (Plutarch, etc.) allow it to be understood as equivalent to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαγμα</span></span>, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισμος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτισμα</span></span>. That is to say Paul means a prize to be held on to rather than something to be won ("robbery").</p>
<p><b>To be on an equality with God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το εινα ισα θεο</span></span>). Accusative articular infinitive object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγησατο</span></span>, "the being equal with God" (associative instrumental case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεω</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ισα</span></span> is adverbial use of neuter plural with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:16">Revelation 21:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>Emptied himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτον εκενωσε</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κενοω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κενος</span></span>, empty. Of what did Christ empty himself? Not of his divine nature. That was impossible. He continued to be the Son of God. There has arisen a great controversy on this word, a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κενοσις</span></span> doctrine. Undoubtedly Christ gave up his environment of glory. He took upon himself limitations of place (space) and of knowledge and of power, though still on earth retaining more of these than any mere man. It is here that men should show restraint and modesty, though it is hard to believe that Jesus limited himself by error of knowledge and certainly not by error of conduct. He was without sin, though tempted as we are. "He stripped himself of the insignia of majesty" (Lightfoot). </p>
