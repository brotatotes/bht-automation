<p><b> The form of a servant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μορφην δουλου</span></span>). He took the characteristic attributes (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μορφην</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span>) of a slave. His humanity was as real as his deity.</p>
<p><b>In the likeness of men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ομοιωματ ανθρωπων</span></span>). It was a likeness, but a real likeness (Kennedy), no mere phantom humanity as the Docetic Gnostics held. Note the difference in tense between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαρχων</span></span> (eternal existence in the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μορφη</span></span> of God) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενομενος</span></span> (second aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>, becoming, definite entrance in time upon his humanity). </p>
