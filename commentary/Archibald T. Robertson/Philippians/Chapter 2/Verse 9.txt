<p><b> Wherefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διο</span></span>). Because of which act of voluntary and supreme humility.</p>
<p><b>Highly exalted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερυψωσε</span></span>). First aorist indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερυψοω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υψος</span></span>) late and rare word (LXX and Byzantine). Here only in N.T. Because of Christ's voluntary humiliation God lifted him above or beyond (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span>) the state of glory which he enjoyed before the Incarnation. What glory did Christ have after the Ascension that he did not have before in heaven? What did he take back to heaven that he did not bring? Clearly his humanity. He returned to heaven the Son of Man as well as the Son of God.</p>
<p><b>The name which is above every name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ονομα το υπερ παν ονομα</span></span>). What name is that? Apparently and naturally the name</p>
<p><b>Jesus </b>, which is given in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:10">Philippians 2:10</span>. Some think it is "Jesus Christ," some "Lord," some the ineffable name Jehovah, some merely dignity and honour. </p>
