<p><b> Finally </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το λοιπον</span></span>). Accusative of general reference, literally, "as for the rest." So again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:8">Philippians 4:8</span>. It (or just <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λοιπον</span></span>) is a common phrase towards the close of Paul's Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:1">2 Thessalonians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11">2 Corinthians 13:11</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:10">Ephesians 6:10</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του λοιπου</span></span> (genitive case). But Paul uses the idiom elsewhere also as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:29">1 Corinthians 7:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:1">1 Thessalonians 4:1</span> before the close of the letter is in sight. It is wholly needless to understand Paul as about to finish and then suddenly changing his mind like some preachers who announce the end a half dozen times.</p>
<p><b>To write the same things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα αυτα γραφειν</span></span>). Present active articular infinitive, "the going on writing the same things." What things? He has just used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαιρετε</span></span> (go on rejoicing) again and he will repeat it in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:4">Philippians 4:4</span>. But in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:2">Philippians 3:2</span> he uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπετε</span></span> three times. At any rate Paul, as a true teacher, is not afraid of repetition.</p>
<p><b>Irksome </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οκνηρον</span></span>). Old adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οκνεω</span></span>, to delay, to hesitate. It is not tiresome to me to repeat what is "safe" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασφαλες</span></span>) for you. Old adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφαλλω</span></span>, to totter, to reel. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:34">Acts 21:34</span>. </p>
