 If by any means I may attain  (ε πως καταντησω). Not an expression of doubt, but of humility (Vincent), a modest hope (Lightfoot). For ε πως, see Romans 1:10; Romans 11:14 where παραζηλωσω can be either future indicative or aorist subjunctive like καταντησω here (see subjunctive καταλαβω in verse Philippians 3:12), late compound verb κατανταω.Resurrection  (εξαναστασιν). Late word, not in LXX, but in Polybius and one papyrus example. Apparently Paul is thinking here only of the resurrection of believers out from the dead and so double εξ (τεν εξαναστασιν την εκ νεκρων). Paul is not denying a general resurrection by this language, but emphasizing that of believers.
