<p><b> Not that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ οτ</span></span>). To guard against a misunderstanding as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:26">John 6:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:6">John 12:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:24">2 Corinthians 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:11">Philippians 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:17">Philippians 4:17</span>.</p>
<p><b>I have already obtained </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηδη ελαβον</span></span>). Rather, "I did already obtain," constative second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>, summing up all his previous experiences as a single event.</p>
<p><b>Or am already made perfect </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ηδη τετελειωμα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative (state of completion) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειοω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειος</span></span> and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελος</span></span> (end). Paul pointedly denies that he has reached a spiritual impasse of non- development. Certainly he knew nothing of so-called sudden absolute perfection by any single experience. Paul has made great progress in Christlikeness, but the goal is still before him, not behind him.</p>
<p><b>But I press on </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωκω δε</span></span>). He is not discouraged, but encouraged. He keeps up the chase (real idea in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωκω</span></span>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:1">1 Corinthians 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:30">Romans 9:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:11">1 Timothy 6:11</span>).</p>
<p><b>If so be that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε κα</span></span>). "I follow after." The condition (third class, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ει--καταλαβω</span></span>, second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλαμβανω</span></span>) is really a sort of purpose clause or aim. There are plenty of examples in the <i>Koine</i> of the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and the subjunctive as here (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1017), "if I also may lay hold of that for which (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφ' ω</span></span>, purpose expressed by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>) I was laid hold of (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατελημφθην</span></span>, first aorist passive of the same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλαμβανω</span></span>) by Christ Jesus." His conversion was the beginning, not the end of the chase. </p>
