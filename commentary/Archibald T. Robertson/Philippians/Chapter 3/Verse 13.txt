<p><b> Not yet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουπω</span></span>). But some MSS. read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου</span></span> (not).</p>
<p><b>To have apprehended </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατειληφενα</span></span>). Perfect active infinitive of same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλαμβανω</span></span> (perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>, to grasp completely). Surely denial enough.</p>
<p><b>But one thing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν δε</span></span>). No verb in the Greek. We can supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιω</span></span> (I do) or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διωκω</span></span> (I keep on in the chase), but no verb is really needed. "When all is said, the greatest art is to limit and isolate oneself" (Goethe), concentration.</p>
<p><b>Forgetting the things which are behind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα μεν οπισω επιλανθανομενος</span></span>). Common verb, usually with the genitive, but the accusative in the <i>Koine</i> is greatly revived with verbs. Paul can mean either his old pre-Christian life, his previous progress as a Christian, or both (all of it).</p>
<p><b>Stretching forward </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεκτεινομενος</span></span>). Present direct middle participle of the old double compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεκτεινω</span></span> (stretching myself out towards). Metaphor of a runner leaning forward as he runs. </p>
