<p><b> Toward the goal </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα σκοπον</span></span>). "Down upon the goal," who is Jesus himself to whom we must continually look as we run (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>). The word means a watchman, then the goal or mark. Only here in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Unto the prize </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το βραβειον</span></span>). Late word (Menander and inscriptions) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βραβευς</span></span> (umpire who awards the prize). In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24">1 Corinthians 9:24</span>.</p>
<p><b>Of the high calling </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της ανω κλησεως</span></span>). Literally, "of the upward calling." The goal continually moves forward as we press on, but yet never out of sight. </p>
