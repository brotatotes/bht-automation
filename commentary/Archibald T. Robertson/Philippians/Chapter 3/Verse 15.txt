<p><b> As many as be perfect </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσο τελειο</span></span>). Here the term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελειο</span></span> means relative perfection, not the absolute perfection so pointedly denied in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:12">Philippians 3:12</span>. Paul here includes himself in the group of spiritual adults (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:13">Hebrews 5:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>Let us be thus minded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο φρονωμεν</span></span>). Present active volitive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρονεω</span></span>. "Let us keep on thinking this," viz. that we have not yet attained absolute perfection.</p>
<p><b>If ye are otherwise minded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τ ετερως φρονειτε</span></span>). Condition of first class, assumed as true. That is, if ye think that ye are absolutely perfect.</p>
<p><b>Shall God reveal unto you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος υμιν αποκαλυψε</span></span>). He turns such cases over to God. What else can he do with them?</p>
<p><b>Whereunto we have already come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ο εφθασαμεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθανω</span></span>, originally to come before as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>, but usually in the <i>Koine</i> simply to arrive, attain to, as here. </p>
