<p><b> By that same rule let us walk </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω αυτω στοιχειν</span></span>) Aleph A B do not have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κανον</span></span> (rule). Besides <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοιχειν</span></span> is the absolute present active infinitive which sometimes occurs instead of the principal verb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:15">Romans 12:15</span>. Paul means simply this that, having come thus far, the thing to do is to go "in the same path" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω αυτω</span></span>) in which we have been travelling so far. A needed lesson for Christians weary with the monotony of routine in religious life and work. </p>
