 Imitators together of me  (συνμιμητα μου). Found only here so far, though Plato uses συμμιμεισθα. "Vie with each other in imitating me" (Lightfoot).Mark  (σκοπειτε). Old verb from σκοπος (verse Philippians 3:14). "Keep your eyes on me as goal." Mark and follow, not avoid as in Romans 16:17.An ensample  (τυπον). Originally the impression left by a stroke (John 20:25), then a pattern (mould) as here (cf. 1 Thessalonians 1:7; 1 Corinthians 10:6; 1 Corinthians 10:11; Romans 5:14; Romans 6:17).
