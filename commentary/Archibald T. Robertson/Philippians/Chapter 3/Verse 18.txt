 I told you often  (πολλακις ελεγον). Imperfect active, repetition in Paul s warnings to them.Even weeping  (κα κλαιων). Deep emotion as he dictated the letter and recalled these recreant followers of Christ (cf. 2 Corinthians 2:4).The enemies of the cross of Christ  (τους εχθρους του σταυρου του Χριστου). Either the Judaizers who denied the value of the cross of Christ (Galatians 5:11; Galatians 6:12; Galatians 6:14) or Epicurean antinomians whose loose living gave the lie to the cross of Christ (1 John 2:4).
