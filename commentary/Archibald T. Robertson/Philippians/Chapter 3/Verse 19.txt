 Whose god is the belly  (ου το θεος η κοιλια). The comic poet Eupolis uses the rare word Κοιλιοδαιμων for one who makes a god of his belly and Seneca speaks of one who abdomini servit. Sensuality in food, drink, sex then as now mastered some men. These men posed as Christians and gloried in their shame.Who mind earthly things  (ο τα επιγεια φρονουντες). Anacoluthon. The nominative does not refer to πολλο at the beginning, but with the accusative τους εχθρους in between. See Mark 12:40.
