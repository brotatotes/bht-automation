<p><b> Whose god is the belly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου το θεος η κοιλια</span></span>). The comic poet Eupolis uses the rare word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κοιλιοδαιμων</span></span> for one who makes a god of his belly and Seneca speaks of one who <i>abdomini servit</i>. Sensuality in food, drink, sex then as now mastered some men. These men posed as Christians and gloried in their shame.</p>
<p><b>Who mind earthly things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο τα επιγεια φρονουντες</span></span>). Anacoluthon. The nominative does not refer to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλο</span></span> at the beginning, but with the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους εχθρους</span></span> in between. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:40">Mark 12:40</span>. </p>
