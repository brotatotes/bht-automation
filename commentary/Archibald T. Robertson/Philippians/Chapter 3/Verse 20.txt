<p><b> Our citizenship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημων το πολιτευμα</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιλιτευω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:27">Philippians 1:27</span>), but only here in N.T. The inscriptions use it either for citizenship or for commonwealth. Paul was proud of his Roman citizenship and found it a protection. The Philippians were also proud of their Roman citizenship. But Christians are citizens of a kingdom not of this world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:36">John 18:36</span>). Milligan (<i>Vocabulary</i>) doubts if commentators are entitled to translate it here: "We are a colony of heaven," because such a translation reverses the relation between the colony and the mother city. But certainly here Paul's heart is in heaven.</p>
<p><b>We wait for </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκδεχομεθα</span></span>). Rare and late double compound (perfective use of prepositions like wait out) which vividly pictures Paul's eagerness for the second coming of Christ as the normal attitude of the Christian colonist whose home is heaven. </p>
