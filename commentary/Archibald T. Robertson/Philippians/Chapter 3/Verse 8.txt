<p><b> Yea, verily, and </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα μεν ουν γε κα</span></span>). Five particles before Paul proceeds (yea, indeed, therefore, at least, even), showing the force and passion of his conviction. He repeats his affirmation with the present middle indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγουμα</span></span>), "I still count all things loss for the excellency of the knowledge (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το υπερεχον</span></span>, the surpassingness, neuter articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερεχω</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:3">Philippians 2:3</span>) of Christ Jesus my Lord."</p>
<p><b>Dung </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκυβαλα</span></span>). Late word of uncertain etymology, either connected with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκωρ</span></span> (dung) or from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ες κυνας βαλλω</span></span>, to fling to the dogs and so refuse of any kind. It occurs in the papyri. Here only in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>That I may gain Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα Χριστον κερδησω</span></span>). First aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδαω</span></span>, Ionic form for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερδαινω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> in purpose clause. Paul was never satisfied with his knowledge of Christ and always craved more fellowship with him. </p>
