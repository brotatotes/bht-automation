<p><b> In the beginning of the gospel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν αρχη του ευαγγελιου</span></span>). After he had wrought in Philippi (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>Had fellowship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκοινωνησεν</span></span>). "Had partnership" (first aorist active indicative).</p>
<p><b>In the matter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις λογον</span></span>). "As to an account." No other church opened an account with Paul.</p>
<p><b>Of giving and receiving </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοσεως κα λημψεως</span></span>). Credit and debit. A mercantile metaphor repeated in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:17">Philippians 4:17</span> by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις λογον υμων</span></span> (to your account). Paul had to keep books then with no other church, though later Thessalonica and Beroea joined Philippi in support of Paul's work in Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:8">2 Corinthians 11:8</span>).</p>
<p><b>But ye only </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη υμεις μονο</span></span>). Not even Antioch contributed anything but good wishes and prayers for Paul's work (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1-3">Acts 13:1-3</span>). </p>
