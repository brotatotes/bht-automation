<p><b> I seek for </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιζητω</span></span>). Old verb, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:7">Romans 11:7</span> (linear present, I am seeking for). Lightfoot calls it "the Apostle's nervous anxiety to clear himself" of wanting more gifts. Why not say his delicate courtesy? </p>
