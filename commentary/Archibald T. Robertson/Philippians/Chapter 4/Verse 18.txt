 I have all things  (απεχω παντα). As a receipt in full in appreciation of their kindness. Απεχω is common in the papyri and the ostraca for "receipt in full" (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 110). See Matthew 6:2; Matthew 6:5; Matthew 6:16.I am filled  (πεπληρωμα). Perfect passive indicative of πληροω. "Classical Greek would hardly use the word in this personal sense" (Kennedy).An odour of a sweet smell  (οσμην ευωδιας). Οσμη, old word from οζω, to smell. Ευωδια, old word from ευ and οζω. In Ephesians 5:2 both words come together as here and in 2 Corinthians 2:15 we have ευωδια (only other N.T. example) and in verse 2 Corinthians 2:16 οσμη twice. Ευωδιας here is genitive of quality.Sacrifice  (θυσιαν). Not the act, but the offering as in Romans 12:1.Well-pleasing  (ευαρεστον). As in Romans 12:1.
