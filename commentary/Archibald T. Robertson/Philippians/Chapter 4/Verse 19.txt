<p><b> According to his riches in glory </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα το πλουτος αυτου εν δοξη</span></span>). God has an abundant treasure in glory and will repay the Philippians for what they have done for Paul. The spiritual reward is what spurs men into the ministry and holds them to it. </p>
