<p><b> Euodia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ευοδιαν</span></span>). This name means literally "prosperous journey" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ, οδος</span></span>). It occurs in the inscriptions.</p>
<p><b>Syntyche </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συντυχην</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συντυγχανω</span></span>, to meet with and so "pleasant acquaintance" or "good-luck." Occurs in the inscriptions and identified with Lydia by some. Klopper suggests that each of these rival women had church assemblies in their homes, one a Jewish-Christian church, the other a Gentile-Christian church. Vincent doubts the great influence of women in Macedonia held by Lightfoot who also suggests that these two were ladies of rank or perhaps deaconesses of the church in Philippi. Schinz suggests that in such a pure church even slight bickerings would make a real disturbance. "It may have been accidental friction between two energetic Christian women" (Kennedy). </p>
