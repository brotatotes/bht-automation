<p><b> True yokefellow </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνησιε συνζυγε</span></span>). All sorts of suggestions have been made here, one that it was Lydia who is termed Paul's wife by the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνζυγε</span></span>. Unfortunately for that view <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνησιε</span></span> is masculine vocative singular. Some have suggested it as a proper name though it is not found in the inscriptions, but the word does occur as an appellative in one. Lightfoot even proposes Epaphroditus, the bearer of the Epistle, certainly a curious turn to take to address him. After all it matters little that we do not know who the peacemaker was.</p>
<p><b>Help these women </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνλαμβανου αυταις</span></span>). Present middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνλαμβανω</span></span>, to seize (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:55">Matthew 26:55</span>), to conceive (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:24">Luke 1:24</span>), then to take hold together with one (associative instrumental case), to help as here (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:7">Luke 5:7</span>). "Take hold with them."</p>
<p><b>They laboured with me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνηθλησαν μο</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναθλεω</span></span> (for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:27">Philippians 1:27</span>) with associative instrumental case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μο</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>With Clement also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα κα Κλημεντος</span></span>). There is no evidence that he was Clement of Rome as the name is common.</p>
<p><b>In the book of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν βιβλω ζωης</span></span>). The only instance of this expression in the N.T. outside of the Apocalypse (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:5">Philippians 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+13:8">Philippians 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+17:8">Philippians 17:8</span>, etc.). Hence real Christians in spite of their bickerings. </p>
