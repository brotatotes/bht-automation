 Your forbearance  (το επιεικες υμων). "Your gentleness," "your sweet reasonableness" (Matthew Arnold), "your moderation." Old adjective (επι, εικος) as in James 3:17; 1 Timothy 3:3. Article and neuter singular here= η επιεικεια (Acts 24:4; 2 Corinthians 10:1) like to χρηστον in Romans 2:4.The Lord is at hand  (ο κυριος εγγυς). "The Apostle's watchword" (Lightfoot), as in 1 Corinthians 16:22 (Μαραν αθα, Aramaic equivalent, Our Lord cometh). Unless, indeed, εγγυς here means near in space instead ofnigh  in time.
