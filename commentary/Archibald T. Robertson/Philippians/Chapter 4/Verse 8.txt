 Finally  (το λοιπον). See on Philippians 3:1.Whatsoever  (οσα). Thus he introduces six adjectives picturing Christian ideals, old-fashioned and familiar words not necessarily from any philosophic list of moral excellencies Stoic or otherwise. Without these no ideals can exist. They are pertinent now when so much filth is flaunted before the world in books, magazines and moving-pictures under the name of realism (the slime of the gutter and the cess-pool).Honourable  (σεμνα). Old word from σεβω, to worship, revere. So revered, venerated (1 Timothy 3:8).Pure  (αγνα). Old word for all sorts of purity. There are clean things, thoughts, words, deeds.Lovely  (προσφιλη). Old word, here only in N.T., from προς and φιλεω, pleasing, winsome.Of good report  (ευφημα. Old word, only here in N.T., from ευ and φημη, fair-speaking, attractive.If there be any  (ε τις). Paul changes the construction from οσα (whatsoever) to a condition of the first class, as in Philippians 2:1, with two substantives.Virtue  (αρετη). Old word, possibly from αρεσκω, to please, used very often in a variety of senses by the ancients for any mental excellence or moral quality or physical power. Its very vagueness perhaps explains its rarity in the N.T., only four times (Philippians 4:8; 1 Peter 2:9; 2 Peter 1:3; 2 Peter 1:5). It is common in the papyri, but probably Paul is using it in the sense found in the LXX (Isaiah 42:12; Isaiah 43:21) of God's splendour and might (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 95) in connection with "praise" (επαινος) as here or even meaning praise.Think on these things  (ταυτα λογιζεσθε). Present middle imperative for habit of thought. We are responsible for our thoughts and can hold them to high and holy ideals.
