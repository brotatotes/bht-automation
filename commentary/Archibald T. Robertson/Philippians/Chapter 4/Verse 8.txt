<p><b> Finally </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το λοιπον</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:1">Philippians 3:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Whatsoever </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσα</span></span>). Thus he introduces six adjectives picturing Christian ideals, old-fashioned and familiar words not necessarily from any philosophic list of moral excellencies Stoic or otherwise. Without these no ideals can exist. They are pertinent now when so much filth is flaunted before the world in books, magazines and moving-pictures under the name of realism (the slime of the gutter and the cess-pool).</p>
<p><b>Honourable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεμνα</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεβω</span></span>, to worship, revere. So revered, venerated (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span>).</p>
<p><b>Pure </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνα</span></span>). Old word for all sorts of purity. There are clean things, thoughts, words, deeds.</p>
<p><b>Lovely </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσφιλη</span></span>). Old word, here only in N.T., from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλεω</span></span>, pleasing, winsome.</p>
<p><b>Of good report </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευφημα</span></span>. Old word, only here in N.T., from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φημη</span></span>, fair-speaking, attractive.</p>
<p><b>If there be any </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τις</span></span>). Paul changes the construction from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσα</span></span> (whatsoever) to a condition of the first class, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:1">Philippians 2:1</span>, with two substantives.</p>
<p><b>Virtue </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρετη</span></span>). Old word, possibly from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρεσκω</span></span>, to please, used very often in a variety of senses by the ancients for any mental excellence or moral quality or physical power. Its very vagueness perhaps explains its rarity in the N.T., only four times (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:8">Philippians 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:3">2 Peter 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5">2 Peter 1:5</span>). It is common in the papyri, but probably Paul is using it in the sense found in the LXX (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:12">Isaiah 42:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+43:21">Isaiah 43:21</span>) of God's splendour and might (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 95) in connection with "praise" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαινος</span></span>) as here or even meaning praise.</p>
<p><b>Think on these things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταυτα λογιζεσθε</span></span>). Present middle imperative for habit of thought. We are responsible for our thoughts and can hold them to high and holy ideals. </p>
