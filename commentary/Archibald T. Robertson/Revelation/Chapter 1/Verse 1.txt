<p><b> The Revelation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαλυψις</span></span>). Late and rare word outside of N.T. (once in Plutarch and so in the vernacular <i>Koine</i>), only once in the Gospels (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:32">Luke 2:32</span>), but in LXX and common in the Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:7">2 Thessalonians 1:7</span>), though only here in this book besides the title, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαλυπτω</span></span>, old verb, to uncover, to unveil. In the Epistles <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαλυψις</span></span> is used for insight into truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span>) or for the revelation of God or Christ at the second coming of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:7">2 Thessalonians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>). It is interesting to compare <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαλυψις</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιφανεια</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φανερωσις</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:7">1 Corinthians 12:7</span>). The precise meaning here turns on the genitive following.</p>
<p><b>Of Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). Hort takes it as objective genitive (revelation about Jesus Christ), but Swete rightly argues for the subjective genitive because of the next clause.</p>
<p><b>Gave him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκεν αυτο</span></span>). It is the Son who received the revelation from the Father, as is usual (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:20">John 5:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:26">John 5:26</span>, etc.).</p>
<p><b>To shew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειξα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεικνυμ</span></span>, purpose of God in giving the revelation to Christ.</p>
<p><b>Unto his servants </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις δουλοις αυτου</span></span>). Believers in general and not just to officials. Dative case. God's servants (or Christ's).</p>
<p><b>Must shortly come to pass </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε γενεσθα εν ταχε</span></span>). Second aorist middle infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>. See this same adjunct (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ταχε</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:8">Luke 18:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:20">Romans 16:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span>. It is a relative term to be judged in the light of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:8">2 Peter 3:8</span> according to God's clock, not ours. And yet undoubtedly the hopes of the early Christians looked for a speedy return of the Lord Jesus. This vivid panorama must be read in the light of that glorious hope and of the blazing fires of persecution from Rome.</p>
<p><b>Sent and signified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσημανεν αποστειλας</span></span>). "Having sent (first aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστελλω</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:16">Matthew 10:16</span> and again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span> of God sending his angel) signified" (first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημαινω</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημα</span></span>, sign or token, for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:33">John 12:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:1">Revelation 12:1</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον</span></span>, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημαινω</span></span> (only here in the Apocalypse) suits admirably the symbolic character of the book.</p>
<p><b>By his angel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του αγγελου αυτου</span></span>). Christ's angel as Christ is the subject of the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσημανεν</span></span>, as in 22:16 Christ sends his angel, though in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span> God sends.</p>
<p><b>Unto his servant John </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω δουλω αυτου Ιωανε</span></span>). Dative case. John gives his name here, though not in Gospel or Epistles, because "prophecy requires the guarantee of the individual who is inspired to utter it" (Milligan). "The genesis of the Apocalypse has now been traced from its origin in the Mind of God to the moment when it reached its human interpreter" (Swete). "Jesus is the medium of all revelation" (Moffatt). </p>
