<p><b> I was in the Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενομην εν πνευματ</span></span>). Rather, "I came to be (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>) in the Spirit," came into an ecstatic condition as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:10">Acts 10:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17">Acts 22:17</span>, not the normal spiritual condition (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα εν πνευματ</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span>).</p>
<p><b>On the Lord's Day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη κυριακη ημερα</span></span>). Deissmann has proven (<i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 217f.; <i>Light</i>, etc., p. 357ff.) from inscriptions and papyri that the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριακος</span></span> was in common use for the sense "imperial" as imperial finance and imperial treasury and from papyri and ostraca that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερα Σεβαστη</span></span> (Augustus Day) was the first day of each month, Emperor's Day on which money payments were made (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:1">1 Corinthians 16:1</span>). It was easy, therefore, for the Christians to take this term, already in use, and apply it to the first day of the week in honour of the Lord Jesus Christ's resurrection on that day (<i>Didache</i> 14, Ignatius <i>Magn</i>. 9). In the N.T. the word occurs only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:20">1 Corinthians 11:20</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριακον δειπνον θε Λορδ'ς Συππερ</span></span>). It has no reference to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημερα κυριου</span></span> (the day of judgment, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:10">2 Peter 3:10</span>).</p>
<p><b>Behind me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπισω μου</span></span>). "The unexpected, overpowering entrance of the divine voice" (Vincent). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+3:12">Ezekiel 3:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>Voice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνην</span></span>). Of Christ, as is plain in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:12">Revelation 1:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>As of a trumpet </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως σαλπιγγος</span></span>). So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span> referring to this.</p>
<p><b>Saying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγουσης</span></span>). Present active participle genitive case agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαλπιγγος</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγουσαν</span></span>, accusative agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνην</span></span>. So on purpose, as is clear from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span>, where <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλουσης</span></span> also agrees with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαλπιγγος</span></span>. </p>
