<p><b> Write in a book </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραψον εις βιβλιον</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span> for instantaneous action. The commission covers the whole series of visions which all grow out of this first vision of the Risen Christ.</p>
<p><b>Send </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεμψον</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεμπω</span></span>. Part of the commission from Christ. The names of the seven churches of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span> are now given, and the particular message to each church comes in chapters 2 and 3 and in the same order, the geographical order going north from Ephesus, then east and south to Laodicea. But apparently the whole book was to be read to each of the seven churches. It would probably also be copied at each church. </p>
