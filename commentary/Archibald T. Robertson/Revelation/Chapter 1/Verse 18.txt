<p><b> And I was dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εγενομην νεκρος</span></span>). "And I be came dead" (aorist middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:10">Revelation 1:10</span>, definite reference to the Cross).</p>
<p><b>I am alive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζων ειμ</span></span>). Periphrastic present active indicative, "I am living," as the words <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ζων</span></span> just used mean.</p>
<p><b>Forevermore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τους αιωνας των αιωνων</span></span>). "Unto the ages of the ages," a stronger expression of eternity even than in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:6">Revelation 1:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>The keys </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας κλεις</span></span>). One of the forms for the accusative plural along with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλειδας</span></span>, the usual one (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span>).</p>
<p><b>Of death and of Hades </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του θανατου κα του αιδου</span></span>). Conceived as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> as a prison house or walled city. The keys are the symbol of authority, as we speak of honouring one by giving him the keys of the city. Hades here means the unseen world to which death is the portal. Jesus has the keys because of his victory over death.
