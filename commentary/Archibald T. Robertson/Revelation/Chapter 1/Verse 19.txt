<p><b> Therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν</span></span>). In view of Christ's words about himself in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span> and the command in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:11">Revelation 1:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>Which thou sawest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α ειδες</span></span>). The vision of the Glorified Christ in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:13-18">Revelation 1:13-18</span>.</p>
<p><b>The things which are </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α εισιν</span></span>). Plural verb (individualising the items) though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> is neuter plural, certainly the messages to the seven churches (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20-3">Revelation 1:20-3</span>) in relation to the world in general, possibly also partly epexegetic or explanatory of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α ειδες</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>The things which shall come to pass hereafter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α μελλε γινεσθα μετα ταυτα</span></span>). Present middle infinitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλε</span></span>, though both aorist and future are also used. Singular verb here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλε</span></span>) blending in a single view the future. In a rough outline this part begins in 4:1 and goes to end of chapter 22, though the future appears also in chapters 2 and 3 and the present occurs in 4 to 22 and the elements in the vision of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:13-18">Revelation 1:13-18</span>) reappear repeatedly. </p>
