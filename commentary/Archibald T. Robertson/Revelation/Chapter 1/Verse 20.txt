<p><b> The mystery of the seven stars </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μυστηριον των επτα αστερων</span></span>). On the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυστηριον</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:11">Matthew 13:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</span>. Here it means the inner meaning (the secret symbol) of a symbolic vision (Swete) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:7">Revelation 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:18">Revelation 13:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:7">Revelation 17:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:9">Revelation 17:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+2:47">Daniel 2:47</span>. Probably the accusative absolute (Charles), "as for the mystery" (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, pp. 490, 1130), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>. This item is picked out of the previous vision (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>) as needing explanation at once and as affording a clue to what follows (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:1">Revelation 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:5">Revelation 2:5</span>).</p>
<p><b>Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ους</span></span>). Masculine accusative retained without attraction to case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αστερων</span></span> (genitive, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>In my right hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ της δεξιας μου</span></span>). Or "upon," but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη</span></span>, etc., in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>And the seven golden candlesticks </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τας επτα λυχνιας τας χρυσας</span></span>). "The seven lampstands the golden," identifying the stars of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span> with the lampstands of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:12">Revelation 1:12</span>. The accusative case here is even more peculiar than the accusative absolute <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυστηριον</span></span>, since the genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυχνιων</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυστηριον</span></span> is what one would expect. Charles suggests that John did not revise his work.</p>
<p><b>The angels of the seven churches </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελο των επτα εκκλησιων</span></span>). Anarthrous in the predicate (angels of, etc.). "The seven churches" mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:11">Revelation 1:11</span>. Various views of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελος</span></span> here exist. The simplest is the etymological meaning of the word as messenger from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελλω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:10">Matthew 11:10</span>) as messengers from the seven churches to Patmos or by John from Patmos to the churches (or both). Another view is that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελος</span></span> is the pastor of the church, the reading <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την γυναικα σου</span></span> (thy wife) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:20">Revelation 2:20</span> (if genuine) confirming this view. Some would even take it to be the bishop over the elders as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισχοπος</span></span> in Ignatius, but a separate <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελος</span></span> in each church is against this idea. Some take it to be a symbol for the church itself or the spirit and genius of the church, though distinguished in this very verse from the churches themselves (the lampstands). Others take it to be the guardian angel of each church assuming angelic patrons to be taught in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:10">Matthew 18:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:15">Acts 12:15</span>. Each view is encompassed with difficulties, perhaps fewer belonging to the view that the "angel" is the pastor.</p>
<p><b>Are seven churches </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επτα εκκλησια εισιν</span></span>). These seven churches (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:11">Revelation 1:11</span>) are themselves lampstands (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:12">Revelation 1:12</span>) reflecting the light of Christ to the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:14-16">Matthew 5:14-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>) in the midst of which Christ walks (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:13">Revelation 1:13</span>). </p>
