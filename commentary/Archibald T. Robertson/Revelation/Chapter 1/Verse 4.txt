<p><b> To the seven churches which are in Asia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταις επτα εκκλησιαις ταις εν τη Ασια</span></span>). Dative case as in a letter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span>). John is writing, but the revelation is from God and Christ through an angel. It is the Roman province of Asia which included the western part of Phrygia. There were churches also at Troas (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:5">Acts 20:5</span>) and at Colossal and Hierapolis (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:1">Colossians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1">Colossians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:13">Colossians 4:13</span>) and possibly at Magnesia and Tralles. But these seven were the best points of communication with seven districts (Ramsay) and, besides, seven is a favorite number of completion (like the full week) in the book (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:12">Revelation 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:5">Revelation 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:1">Revelation 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:2">Revelation 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:3">Revelation 10:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:13">Revelation 11:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:3">Revelation 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>From him which is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο ο ων</span></span>). This use of the articular nominative participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> instead of the ablative is not due to ignorance or a mere slip (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαψυς πενναε</span></span>), for in the next line we have the regular idiom with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο των επτα πνευματων</span></span>. It is evidently on purpose to call attention to the eternity and unchangeableness of God. Used of God in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:14">Exodus 3:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>And which was </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο ην</span></span>). Here again there is a deliberate change from the articular participle to the relative use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο</span></span> (used in place of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος</span></span> to preserve identity of form in the three instances like Ionic relative and since no aorist participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span> existed). The oracle in Pausanias X. 12 has it: <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ζευς ην, Ζευς εστι, Ζευς εσσετα</span></span> (Zeus was, Zeus is, Zeus will be).</p>
<p><b>Which is to come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ερχομενος</span></span>). "The Coming One," futuristic use of the present participle instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εσομενος</span></span>. See the same idiom in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:8">Revelation 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:8">Revelation 4:8</span> and (without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ερχομενος</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:17">Revelation 11:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:5">Revelation 16:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>From the seven spirits </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο των επτα πνευματων</span></span>). A difficult symbolic representation of the Holy Spirit here on a par with God and Christ, a conclusion borne out by the symbolic use of the seven spirits in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:1">Revelation 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:5">Revelation 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span> (from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:2-10">Zechariah 4:2-10</span>). There is the one Holy Spirit with seven manifestations here to the seven churches (Swete, <i>The Holy Spirit in the N.T.</i>, p. 374), unity in diversity (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4">1 Corinthians 12:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>Which are </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των</span></span> article Aleph A, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> relative P).</p>
<p><b>Before his throne </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωπιον του θρονου αυτου</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:5">Revelation 4:5</span>. </p>
