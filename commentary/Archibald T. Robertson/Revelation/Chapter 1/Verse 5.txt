 Who is the faithful witness  (ο μαρτυς ο πιστος). "The witness the faithful," nominative in apposition like πρωτοτοκος and αρχων with the preceding ablative Ιησου Χριστου with απο, a habit of John in this book (apparently on purpose) as in Revelation 2:13; Revelation 2:20; Revelation 3:12, etc. See this same phrase in Revelation 2:13; Revelation 3:14. The use of μαρτυς of Jesus here is probably to the witness (Revelation 1:1) in this book (Revelation 22:16), not to the witness of Jesus before Pilate (1 Timothy 6:13).The first-born of the dead  (ο πρωτοτοκος των νεκρων). A Jewish Messianic title (Psalms 88:28) and as in Colossians 1:18 refers to priority in the resurrection to be followed by others. See Luke 2:7 for the word.The ruler of the kings of the earth  (ο αρχων των βασιλεων της γης). Jesus by his resurrection won lordship over the kings of earth (Revelation 17:14; Revelation 19:16), what the devil offered him by surrender (Matthew 4:8).Unto him that loveth us  (τω αγαπωντ ημας). Dative of the articular present (not aorist αγαπησαντ) active participle of αγαπαω in a doxology to Christ, the first of many others to God and to Christ (Revelation 1:6; Revelation 4:11; Revelation 5:9; Revelation 5:12; Revelation 7:10; Revelation 7:12, etc.). For the thought see John 3:16.Loosed  (λυσαντ). First aorist active participle of λυω (Aleph A C), though some MSS. (P Q) read λουσαντ (washed), a manifest correction. Note the change of tense. Christ loosed us once for all, but loves us always.By his blood  (εν τω αιματ αυτου). As in Revelation 5:9. John here as in the Gospel and Epistles states plainly and repeatedly the place of the blood of Christ in the work of redemption.
