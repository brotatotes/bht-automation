<p><b> And he made </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εποιησεν</span></span>). Change from the participle construction, which would be <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ποιησαντ</span></span> (first aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυσαντ</span></span> just before, a Hebraism Charles calls it, but certainly an anacoluthon of which John is very fond, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2">Revelation 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:9">Revelation 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:20">Revelation 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:14">Revelation 7:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:2">Revelation 14:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+15:3">Revelation 15:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Kingdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλειαν</span></span>). So correctly Aleph A C, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλεις</span></span> (P cursives). Perhaps a reminiscence of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:6">Exodus 19:6</span>, a kingdom of priests. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:10">Revelation 5:10</span> we have again "a kingdom and priests." The idea here is that Christians are the true spiritual Israel in God's promise to Abraham as explained by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>To be priests </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερεις</span></span>). In apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλειαν</span></span>, but with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> (and) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:10">Revelation 5:10</span>. Each member of this true kingdom is a priest unto God, with direct access to him at all times.</p>
<p><b>Unto his God and Father </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω θεω κα πατρ αυτου</span></span>). Dative case and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> (Christ) applies to both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατρ</span></span>. Jesus spoke of the Father as his God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:46">Matthew 27:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:17">John 20:17</span>) and Paul uses like language (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span>), as does Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span>).</p>
<p><b>To him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span>). Another doxology to Christ. "The adoration of Christ which vibrates in this doxology is one of the most impressive features of the book" (Moffatt). Like doxologies to Christ appear in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:13">Revelation 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:10">Revelation 7:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:11">1 Peter 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:18">2 Peter 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:18">2 Timothy 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:21">Hebrews 13:21</span>. These same words (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η δοξα κα το κρατος</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:11">1 Peter 4:11</span>, only <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η δοξα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:18">2 Peter 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:18">2 Timothy 4:18</span>, but with several others in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:13">Revelation 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:10">Revelation 7:10</span>. </p>
