<p><b> Behold, he cometh with the clouds </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδου ερχετα μετα των νεφελων</span></span>). Futuristic present middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, a reminiscence of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span> (Theodotion). "It becomes a common eschatological refrain" (Beckwith) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:26">Mark 13:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:62">Mark 14:62</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:27">Luke 21:27</span>.

<p><b>Shall see </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οψετα</span></span>). Future middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οραω</span></span>, a reminiscence of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:10">Zechariah 12:10</span> according to the text of Theodotion (Aquila and Symmachus) rather than the LXX and like that of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span> (similar combination of Daniel and Zechariah) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+26:64">Revelation 26:64</span>. This picture of the victorious Christ in his return occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:18-20">Revelation 14:18-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:11-21">Revelation 19:11-21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:7-10">Revelation 20:7-10</span>.</p>
<p><b>And they which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα οιτινες</span></span>). "And the very ones who," Romans and Jews, all who shared in this act.</p>
<p><b>Pierced </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεκεντησαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκεντεω</span></span>, late compound (Aristotle, Polybius, LXX), from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κεντεω</span></span> (to stab, to pierce), in N.T., only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:37">John 19:37</span>, in both cases from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:10">Zechariah 12:10</span>, but not the LXX text (apparently proof that John used the original Hebrew or the translation of Theodotion and Aquila).</p>
<p><b>Shall mourn </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοψοντα</span></span>). Future middle (direct) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοπτω</span></span>, old verb, to cut, "they shall cut themselves," as was common for mourners (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:17">Matthew 11:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:52">Luke 8:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:27">Luke 23:27</span>).

<p><b>Tribes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλα</span></span>). Not just the Jewish tribes, but the spiritual Israel of Jews and Gentiles as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:4-8">Revelation 7:4-8</span>. No nation had then accepted Christ as Lord and Saviour, nor has any yet done so. </p>
