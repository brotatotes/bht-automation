<p><b> I John </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω Ιωανης</span></span>). So <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:8">Revelation 22:8</span>. In apocalyptic literature the personality of the writer is always prominent to guarantee the visions (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+8:1">Daniel 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+10:2">Daniel 10:2</span>).</p>
<p><b>Partaker with you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνκοινωνος</span></span>). See already <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:23">1 Corinthians 9:23</span>. "Co-partner with you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:17">Romans 11:17</span>). One article with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδελφος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνκοινωνος</span></span> unifying the picture. The absence of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστολος</span></span> here does not show that he is not an apostle, but merely his self-effacement, as in the Fourth Gospel, and still more his oneness with his readers. So there is only one article (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη</span></span>) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιψε</span></span> (tribulation), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλεια</span></span> (kingdom), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπομονη</span></span> (patience), ideas running all through the book. Both the tribulation (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:21">Matthew 13:21</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιψις</span></span>) and the kingdom (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλεια</span></span>) were present realities and called for patience (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπομονη</span></span> being "the spiritual alchemy" according to Charles for those in the kingdom, for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:15">Luke 8:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:7">James 5:7</span>). All this is possible only "in Jesus" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Ιησου</span></span>), a phrase on a par with Paul's common <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Χριστω</span></span> (in Christ), repeated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:13">Revelation 14:13</span>. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:20">Revelation 3:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:5">2 Thessalonians 3:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>Was </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενομην</span></span>). Rather, "I came to be," second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>In the isle that is called Patmos </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη νησω τη καλουμενη Πατμω</span></span>). Patmos is a rocky sparsely settled island some ten miles long and half that wide, one of the Sporades group in the Aegean Sea, south of Miletus. The present condition of the island is well described by W. E. Geil in <i>The Isle That Is Called Patmos</i> (1905). Here John saw the visions described in the book, apparently written while still a prisoner there in exile.</p>
<p><b>For the word of God and the testimony of Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τον λογον του θεου κα την μαρτυριαν Ιησου</span></span>). The reason for (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> and the accusative) John's presence in Patmos, naturally as a result of persecution already alluded to, not for the purpose of preaching there or of receiving the visions. See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:2">Revelation 1:2</span> for the phrase. </p>
