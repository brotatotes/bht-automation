 Another strong angel  (αλλον αγγελον ισχυρον). But the seventh trumpet does not sound till Revelation 11:15. This angel is not one of the seven or of the four, but like the other strong angel in Revelation 5:2; Revelation 18:21 or the other angel in Revelation 14:6; Revelation 14:15. The sixth trumpet of Revelation 9:13 ends in Revelation 9:21. The opening of the seventh seal was preceded by two visions (chapter Revelation 10:7) and so here the sounding of the seventh trumpet (Revelation 11:15) is preceded by a new series of visions (Revelation 10:1-11).Coming down out of heaven  (καταβαινοντα εκ του ουρανου). Present active participle of καταβαινω picturing the process of the descent as in Revelation 20:1 (cf. Revelation 3:12).Arrayed with a cloud  (περιβεβλημενον νεφελην). Perfect passive participle of περιβαλλω with accusative case retained as in Revelation 7:9; Revelation 7:13. Not proof that this angel is Christ, though Christ will come on the clouds (Revelation 1:7) as he ascended on a cloud (Acts 1:9). God's chariot is in the clouds (Psalms 104:3), but this angel is a special messenger of God's.The rainbow  (η ιρις). See Revelation 4:3 for this word. The construction here is changed from the accusative to the nominative.As the sun  (ως ο ηλιος). The very metaphor applied to Christ in Revelation 1:16.As pillars of fire  (ως στυλο πυρος). Somewhat like the metaphor of Christ in Revelation 1:15, but still no proof that this angel is Christ. On στυλος see Revelation 3:12; Galatians 2:9.
