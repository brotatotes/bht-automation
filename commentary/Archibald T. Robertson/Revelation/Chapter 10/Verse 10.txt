<p><b> I took--and ate it up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαβον--κα κατεφαγον αυτο</span></span>). Second aorist active indicatives of the same verbs to show John's prompt obedience to the command. The order of the results is here changed to the actual experience (sweet in the mouth, bitter in the belly). The simplex verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφαγον</span></span> (I ate) is now used, not the compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεφαγον</span></span> (I ate up). </p>
