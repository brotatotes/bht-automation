<p><b> The seven thunders </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α επτα βροντα</span></span>). A recognized group, but not explained here, perhaps John assuming them to be known. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βροντα</span></span> see already <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:5">Revelation 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:1">Revelation 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:5">Revelation 8:5</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:29">Revelation 10:29</span> the Lord speaks in the sevenfold voice of the thunderstorm upon the sea.</p>
<p><b>Their voices </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας εαυτων φωνας</span></span>). Cognate accusative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλησαν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτων</span></span> (reflexive) means "their own." In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:28">John 12:28</span> the voice of the Father to Christ was thought by some to be thunder. </p>
