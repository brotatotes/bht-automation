 The seven thunders  (α επτα βροντα). A recognized group, but not explained here, perhaps John assuming them to be known. For βροντα see already Revelation 4:5; Revelation 6:1; Revelation 8:5. In Revelation 10:29 the Lord speaks in the sevenfold voice of the thunderstorm upon the sea.Their voices  (τας εαυτων φωνας). Cognate accusative with ελαλησαν and εαυτων (reflexive) means "their own." In John 12:28 the voice of the Father to Christ was thought by some to be thunder.
