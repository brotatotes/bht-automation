<p><b> I was about to write </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημελλον γραφειν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλω</span></span> (double augment as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:47">John 4:47</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:33">John 12:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:32">John 18:32</span>) and the present (inchoative) active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span>, "I was on the point of beginning to write," as commanded in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:11">Revelation 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:19">Revelation 1:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>Seal up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφραγισον</span></span>). Aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφραγιζω</span></span>, tense of urgency, "seal up at once."</p>
<p><b>And write them not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μη αυτα γραψηις</span></span>). Prohibition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the ingressive aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span>, "Do not begin to write." It is idle to conjecture what was in the utterances. Compare Paul's silence in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:4">2 Corinthians 12:4</span>. </p>
