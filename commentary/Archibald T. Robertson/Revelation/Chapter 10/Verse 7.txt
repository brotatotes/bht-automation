<p><b> When he is about to sound </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν μελλη σαλπιζειν</span></span>). Indefinite temporal clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> and the present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλω</span></span> and the present (inchoative) active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαλπιζω</span></span>, "whenever he is about to begin to sound" (in contrast to the aorist in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>).</p>
<p><b>Then </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>). So in apodosis often (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:10">Revelation 14:10</span>).</p>
<p><b>Is finished </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετελεσθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελεω</span></span>, proleptic or futuristic use of the aorist as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:28">1 Corinthians 7:28</span>. So also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+15:1">Revelation 15:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>The mystery of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μυστηριον του θεου</span></span>). This same phrase by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1">1 Corinthians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>. Here apparently the whole purpose of God in human history is meant.</p>
<p><b>According to the good tidings which he declared </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ευηγγελισεν</span></span>). "As he gospelized to," first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιζω</span></span>, a rare use of the active as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span> with the accusative. See the middle so used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:9">Galatians 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:12">1 Peter 1:12</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="am+3:7">Amos 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+7:25">Jeremiah 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+25:4">Jeremiah 25:4</span> for this idea in the O.T. prophets who hoped for a cleaning up of all mysteries in the last days. </p>
