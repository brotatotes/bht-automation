 A reed  (καλαμος). Old word for a growing reed (Matthew 11:7) which grew in immense brakes in the Jordan valley, a writer's reed (3 John 1:7), a measuring-rod (here, Revelation 21:15; Ezekiel 40:3-6; Ezekiel 42:16-19).Like a rod  (ομοιος ραβδω). See Revelation 2:27; Mark 6:8 for ραβδος.And one said  (λεγων). "Saying" (present active masculine participle of λεγω) is all that the Greek has. The participle implies εδωκεν (he gave), not εδοθη, a harsh construction seen in Genesis 22:20; Genesis 38:24, etc.Rise and measure  (εγειρε κα μετρησον). Present active imperative of εγειρω (intransitive, exclamatory use as in Mark 2:11) and first aorist active imperative of μετρεω. In Ezekiel 42:2 the prophet measures the temple and that passage is probably in mind here. But modern scholars do not know how to interpret this interlude (Revelation 11:1-13) before the seventh trumpet (Revelation 11:15). Some (Wellhausen) take it to be a scrap from the Zealot party before the destruction of Jerusalem, which event Christ also foretold (Mark 13:2; Matthew 24:2; Luke 21:6) and which was also attributed to Stephen (Acts 6:14). Charles denies any possible literal interpretation and takes the language in a wholly eschatological sense. There are three points in the interlude, however understood: the chastisement of Jerusalem or Israel (verses Revelation 11:1; Revelation 11:2), the mission of the two witnesses (Revelation 11:3-12), the rescue of the remnant (Revelation 11:13). There is a heavenly sanctuary (Revelation 7:15; Revelation 11:19; Revelation 14:15, etc.), but here ναος is on earth and yet not the actual temple in Jerusalem (unless so interpreted). Perhaps here it is the spiritual (Revelation 3:12; 2 Thessalonians 2:4; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 2 Corinthians 6:16; Ephesians 2:19). For altar (θυσιαστηριον) see Revelation 8:3. Perhaps measuring as applied to "them that worship therein" (τους προσκυνουντας εν αυτω) implies a word like numbering, with an allusion to the 144,000 in chapter 7 (a zeugma).
