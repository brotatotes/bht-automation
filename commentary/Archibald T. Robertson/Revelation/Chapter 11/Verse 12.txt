<p><b> Saying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγουσης</span></span>). Present active predicate participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span>, feminine genitive agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνης</span></span>, though some MSS. have the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνην λεγουσαν</span></span>, either construction being proper after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσαν</span></span> (they heard). There is a little evidence for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσα</span></span> like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:10">Revelation 12:10</span> (24 times in the book). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28">John 5:28</span>.</p>
<p><b>Come up hither </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβατε ωδε</span></span>). Second aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινω</span></span>. The ascension of these two witnesses is in full view of their enemies, not just in the presence of a few friends as with Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:9">Acts 1:9</span>).</p>
<p><b>They went up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεβησαν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>In the cloud </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη νεφελη</span></span>). As Jesus did (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:9">Acts 1:9</span>) and like Elijah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+2:11">2 Kings 2:11</span>). Their triumph is openly celebrated before their enemies and is like the rapture described by Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</span>. </p>
