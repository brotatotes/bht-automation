<p><b> There followed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενοντο</span></span>). "There came to pass." There was silence in heaven upon the opening of the seventh seal (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:1">Revelation 8:1</span>), but here "great voices." Perhaps the great voices are the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωα</span></span> of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6">Revelation 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:8">Revelation 5:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>Saying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγοντες</span></span>). Construction according to sense; <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγοντες</span></span>, masculine participle (not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγουσα</span></span>), though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνα</span></span>, feminine. John understood what was said.</p>
<p><b>Is become </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span>). "Did become," prophetic use of the aorist participle, already a fact. See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:9">Luke 19:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>The kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του κυριου ημων κα του Χριστου αυτου</span></span>). Repeat <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η βασιλεια</span></span> from the preceding. God the Father is meant here by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυριου</span></span> (Lord), as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> (his) shows. This is the certain and glorious outcome of the age-long struggle against Satan, who wields the kingdom of the world which he offered to Christ on the mountain for one act of worship. But Jesus scorned partnership with Satan in the rule of the world, and chose war, war up to the hilt and to the end. Now the climax has come with Christ as Conqueror of the kingdom of this world for his Father. This is the crowning lesson of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p><b>He shall reign </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλευσε</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλευω</span></span>. God shall reign, but the rule of God and of Christ is one as the kingdom is one (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:27">1 Corinthians 15:27</span>). Jesus is the Lord's Anointed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:26">Luke 2:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:20">Luke 9:20</span>). </p>
