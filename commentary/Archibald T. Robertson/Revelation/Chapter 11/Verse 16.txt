 The four and twenty elders  (ο εικοσ τεσσαρες πρεσβυτερο). They follow the living creatures (verse Revelation 11:15, if correctly interpreted) in their adoration, as in Revelation 4:9. Though seated on thrones of their own (Revelation 4:4), yet they fall upon their faces in every act of worship to God and Christ (Revelation 4:10; Revelation 5:8; Revelation 5:14; Revelation 19:4). Here επ τα προσωπα αυτων (upon their faces) is added as in Revelation 7:11 about the angels. The elders here again represent the redeemed, as the four living creatures the forces of nature, in the great thanksgiving here (ευχαριστουμεν, present active indicative of ευχαριστεω).
