<p><b> The four and twenty elders </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εικοσ τεσσαρες πρεσβυτερο</span></span>). They follow the living creatures (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>, if correctly interpreted) in their adoration, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:9">Revelation 4:9</span>. Though seated on thrones of their own (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:4">Revelation 4:4</span>), yet they fall upon their faces in every act of worship to God and Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:10">Revelation 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:8">Revelation 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:14">Revelation 5:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:4">Revelation 19:4</span>). Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τα προσωπα αυτων</span></span> (upon their faces) is added as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:11">Revelation 7:11</span> about the angels. The elders here again represent the redeemed, as the four living creatures the forces of nature, in the great thanksgiving here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστουμεν</span></span>, present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχαριστεω</span></span>). </p>
