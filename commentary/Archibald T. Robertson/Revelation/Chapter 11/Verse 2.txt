<p><b> The court </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αυλην</span></span>). The uncovered yard outside the house. There were usually two, one between the door and the street, the outer court, the other the inner court surrounded by the buildings (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:66">Mark 14:66</span>). This is here the outer court, "which is without the temple" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την εξωθεν του ναου</span></span>), outside of the sanctuary, but within the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερον</span></span> where the Gentiles could go (carrying out the imagery of the Jerusalem temple).</p>
<p><b>Leave without </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλε εξωθεν</span></span>). Literally, "cast without" (second aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβαλλω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Do not measure it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη αυτην μετρησηις</span></span>). Prohibition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the first aorist active (ingressive) subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετρεω</span></span>. This outer court is left to its fate. In Herod's temple the outer court was marked off from the inner by "the middle wall of partition" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μεσοιτοιχον του φραγμου</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span>), beyond which a Gentile could not go. In this outer court was a house of prayer for the Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:17">Mark 11:17</span>), but now John is to cast it out and leave to its fate (given to the Gentiles in another sense) to be profaned by them.</p>
<p><b>They shall tread under foot </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατησουσιν</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατεω</span></span>, here to trample with contempt as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:24">Luke 21:24</span>, even the holy city (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:5">Matthew 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+48:2">Isaiah 48:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ne+11:1">Nehemiah 11:1</span>). Charles thinks that only the heavenly city can be so called here (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:10">Revelation 21:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:19">Revelation 22:19</span>) because of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:8">Revelation 11:8</span> (Sodom and Gomorrah). But the language may be merely symbolical. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+9:24">Daniel 9:24</span>.</p>
<p><b>Forty and two months </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηνας τεσσερακοντα κα δυο</span></span>). Accusative of extent of time. This period in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:25">Daniel 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+12:7">Daniel 12:7</span>. It occurs in three forms in the Apocalypse (forty-two months, here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:5">Revelation 13:5</span>; 1260 days, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:3">Revelation 11:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:6">Revelation 12:6</span>; time, times and half a time or 3 1/2 years, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:14">Revelation 12:14</span> and so in Daniel). This period, however its length may be construed, covers the duration of the triumph of the Gentiles, of the prophesying of the two witnesses, of the sojourn of the woman in the wilderness. </p>
