 The two olive trees  (α δυο ελαια). The article seems to point to what is known. For this original use of ελαια see Romans 11:17; Romans 11:24. In Zechariah 4:2; Zechariah 4:3; Zechariah 4:14 the lampstand or candlestick (λυχνια) is Israel, and the two olive trees apparently Joshua and Zerubbabel, but John makes his own use of this symbolism. Here the two olive trees and the candlesticks are identical.Standing  (εστωτες). Masculine perfect active participle agreeing with ουτο instead of εστωσα (read by P and cursives) agreeing with ελαια κα λυχνια, even though α (feminine plural article) be accepted before ενωπιον του κυριου (before the Lord).
