<p><b> If any man desireth to hurt them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τις αυτους θελε αδικησα</span></span>). Condition of first class, assumed to be true, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and present active indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελε</span></span>) "if any one wants to hurt" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικησα</span></span> first aorist active infinitive). It is impossible to hurt these two witnesses till they do their work. The fire proceeding out of the mouths of the witnesses is like Elijah's experience (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+1:10">2 Kings 1:10</span>).</p>
<p><b>Devoureth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεσθιε</span></span>). "Eats up (down)," present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεσθιω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>If any man shall desire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τις θεληση</span></span>). Condition of third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:13">Luke 9:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:12">Philippians 3:12</span>, but MSS. also read either <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελε</span></span> (present active indicative) or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελησε</span></span> (future active, condition of the first class like the preceding one. The condition is repeated in this changed form, as less likely to happen and with inevitable death (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε αυτον αποκτανθηνα</span></span>, must be killed, first aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκτεινω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>). </p>
