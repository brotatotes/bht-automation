 If any man desireth to hurt them  (ε τις αυτους θελε αδικησα). Condition of first class, assumed to be true, with ε and present active indicative (θελε) "if any one wants to hurt" (αδικησα first aorist active infinitive). It is impossible to hurt these two witnesses till they do their work. The fire proceeding out of the mouths of the witnesses is like Elijah's experience (2 Kings 1:10).Devoureth  (κατεσθιε). "Eats up (down)," present active indicative of κατεσθιω.If any man shall desire  (ε τις θεληση). Condition of third class with ε and first aorist active subjunctive of θελω as in Luke 9:13; Philippians 3:12, but MSS. also read either θελε (present active indicative) or θελησε (future active, condition of the first class like the preceding one. The condition is repeated in this changed form, as less likely to happen and with inevitable death (δε αυτον αποκτανθηνα, must be killed, first aorist passive infinitive of αποκτεινω with δε).
