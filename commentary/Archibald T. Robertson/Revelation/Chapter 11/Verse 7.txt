<p><b> When they shall have finished </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν τελεσωσιν</span></span>). Merely the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελεω</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> in an indefinite temporal clause with no <i>futurum exactum</i> (future perfect), "whenever they finish."</p>
<p><b>The beast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το θηριον</span></span>). "The wild beast comes out of the abyss" of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:1">Revelation 9:1</span>. He reappears in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:3">Daniel 7:3</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θηρια</span></span> occurs. Nothing less than antichrist will satisfy the picture here. Some see the abomination of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:7">Daniel 7:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:15">Matthew 24:15</span>. Some see Nero <i>redivivus</i>.</p>
<p><b>He shall make war with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησε μετ' αυτων πολεμον</span></span>). This same phrase occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:17">Revelation 12:17</span> about the dragon's attack on the woman. It is more the picture of single combat (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:16">Revelation 2:16</span>).</p>
<p><b>He shall overcome them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νικησε αυτους</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νικαω</span></span>. The victory of the beast over the two witnesses is certain, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:21">Daniel 7:21</span>.</p>
<p><b>And kill them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αποκτενε</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκτεινω</span></span>. Without attempting to apply this prophecy to specific individuals or times, one can agree with these words of Swete: "But his words cover in effect all the martyrdoms and massacres of history in which brute force has seemed to triumph over truth and righteousness." </p>
