 Their dead bodies lie  (το πτωμα αυτων). Old word from πιπτω (to fall), a fall, especially of bodies slain in battle, a corpse, a carcase (Matthew 14:12), here the singular (some MSS. πτωματα, plural) as belonging to each of the αυτων (their) like στοματος αυτων (their mouth) in verse Revelation 11:5. So also in verse Revelation 11:9. No word in the Greek for "lie."In  (επ). "Upon," as in verse Revelation 11:6, with genitive (της πλατειας), the broad way (οδου understood), from πλατυς (broad) as in Matthew 6:5, old word (Revelation 21:21; Revelation 22:2).Of the great city  (της πολεως της μεγαλης). Clearly Jerusalem in view of the closing clause (οπου--εσταυρωθη), though not here called "the holy city" as in verse Revelation 11:2, and though elsewhere in the Apocalypse Babylon (Rome) is so described (Revelation 14:8; Revelation 16:19; Revelation 17:5; Revelation 18:2; Revelation 18:10; Revelation 18:16; Revelation 18:18; Revelation 18:19; Revelation 18:21).Which  (ητις). Which very city, not "whichever."Spiritually  (πνευματικως). This late adverb from πνευματικος (spiritual) occurs in the N.T. only twice, in 1 Corinthians 2:14 for the help of the Holy Spirit in interpreting God's message and here in a hidden or mystical (allegorical sense). For this use of πνευματικος see 1 Corinthians 10:3. Judah is called Sodom in Isaiah 1:9; Ezekiel 16:46; Ezekiel 16:55. See also Matthew 10:15; Matthew 11:23. Egypt is not applied to Israel in the O.T., but is "an obvious symbol of oppression and slavery" (Swete).Where also their Lord was crucified  (οπου κα ο κυριος αυτων εσταυρωθη). First aorist passive indicative of σταυροω, to crucify, a reference to the fact of Christ's crucifixion in Jerusalem. This item is one of the sins of Jerusalem and the disciple is not greater than the Master (John 15:20).
