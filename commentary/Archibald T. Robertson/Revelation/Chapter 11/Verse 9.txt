 Men from among  (εκ των etc.). No word for "men" (ανθρωπο or πολλο) before εκ των, but it is implied (partitive use of εκ) as in Revelation 2:10 and often. See also Revelation 5:9; Revelation 7:9 for this enumeration of races and nations.Do look upon  (βλεπουσιν). Present (vivid dramatic) active indicative of βλεπω.Three days and a half  (ημερας τρεις κα ημισυ). Accusative of extent of time. Hημισυ is neuter singular though ημερας (days) is feminine as in Mark 6:23; Revelation 12:14. The days of the gloating over the dead bodies are as many as the years of the prophesying by the witnesses (Revelation 11:3), but there is no necessary correspondence (day for a year). This delight of the spectators "is represented as at once fiendish and childish" (Swete).Suffer not  (ουκ αφιουσιν). Present active indicative of αφιω, late form for αφιημ, as in Mark 1:34 (cf. αφεις in Revelation 2:20). This use of αφιημ with the infinitive is here alone in the Apocalypse, though common elsewhere (John 11:44; John 11:48; John 12:7; John 18:8).Their dead bodies  (τα πτωματα αυτων). "Their corpses," plural here, though singular just before and in verse Revelation 11:8.To be laid in a tomb  (τεθηνα εις μνημα). First aorist passive of τιθημ, to place. Μνημα (old word from μιμνησκω, to remind) is a memorial, a monument, a sepulchre, a tomb (Mark 5:3). "In a country where burial regularly took place on the day of death the time of exposure and indignity would be regarded long" (Beckwith). See Tobit 1:18ff.
