<p><b> A great sign </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον μεγα</span></span>). The first of the visions to be so described (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:3">Revelation 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+15:1">Revelation 15:1</span>), and it is introduced by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφθη</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:3">Revelation 12:3</span>, not by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα ταυτο</span></span> or by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον</span></span> or by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον κα ιδου</span></span> as heretofore. This "sign" is really a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τερας</span></span> (wonder), as it is so by association in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:48">John 4:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22">Acts 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:12">Acts 5:12</span>. The element of wonder is not in the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον</span></span> as in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τερας</span></span>, but often in the thing itself as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:11">Luke 21:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:16">John 9:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:13">Revelation 13:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+15:1">Revelation 15:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:14">Revelation 16:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>A woman </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυνη</span></span>). Nominative case in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον</span></span>. "The first 'sign in heaven' is a Woman--the earliest appearance of a female figure in the Apocalyptic vision" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>Arrayed with the sun </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιβεβλημενη τον ηλιον</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιβαλλω</span></span>, with the accusative retained as so often (9 times) in the Apocalypse. Both Charles and Moffatt see mythological ideas and sources behind the bold imagery here that leave us all at sea. Swete understands the Woman to be "the church of the Old Testament" as "the Mother of whom Christ came after the flesh. But here, as everywhere in the Book, no sharp dividing line is drawn between the Church of the Old Testament and the Christian Society." Certainly she is not the Virgin Mary, as verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:17">Revelation 12:17</span> makes clear. Beckwith takes her to be "the heavenly representative of the people of God, the <i>ideal</i> Zion, which, so far as it is embodied in concrete realities, is represented alike by the people of the Old and the New Covenants." John may have in mind <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+7:14">Isaiah 7:14</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:23">Matthew 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:31">Luke 1:31</span>) as well as <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mic+4:10">Micah 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+26:17">Isaiah 26:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:7">Isaiah 66:7</span> without a definite picture of Mary. The metaphor of childbirth is common enough (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:21">John 16:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:19">Galatians 4:19</span>). The figure is a bold one with the moon "under her feet" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποκατω των ποδων αυτης</span></span>) and "a crown of twelve stars" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στεφανος αστερων δωδεκα</span></span>), a possible allusion to the twelve tribes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:12">Revelation 21:12</span>) or to the twelve apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:14">Revelation 21:14</span>). </p>
