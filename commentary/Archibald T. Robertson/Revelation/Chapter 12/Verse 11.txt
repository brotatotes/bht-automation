<p><b> They overcame him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτο ενικησαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νικαω</span></span>, the verb used by Jesus of his own victory (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33">John 16:33</span>) and about him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:5">Revelation 5:5</span>). "The victory of the martyrs marks the failure of Satan's endeavours" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>Because of the blood of the Lamb </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια το αιμα του αρνιου</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:14">Revelation 7:14</span>. The blood of Christ is here presented by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> as the ground for the victory and not the means, as by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span>. Both ideas are true, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> with the accusative gives only the reason. The blood of Christ does cleanse us from sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span>). Christ conquered Satan, and so makes our victory possible (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:21">Luke 11:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:18">Hebrews 2:18</span>). "Thus the Lamb is the true <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνηγορος</span></span> (like Michael) of the New Israel, its <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακλητος προς τον πατερα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>)" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>Because of the Word of their testimony </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τον λογον της μαρτυριας αυτων</span></span>). The same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>, "because of their testimony to Jesus" as in John's own case in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>. These martyrs have been true to their part.</p>
<p><b>They loved not their life even unto death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ηγαπησαν τεν ψυχην αυτων αχρ θανατου</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαω</span></span>. They did resist "unto blood" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεχρις αιματος</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:4">Hebrews 12:4</span>) and did not put their own lives before loyalty to Christ. There is a direct reference to the words of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:25">John 12:25</span> as illustrated also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:35">Mark 8:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:39">Matthew 10:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:24">Luke 9:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:33">Luke 17:33</span>. Paul's own example is pertinent (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:13">Acts 21:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:20">Philippians 1:20</span>). Jesus himself had been "obedient unto death" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:8">Philippians 2:8</span>). These martyrs seem to be still alive on earth, but their heroism is proleptically pictured. </p>
