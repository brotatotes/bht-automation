 There were given  (εδοθησαν). As in Revelation 8:2; Revelation 9:1; Revelation 9:3.The two wings of the great eagle  (α δυο πτερυγες του αετου του μεγαλου). Not the eagle of Revelation 8:13, but the generic use of the article. Every eagle had two wings. Probably here, as in Matthew 24:28, the griffon or vulture rather than the true eagle is pictured. For the eagle in the O.T. see Exodus 19:4; Isaiah 40:31; Job 9:26; Proverbs 24:54.That she might fly  (ινα πετητα). Purpose clause with ινα and present middle subjunctive of πετομα, old verb, to fly, in N.T. only in the Apocalypse (Revelation 4:7; Revelation 8:13; Revelation 12:14; Revelation 14:6; Revelation 19:17). Resumption of the details in verse Revelation 12:6 (which see) about the "wilderness," her "place," the redundant εκε with οπου, the "time and times, and half a time" (καιρον κα καιρους κα ημισυ), 1260 days, but with τρεφετα (present passive indicative) instead of τρεφωσιν (general plural of the present active subjunctive), and with the addition of "from the face of the serpent" (απο προσωπου του οφεως), because the serpent rules the earth for that period. "To the end of the present order the Church dwells in the wilderness" (Swete), and yet we must carry on for Christ.
