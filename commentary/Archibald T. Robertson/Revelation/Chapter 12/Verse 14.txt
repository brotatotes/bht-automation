<p><b> There were given </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοθησαν</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:2">Revelation 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:1">Revelation 9:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:3">Revelation 9:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>The two wings of the great eagle </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α δυο πτερυγες του αετου του μεγαλου</span></span>). Not the eagle of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13">Revelation 8:13</span>, but the generic use of the article. Every eagle had two wings. Probably here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:28">Matthew 24:28</span>, the griffon or vulture rather than the true eagle is pictured. For the eagle in the O.T. see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:4">Exodus 19:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:31">Isaiah 40:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+9:26">Job 9:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+24:54">Proverbs 24:54</span>.</p>
<p><b>That she might fly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα πετητα</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and present middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πετομα</span></span>, old verb, to fly, in N.T. only in the Apocalypse (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:7">Revelation 4:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13">Revelation 8:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:14">Revelation 12:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:17">Revelation 19:17</span>). Resumption of the details in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:6">Revelation 12:6</span> (which see) about the "wilderness," her "place," the redundant <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκε</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου</span></span>, the "time and times, and half a time" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιρον κα καιρους κα ημισυ</span></span>), 1260 days, but with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρεφετα</span></span> (present passive indicative) instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρεφωσιν</span></span> (general plural of the present active subjunctive), and with the addition of "from the face of the serpent" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο προσωπου του οφεως</span></span>), because the serpent rules the earth for that period. "To the end of the present order the Church dwells in the wilderness" (Swete), and yet we must carry on for Christ. </p>
