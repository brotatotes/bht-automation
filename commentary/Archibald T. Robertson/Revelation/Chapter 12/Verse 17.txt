<p><b> Waxed wroth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωργισθη</span></span>). First aorist (ingressive) passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οργιζομα</span></span>, "became angry."</p>
<p><b>With the woman </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τη γυναικ</span></span>). "At the woman," "because of the woman."</p>
<p><b>Went away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηλθεν</span></span>). "Went off" in his rage to make war with the scattered followers of the Lamb not in the wilderness, perhaps an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>. The devil carries on relentless war with all those "which keep the commandments of God and hold the testimony of Jesus" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των τηρουντων τας εντολας του θεου κα εχοντων την μαρτυριαν Ιησου</span></span>). These two marks excite the wrath of the devil then and always. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:12">Revelation 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>. </p>
