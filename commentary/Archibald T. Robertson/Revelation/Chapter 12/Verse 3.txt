<p><b> Another sign </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλο σημειον</span></span>). "A second tableau following close upon the first and inseparable from it" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>And behold </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ιδου</span></span>). As often (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:2">Revelation 6:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:5">Revelation 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:8">Revelation 6:8</span>, etc.).</p>
<p><b>A great red dragon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δρακων μεγας πυρρος</span></span>). Homer uses this old word (probably from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δερκομα</span></span>, to see clearly) for a great monster with three heads coiled like a serpent that ate poisonous herbs. The word occurs also in Hesiod, Pindar, Eschylus. The Babylonians feared a seven-headed hydra and Typhon was the Egyptian dragon who persecuted Osiris. One wonders if these and the Chinese dragons are not race memories of conflicts with the diplodocus and like monsters before their disappearance. Charles notes in the O.T. this monster as the chief enemy of God under such title as Rahab (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+51:9">Isaiah 51:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+26:12">Job 26:12</span>), Behemoth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+40:15-24">Job 40:15-24</span>), Leviathan (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+27:1">Isaiah 27:1</span>), the Serpent (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="am+9:2">Amos 9:2</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+74:13">Psalms 74:13</span> we read of "the heads of the dragons." On <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρρος</span></span> (red) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:4">Revelation 6:4</span>. Here (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span>) and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:2">Revelation 20:2</span> the great dragon is identified with Satan. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:7">Revelation 12:7</span> for many of the items here, like the ten horns (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:7">Daniel 7:7</span>) and hurling the stars (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+8:10">Daniel 8:10</span>). The word occurs in the Apocalypse alone in the N.T.</p>
<p><b>Seven diadems </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επτα διαδηματα</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαδεω</span></span> (to bind around), the blue band marked with white with which Persian kings used to bind on the tiara, so a royal crown in contrast with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στεφανος</span></span> (chaplet or wreath like the Latin <i>corona</i> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:10">Revelation 2:10</span>), in N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:12">Revelation 19:12</span>. If Christ as Conqueror has "many diadems," it is not strange that Satan should wear seven (ten in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>). </p>
