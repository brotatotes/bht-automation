<p><b> His tail </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ουρα αυτου</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:10">Revelation 9:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:19">Revelation 9:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>Draweth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συρε</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συρω</span></span>, old verb, to drag, here alone in the Apocalypse, but see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:8">John 21:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>The third part of the stars </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το τριτον των αστερων</span></span>). Like a great comet is this monster. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+8:10">Daniel 8:10</span>. Perhaps only the third is meant to soften the picture as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:7">Revelation 8:7</span>.</p>
<p><b>Did cast them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβαλεν αυτους</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative. Charles takes this to refer to a war in heaven between the good angels and Satan, with the fall of some angels (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:6">Jude 1:6</span>). But John may have in mind the martyrs before Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:32">Hebrews 11:32</span>) and after Christ's ascension (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:35">Matthew 23:35</span>).</p>
<p><b>Stood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστηκεν</span></span>). Imperfect active of a late verb, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στηκω</span></span>, from the perfect <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστηκα</span></span> of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>, graphic picture of the dragon's challenge of the woman who is about to give birth.</p>
<p><b>When she was delivered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν τεκη</span></span>). Indefinite temporal clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> and the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τικτω</span></span>, "whenever she gives birth."</p>
<p><b>That he might devour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα καταφαγη</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεσθιω</span></span>, to eat up (down). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+28:34">Jeremiah 28:34</span>. This is what Pharaoh did to Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+1:15-22">Exodus 1:15-22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+85:13">Psalms 85:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+27:1">Isaiah 27:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+51:9">Isaiah 51:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+29:3">Ezekiel 29:3</span>). Precisely so the devil tried to destroy the child Jesus on his birth. </p>
