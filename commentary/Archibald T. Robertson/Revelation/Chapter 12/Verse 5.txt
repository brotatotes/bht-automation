 She was delivered of a son  (ετεκεν υιον). Literally, "she bore a son" (second aorist active indicative of τικτω).A man child  (αρσεν). So A C with the neuter τεκνον or παιδιον in mind, as often in O.T. (ετεκεν αρσεν, Exodus 1:16; Exodus 2:2; Leviticus 12:2; Leviticus 12:7; Isaiah 66:7; Jeremiah 20:15, etc.), but P and some cursives read αρσενα (masculine accusative), as in verse Revelation 12:13 (τον αρσενα), while Aleph Q have αρρενα. The word is old (either αρσην or αρρην), as in Matthew 19:4, only in this chapter in the Apocalypse. It is really redundant after υιον (son), as in Tob. 6:12 (Aleph).Who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron  (ος μελλε ποιμαινειν παντα τα εθνη εν ραβδω σιδηρα). See Revelation 2:27 for these words (from Psalms 2:9) applied there to victorious Christians also, and in Revelation 19:15 to the triumphant Christian. His rule will go beyond the Jews (Matthew 2:6). There is here, of course, direct reference to the birth of Jesus from Mary, who thus represented in her person this "ideal woman" (God's people).Was caught unto God  (ηρπασθη). First aorist passive indicative of αρπαζω, old verb for seizing or snatching away, as in John 10:12, here alone in the Apocalypse. Reference to the ascension of Christ, with omission of the ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ because he is here simply showing that "the Dragon's vigilance was futile" (Swete). "The Messiah, so far from being destroyed, is caught up to a share in God's throne" (Beckwith).
