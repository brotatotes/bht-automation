<p><b> She was delivered of a son </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετεκεν υιον</span></span>). Literally, "she bore a son" (second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τικτω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>A man child </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρσεν</span></span>). So A C with the neuter <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνον</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδιον</span></span> in mind, as often in O.T. (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετεκεν αρσεν</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+1:16">Exodus 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:2">Exodus 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+12:2">Leviticus 12:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+12:7">Leviticus 12:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:7">Isaiah 66:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+20:15">Jeremiah 20:15</span>, etc.), but P and some cursives read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρσενα</span></span> (masculine accusative), as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:13">Revelation 12:13</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αρσενα</span></span>), while Aleph Q have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρρενα</span></span>. The word is old (either <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρσην</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρρην</span></span>), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:4">Matthew 19:4</span>, only in this chapter in the Apocalypse. It is really redundant after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιον</span></span> (son), as in Tob. 6:12 (Aleph).</p>
<p><b>Who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος μελλε ποιμαινειν παντα τα εθνη εν ραβδω σιδηρα</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27">Revelation 2:27</span> for these words (from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:9">Psalms 2:9</span>) applied there to victorious Christians also, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:15">Revelation 19:15</span> to the triumphant Christian. His rule will go beyond the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:6">Matthew 2:6</span>). There is here, of course, direct reference to the birth of Jesus from Mary, who thus represented in her person this "ideal woman" (God's people).</p>
<p><b>Was caught unto God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηρπασθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρπαζω</span></span>, old verb for seizing or snatching away, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:12">John 10:12</span>, here alone in the Apocalypse. Reference to the ascension of Christ, with omission of the ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ because he is here simply showing that "the Dragon's vigilance was futile" (Swete). "The Messiah, so far from being destroyed, is caught up to a share in God's throne" (Beckwith). </p>
