<p><b> Fled into the wilderness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφυγεν εις την ερημον</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φευγω</span></span>. Here, of course, not Mary, but "the ideal woman" (God's people) of the preceding verses, who fled under persecution of the dragon. God's people do not at once share the rapture of Christ, but the dragon is unable to destroy them completely. The phrases used here seem to be reminiscent of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+8:2">Deuteronomy 8:2</span> (wanderings of Israel in the wilderness), <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:2">1 Kings 17:2</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:3">Revelation 19:3</span> (Elijah's flight), I Macc. 2:29 (flight of the Jews from Antiochus Epiphanes), <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:13">Matthew 2:13</span> (flight of Joseph and Mary to Egypt), <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:14">Mark 13:14</span> (the flight of Christians at the destruction of Jerusalem).</p>
<p><b>Where </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου--εκε</span></span>). Hebrew redundancy (where--there) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:8">Revelation 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:9">Revelation 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:9">Revelation 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:12">Revelation 13:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:9">Revelation 17:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:8">Revelation 20:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>Prepared </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητοιμασμενον</span></span>). Perfect passive predicate participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετοιμαζω</span></span>, for which verb see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:23">Matthew 20:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:6">Revelation 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:7">Revelation 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:15">Revelation 9:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:12">Revelation 16:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7">Revelation 19:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>, and for its use with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοπος</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:2">John 14:2</span> and for the kind of fellowship meant by it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+31:21">Psalms 31:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:13">2 Corinthians 13:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:3">Colossians 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span>).</p>
<p><b>Of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο του θεου</span></span>). "From (by) God," marking the source as God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:18">Revelation 9:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:13">James 1:13</span>). This anticipatory symbolism is repeated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:13">Revelation 12:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>That there they may nourish her </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα εκε τρεφωσιν αυτην</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the present for continued action: active subjunctive according to A P though C reads <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρεφουσιν</span></span>, present active indicative, as is possible also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:17">Revelation 13:17</span> and certainly so in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:20">1 John 5:20</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 984), a solecism in late vernacular Greek. The plural is indefinite "they" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:11">Revelation 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:9">Revelation 11:9</span>. One MSS. has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρεφετα</span></span> (is nourished). The stereotyped phrase occurs here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:2">Revelation 11:2</span>, for the length of the dragon's power, repeated in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:14">Revelation 12:14</span> in more general terms and again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:5">Revelation 13:5</span>. </p>
