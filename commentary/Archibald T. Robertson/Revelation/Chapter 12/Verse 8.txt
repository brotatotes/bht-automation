<p><b> And they prevailed not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκ ισχυσαν</span></span>). Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> equals "and yet" or "but." A few MSS. read the singular <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυσεν</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επολεμησεν</span></span>, but wrongly so.</p>
<p><b>Neither was their place found any more </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδε τοπος ευρεθη αυτων ετ</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκω</span></span>, to find. Probably <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτων</span></span> is the objective genitive (place for them), just as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:11">Revelation 20:11</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοις</span></span> (dative, for them) is used with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοπος ουχ ευρεθη</span></span>. The phrase occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+2:35">Daniel 2:35</span> Theod. and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+10:10">Zechariah 10:10</span>. The dragon is finally expelled from heaven (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+1:6">Job 1:6</span>), though to us it seems a difficult conception to think of Satan having had access to heaven. </p>
