<p><b> He stood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσταθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span> (intransitive), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:3">Revelation 8:3</span>. "He stopped" on his way to war with the rest of the woman's seed. P Q read here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσταθην</span></span> (I stood) when it has to be connected with chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:13">Revelation 13:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>Upon the sand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ την αμμον</span></span>). The accusative case as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:1">Revelation 7:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:3">Revelation 8:3</span>, etc. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αμμος</span></span> is an old word for sand, for innumerable multitude in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:8">Revelation 20:8</span>. </p>
<p><b> Out of the sea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ της θαλασσης</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:7">Revelation 11:7</span> for "the beast coming up out of the abyss." The imagery comes from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:3">Daniel 7:3</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>. This "wild beast from the sea," as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:17">Daniel 7:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:23">Daniel 7:23</span>, is a vast empire used in the interest of brute force. This beast, like the dragon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:3">Revelation 12:3</span>), has ten horns and seven heads, but the horns are crowned, not the heads. The Roman Empire seems to be meant here (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:9">Revelation 17:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:12">Revelation 17:12</span>). On "diadems" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαδηματα</span></span>) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:3">Revelation 12:3</span>, only ten here, not seven as there.</p>
<p><b>Names of blasphemy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονοματα βλασφημιας</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:3">Revelation 17:3</span> for this same phrase. The meaning is made plain by the blasphemous titles assumed by the Roman emperors in the first and second centuries, as shown by the inscriptions in Ephesus, which have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span> constantly applied to them. </p>
