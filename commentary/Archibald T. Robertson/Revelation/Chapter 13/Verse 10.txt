 If any man is for captivity  (ε τις εις αιχμαλωσιαν). Condition of first class, but with no copula (εστιν) expressed. For αιχμαλωσιαν (from αιχμαλωτος captive) see Ephesians 4:8, only other N.T. example. Apparently John means this as a warning to the Christians not to resist force with force, but to accept captivity as he had done as a means of grace. Cf. Jeremiah 15:2. The text is not certain, however.If any man shall kill with the sword  (ε τις εν μαχαιρη αποκτενε). First-class condition with future active of αποκτεινω, not future passive, for it is a picture of the persecutor drawn here like that by Jesus in Matthew 26:52.Must he be killed  (δε αυτον εν μαχαιρη αποκτανθηνα). First aorist passive infinitive of αποκτεινω. The inevitable conclusion (δε) of such conduct. The killer is killed.Here  (ωδε). In this attitude of submission to the inevitable. For ωδε see Revelation 13:18; Revelation 14:12; Revelation 17:9. "Faith" (πιστις) here is more like faithfulness, fidelity.
