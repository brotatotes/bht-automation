<p><b> If any man is for captivity </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τις εις αιχμαλωσιαν</span></span>). Condition of first class, but with no copula (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span>) expressed. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιχμαλωσιαν</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιχμαλωτος</span></span> captive) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:8">Ephesians 4:8</span>, only other N.T. example. Apparently John means this as a warning to the Christians not to resist force with force, but to accept captivity as he had done as a means of grace. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+15:2">Jeremiah 15:2</span>. The text is not certain, however.</p>
<p><b>If any man shall kill with the sword </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τις εν μαχαιρη αποκτενε</span></span>). First-class condition with future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκτεινω</span></span>, not future passive, for it is a picture of the persecutor drawn here like that by Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:52">Matthew 26:52</span>.</p>
<p><b>Must he be killed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε αυτον εν μαχαιρη αποκτανθηνα</span></span>). First aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκτεινω</span></span>. The inevitable conclusion (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>) of such conduct. The killer is killed.</p>
<p><b>Here </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωδε</span></span>). In this attitude of submission to the inevitable. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωδε</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:18">Revelation 13:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:12">Revelation 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:9">Revelation 17:9</span>. "Faith" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span>) here is more like faithfulness, fidelity. </p>
