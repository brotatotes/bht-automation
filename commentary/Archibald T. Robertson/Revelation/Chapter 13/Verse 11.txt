<p><b> Another beast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλο θηριον</span></span>). Like the first beast (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>), not a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετερον θηριον</span></span> (a different beast).</p>
<p><b>Out of the earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ της γης</span></span>). Not "out of the sea" as the first (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>), perhaps locating him in Asia Minor without world-wide scope, but plainly the agent of the first beast and so of the dragon.</p>
<p><b>He had </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειχεν</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>. Only two horns (not ten like the first, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>Like unto a lamb </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοια αρνιω</span></span>). Usual construction. Only the two horns of a young lamb and without the ferocity of the other beast, but "he spake as a dragon" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαλε ως δρακων</span></span>). Gunkel and Charles confess their inability to make anything out of this item. But Swete thinks that he had the roar of a dragon with all the looks of a lamb (weakness and innocence). Cf. the wolves in sheep's clothing (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:15">Matthew 7:15</span>). </p>
