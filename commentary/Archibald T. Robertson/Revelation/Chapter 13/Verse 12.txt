<p><b> He exerciseth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιε</span></span>). Present active dramatic present of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>. In his sight (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωπιον αυτου</span></span>). In the eye of the first beast who gets his authority from the dragon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:2">Revelation 13:2</span>). The second beast carries on the succession of authority from the dragon and the first beast. It has been a common Protestant interpretation since the Reformation of Luther to see in the first beast Pagan Rome and in the second beast Papal Rome. There is undoubted verisimilitude in this interpretation, but it is more than doubtful if any such view comes within the horizon of the imagery here. Ramsay takes the first beast to be the power of imperial Rome and the second beast to be the provincial power which imitated Rome in the persecutions.</p>
<p><b>To worship the first beast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα προσκυνησουσιν το θηριον το πρωτον</span></span>). Sub-final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιε</span></span> seen in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:37">John 11:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:16">Colossians 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span>, usually with the subjunctive, but here with the future indicative as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span>. Note the accusative after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνεω</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span>. Here the death-stroke of one of the heads (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:3">Revelation 13:3</span>) is ascribed to the beast. Clearly the delegated authority of the provincial priests of the emperor-worship is rigorously enforced, if this is the correct interpretation. </p>
