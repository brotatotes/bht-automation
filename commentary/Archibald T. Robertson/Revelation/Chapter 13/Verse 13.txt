<p><b> That he should even make fire come down out of heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα κα πυρ ποιη εκ του ουρανου καταβαινειν</span></span>). Purpose clause again with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span> and the object infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβαινω</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιε</span></span>. Christ promised great signs to the disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:12">John 14:12</span>), but he also warned them against false prophets and false christs with their signs and wonders (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:22">Mark 13:22</span>). So also Paul had pictured the power of the man of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:9">2 Thessalonians 2:9</span>). Elijah had called down fire from heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:38">1 Kings 18:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+1:10">2 Kings 1:10</span>) and James and John had once even urged Jesus to do this miracle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:54">Luke 9:54</span>). </p>
