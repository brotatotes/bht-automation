<p><b> And he deceiveth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα πλανα</span></span>). Present active (dramatic) indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλαναω</span></span>, the very thing that Jesus had said would happen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>, "So as to lead astray" <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε πλανασθα</span></span>, the word used here, if possible the very elect). It is a constant cause for wonder, the gullibility of the public at the hands of new charlatans who continually bob up with their pipe-dreams.</p>
<p><b>That they should make an image to the beast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησα εικονα τω θηριω</span></span>). Indirect command (this first aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγων</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:21">Acts 21:21</span>, not indirect assertion. This "image" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εικων</span></span>, for which word see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:20">Matthew 22:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>) of the emperor could be his head upon a coin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:16">Mark 12:16</span>), an <i>imago</i> painted or woven upon a standard, a bust in metal or stone, a statue, anything that people could be asked to bow down before and worship. This test the priests in the provinces pressed as it was done in Rome itself. The phrase "the image of the beast," occurs ten times in this book (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:15">Revelation 13:15</span> <i>ter</i>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:9">Revelation 14:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:11">Revelation 14:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+15:2">Revelation 15:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:2">Revelation 16:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>). Emperor-worship is the issue and that involves worship of the devil.</p>
<p><b>The stroke of the sword </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την πληγην της μαχαιρης</span></span>). This language can refer to the death of Nero by his own sword.</p>
<p><b>And lived </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εζησεν</span></span>). "And he came to life" (ingressive first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζαω</span></span>). Perhaps a reference to Domitian as a second Nero in his persecution of Christians. </p>
