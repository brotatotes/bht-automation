<p><b> To give breath to it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουνα πνευμα αυτη</span></span>). This second beast, probably a system like the first (not a mere person), was endowed with the power to work magical tricks, as was true of Simon Magus and Apollonius of Tyana and many workers of legerdemain since. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πνευμα</span></span> here has its original meaning of breath or wind like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα ζωης</span></span> (breath of life) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:11">Revelation 11:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>Even to the image </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εικον</span></span>). No "even" in the Greek, just apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτη</span></span> (her).</p>
<p><b>That should both speak and cause </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα κα λαληση κα ποιηση</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαλεω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>. Ventriloquism like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:16">Acts 16:16</span>.</p>
<p><b>That should be killed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα αποκτανθωσιν</span></span>). Sub-final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκτεινω</span></span>, after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιηση</span></span>, as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:12">Revelation 13:12</span> (future indicative).</p>
<p><b>As many as should not worship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσο εαν μη προσκυνησωσιν</span></span>). Indefinite relative clause with modal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> (= <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span>) and the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνεω</span></span> with the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την εικονα</span></span> (some MSS. the dative). Note the triple use of "the image of the beast" in this sentence. "That refusal to worship the image of the emperor carried with it capital punishment in Trajan's time is clear from Pliny's letter to Trajan (X. 96)" (Charles). </p>
