<p><b>A mark </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαραγμα</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρασσω</span></span>, to engrave, in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:29">Acts 17:29</span> of idolatrous images, but in Rev.

Deissmann (<i>Bible Studies</i>, pp. 240ff.) shows that in the papyri official business documents often have the name and image of the emperor, with the date as the official stamp or seal and with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαραγμα</span></span> as the name of this seal. Animals and slaves were often branded with the owner's name, as Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:17">Galatians 6:17</span>) bore the stigmata of Christ. Ptolemy Philadelphus compelled some Alexandrian Jews to receive the mark of Dionysus as his devotees (III Macc. 3:29). The servants of God receive on their foreheads the stamp of the divine seal (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:3">Revelation 7:3</span>). Charles is certain that John gets his metaphor from the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεφιλλιν</span></span> (phylacteries) which the Jew wore on his left hand and on his forehead. At any rate, this "mark of the beast" was necessary for life and all social and business relations. On the right hand, that is in plain sight.</p>
<p><b>Upon their forehead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ το μετωπον αυτων</span></span>). Accusative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>, though genitive just before with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χειρος</span></span> (hand).
