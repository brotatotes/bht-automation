 He causeth all  (same use of ποιεω as in Revelation 13:12; Revelation 13:15). Note article here with each class (the small and the great, etc.).That there be given them  (ινα δωσιν αυτοις). Same use of ινα after ποιεω as in Revelation 13:12; Revelation 13:15, only here with indefinite plural δωσιν (second aorist active subjunctive), "that they give themselves," as in Revelation 10:11; Revelation 12:6; Revelation 16:15.A mark  (χαραγμα). Old word from χαρασσω, to engrave, in Acts 17:29 of idolatrous images, but in Rev. (Revelation 13:16; Revelation 13:17; Revelation 14:9; Revelation 14:11; Revelation 16:2; Revelation 19:20; Revelation 20:4) of the brand of the beast on the right hand or on the forehead or on both. Deissmann (Bible Studies, pp. 240ff.) shows that in the papyri official business documents often have the name and image of the emperor, with the date as the official stamp or seal and with χαραγμα as the name of this seal. Animals and slaves were often branded with the owner's name, as Paul (Galatians 6:17) bore the stigmata of Christ. Ptolemy Philadelphus compelled some Alexandrian Jews to receive the mark of Dionysus as his devotees (III Macc. 3:29). The servants of God receive on their foreheads the stamp of the divine seal (Revelation 7:3). Charles is certain that John gets his metaphor from the τεφιλλιν (phylacteries) which the Jew wore on his left hand and on his forehead. At any rate, this "mark of the beast" was necessary for life and all social and business relations. On the right hand, that is in plain sight.Upon their forehead  (επ το μετωπον αυτων). Accusative with επ, though genitive just before with χειρος (hand). See already Revelation 7:3; Revelation 9:4 (genitive επ των μετωπων). Only in the Apocalypse in N.T.
