<p><b> That no man should be able to buy or to sell </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη τις δυνητα αγορασα η πωλησα</span></span>). Final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and present middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμα</span></span> with aorist active infinitives. This is a regular boycott (Ramsay, <i>Seven Letters</i>, p. 106f.) against all not worshippers of the emperor.</p>
<p><b>Save </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη</span></span>). "If not," "except."</p>
<p><b>Even the name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ονομα</span></span>). No "even," just apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαραγμα</span></span> (the mark).</p>
<p><b>Or the number </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η τον αριθμον</span></span>). The stamp (the mark) may bear either the name or the number of the beast. The name and the number are one and the same. They could write the name in numerals, for numbers were given by letters. Swete suggests that it was "according to a sort of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεματρια</span></span> known to the Apocalyptist and his Asian readers, but not generally intelligible." </p>
