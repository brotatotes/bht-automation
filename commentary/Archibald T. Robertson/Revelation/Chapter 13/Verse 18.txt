<p><b> Here is wisdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωδε η σοφια</span></span>). The puzzle that follows as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:9">Revelation 17:9</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span> for "a spirit of wisdom and of understanding."</p>
<p><b>He that understands </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εχων νουν</span></span>). "The one having intelligence" in such matters. Cf. the adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουνεχως</span></span> (discreetly) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:34">Mark 12:34</span>.</p>
<p><b>Let him count </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψηφισατω</span></span>). First active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψηφιζω</span></span>, old verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψηφος</span></span> pebble), to count, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:28">Luke 14:28</span>.</p>
<p><b>The number of a man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αριθμος ανθρωπου</span></span>). "A man's number." But what man and what name?</p>
<p><b>Six hundred and sixty-six </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξακοσιο εξηκοντα εξ</span></span>). Unfortunately some MSS. here read 616 instead of 666. All sorts of solutions are offered for this conundrum. Charles is satisfied with the Hebrew letters for Nero Caesar, which give 666, and with the Latin form of Nero (without the final n), which makes 616. Surely this is ingenious and it may be correct. But who can really tell? </p>
