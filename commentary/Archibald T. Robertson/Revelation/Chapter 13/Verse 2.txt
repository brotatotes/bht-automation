<p><b> Like unto a leopard </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιον παρδαλε</span></span>). Associative-instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρδαλις</span></span>, old word for panther, leopard, here only in N.T. The leopard (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεο, παρδ</span></span>) was considered a cross between a panther and a lioness.</p>
<p><b>As the feet of a bear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως αρκου</span></span>). Old word, also spelled <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρκτος</span></span>, here only in N.T. From <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:4">Daniel 7:4</span>. No word in the Greek for "feet" before "bear."</p>
<p><b>As the mouth of a lion </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως στομα λεοντος</span></span>). From <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:4">Daniel 7:4</span>. This beast combines features of the first three beasts in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:2">Daniel 7:2</span>. The strength and brutality of the Babylonian, Median, and Persian empires appeared in the Roman Empire. The catlike vigilance of the leopard, the slow and crushing power of the bear, and the roar of the lion were all familiar features to the shepherds in Palestine (Swete).</p>
<p><b>The dragon gave him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκεν αυτω ο δρακων</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span> (to give) and dative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span> (the beast). The dragon works through this beast. The beast is simply Satan's agent. Satan claimed this power to Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:9">Matthew 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:6">Luke 4:6</span>) and Christ called Satan the prince of this world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:31">John 12:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:30">John 14:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:11">John 16:11</span>). So the war is on. </p>
