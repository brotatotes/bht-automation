<p><b> And I saw </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>). No verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον</span></span>) in the old MSS., but clearly understood from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:2">Revelation 13:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>As though it had been smitten </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως εσφαγμενην</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφαζω</span></span>, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>, accusative singular agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιαν</span></span> (one of the heads), object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον</span></span> understood, "as though slain" (so the word means in seven other instances in the book). There is a reference to the death and new life of the Lamb in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>And his death-stroke was healed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα η πληγη αυτου εθεραπευθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεραπευω</span></span>. "The stroke of death" (that led to death). Apparently refers to the death of Nero in June 68 A.D. by his own hand. But after his death pretenders arose claiming to be Nero <i>redivivus</i> even as late as 89 (Tacitus, <i>Hist</i>. i. 78, ii. 8, etc.). John seems to regard Domitian as Nero over again in the persecutions carried on by him. The distinction is not always preserved between the beast (Roman Empire) and the seven heads (emperors), but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:10">Revelation 17:10</span> the beast survives the loss of five heads. Here it is the death-stroke of one head, while in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:12">Revelation 13:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span> the beast himself receives a mortal wound.</p>
<p><b>Wondered after the beast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθαυμασθη οπισω του θηριου</span></span>). First aorist passive (deponent) indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαυμαζω</span></span>, to wonder at, to admire, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>. For this pregnant use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπισω</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:9">John 12:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:37">Acts 5:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:30">Acts 20:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:15">1 Timothy 5:15</span>. "All the earth wondered at and followed after the beast," that is Antichrist as represented by Domitian as Nero <i>redivivus</i>. But Charles champions the view that Caligula, not Nero, is the head that received the death-stroke and recovered and set up statues of himself for worship, even trying to do it in Jerusalem. </p>
