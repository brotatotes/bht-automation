 They worshipped the dragon  (προσεκυνησαν τω δρακοντ). First aorist active indicative of προσκυνεω, with dative case δρακοντ (from δρακων). They really worshipped Satan (the dragon) when "they worshipped the beast" (προσεκυνησαν τω θηριω) or any one of the heads (like Caligula, Nero, Domitian) of the beast. The beast is merely the tool of the devil for worship. Recall the fact that the devil even proposed that Jesus worship him. Emperor-worship, like all idolatry, was devil-worship. The same thing is true today about self-worship (humanism or any other form of it).Who is like unto the beast?  (τις ομοιος τω θηριωι;). Associative-instrumental case after ομοιος. An echo, perhaps parody, of like language about God in Exodus 15:11; Psalms 35:10; Psalms 113:5. "The worship of such a monster as Nero was indeed a travesty of the worship of God" (Swete).And who is able to war with him?  (κα τις δυνατα πολεμησα μετ' αυτου;). Worship of the devil and the devil's agent is justified purely on the ground of brute force. It is the doctrine of Nietzsche that might makes right.
