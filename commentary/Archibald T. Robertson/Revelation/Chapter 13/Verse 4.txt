<p><b> They worshipped the dragon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεκυνησαν τω δρακοντ</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνεω</span></span>, with dative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δρακοντ</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δρακων</span></span>). They really worshipped Satan (the dragon) when "they worshipped the beast" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσεκυνησαν τω θηριω</span></span>) or any one of the heads (like Caligula, Nero, Domitian) of the beast. The beast is merely the tool of the devil for worship. Recall the fact that the devil even proposed that Jesus worship him. Emperor-worship, like all idolatry, was devil-worship. The same thing is true today about self-worship (humanism or any other form of it).</p>
<p><b>Who is like unto the beast? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις ομοιος τω θηριωι;</span></span>). Associative-instrumental case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιος</span></span>. An echo, perhaps parody, of like language about God in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:11">Exodus 15:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+35:10">Psalms 35:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+113:5">Psalms 113:5</span>. "The worship of such a monster as Nero was indeed a travesty of the worship of God" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>And who is able to war with him? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τις δυνατα πολεμησα μετ' αυτου;</span></span>). Worship of the devil and the devil's agent is justified purely on the ground of brute force. It is the doctrine of Nietzsche that might makes right. </p>
