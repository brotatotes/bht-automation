<p><b> To make war with the saints and to overcome them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησα πολεμον μετα των αγιων κα νικησα αυτους</span></span>). This clause with two epexegetical first aorist active infinitives (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολεμησα</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νικησα</span></span>) is omitted in A C P, but probably by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοεοτελευτον</span></span> (like ending) because of the repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοθη</span></span>. The words seem to come from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:21">Daniel 7:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:23">Daniel 7:23</span>. There was no escape from the beast's rule in the Mediterranean world. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span> for the phrases here used, there for praise to the Lamb. </p>
