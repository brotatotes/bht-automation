 To make war with the saints and to overcome them  (ποιησα πολεμον μετα των αγιων κα νικησα αυτους). This clause with two epexegetical first aorist active infinitives (πολεμησα and νικησα) is omitted in A C P, but probably by ομοεοτελευτον (like ending) because of the repetition of εδοθη. The words seem to come from Daniel 7:21; Daniel 7:23. There was no escape from the beast's rule in the Mediterranean world. See Revelation 5:9 for the phrases here used, there for praise to the Lamb.
