 The Lamb  (το αρνιον). See Revelation 5:6; Revelation 7:17; Revelation 12:11; Revelation 13:8 and is in contrast with the anarthrous αρνιον in Revelation 13:11. This proleptic vision of the Lamb "standing on the mount Zion" (εστος επ το ορος Σιων, second perfect active participle neuter of ιστημ with επ and accusative) is reasoning after the visions of the two beasts. Mount Zion is the site of the new city of God (Hebrews 12:22), the Jerusalem above (Galatians 4:26), the seat of the Messianic Kingdom whether heaven or the new earth (Revelation 14:21; Revelation 14:22). These victors have the name of the Lamb and God upon their foreheads as in Revelation 3:12; Revelation 22:4, in place of the mark of the beast above (Revelation 13:16; Revelation 14:11). This seal protects them (Revelation 9:4).A hundred and forty and four thousand  (εκατον τεσσερακοντα τεσσαρες χιλιαδες). "Thousands" literally (χιλιας feminine word for a thousand and so εχουσα feminine plural). For the 144,000 see Revelation 7:5; Revelation 7:8, though some scholars seek a distinction somehow.
