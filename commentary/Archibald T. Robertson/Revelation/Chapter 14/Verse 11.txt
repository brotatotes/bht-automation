 The smoke of their torment  (ο καπνος του βασανισμου αυτων). See Revelation 9:5 for βασανισμος, only there it was a limited penalty, here it is "for ever and ever" (εις αιωνας αιωνων, unto ages of ages). See also Revelation 18:9; Revelation 19:3; Revelation 20:10.They have no rest  (ουκ εχουσιν αναπαυσιν). The very language used in Revelation 4:8 of the four living creatures in praising God. "Those who desert Christ for Caesar will be the victims of a remorse that never dies or sleeps" (Swete). The rest of the verse repeats the solemn challenge of verse Revelation 14:9.
