<p><b> The smoke of their torment </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο καπνος του βασανισμου αυτων</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:5">Revelation 9:5</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασανισμος</span></span>, only there it was a limited penalty, here it is "for ever and ever" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις αιωνας αιωνων</span></span>, unto ages of ages). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:9">Revelation 18:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:3">Revelation 19:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span>.</p>
<p><b>They have no rest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εχουσιν αναπαυσιν</span></span>). The very language used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:8">Revelation 4:8</span> of the four living creatures in praising God. "Those who desert Christ for Caesar will be the victims of a remorse that never dies or sleeps" (Swete). The rest of the verse repeats the solemn challenge of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:9">Revelation 14:9</span>. </p>
