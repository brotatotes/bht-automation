<p><b> Write </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γραψον</span></span>). First aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:11">Revelation 1:11</span>. John's meditation is broken by this command. This new beatitude (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακαριο</span></span>, Blessed) for the Christian dead goes farther than Paul's words (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:14-16">1 Thessalonians 4:14-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:18">1 Corinthians 15:18</span>). Probably "from henceforth" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απ' αρτ</span></span>) goes with "those who die in the Lord," giving comfort to those facing persecution and death.</p>
<p><b>That they may rest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα αναπαησοντα</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the second future passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπαυω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>From their labours </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ των κοπων αυτων</span></span>). From the toils, the wearinesses, but not from the activities (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εργα</span></span>), for these "follow with them." There is this to comfort us for all our growth here. Even if cut short, it can be utilized in heaven, which is not a place of idleness, but of the highest form of spiritual service. </p>
