 Write  (Γραψον). First aorist active imperative of γραφω as in Revelation 1:11. John's meditation is broken by this command. This new beatitude (μακαριο, Blessed) for the Christian dead goes farther than Paul's words (1 Thessalonians 4:14-16; 1 Corinthians 15:18). Probably "from henceforth" (απ' αρτ) goes with "those who die in the Lord," giving comfort to those facing persecution and death.That they may rest  (ινα αναπαησοντα). Purpose clause with ινα and the second future passive of αναπαυω.From their labours  (εκ των κοπων αυτων). From the toils, the wearinesses, but not from the activities (εργα), for these "follow with them." There is this to comfort us for all our growth here. Even if cut short, it can be utilized in heaven, which is not a place of idleness, but of the highest form of spiritual service.
