 A white cloud  (νεφελη λευκη). Like the "bright cloud" of Matthew 17:5 (Transfiguration), a familiar object in the Mediterranean lands. See Daniel 7:13; Matthew 24:30; Matthew 26:64; Acts 1:9; Acts 1:11 for the picture of Christ's return.I saw one sitting  (καθημενον). No ειδον here, but the accusative follows the ειδον at the beginning, as νεφελη is nominative after ιδου, as in Revelation 4:1; Revelation 4:4.Like unto a son of man  (ομοιον υιον ανθρωπου). Accusative here after ομοιον as in Revelation 1:13, instead of the usual associative instrumental (Revelation 13:4).Having  (εχων). Nominative again after the ιδου construction, just before, not after, ειδον.A golden crown  (στεφανον χρυσουν). Here a golden wreath, not the diadems of Revelation 19:12.A sharp sickle  (δρεπανον οξυ). Old form δρεπανη (from δρεπω, to pluck), pruning-hook, in N.T. only in this chapter and Mark 4:29. Christ is come for reaping this time (Hebrews 9:28) for the harvesting of earth (verses Revelation 14:15-17). The priesthood of Christ is the chief idea in Revelation 1:12-20 and "as the true Imperator" (Swete) in chapter Revelation 14:19.
