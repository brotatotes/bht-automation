<p><b> Was trodden </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επατηθη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατεω</span></span>, to tread. The image of treading out the grapes is a familiar one in the East. Perhaps <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:3">Isaiah 63:3</span> is in mind.</p>
<p><b>Without the city </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξωθεν της πολεως</span></span>). Ablative case with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξωθεν</span></span> (like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξω</span></span>). This was the usual place (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:12">Hebrews 13:12</span>). See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξωθεν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:2">Revelation 11:2</span>. Joel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joe+3:12">Joel 3:12</span>) pictures the valley of Jehoshaphat as the place of the slaughter of God's enemies. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:4">Zechariah 14:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>Blood from the winepress </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιμα εκ της ληνου</span></span>). Bold imagery suggested by the colour of the grapes.</p>
<p><b>Unto the bridles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ των χαλινων</span></span>). Old word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαλαω</span></span> to slacken), in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:3">James 3:3</span>. Bold picture.</p>
<p><b>As far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο σταδιων χιλιων εξακοσιων</span></span>). A peculiar use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>, for "distance from (of)" as also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:18">John 11:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:8">John 21:8</span>, somewhat like the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span>. The distance itself covers the length of Palestine, but it is more likely that "the metaphor is worked out with the exuberance of apocalyptic symbolism" (Swete) for the whole earth. </p>
