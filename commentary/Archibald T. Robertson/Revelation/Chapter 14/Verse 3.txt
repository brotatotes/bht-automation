<p><b> They sing as it were a new song </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιδουσιν ως ωιδην καινην</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span> for this phrase (cognate accusative) save that here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> (as if) is added. There the new song was sung by the four living creatures and the elders, but here "before" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενωπιον</span></span>) them and so apparently by the throng who were themselves redeemed by the Lamb.</p>
<p><b>No man could learn the song save </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεις εδυνατο μαθειν την ωιδην ε μη</span></span>). Imperfect (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδυνατο</span></span>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμα</span></span> and second aorist (ingressive) active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μανθανω</span></span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9-12">Revelation 5:9-12</span> the angels join in the song. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+15:3">Revelation 15:3</span> it is the Song of Moses and the Lamb.</p>
<p><b>Even they that had been purchased out of the earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ηγορασμενο απο της γης</span></span>). Perfect passive articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγοραζω</span></span>, purchased by the blood of the Lamb (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span>), masculine plural in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χιλιαδες</span></span> (thousands) feminine plural (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:5">Revelation 7:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:8">Revelation 7:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Απο</span></span> (from) here, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> (out of) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span>. The 144,000 are not yet separated from the earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span>). Whether the 144,000 here are identical with that number in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:4-8">Revelation 7:4-8</span> or not, they must embrace both men and women. </p>
