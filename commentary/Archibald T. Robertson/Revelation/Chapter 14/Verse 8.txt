<p><b> Another, a second angel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλος δευτερος αγγελος</span></span>). This second angel "followed" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκολουθησεν</span></span>, first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακολουθεω</span></span>) and interpreted in part the first one.</p>
<p><b>Fallen, fallen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεσεν, επεσεν</span></span>). Prophetic aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιπτω</span></span>, repeated as a solemn dirge announcing the certainty of the fall. The English participle "fallen, fallen" is more musical and rhythmical than the literal rendering "fell, fell." The language is an echo of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+21:9">Isaiah 21:9</span>, though B in the LXX has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπτωκεν, πεπτωκεν</span></span> (perfect).</p>
<p><b>Babylon the great </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βαβυλων η μαγαλη</span></span>). The adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγαλη</span></span> occurs with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βαβυλων</span></span> each time in the Apocalypse (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:19">Revelation 16:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:5">Revelation 17:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:2">Revelation 18:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:10">Revelation 18:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:21">Revelation 18:21</span>) as a reminder of Nebuchadrezzar. There is no doubt that Rome is meant by Babylon, as is probably seen already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:13">1 Peter 5:13</span>. As a prisoner in Patmos John can speak his mind by this symbolism.</p>
<p><b>Hath made to drink </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεποτικεν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποτιζω</span></span>, old causative verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποτος</span></span> drinking, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:3">1 Peter 4:3</span>), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:35">Matthew 25:35</span>. The remarkable phrase that follows seems based on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:8">Jeremiah 51:8</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+25:15">Jeremiah 25:15</span>). It is a combination also of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:10">Revelation 14:10</span> (the wine of God's wrath, also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:19">Revelation 16:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:15">Revelation 19:15</span>) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:2">Revelation 17:2</span>. There is no doubt of the dissoluteness of the old Babylon of Jeremiah's day as of the Rome of John's time. Rome is pictured as the great courtesan who intoxicates and beguiles the nations to fornication (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:2">Revelation 17:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:4">Revelation 17:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:6">Revelation 17:6</span>), but the cup of God's wrath for her and her paramours is full (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:10">Revelation 14:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:19">Revelation 16:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:2">Revelation 18:2</span>). </p>
