<p><b> A third </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τριτος</span></span>). "The third of this succession of herald angels denounces the Caesar-worshippers" (Swete). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:12">Revelation 13:12</span>. This counter proclamation (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:9-12">Revelation 14:9-12</span>) warns those tempted to yield to the threats of the second beast about boycott and death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:11-17">Revelation 13:11-17</span>).</p>
<p><b>If any man worshippeth the beast and his image </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τις προσκυνε το θηριον κα την εικονα αυτου</span></span>). Condition of first class challenging those afraid of the beast. Note accusative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θηριον</span></span>) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνε</span></span>, not dative as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:7">Revelation 14:7</span>.</p>
<p><b>And receiveth a mark </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα λαμβανε χαραγμα</span></span>). Carries on the same condition and picks up the very language of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:16">Revelation 13:16</span>. These Caesar-worshippers are guilty of an "eternal sin" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:29">Mark 3:29</span>). </p>
