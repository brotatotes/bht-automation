<p><b> Another sign in heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλο σημειον εν τω ουρανω</span></span>). Looking back to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:1">Revelation 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:3">Revelation 12:3</span>, after the series intervening. The Seven Bowls are parallel with the Seven Seals (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+15:6">Revelation 15:6</span>) and the Seven Trumpets (chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+15:8-11">Revelation 15:8-11</span>), but there is an even closer connection with chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+15:12-14">Revelation 15:12-14</span>, "the drama of the long conflict between the church and the world" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>Great and marvellous </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεγα κα θαυμαστον</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θαυμαστος</span></span> is an old verbal adjective (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαυμαζω</span></span>, to wonder) and is already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>. The wonder extends to the end of this vision or sign (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:21">Revelation 16:21</span>).</p>
<p><b>Seven angels </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγγελους επτα</span></span>). Accusative case in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον</span></span>. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:2">Revelation 8:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>Which are the last </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας εσχατας</span></span>). "Seven plagues the last." As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span>, "the final cycle of such visitations" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>Is finished </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετελεσθη</span></span>). Proleptic prophetic first aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελεω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:7">Revelation 10:7</span>. The number seven seems particularly appropriate here for finality and completeness. </p>
