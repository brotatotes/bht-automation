 As it were a glassy sea  (ως θαλασσαν υαλινην). Accusative case after ειδον and ως here, not in Revelation 4:6, which see for the symbol.Mingled with fire  (μεμιγμενην πυρ). Perfect passive participle of μιγνυμ, to mix, and the associative instrumental case πυρ. This item not in Revelation 4:6 (a vision of peace), but here it adds to the splendour of the vision. This parenthesis (Revelation 15:2-4) gives a picture of the martyrs in their state of bliss.Them that come off victorious  (τους νικωντας). Present active articular participle of νικαω, accusative after ειδον, "those that come off victorious" (Revelation 14:4).From the beast and from his image  (εκ του θηριου κα εκ της εικονος αυτου). This use of εκ after νικαω is unusual, also with εκ του αριθμου. For these items see Revelation 13:1; Revelation 13:14; Revelation 13:17; Revelation 14:9; Revelation 14:11; Revelation 19:20; Revelation 20:4.By the glassy sea  (επ την θαλασσαν την υαλινην). Or "upon" more likely (Revelation 4:6) with the accusative as in Matthew 14:25.Harps of God  (κιθαρας του θεου). Objective genitive, for the worship of God (Revelation 5:8; Revelation 14:2; 1 Chronicles 16:42).
