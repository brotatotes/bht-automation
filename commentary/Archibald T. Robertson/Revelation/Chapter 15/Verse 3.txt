 The song of Moses  (την ωιδην του Μωυσεως). Exodus 14:31; Exodus 15:1-19. A song of victory like that of Moses after crossing the Red Sea.And the song of the Lamb  (την ωιδην του αρνιου). A separate note of victory like that of Moses, though one song, not two. Charles finds it impossible to reconcile the two expressions, if genuine, but it is a needless objection. The words come from the O.T.: "great" (μεγαλα) from Psalms 111:2, "wonderful" (θαυμαστα) from Psalms 139:14, "O Lord God the Almighty" (Κυριε ο θεος ο παντοκρατωρ) from Amos 4:13 (Revelation 4:8), "righteous and true" (δικαια κα αληθινα) from Deuteronomy 32:4, "Thou King of the ages" (ο βασιλευς των αιωνων) like Jeremiah 10:10; 1 Timothy 1:17. Some MSS. have "the king of the saints" and some "the king of the nations," like Jeremiah 10:7. John thus combines in Hebraic tone the expressions of the old and the new in the song to the Glorified Messiah.
