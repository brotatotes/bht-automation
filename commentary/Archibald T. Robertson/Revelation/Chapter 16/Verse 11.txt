<p><b> They blasphemed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβλασφημησαν</span></span>)</p>
<p><b>and they repented not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ου μετενοησαν</span></span>). Precisely as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:9">Revelation 16:9</span>, which see. Not just because of the supernatural darkness, but also "because of their pains" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ των πονων αυτων</span></span>, plural here and same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>) and their sores (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εκ των ελκων αυτων</span></span>, as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:2">Revelation 16:2</span>, only plural, and same use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Of their works </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ των εργων αυτων</span></span>). "Out of their deeds," and addition to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:9">Revelation 16:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>The God of heaven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον θεον του ουρανου</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+2:44">Daniel 2:44</span>. Like the pride of Nebuchadrezzar against Jehovah. </p>
