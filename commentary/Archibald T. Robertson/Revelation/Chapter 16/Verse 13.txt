 Coming out of  (εκ alone, no participle ερχομενα).Of the dragon  (του δρακοντος). That is Satan (Revelation 12:3; Revelation 12:9).Of the beast  (του θηριου). The first beast (Revelation 13:1; Revelation 13:12) and then just the beast (Revelation 13:14; Revelation 14:9; Revelation 14:11; Revelation 15:2; Revelation 16:2; Revelation 16:10), the brute force of the World-power represented by the Roman Empire" (Swete).Of the false prophet  (του ψευδοπροφητου). Cf. Matthew 7:15; Acts 13:6; 1 John 2:22; 1 John 4:3; 2 John 1:7. Identified with the second beast (Revelation 13:11-14) in Revelation 19:20; Revelation 20:10. So the sixth bowl introduces the dragon and his two subalterns of chapters Revelation 16:12; Revelation 16:13 (the two beasts).Three unclean spirits  (πνευματα τρια ακαθαρτα). Out of the mouths of each of the three evil powers (the dragon and the two beasts) comes an evil spirit. See the use of mouth in Revelation 1:16 (Revelation 9:17; Revelation 11:5; Revelation 12:15; Revelation 19:15; Revelation 19:21) as a chief seat of influence. In 2 Thessalonians 2:8 we have "the breath of his mouth" (the other sense of πνευμα). For ακαθαρτον (unclean) with πνευμα see Mark 1:23; Mark 3:11; Mark 5:2; Acts 5:16; Acts 8:7. Christ expelled unclean spirits, but His enemies send them forth" (Swete). See Zechariah 13:2 "the false prophets and the unclean spirits."As it were frogs  (ως βατραχο). Cf. Exodus 8:5; Leviticus 11:10. Old word, here alone in N.T. Like loathsome frogs in form.
