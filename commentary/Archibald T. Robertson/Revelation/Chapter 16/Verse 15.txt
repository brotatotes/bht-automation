 Behold, I come as a thief  (ιδου ερχομα ως κλεπτης). The voice of Christ breaks in with the same metaphor as in Revelation 3:3, which see. There comes one of seven beatitudes in Rev. (Revelation 1:3; Revelation 14:13; Revelation 16:15; Revelation 19:9; Revelation 20:6; Revelation 22:7; Revelation 22:14). For γρηγορων (watching) see Revelation 3:2, and for τηρων (keeping), Revelation 1:3.Lest he walk naked  (ινα μη γυμνος περιπατη). Negative purpose clause with ινα μη and the present active subjunctive of περιπατεω, and note predicate nominative γυμνος (naked).And they see his shame  (κα βλεπωσιν την ασχημοσυνην αυτου). Continuation of the final clause with present active subjunctive of βλεπω. Ασχημοσυνην is old word (from ασχημων, indecent, 1 Corinthians 12:23), in N.T. only here and Romans 1:27, a euphemism for την αισχυνην (Revelation 3:18).
