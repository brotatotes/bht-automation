 Upon the air  (επ τον αερα). All men breathe the air and this is worse than the smiting of the earth (verse Revelation 16:2), the sea (Revelation 16:3), the fresh waters (Revelation 16:4), the sun (Revelation 16:8).A great voice  (φωνη μεγαλη). The voice of God as in Revelation 16:1.It is done  (Γεγονεν). Perfect active indicative of γινομα. Like Γεγοναν in Revelation 21:6. The whole series of plagues is now complete.
