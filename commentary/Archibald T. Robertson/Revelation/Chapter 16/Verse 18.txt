 And there were  (κα εγενοντο). "And there came" (same verb ginomai). See Revelation 8:5; Revelation 11:19 for this list of terrible sounds and lightnings, and for the great earthquake (σεισμος μεγας) see Revelation 6:12; Revelation 11:13 (cf. Luke 21:11).Such as was not  (οιος ουκ εγενετο). Qualitative relative with γινομα again, "such as came not."Since there were men  (αφ' ου ανθρωπο εγενοντο). "Since which time (χρονου understood) men came."So great an earthquake, so mighty  (τηλικουτος σεισμος ουτω μεγας). Quantitative correlative τηλικουτος rather than the qualitative τοιουτος, to correspond with οιος (not οσος). And then ουτω μεγας repeats (redundant) τηλικουτος. Cf. Mark 13:19 for οια--τοιαυτη about like tribulation (θλιψις).
