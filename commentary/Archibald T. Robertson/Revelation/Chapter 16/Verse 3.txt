<p><b> Into the sea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την θαλασσαν</span></span>). Like the first Egyptian plague (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:12-41">Exodus 7:12-41</span>) though only the Nile affected then.</p>
<p><b>Blood as of a dead man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιμα ως νεκρου</span></span>). At the trumpet (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:11">Revelation 8:11</span>) the water becomes wormwood. Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως νεκρου</span></span> is added to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:19">Exodus 7:19</span>, "the picture of a murdered man weltering in his blood" (Swete). "Coagulated blood, fatal to animal life" (Moffatt).</p>
<p><b>Every living soul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασα ψυχη ζωης</span></span>). "Every soul of life" (Hebraism, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:21">Genesis 1:21</span>, marked by life).</p>
<p><b>Even the things that were in the sea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα εν τη θαλασση</span></span>). "The things in the sea," in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span>. Complete destruction, not partial as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:9">Revelation 8:9</span>. </p>
