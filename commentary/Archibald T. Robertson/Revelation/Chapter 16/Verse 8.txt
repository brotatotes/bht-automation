 Upon the sun  (επ τον ηλιον). Not εις (into) as in verses Revelation 16:2; Revelation 16:3; Revelation 16:4. The fourth trumpet (Revelation 8:12) affected a third of the sun, moon, and stars with a plague of darkness, but here it is a plague of extreme heat.To scorch with fire  (καυματισα εν πυρ). First aorist active infinitive of καυματιζω, late (Plutarch, Epictetus) causative verb (from καυμα, heat), in N.T. only here and verse Revelation 16:9; Matthew 13:6; Mark 4:6. The addition of εν πυρ (in fire, with fire) intensifies the picture.
