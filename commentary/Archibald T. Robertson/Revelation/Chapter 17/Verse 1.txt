<p><b> I will show thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειξω σο</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεικνυμ</span></span>. It is fitting that one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls should explain the judgment on Babylon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:19">Revelation 16:19</span>) already pronounced (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>). That is now done in chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:17">Revelation 17:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:18">Revelation 17:18</span>.</p>
<p><b>The judgment of the great harlot </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το κριμα της πορνης της μεγαλης</span></span>). The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριμα</span></span> is the one used about the doom of Babylon in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:9">Jeremiah 51:9</span>. Already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span> Babylon is called the harlot. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πορνης</span></span> is the objective genitive, "the judgment on the great harlot."</p>
<p><b>That sitteth upon many waters </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της καθημενης επ υδατων πολλων</span></span>). Note triple use of the article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της</span></span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:13">Jeremiah 51:13</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφ' υδασ πολλοις</span></span> (locative in place of genitive as here). Babylon got its wealth by means of the Euphrates and the numerous canals for irrigation. Rome does not have such a system of canals, but this item is taken and applied to the New Babylon in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:15">Revelation 17:15</span>. Nahum (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="na+3:4">Nahum 3:4</span>) calls Nineveh a harlot, as Isaiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+23:16">Isaiah 23:16</span>) does Tyre. </p>
