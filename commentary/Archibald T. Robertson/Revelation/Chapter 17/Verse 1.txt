 I will show thee  (δειξω σο). Future active of δεικνυμ. It is fitting that one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls should explain the judgment on Babylon (Revelation 16:19) already pronounced (Revelation 14:8). That is now done in chapters Revelation 17:17; Revelation 17:18.The judgment of the great harlot  (το κριμα της πορνης της μεγαλης). The word κριμα is the one used about the doom of Babylon in Jeremiah 51:9. Already in Revelation 14:8 Babylon is called the harlot. Πορνης is the objective genitive, "the judgment on the great harlot."That sitteth upon many waters  (της καθημενης επ υδατων πολλων). Note triple use of the article της. In Jeremiah 51:13 we have εφ' υδασ πολλοις (locative in place of genitive as here). Babylon got its wealth by means of the Euphrates and the numerous canals for irrigation. Rome does not have such a system of canals, but this item is taken and applied to the New Babylon in Revelation 17:15. Nahum (Nahum 3:4) calls Nineveh a harlot, as Isaiah (Isaiah 23:16) does Tyre.
