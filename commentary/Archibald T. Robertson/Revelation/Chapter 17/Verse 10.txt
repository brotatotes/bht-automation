<p><b> Seven kings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλεις επτα</span></span>). This is another change in the symbolism. The identification of these seven kings is one of the puzzles of the book.</p>
<p><b>The five are fallen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πεντε επεσαν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιπτω</span></span> with the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-αν</span></span> ending. Common for the downfall of kings (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+29:5">Ezekiel 29:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+30:6">Ezekiel 30:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+21:9">Isaiah 21:9</span>, etc.). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2sa+3:38">2 Samuel 3:38</span>.</p>
<p><b>The one is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εις εστιν</span></span>). The one when this vision is dated.</p>
<p><b>The other is not yet come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αλλος ουπω ηλθεν</span></span>). Prophetic second aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>. Charles takes this as the date of this "source" or part of the Apocalypse. But John could himself have used this language in the time of Domitian even if he was the one who had not yet come. The difficulty about counting these emperors is that Galba, Otho, Vitellius reigned so briefly that they hardly merit being included.</p>
<p><b>When he cometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν ελθη</span></span>). Indefinite temporal clause for the future, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> and the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, "whenever he comes."</p>
<p><b>He must continue a little while </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ολιγον αυτον δε μεινα</span></span>). Swete takes this to be Titus, who died September 13, 81, after a short reign. </p>
