<p><b> Is himself also an eighth and is of the seven </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αυτος ογδοος κα εκ των επτα</span></span>). This is the angel's interpretation and it looks like a reference to Domitian as the eighth, who is regarded as one of the seven because he was considered a second Nero (Nero <i>redivivus</i>). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ των επτα</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:8">Acts 21:8</span>. John may have used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ των</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις εκ των</span></span> to avoid absolute identity between Domitian and Nero (Beckwith).</p>
<p><b>And he goeth unto perdition </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εις απωλειαν υπαγε</span></span>). As in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>. "Domitian was assassinated (September 18, 96), after a terrible struggle with his murderers. The tyrant's end was a symbol of the end to which the Beast which he personated was hastening" (Swete). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:11-21">Revelation 19:11-21</span>. </p>
