 Have one mind  (μιαν γνωμην εχουσιν). "One purpose" (γνωμη from γινωσκω) as in Acts 20:3; 1 Corinthians 1:10. The new powers are allies of the beast.They give their power and authority unto the beast  (την δυναμιν κα την εξουσιαν αυτων τω θηριω διδοασιν). Present active indicative of διδωμ. Just as the dragon gave both power and authority to the beast (Revelation 13:2), so they are wholly at the service of the beast.
