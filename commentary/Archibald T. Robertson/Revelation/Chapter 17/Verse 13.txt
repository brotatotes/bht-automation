<p><b> Have one mind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιαν γνωμην εχουσιν</span></span>). "One purpose" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωμη</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:3">Acts 20:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:10">1 Corinthians 1:10</span>. The new powers are allies of the beast.</p>
<p><b>They give their power and authority unto the beast </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την δυναμιν κα την εξουσιαν αυτων τω θηριω διδοασιν</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>. Just as the dragon gave both power and authority to the beast (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:2">Revelation 13:2</span>), so they are wholly at the service of the beast. </p>
