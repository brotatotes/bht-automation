<p><b> These </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτο</span></span>). These ten kings.</p>
<p><b>Shall war against the Lamb </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα του θηριου πολεμησουσιν</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολεμεο</span></span>, to war. As allies of the beast (the servant of the dragon, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:7">Revelation 12:7</span>) they will wage war with the Lamb (the enemy of the dragon). These kings gather for battle as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:13">Revelation 16:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>And the Lamb shall overcome them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα το αρνιον νικησε αυτους</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νικαω</span></span>. This is the glorious outcome, victory by the Lamb over the coalition of kings as against the beast before.</p>
<p><b>For he is Lord of lords and King of kings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ Κυριος κυριων εστιν κα Βασιλευς βασιλεων</span></span>). The same words are again descriptive of Christ in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:16">Revelation 19:16</span>, as of God in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+10:17">Deuteronomy 10:17</span> (God of gods and Lord of lords) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+10:17">Daniel 10:17</span> (God of gods and Lord of kings). Cf. also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:15">1 Timothy 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>. Crowned heads are Christ's subjects.</p>
<p><b>And they also shall overcome that are with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο μετ' αυτου</span></span>). "And those with him shall also overcome" (supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νικησουσιν</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισιν</span></span>). They will share in the triumph of the Lamb, as they shared in the conflict. Cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα του θηριου</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:12">Revelation 17:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>Called and chosen and faithful </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλητο κα εκλεκτο κα πιστο</span></span>). These are the three notes of those who share in the victory. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλητος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεκτος</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:14">Matthew 22:14</span> (contrasted); <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:10">2 Peter 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:10">Revelation 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:13">Revelation 2:13</span>. The elect are called and prove faithful. </p>
