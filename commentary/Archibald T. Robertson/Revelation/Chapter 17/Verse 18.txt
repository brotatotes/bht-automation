 The woman  (η γυνη). She is now explained after the beast has been interpreted. Verse Revelation 17:9 made it plain enough, but this verse demonstrates that the woman is the city of Rome "which reigneth (η εχουσα βασιλειαν, the one having a kingdom) over the kings of the earth (επ των βασιλεων της γης)." Rome followed Babylon, and other cities may follow in their train.
