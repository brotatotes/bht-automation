<p><b> The woman </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η γυνη</span></span>). She is now explained after the beast has been interpreted. Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:9">Revelation 17:9</span> made it plain enough, but this verse demonstrates that the woman is the city of Rome "which reigneth (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η εχουσα βασιλειαν</span></span>, the one having a kingdom) over the kings of the earth (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ των βασιλεων της γης</span></span>)." Rome followed Babylon, and other cities may follow in their train. </p>
