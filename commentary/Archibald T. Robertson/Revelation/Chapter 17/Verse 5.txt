<p><b> Upon her forehead a name written </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ το μετωπον αυτης ονομα γεγραμμενον</span></span>). Roman harlots wore a label with their names on their brows (Seneca, <i>Rhet</i>. I. 2. 7; Juvenal VI. 122f.), and so here. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:16">Revelation 19:16</span> Christ has a name on his garments and on his thigh, while in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:4">Revelation 22:4</span> the redeemed have the name of God on their foreheads. There is undoubtedly a contrast between this woman here and the woman in chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:12">Revelation 17:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>Mystery </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μυστηριον</span></span>). Either in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span> or as part of the inscription on her forehead. In either case the meaning is the same, that the name Babylon is to be interpreted mystically or spiritually (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματικως</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:8">Revelation 11:8</span>) for Rome.</p>
<p><b>The Mother of the Harlots and of the Abominations of the Earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hη Μητηρ των Πορνων κα των Βδελυγματων της Γης</span></span>). The Metropolis of the Empire is the mother of harlotry and of the world's idolatries. Charles quotes Tacitus (<i>Ann</i>. XV. 44) about Rome as the city "quo cuncta undique atrocia aut pudenda confluunt celebranturque_." </p>
