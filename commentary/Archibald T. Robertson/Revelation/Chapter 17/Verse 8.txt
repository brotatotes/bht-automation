<p><b> Was and is not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην κα ουκ εστιν</span></span>). Imperfect and present of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειμ</span></span>, an apparent antithesis to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ην κα ο ων</span></span> of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>. This is a picture of the beast of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span> which the woman is riding, but no longer just the empire, but one of the emperors who died (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν</span></span>, is not).</p>
<p><b>And is about to come up out of the abyss </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μελλε αναβαινειν εκ της αβυσσου</span></span>). That is, he is going to come to life again.</p>
<p><b>And to go into perdition </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εις απωλειαν υπαγε</span></span>). So (and he goes into perdition) the best MSS. read rather than the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπαγειν</span></span>. Most interpreters see here an allusion to the "Nero <i>redivivus</i>" expectancy realized in Domitian, who was ruling when John wrote and who was called Nero <i>redivivus</i>.</p>
<p><b>Shall wonder </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαυμασθησοντα</span></span>). First future passive (deponent) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θαυμαζω</span></span>, with which compare <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθαυμασθη</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:3">Revelation 13:3</span>. John had wondered (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εθαυμασα</span></span>) in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:6">Revelation 17:6</span> "with the amazement of a horrible surprise; the world will wonder and admire" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>Whose name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων ονομα</span></span>). Singular <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span>, like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πτωμα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:8">Revelation 11:8</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span> for the same description of those who worship the beast and for discussion of details.</p>
<p><b>When they behold </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεποντων</span></span>). Genitive plural of the present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλεπω</span></span>, agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span> (genitive relative) rather than with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κατοικουντες</span></span> (nominative just before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>How that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). "Namely that."</p>
<p><b>He was, and is not, and shall come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην κα ουκ εστιν κα παρεστα</span></span>). Repetition of what is in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:7">Revelation 17:7</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεστα</span></span> (future of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρειμ</span></span>, from which <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρουσια</span></span> comes) in place of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλε</span></span>, "parody of the divine name" (Charles) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:8">Revelation 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:8">Revelation 4:8</span>, "as the hellish antitype of Christ." The Neronic Antichrist has also a <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρουσια</span></span>. </p>
