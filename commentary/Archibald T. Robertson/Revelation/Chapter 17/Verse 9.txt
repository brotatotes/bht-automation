<p><b> Here is the mind which hath wisdom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hωδε ο νους ο εχων σοφιαν</span></span>). "Here is the intelligence which has wisdom" (Charles). A variation of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:18">Revelation 13:18</span>, but the same idea.</p>
<p><b>Seven mountains </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επτα ορη</span></span>). Rome was known as the city on seven hills (Vergil, Horace, Ovid, Cicero, etc.).</p>
<p><b>On which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου--επ' αυτων</span></span>). "Where--upon them." Pleonasm like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου--εκε</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:6">Revelation 12:6</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span> it is the beast that has the seven heads, while here the woman riding the beast has seven heads, a slight change in the symbolism, and the heads are further identified as kings. </p>
