 Standing afar off  (απο μακροθεν εστηκοτες). Perfect active (intransitive) participle of ιστημ. Vivid picture of the terrible scene, fascinated by the lurid blaze (cf. Nero's delight in the burning of Rome in A.D. 64), and yet afraid to draw near. On απο μακροθεν see Mark 5:6. There is a weird charm in a burning city. They feared the same fate (cf. verse Revelation 18:7 for βασανισμου, torment).Woe, woe, the great city  (ουαι, ουαι, η πολις η μεγαλη). Only example in the Apocalypse of the nominative with ουα except verses Revelation 18:16; Revelation 18:19, though in Luke 6:25 and common in LXX (Isaiah 5:7; Isaiah 5:11, etc.). For the dative see Revelation 8:13, once so "strong" (η ισχυρα)!In one hour  (μια ωρα). Repeated in verses Revelation 18:16; Revelation 18:19, and like μια ημερα (in one day) in verse Revelation 18:8. Some MSS. have here μιαν ωραν, like ποιαν ωραν (accusative of extent of time) in Revelation 3:3. See verse Revelation 18:8 (ο κρινας) for η κρισις σου (thy judgment). This is the dirge of the kings.
