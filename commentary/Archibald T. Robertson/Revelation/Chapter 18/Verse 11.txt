 The merchants  (ο εμπορο). As in Revelation 18:3; Revelation 18:15; Revelation 18:23. The dirge of the merchants follows the wail of the kings.Weep and mourn  (κλαιουσιν κα πενθουσιν). Present active indicatives of κλαιω and πενθεω as in verses Revelation 18:9 (for κλαιω), Revelation 18:15; Revelation 18:19.For no man buyeth their merchandise any more  (οτ τον γομον αυτων ουδεις αγοραζε ουκετ). Reason enough for their sorrow over Rome's fall. Γομος is old word (from γεμω to be full) for a ship's cargo (Acts 21:3) and then any merchandise (Revelation 18:11). Galen, Pliny, Aristides tell of the vastness of the commerce and luxury of Rome, the world's chief market. Many of the items here are like those in the picture of the destruction of Tyre in Revelation 18:26; Revelation 18:27. There are twenty-nine items singled out in verses Revelation 18:12; Revelation 18:13 of this merchandise or cargo (γομον), imports into the port of Rome. Only a few need any comment.
