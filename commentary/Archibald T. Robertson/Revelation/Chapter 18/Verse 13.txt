This use of σωμα for slave occurs in Genesis 34:29; Tob 10:11 (σωματα κα κτηνη, slaves and cattle); II Macc. 8:11.Souls of men  (ψυχας ανθρωπων). Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 160) finds this use of σωμα for slave in the Egyptian Delta. Return to the accusative ψυχας. From Numbers 31:35; 1 Chronicles 5:21; Ezekiel 27:13. This addition is an explanation of the use of σωματα for slaves, "human live stock" (Swete), but slaves all the same. Perhaps κα here should be rendered "even," not "and": "bodies even souls of men." The slave merchant was called σωματεμπορος (body merchant).
