 They cast dust  (εβαλον χουν). Second aorist active of βαλλω. Χους is old word (from χεω to pour) for heap of earth, dust, in N.T. only here and Mark 6:11. Cf. Ezekiel 27:30; Luke 10:13. This is the dirge of the sea-folk (cf. verses Revelation 18:10; Revelation 18:16).By reason of her costliness  (εκ της τιμιοτητος αυτης). Occasionally in later literary Greek, though here only in N.T. and not in LXX. The same use of τιμη appears in 1 Peter 2:7. Common in the papyri as a title like "Your Honor" (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary).
