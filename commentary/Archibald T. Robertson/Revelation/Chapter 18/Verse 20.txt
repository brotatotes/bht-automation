<p><b> Rejoice over her </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ευφραινου επ' αυτη</span></span>). Present middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευφραινω</span></span>, for which verb see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:10">Revelation 11:10</span>, used there of the joy of the wicked over the death of the two witnesses, just the opposite picture to this. "The song of doom" (Charles) here seems to be voiced by John himself.</p>
