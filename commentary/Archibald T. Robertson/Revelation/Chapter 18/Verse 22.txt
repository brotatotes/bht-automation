 The voice  (φωνη). Cf. Ezekiel 26:13. Or "sound" as in 1 Corinthians 14:8 with σαλπιγξ (trumpet). For this song of judgment see Jeremiah 25:10.Of harpers  (κιθαρωιδων). Old word (from κιθαρα, harp, and ωιδος, singer) as in Revelation 14:2.Of minstrels  (μουσικων). Old word (from μουσα, music), here only in N.T., one playing on musical instruments.Of flute-players  (αυλητων). Old word (from αυλεω, to play on a flute, Matthew 11:17, αυλος, flute, 1 Corinthians 14:7), in N.T. only here and Matthew 9:23.Of trumpeters  (σαλπιστων). Late form for the earlier σαλπιγκτης (from σαλπιζω), here only in N.T.Shall be heard no more at all  (ου μη ακουσθη). First aorist passive subjunctive of ακουω with the double negative as below, with φωνη μυλου (sound of the millstone), and as in verse Revelation 18:21 with ου με ευρεθη and again with πας τεχνιτης (craftsman). This old word is from τεχνη, art, as here in some MSS. ("of whatsoever craft," πασης τεχνης). Τεχνιτης occurs also in this sense in Acts 19:24; Acts 19:38; and in Hebrews 11:10 of God as the Architect. There is power in this four-fold sonorous repetition of ου μη and the subjunctive with two more examples in verse Revelation 18:23.
