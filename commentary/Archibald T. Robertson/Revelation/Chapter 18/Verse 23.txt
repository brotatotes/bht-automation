"Even the occasional flash of the torches carried by bridal processions (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:1">Matthew 25:1</span>) is seen no more" (Swete). The sixth instance of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span>, in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:21-23">Revelation 18:21-23</span>, occurs with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουσθη</span></span> (third instance of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουσθη</span></span>, two in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:22">Revelation 18:22</span>).</p>
