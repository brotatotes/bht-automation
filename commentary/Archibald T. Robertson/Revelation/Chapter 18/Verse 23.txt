 Of a lamp  (λυχνου). Old word (Matthew 5:15), again in Revelation 22:5.Shall shine no more at all  (ου μη φανη). Fifth instance in these verses of ου μη with the aorist subjunctive, here the active of φαινω as in Revelation 8:12. It is not known whether Rome had street lights or not.The voice of the bridegroom and of the bride  (φωνη νυμφιου κα νυμφης). See John 3:29; Jeremiah 7:34; Jeremiah 16:9. "Even the occasional flash of the torches carried by bridal processions (Matthew 25:1) is seen no more" (Swete). The sixth instance of ου μη, in verses Revelation 18:21-23, occurs with ακουσθη (third instance of ακουσθη, two in verse Revelation 18:22).Were the princes of the earth  (ησαν ο μεγιστανες της γης). For μεγισταν see Revelation 6:15; Mark 6:21. "Thy merchants were the grandees" once, but now these merchant princes are gone.With thy sorcery  (εν τη φαρμακια σου). Εν (instrumental use) and the locative case of φαρμακια, old word (from φαρμακευω, to prepare drugs, from φαρμακον, sorcery, Revelation 9:21), in N.T. only here and Galatians 5:20 for sorcery and magical arts. If one is puzzled over the connection between medicine and sorcery as illustrated by this word (our pharmacy), he has only to recall quackery today in medicine (patent medicines and cure-alls), witch-doctors, professional faith-healers, medicine-men in Africa. True medical science has had a hard fight to shake off chicanery and charlatanry.Were deceived  (επλανηθησαν). First aorist passive indicative of πλαναω. These charlatans always find plenty of victims. See Mark 12:24.
