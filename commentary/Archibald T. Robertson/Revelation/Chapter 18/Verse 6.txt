 Render as she rendered  (αποδοτε ως απεδωκεν). Second aorist (effective) active imperative and first aorist (effective) active of αποδιδωμ, old and common verb for requital, to give back, the lex talionis which is in the O.T. (Jeremiah 50:15; Jeremiah 50:29; Jeremiah 51:24; Jeremiah 51:56; Psalms 137:8), and in the N.T. also (Matthew 7:2). Here the reference is to persecutions by Rome, particularly the martyrdom of the saints (Revelation 18:24; Revelation 19:2).Double the double  (διπλωσατε τα διπλα). First aorist imperative of διπλοω, old verb (from διπλοος, double, Matthew 23:15), here only in N.T. Διπλα is simply the neuter plural accusative (cognate) contract form for διπλοα (not διπλω). Requite here in double measure, a full requital (Exodus 22:4; Exodus 22:7; Exodus 22:9; Isaiah 40:2; Jeremiah 16:18; Jeremiah 17:18; Zechariah 9:12). The double recompense was according to the Levitical law.Which she mingled  (ω εκερασεν). First aorist active indicative of κεραννυμ. The relative ω is attracted to the locative case of its antecedent ποτηριω (cup), for which see Revelation 14:8; Revelation 14:10; Revelation 17:4; Revelation 18:3.Mingle unto her double  (κερασατε αυτη διπλουν). First aorist active imperative of the same verb κεραννυμ, with the same idea of double punishment.
