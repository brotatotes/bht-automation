<p><b> After these things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα ταυτα</span></span>). Often when a turn comes in this book. But Beckwith is probably correct in seeing in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:1-5">Revelation 19:1-5</span> the climax of chapter <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:18">Revelation 19:18</span>. This first voice (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:1">Revelation 19:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:2">Revelation 19:2</span>) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως φωνην μεγαλην ουχλου πολλου</span></span> (as it were great voice of much multitude) is probably the response of the angelic host (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:11">Revelation 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:22">Hebrews 12:22</span>). There is responsive singing (grand chorus) as in chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:4">Revelation 19:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:5">Revelation 19:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>Saying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγοντων</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span>, genitive plural, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλου</span></span> is genitive singular (collective substantive, agreement in sense).</p>
<p><b>Hallelujah </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αλληλουια</span></span>). Transliteration of the Hebrew seen often in the Psalms (LXX) and in III. Macc. 7:13, in N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:1">Revelation 19:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:3">Revelation 19:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:4">Revelation 19:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:6">Revelation 19:6</span>. It means, "Praise ye the Lord." Fifteen of the Psalms begin or end with this word. The Great Hallel (a title for <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:104-109">Revelation 19:104-109</span>) is sung chiefly at the feasts of the passover and tabernacles. This psalm of praise uses language already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:10">Revelation 12:10</span>. </p>
