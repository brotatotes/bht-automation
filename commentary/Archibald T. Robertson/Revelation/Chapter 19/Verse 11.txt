 The heaven opened  (τον ουρανον ηνεωιγμενον). Perfect passive participle (triple reduplication) of ανοιγω. Accusative case after ειδον. So Ezekiel (Revelation 1:1) begins his prophecy. See also the baptism of Jesus (Matthew 3:16; Luke 3:21, but σχιζομενους in Mark 1:10). Jesus predicted the opened heavens to Nathanael (John 1:51). In Revelation 4:1 a door is opened in heaven, the sanctuary is opened (Revelation 11:19; Revelation 15:5), angels come out of heaven (Revelation 10:1; Revelation 14:17; Revelation 18:1), and sounds come from heaven (Revelation 19:1).Behold, a white horse  (ιδου ιππος λευκος). Nominative case because of ιδου, not ειδον. Cf. Revelation 6:2 for ιππος λευκος. The emblem of victory in both cases, but the riders are very different. Here it is the Messiah who is the Warrior, as is made plain by "Faithful and True" (πιστος κα αληθινος), epithets already applied to Christ (Revelation 1:5; Revelation 3:7; Revelation 3:14). Cf. also Revelation 22:6.In righteousness he doth judge and make war  (εν δικαιοσυνη κρινε κα πολεμε). See Isaiah 11:3. The Messiah is both Judge and Warrior, but he does both in righteousness (Revelation 15:3; Revelation 16:5; Revelation 16:7; Revelation 19:2). He passes judgment on the beast (antichrist) and makes war on him. Satan had offered Christ a victory of compromise which was rejected.
