<p><b> The heaven opened </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον ουρανον ηνεωιγμενον</span></span>). Perfect passive participle (triple reduplication) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιγω</span></span>. Accusative case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον</span></span>. So Ezekiel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span>) begins his prophecy. See also the baptism of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:21">Luke 3:21</span>, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχιζομενους</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:10">Mark 1:10</span>). Jesus predicted the opened heavens to Nathanael (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:51">John 1:51</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span> a door is opened in heaven, the sanctuary is opened (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+15:5">Revelation 15:5</span>), angels come out of heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:1">Revelation 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:17">Revelation 14:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:1">Revelation 18:1</span>), and sounds come from heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:1">Revelation 19:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>Behold, a white horse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδου ιππος λευκος</span></span>). Nominative case because of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδου</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον</span></span>. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:2">Revelation 6:2</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιππος λευκος</span></span>. The emblem of victory in both cases, but the riders are very different. Here it is the Messiah who is the Warrior, as is made plain by "Faithful and True" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστος κα αληθινος</span></span>), epithets already applied to Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:7">Revelation 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>). Cf. also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>In righteousness he doth judge and make war </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν δικαιοσυνη κρινε κα πολεμε</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:3">Isaiah 11:3</span>. The Messiah is both Judge and Warrior, but he does both in righteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+15:3">Revelation 15:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:5">Revelation 16:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:7">Revelation 16:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:2">Revelation 19:2</span>). He passes judgment on the beast (antichrist) and makes war on him. Satan had offered Christ a victory of compromise which was rejected. </p>
