<p><b> A flame of fire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φλοξ πυρος</span></span>). As in the opening vision of Christ in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:14">Revelation 1:14</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:18">Revelation 2:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>Many diadems </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαδηματα πολλα</span></span>). A new feature, but the dragon has a diadem on each of his seven heads (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:3">Revelation 12:3</span>) and the first beast one upon each of his ten horns (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>). So the victorious Messiah will wear many royal diadems and not mere crowns, because he is King of kings (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:16">Revelation 19:16</span>).</p>
<p><b>And he hath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εχων</span></span>). Nominative active present participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span> either used absolutely as an independent verb (like indicative) or in an anacoluthon, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτου</span></span> (his) is genitive.</p>
<p><b>A name written </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα γεγραμμενον</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>But he himself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη αυτος</span></span>). "Except himself" (common ellipsis of the verb after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη</span></span>, "if not"). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span> for the new name there described. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span> for the name of Christ on the forehead of the 144,000, and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:5">Revelation 17:5</span> for the name on the forehead of the harlot. This word here supplements what Jesus says in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>. </p>
