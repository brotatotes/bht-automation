 The armies which are in heaven  (τα στρατευματα τα εν τω ουρανω). See Revelation 12:7 for Michael and angels warring with the dragon, and also Matthew 26:53 for the angels at Christ's call, not to say Hebrews 1:6; Hebrews 1:14; Matthew 13:41; Revelation 5:11.Followed  (ηκολουθε). Imperfect active and singular (στρατευματα, neuter plural) of ακολουθεω, graphic picture of the celestial Warrior with his angelic hosts "upon white horses" (εφ' ιπποις λευκοις) like the Leader and, like him "clothed in fine linen white and pure" (ενδεδυμενο βυσσινον λευκον καθαρον) like the Leader again (Revelation 19:8). Note ενδεδυμενο here as in Revelation 1:13; Revelation 15:6.
