Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of πατασσω, old verb already in Revelation 11:6 and like Isaiah 11:4, a figure here for forensic and judicial condemnation.And he shall rule them  (κα αυτος ποιμανε). Emphatic use of αυτος twice (he himself). Future active of ποιμαινω, to shepherd as in Revelation 2:27; Revelation 12:5 "with a rod of iron" (εν ραβδω σιδηρα) as there. See 1 Peter 2:25; Hebrews 13:20 for Christ as Shepherd.And he treadeth  (κα αυτος πατε). Change to present tense of πατεω, to tread (here transitive), with solemn repetition of κα αυτος.The winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God  (την ληνον του οινου του θυμου της οργης του θεου του παντοκρατορος). Literally, "the winepress of the wine of the wrath of the anger of God the Almighty" (four genitives dependent on one another and on ληνον). These images are here combined from Revelation 14:8; Revelation 14:10; Revelation 14:19; Revelation 16:19. The fact is already in Revelation 19:13 after Isaiah 63:1.
