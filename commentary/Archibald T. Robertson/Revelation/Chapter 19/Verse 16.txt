<p><b> And on his thigh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα επ τον μηρον αυτου</span></span>). "Even upon his thigh." Old word, here alone in N.T.</p>
<p><b>King of kings, and Lord of lords </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βασιλευς βασιλεων κα Κυριος κυριων</span></span>). The title already given to the Lamb in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:14">Revelation 17:14</span>, but in reverse order. See the same idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:15">1 Timothy 6:15</span>. </p>
