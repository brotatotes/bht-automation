 An angel  (ενα αγγελον). Like εις in Revelation 18:21, just "an," not "one."Standing in the sun  (εστωτα εν τω ηλιω). Second perfect active participle of ιστημ (intransitive). "Where all the birds of prey would behold him" (Beckwith). For ορνεοις (birds) see Revelation 18:2 and for εν μεσουρανηματ (in mid heaven) see Revelation 18:13; Revelation 14:6.Come and be gathered together  (Δευτε συναχθητε). Δευτε is the adverb δευρω (hither), used when two or more are addressed, possibly from δευρο ιτε (come here). Asyndeton also without κα (and). First aorist passive imperative of συναγω. The metaphor is drawn from Ezekiel 39:17.Unto the great supper of God  (εις το δειπνον το μεγα του θεου). The habits of vultures are described by Christ in Matthew 24:28. This is a bold and powerful picture of the battlefield after the victory of the Messiah, "a sacrificial feast spread on God's table for all the vultures of the sky" (Swete). Is this battle the same as that of Har Magedon (Revelation 16:16) and that of Gog and Magog (Revelation 20:8) mentioned after the thousand years? The language in Revelation 20:8 seems like this derived from Ezekiel 39:17, and "in the Apocalypse priority in the order of sequence does not always imply priority in time" (Swete). There seems no way to decide this point save that the end seems to be at hand.
