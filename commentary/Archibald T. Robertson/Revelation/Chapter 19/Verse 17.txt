<p><b> An angel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενα αγγελον</span></span>). Like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:21">Revelation 18:21</span>, just "an," not "one."</p>
<p><b>Standing in the sun </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστωτα εν τω ηλιω</span></span>). Second perfect active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span> (intransitive). "Where all the birds of prey would behold him" (Beckwith). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορνεοις</span></span> (birds) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:2">Revelation 18:2</span> and for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν μεσουρανηματ</span></span> (in mid heaven) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:13">Revelation 18:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span>.</p>
<p><b>Come and be gathered together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δευτε συναχθητε</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δευτε</span></span> is the adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευρω</span></span> (hither), used when two or more are addressed, possibly from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευρο ιτε</span></span> (come here). Asyndeton also without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> (and). First aorist passive imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγω</span></span>. The metaphor is drawn from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+39:17">Ezekiel 39:17</span>.</p>
<p><b>Unto the great supper of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το δειπνον το μεγα του θεου</span></span>). The habits of vultures are described by Christ in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:28">Matthew 24:28</span>. This is a bold and powerful picture of the battlefield after the victory of the Messiah, "a sacrificial feast spread on God's table for all the vultures of the sky" (Swete). Is this battle the same as that of Har Magedon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:16">Revelation 16:16</span>) and that of Gog and Magog (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:8">Revelation 20:8</span>) mentioned after the thousand years? The language in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:8">Revelation 20:8</span> seems like this derived from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+39:17">Ezekiel 39:17</span>, and "in the Apocalypse priority in the order of sequence does not always imply priority in time" (Swete). There seems no way to decide this point save that the end seems to be at hand. </p>
