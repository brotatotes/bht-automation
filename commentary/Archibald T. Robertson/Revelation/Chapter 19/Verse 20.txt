<p><b>Into the lake of fire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την λιμνην του πυρος</span></span>). Genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρος</span></span> describes this <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιμνην</span></span> (lake, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:1">Luke 5:1</span>) as it does <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεεννα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:22">Matthew 5:22</span>. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span>.

<p><b>That burneth with brimstone </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της καιομενης εν θειω</span></span>). Note the genitive here in place of the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιμνην</span></span>, perhaps because of the intervening genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρος</span></span> (neuter, not feminine). The agreement is regular in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span>. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν θειω</span></span> (with brimstone) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:10">Revelation 14:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span>. The fact of hell is clearly taught here, but the imagery is not to be taken literally any more than that of heaven in chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:4">Revelation 19:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:5">Revelation 19:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:21">Revelation 19:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:22">Revelation 19:22</span> is to be so understood. Both fall short of the reality. </p>
