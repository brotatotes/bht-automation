 As it were the voice  (ως φωνην). Used here three times, as once in verse Revelation 19:1: once of a second great multitude (οχλου πολλου), not of angels as in verse Revelation 19:1, but the innumerable multitude of the redeemed of Revelation 7:9; then "of many waters" (υδατων πολλων) as in Revelation 1:15; Revelation 14:2 like "the roar of a cataract" (Swete); and once more "the voice of mighty thunders" (βροντων ισχυρων) as in Revelation 6:1; Revelation 10:3.Saying  (λεγοντων). The best attested reading, genitive plural of λεγω, agreeing with οχλου (genitive singular), for roll of the waters and the roar of the thunders were not articulate. Some MSS. have λεγοντες (nominative plural) referring also to οχλου, though nominative instead of genitive. The fourth "Hallelujah" comes from this vast multitude.The Lord our God, the Almighty  (Κυριοσ, ο θεοσ, ο παντοκρατωρ). For this designation of God see also Revelation 1:8; Revelation 4:8; Revelation 11:17; Revelation 15:3; Revelation 16:7; Revelation 16:14; Revelation 19:15; Revelation 21:22. Cf. deus et dominus noster used of the Roman emperor.Reigneth  (εβασιλευσεν). First aorist active of βασιλευω. Probably ingressive prophetic aorist, "God became king" in fulness of power on earth with the fall of the world power.
