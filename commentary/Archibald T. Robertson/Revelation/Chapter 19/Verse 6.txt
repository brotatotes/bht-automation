<p><b> As it were the voice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως φωνην</span></span>). Used here three times, as once in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:1">Revelation 19:1</span>: once of a second great multitude (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλου πολλου</span></span>), not of angels as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:1">Revelation 19:1</span>, but the innumerable multitude of the redeemed of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9">Revelation 7:9</span>; then "of many waters" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υδατων πολλων</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:15">Revelation 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:2">Revelation 14:2</span> like "the roar of a cataract" (Swete); and once more "the voice of mighty thunders" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βροντων ισχυρων</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:1">Revelation 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:3">Revelation 10:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Saying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγοντων</span></span>). The best attested reading, genitive plural of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span>, agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλου</span></span> (genitive singular), for roll of the waters and the roar of the thunders were not articulate. Some MSS. have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγοντες</span></span> (nominative plural) referring also to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οχλου</span></span>, though nominative instead of genitive. The fourth "Hallelujah" comes from this vast multitude.</p>
<p><b>The Lord our God, the Almighty </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριοσ, ο θεοσ, ο παντοκρατωρ</span></span>).

<p><b>Reigneth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβασιλευσεν</span></span>). First aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλευω</span></span>. Probably ingressive prophetic aorist, "God became king" in fulness of power on earth with the fall of the world power. </p>
