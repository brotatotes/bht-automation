 That she should array herself  (ινα περιβαλητα). Sub-final object clause subject of εδοθη (was given to her) with ινα and the second aorist middle (direct) of περιβαλλω to fling around. This bridal dress is a gift from Christ. This form, εδοθη (it was given), occurs some 20 times in this book.In fine linen, bright and pure  (βυσσινον λαμπρον καθαρον). See Revelation 19:14 for the same raiment on those accompanying "The Word of God" and for the seven angels in Revelation 15:6. See by contrast the garments of the harlot (Revelation 17:4; Revelation 18:16). For βυσσινον see Revelation 18:16.The righteous acts of the saints  (τα δικαιωματα των αγιων). This is the explanation (γαρ) of the bridal dress and explains why there is work for the Bride as well as for Christ (Philippians 2:12). See Revelation 15:4 for δικαιωμα (also Romans 5:18).
