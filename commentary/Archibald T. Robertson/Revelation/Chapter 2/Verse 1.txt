<p><b> In Ephesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Εφεσω</span></span>). Near the sea on the river Cayster, the foremost city of Asia Minor, the temple-keeper of Artemis and her wonderful temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:35">Acts 19:35</span>), the home of the magic arts (Ephesian letters, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:19">Acts 19:19</span>) and of the mystery-cults, place of Paul's three years' stay (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:1-10">Acts 19:1-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17-38">Acts 20:17-38</span>), where Aquila and Priscilla and Apollos laboured (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:24-28">Acts 18:24-28</span>), where Timothy wrought (I and II Tim.), where the Apostle John preached in his old age. Surely it was a place of great privilege, of great preaching. It was about sixty miles from Patmos and the messenger would reach Ephesus first. It is a free city, a seat of proconsular government (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:38">Acts 19:38</span>), the end of the great road from the Euphrates. The port was a place of shifting sands, due to the silting up of the mouth of the Cayster. Ramsay (<i>Letters to the Seven Churches</i>, p. 210) calls it "the City of Change."</p>
<p><b>These things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταδε</span></span>). This demonstrative seven times here, once with the message to each church (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:1">Revelation 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:8">Revelation 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:12">Revelation 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:18">Revelation 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:1">Revelation 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:7">Revelation 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:14">Revelation 2:14</span>), only once elsewhere in N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:11">Acts 21:11</span>).</p>
<p><b>He that holdeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κρατων</span></span>). Present active articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατεω</span></span>, a stronger word than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχων</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>, to which it refers.</p>
<p><b>He that walketh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο περιπατων</span></span>). Present active articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιπατεω</span></span>, an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:13">Revelation 1:13</span>. These two epithets are drawn from the picture of Christ in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:13-18">Revelation 1:13-18</span>, and appropriately to conditions in Ephesus describe Christ's power over the churches as he moves among them. </p>
