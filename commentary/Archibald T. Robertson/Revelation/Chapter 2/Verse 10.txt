<p><b> Fear not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη φοβου</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:17">Revelation 1:17</span>. Worse things are about to come than poverty and blasphemy, perhaps prison and death, for the devil "is about to cast" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μελλε βαλλειν</span></span>), "is going to cast."</p>
<p><b>Some of you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ υμων</span></span>). Without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τινας</span></span> (some) before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ υμων</span></span>, a common idiom as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:49">Luke 11:49</span>.</p>
<p><b>That ye may be tried </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα πειρασθητε</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειραζω</span></span>. John himself is in exile. Peter and John had often been in prison together. James the brother of John, Paul, and Peter had all suffered martyrdom. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:10">Revelation 3:10</span> a general persecution is outlined by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειρασμος</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Ye shall have </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξετε</span></span>). Future active, but some MSS. read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχητε</span></span> (present active subjunctive with hina, "that ye may have").</p>
<p><b>Tribulation ten days </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιψιν ημερων δεκα</span></span>). "Tribulation of ten days" (or "within ten days"). It is unwise to seek a literal meaning for ten days. Even ten days of suffering might seem an eternity while they lasted.</p>
<p><b>Be thou faithful </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινου πιστος</span></span>). "Keep on becoming faithful" (present middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>), "keep on proving faithful unto death" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:4">Hebrews 12:4</span>) as the martyrs have done (Jesus most of all).</p>
<p><b>The crown of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον στεφανον της ζωης</span></span>). See this very image in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span>, a familiar metaphor in the games at Smyrna and elsewhere in which the prize was a garland. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:11">Revelation 3:11</span>. The crown consists in life (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:7">Revelation 2:7</span>). See Paul's use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στεφανος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:25">1 Corinthians 9:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>. </p>
