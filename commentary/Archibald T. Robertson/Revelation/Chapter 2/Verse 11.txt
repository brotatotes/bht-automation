<p><b>Of the second death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του θανατου του δευτερου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εκ</span></span> here used for the agent or instrument as often (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:18">Revelation 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:2">Revelation 9:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:1">Revelation 18:1</span>).
