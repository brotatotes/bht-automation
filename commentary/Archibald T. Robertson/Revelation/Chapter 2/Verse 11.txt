 Shall not be hurt  (ου μη αδικηθη). Strong double negative with first aorist passive subjunctive of αδικεω, old verb, to act unjustly (from αδικος), here to do harm or wrong to one, old usage as in Revelation 6:6; Revelation 7:2; Revelation 9:4; Revelation 9:10; Revelation 11:5.Of the second death  (εκ του θανατου του δευτερου). Εκ here used for the agent or instrument as often (Revelation 3:18; Revelation 9:2; Revelation 18:1). See Revelation 20:6; Revelation 20:14; Revelation 21:8 where "the second death" is explained as "the lake of fire." The idea is present in Daniel 12:3; John 5:29 and is current in Jewish circles as in the Jerusalem Targum on Deuteronomy 33:6 and in Philo. It is not annihilation. The Christians put to death in the persecution will at least escape this second death (eternal punishment).
