<p><b> Where </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">που--οπου</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Που</span></span> is interrogative adverb used here in an indirect question as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:39">John 1:39</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hοπου</span></span> is relative adverb referring to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">που</span></span>. Satan's throne (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θρονος του Σατανα</span></span>). Satan not simply resided in Pergamum, but his "throne" or seat of power of king or judge (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:32">Luke 1:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:52">Luke 1:52</span>). The symbol of Asklepios was the serpent as it is of Satan (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:2">Revelation 20:2</span>). There was, besides, a great throne altar to Zeus cut on the Acropolis rock, symbol of "rampant paganism" (Swete) and the new Caesar-worship with the recent martyrdom of Antipas made Pergamum indeed a very throne of Satan.</p>
<p><b>Holdest fast my name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατεις το ονομα σου</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατεω</span></span>, "dost keep on holding," as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:25">Revelation 2:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:11">Revelation 3:11</span>. This church refused to say <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος Καισαρ</span></span> (<i>Martyrd. Polyc</i>. 8f.) and continued to say <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος Ιησους</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>).

<p><b>Didst not deny </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ ηρνησω</span></span>). First aorist middle second person singular of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρνεομα</span></span>. Reference to a specific incident not known to us.</p>
<p><b>My faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την πιστιν μου</span></span>). Objective genitive, "thy faith in me."</p>
<p><b>Of Antipas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αντιπας</span></span>). Indeclinable in this form. It is possible that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αντιπα</span></span> (genitive) was really written, though unimportant as the nominative follows in apposition. Nothing is really known of this early martyr in Pergamum before the writing of the Apocalypse. One legend is that he was burnt to death in a brazen bull. Other martyrs followed him at Pergamum (Agathonice, Attalus, Carpus, Polybus).</p>
<p><b>My witness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μαρτυς μου</span></span>). Nominative in apposition with a genitive as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span> (with ablative), common solecism in the Apocalypse. "Witness" as Jesus had said they should be (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8">Acts 1:8</span>) and Stephen was (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:20">Acts 22:20</span>) and others were (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:6">Revelation 17:6</span>). The word later (by third century) took on the modern meaning of martyr.</p>
<p><b>My faithful one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πιστος μου</span></span>). Nominative also, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μου</span></span> also. Jesus gives Antipas his own title (Swete) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>. Faithful unto death.</p>

<p><b>Among you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ υμιν</span></span>). By your side. Proof of the throne of Satan, "where Satan dwells" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οπου ο Σατανας κατοικε</span></span>), repeated for emphasis. </p>
