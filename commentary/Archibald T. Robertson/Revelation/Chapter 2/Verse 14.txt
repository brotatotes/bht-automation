<p><b> There </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκε</span></span>). That is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρ' υμιν</span></span> (among you). A party in the church that resisted emperor-worship, to the death in the case of Antipas, yet were caught in the insidious wiles of the Nicolaitans which the church in Ephesus withstood.</p>
<p><b>Some that hold </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατουντας</span></span>). "Men holding" (present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατεω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>The teaching of Balaam </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την διδαχην Βαλααμ</span></span>). Indeclinable substantive Balaam (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:1-9">Numbers 25:1-9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+31:15">Numbers 31:15</span>). The point of likeness of these heretics with Balaam is here explained.</p>
<p><b>Taught Balak </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιδασκεν τω Βαλακ</span></span>). Imperfect indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκω</span></span>, Balaam's habit, "as the prototype of all corrupt teachers" (Charles). These early Gnostics practised licentiousness as a principle since they were not under law, but under grace (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:15">Romans 6:15</span>). The use of the dative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκω</span></span> is a colloquialism rather than a Hebraism. Two accusatives often occur with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>To cast a stumbling-block </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλειν σκανδαλον</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive (accusative case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδιδασκεν</span></span>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλω</span></span>, regular use with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκανδαλον</span></span> (trap) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ σκανδαλον</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:13">Romans 14:13</span>. Balaam, as Josephus and Philo also say, showed Balak how to set a trap for the Israelites by beguiling them into the double sin of idolatry and fornication, which often went together (and do so still).</p>
<p><b>To eat things sacrificed to idols </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαγειν ειδωλοθυτα</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσθιω</span></span> and the verbal adjective (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδωλον</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυω</span></span>), quoted here from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:1">Numbers 25:1</span>, but in inverse order, repeated in other order in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:20">Revelation 2:20</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:29">Acts 15:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:25">Acts 21:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span> for the controversy over the temptation to Gentile Christians to do what in itself was harmless, but which led to evil if it led to participation in the pagan feasts. Perhaps both ideas are involved here. Balaam taught Balak how to lead the Israelites into sin in both ways. </p>
