 So thou also  (ουτως κα συ). Thou and the church at Pergamum as Israel had the wiles of Balaam.The teaching of the Nicolaitans likewise  (την διδαχην των Νικολαιτων ομοιως). See on Revelation 1:6 for the Nicolaitans. The use of ομοιως (likewise) here shows that they followed Balaam in not obeying the decision of the Conference at Jerusalem (Acts 15:20; Acts 15:29) about idolatry and fornication, with the result that they encouraged a return to pagan laxity of morals (Swete). Some wrongly hold that these Nicolaitans were Pauline Christians in the face of Colossians 3:5-8; Ephesians 5:3-6.
