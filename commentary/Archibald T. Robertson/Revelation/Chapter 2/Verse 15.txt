<p><b> So thou also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως κα συ</span></span>). Thou and the church at Pergamum as Israel had the wiles of Balaam.</p>
<p><b>The teaching of the Nicolaitans likewise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την διδαχην των Νικολαιτων ομοιως</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:6">Revelation 1:6</span> for the Nicolaitans. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιως</span></span> (likewise) here shows that they followed Balaam in not obeying the decision of the Conference at Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:20">Acts 15:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:29">Acts 15:29</span>) about idolatry and fornication, with the result that they encouraged a return to pagan laxity of morals (Swete). Some wrongly hold that these Nicolaitans were Pauline Christians in the face of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:5-8">Colossians 3:5-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3-6">Ephesians 5:3-6</span>. </p>
