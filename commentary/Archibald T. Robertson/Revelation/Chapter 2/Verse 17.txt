<p><b> Of the hidden manna </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του μαννα του κεκρυμμενου</span></span>). "Of the manna the hidden" (perfect passive articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρυπτω</span></span>). The partitive genitive, the only N.T. example with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>, though Q reads <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το</span></span> (accusative) here. For examples of the ablative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> see Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 519. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:31">John 6:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:49">John 6:49</span> for the indeclinable word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μαννα</span></span>. The golden pot of manna was "laid up before God in the ark" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:23">Exodus 16:23</span>). It was believed that Jeremiah hid the ark, before the destruction of Jerusalem, where it would not be discovered till Israel was restored (II Macc. 2:5ff.). Christ is the true bread from heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:31-33">John 6:31-33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:48-51">John 6:48-51</span>) and that may be the idea here. Those faithful to Christ will have transcendent fellowship with him. Swete takes it to be "the life-sustaining power of the Sacred Humanity now hid with Christ in God."</p>
<p><b>A white stone </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψηφον λευκην</span></span>). This old word for pebble (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψαω</span></span>, to rub) was used in courts of justice, black pebbles for condemning, white pebbles for acquitting. The only other use of the word in the N.T. is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>, where Paul speaks of "depositing his pebble" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηνεγκα ψηφον</span></span>) or casting his vote. The white stone with one's name on it was used to admit one to entertainments and also as an amulet or charm.</p>
<p><b>A new name written </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα καινον γεγραμμενον</span></span>). Perfect passive predicate participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραφω</span></span>. Not the man's own name, but that of Christ (Heitmuller, <i>Im Namen Jsu</i>, p. 128-265). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span> for the name of God so written on one. The man himself may be the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψηφος</span></span> on which the new name is written. "The true Christian has a charmed life" (Moffatt).</p>
<p><b>But he that receiveth it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη ο λαμβανων</span></span>). "Except the one receiving it." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span> for like intimate and secret knowledge between the Father and the Son and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal the Father. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:12">Revelation 19:12</span>. </p>
