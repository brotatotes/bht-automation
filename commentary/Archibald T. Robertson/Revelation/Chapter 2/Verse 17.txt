 Of the hidden manna  (του μαννα του κεκρυμμενου). "Of the manna the hidden" (perfect passive articular participle of κρυπτω). The partitive genitive, the only N.T. example with διδωμ, though Q reads το (accusative) here. For examples of the ablative with απο and εκ see Robertson, Grammar, p. 519. See John 6:31; John 6:49 for the indeclinable word μαννα. The golden pot of manna was "laid up before God in the ark" (Exodus 16:23). It was believed that Jeremiah hid the ark, before the destruction of Jerusalem, where it would not be discovered till Israel was restored (II Macc. 2:5ff.). Christ is the true bread from heaven (John 6:31-33; John 6:48-51) and that may be the idea here. Those faithful to Christ will have transcendent fellowship with him. Swete takes it to be "the life-sustaining power of the Sacred Humanity now hid with Christ in God."A white stone  (ψηφον λευκην). This old word for pebble (from ψαω, to rub) was used in courts of justice, black pebbles for condemning, white pebbles for acquitting. The only other use of the word in the N.T. is in Acts 26:10, where Paul speaks of "depositing his pebble" (κατηνεγκα ψηφον) or casting his vote. The white stone with one's name on it was used to admit one to entertainments and also as an amulet or charm.A new name written  (ονομα καινον γεγραμμενον). Perfect passive predicate participle of γραφω. Not the man's own name, but that of Christ (Heitmuller, Im Namen Jsu, p. 128-265). See Revelation 3:12 for the name of God so written on one. The man himself may be the ψηφος on which the new name is written. "The true Christian has a charmed life" (Moffatt).But he that receiveth it  (ε μη ο λαμβανων). "Except the one receiving it." See Matthew 11:27 for like intimate and secret knowledge between the Father and the Son and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal the Father. See also Revelation 19:12.
