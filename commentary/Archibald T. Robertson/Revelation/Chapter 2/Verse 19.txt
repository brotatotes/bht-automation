 Thy works  (σου τα εργα) . As in Revelation 2:2 and explained (explanatory use of κα =namely) by what follows. Four items are given, with separate feminine article for each (την αγαπην, την πιστιν, την διακονιαν, την υπομονην), a longer list of graces than in Revelation 2:2 for Ephesus. More praise is given in the case of Ephesus and Thyatira when blame follows than in the case of Smyrna and Philadelphia when no fault is found. Love comes first in this list in true Johannine fashion. Faith (πιστιν) here may be "faithfulness," and ministry (διακονιαν) is ministration to needs of others (Acts 11:29; 1 Corinthians 16:15).And that  (κα). Only κα (and) in the Greek, but doubtless οτ (that) is understood.Than the first  (των πρωτων). Ablative after the comparative πλειονα (more).
