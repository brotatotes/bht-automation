<p><b> Thy works </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σου τα εργα</span></span>) . As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2">Revelation 2:2</span> and explained (explanatory use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> =namely) by what follows. Four items are given, with separate feminine article for each (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αγαπην, την πιστιν, την διακονιαν, την υπομονην</span></span>), a longer list of graces than in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2">Revelation 2:2</span> for Ephesus. More praise is given in the case of Ephesus and Thyatira when blame follows than in the case of Smyrna and Philadelphia when no fault is found. Love comes first in this list in true Johannine fashion. Faith (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστιν</span></span>) here may be "faithfulness," and ministry (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονιαν</span></span>) is ministration to needs of others (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:29">Acts 11:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15">1 Corinthians 16:15</span>).</p>
<p><b>And that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span>). Only <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> (and) in the Greek, but doubtless <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> (that) is understood.</p>
<p><b>Than the first </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των πρωτων</span></span>). Ablative after the comparative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλειονα</span></span> (more). </p>
