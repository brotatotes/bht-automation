 I know  (οιδα). Rather than γινωσκω and so "emphasizes better the absolute clearness of mental vision which photographs all the facts of life as they pass" (Swete). So also in Revelation 2:9; Revelation 2:13; Revelation 2:19; Revelation 3:1; Revelation 3:8; Revelation 3:15. For the distinction see John 21:17, "where the universal knowledge passes into the field of special observation."Works  (εργα). The whole life and conduct as in John 6:29.And thy toil and patience  (κα τον κοπον κα την υπομονην σου). "Both thy toil and patience," in explanation of εργα, and see 1 Thessalonians 1:3, where all three words (εργον, κοποσ, υπομονη) occur together as here. See Revelation 14:13 for sharp distinction between εργα (activities) and κοπο (toils, with weariness). Endurance (υπομονη) in hard toil (κοπος).And that  (κα οτ). Further explanation of κοπος (hard toil).Not able  (ου δυνη). This Koine form for the Attic δυνασα (second person singular indicative middle) occurs also in Mark 9:22; Luke 16:2.Bear  (βαστασα). First aorist active infinitive of βασταζω, for which verb see John 10:31; John 12:6; Galatians 6:2. These evil men were indeed a heavy burden.And didst try  (κα επειρασας). First aorist active indicative of πειραζω, to test, a reference to a recent crisis when these Nicolaitans (verse Revelation 2:6) were condemned. The present tenses (δυνηι, εχεις) indicate the continuance of this attitude. Cf. 1 John 4:1.Which call themselves apostles  (τους λεγοντας εαυτους αποστολους). Perhaps itinerant missionaries of these Nicolaitans who posed as equal to or even superior to the original apostles, like the Judaizers so described by Paul (2 Corinthians 11:5; 2 Corinthians 11:13; 2 Corinthians 12:11). Paul had foretold such false teachers (Gnostics), grievous wolves, in Acts 20:29; in sheep's clothing, Jesus had said (Matthew 7:15).And they are not  (κα ουκ εισιν). A parenthesis in Johannine style (John 2:9; John 3:9; 1 John 3:1) for κα ουκ οντας to correspond to λεγοντας.And didst find  (κα ευρες). Second aorist active indicative of ευρισκω. Dropping back to the regular structure parallel with επειρασας.False  (ψευδεις). Predicate accusative plural of ψευδης, self-deceived deceivers as in Revelation 21:8.
