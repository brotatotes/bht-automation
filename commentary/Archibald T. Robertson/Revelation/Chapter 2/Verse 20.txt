<p><b> Thou sufferest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεις</span></span>). Late vernacular present active indicative second person singular as if from a form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεω</span></span> instead of the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιημ</span></span> forms.</p>
<p><b>The woman Jezebel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την γυναικα Ιεζαβελ</span></span>). Symbolical name for some prominent woman in the church in Thyatira, like the infamous wife of Ahab who was guilty of whoredom and witchcraft (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+16:31">1 Kings 16:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+9:22">2 Kings 9:22</span>) and who sought to drive out the worship of God from Israel. Some MSS. here (A Q 40 min.s) have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σου</span></span> (thy wife, thy woman Ramsay makes it), but surely Aleph C P rightly reject <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σου</span></span>. Otherwise she is the pastor's wife!</p>
<p><b>Which calleth herself a prophetess </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η λεγουσα εαυτην προφητιν</span></span>). Nominative articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span> in apposition with the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυναικα</span></span> like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μαρτυς</span></span> in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αντιπας</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:13">Revelation 2:13</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Προφητις</span></span> is an old word, feminine form for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητης</span></span>, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:36">Luke 2:36</span> (Anna), two extremes surely. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:9">Acts 21:9</span> for the daughters of Philip who prophesied.</p>
<p><b>And she teacheth and seduceth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα διδασκε κα πλανα</span></span>). A resolution of the participles (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκουσα κα πλανωσα</span></span>) into finite verbs (present active indicatives) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>. This woman was not a real prophetess, but a false one with loud claims and loose living. One is puzzled to know how such a woman had so much shrewdness and sex-appeal as to lead astray the servants of God in that church. The church tolerated the Nicolaitans and this leader whose primary object was sexual immorality (Charles) and became too much involved with her to handle the heresy. </p>
