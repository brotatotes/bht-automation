<p><b> To you the rest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υμιν τοις λοιποις</span></span>). Dative case. Those who hold out against Jezebel, not necessarily a minority (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:20">Revelation 9:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:21">Revelation 19:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13">1 Thessalonians 4:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>As many as </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οσο</span></span>). Inclusive of all "the rest."</p>
<p><b>This teaching </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την διδαχην ταυτην</span></span>). That of Jezebel.</p>
<p><b>Which </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιτινες</span></span>). "Which very ones," generic of the class, explanatory definition as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:7">Revelation 1:7</span>.</p>
<p><b>Know not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εγνωσαν</span></span>). Second aorist (ingressive) active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, "did not come to know by experience."</p>
<p><b>The deep things of Satan </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα βαθεα του Σατανα</span></span>). The Ophites (worshippers of the serpent) and other later Gnostics (Cainites, Carpocratians, Naassenes) boasted of their knowledge of "the deep things," some claiming this very language about Satan (the serpent) as Paul did of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10">1 Corinthians 2:10</span>). It is not clear whether the words here quoted are a boast of the Nicolaitans or a reproach on the other Christians for not knowing the depths of sin. Some even claimed that they could indulge in immorality without sinning (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:10">1 John 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:10">1 John 3:10</span>). Perhaps both ideas are involved.</p>
<p><b>As they say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως λεγουσιν</span></span>). Probably referring to the heretics who ridicule the piety of the other Christians.</p>
<p><b>None other burden </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου--αλλο βαρος</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Βαρος</span></span> refers to weight (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:12">Matthew 20:12</span>), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φορτιον</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερω</span></span>, to bear, refers to load (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:5">Galatians 6:5</span>), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ογκος</span></span> to bulk (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</span>). Apparently a reference to the decision of the Jerusalem Conference (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:28">Acts 15:28</span>) where the very word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαρος</span></span> is used and mention is made about the two items in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:20">Revelation 2:20</span> (fornication and idolatry) without mentioning the others about things strangled, etc. See the Pharisaic narrowness in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:4">Matthew 23:4</span>. </p>
