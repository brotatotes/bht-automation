<p><b> This against thee, that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα σου οτ</span></span>). For the phrase "have against" see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:23">Matthew 5:23</span>.

<p><b>Thou didst leave </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφηκες</span></span>). First aorist active (kappa aorist, but with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ες</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ας</span></span>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφιημ</span></span>, a definite and sad departure.</p>
<p><b>Thy first love </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αγαπην σου την πρωτην</span></span>). "Thy love the first." This early love, proof of the new life in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:13">1 John 3:13</span>), had cooled off in spite of their doctrinal purity. They had remained orthodox, but had become unloving partly because of the controversies with the Nicolaitans. </p>
