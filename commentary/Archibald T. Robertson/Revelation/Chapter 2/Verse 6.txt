<p><b> That thou hatest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ μισεις</span></span>). Accusative object clause in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο</span></span> (this). Trench tells of the words used in ancient Greek for hatred of evil (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισοπονηρια</span></span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισοπονηρος</span></span> (hater of evil), neither of which occurs in the N.T., but which accurately describe the angel of the church in Ephesus.</p>
<p><b>Of the Nicolaitans </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των Νικολαιτων</span></span>). Mentioned again in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:15">Revelation 2:15</span> and really meant in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2">Revelation 2:2</span>. Irenaeus and Hippolytus take this sect to be followers of Nicolaus of Antioch, one of the seven deacons (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:5">Acts 6:5</span>), a Jewish proselyte, who is said to have apostatized. There was such a sect in the second century (Tertullian), but whether descended from Nicolaus of Antioch is not certain, though possible (Lightfoot). It is even possible that the Balaamites of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:14">Revelation 2:14</span> were a variety of this same sect (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:15">Revelation 2:15</span>).</p>
<p><b>Which I also hate </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α καγω μισω</span></span>). Christ himself hates the teachings and deeds of the Nicolaitans (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span>, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ους</span></span>, deeds, not people), but the church in Pergamum tolerated them. </p>
