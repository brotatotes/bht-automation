<p><b> In Smyrna </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Σμυρνη</span></span>). North of Ephesus, on a gulf of the Aegean, one of the great cities of Asia (province), a seat of emperor-worship with temple to Tiberius, with many Jews hostile to Christianity who later join in the martyrdom of Polycarp, poor church (rich in grace) which receives only praise from Christ, scene of the recent massacre of Greeks by the Turks. Ramsay (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 251) terms Smyrna "the City of Life." Christianity has held on here better than in any city of Asia.</p>
<p><b>The first and the last </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πρωτος κα ο εσχατος</span></span>). Repeating the language of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:17">Revelation 1:17</span>.</p>
<p><b>Which was dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος εγενετο νεκρος</span></span>). Rather, "who became dead" (second aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>.</p>
<p><b>And lived again </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εζησεν</span></span>). First aorist (ingressive, came to life) active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζαω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ζων</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>). Emphasis on the resurrection of Christ. </p>
