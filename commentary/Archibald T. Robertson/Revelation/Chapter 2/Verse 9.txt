<p><b> Thy tribulation and thy poverty </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σου την θλιψιν κα πτωχειαν</span></span>). Separate articles of same gender, emphasizing each item. The tribulation was probably persecution, which helped to intensify the poverty of the Christians (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:5">James 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:26">1 Corinthians 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:10">2 Corinthians 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:2">2 Corinthians 8:2</span>). In contrast with the wealthy church in Laodicea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:17">Revelation 3:17</span>).</p>
<p><b>But thou art rich </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα πλουσιος ε</span></span>). Parenthesis to show the spiritual riches of this church in contrast with the spiritual poverty in Laodicea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:17">Revelation 3:17</span>), this a rich poor church, that a poor rich church. Rich in grace toward God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:21">Luke 12:21</span>) and in good deeds (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:18">1 Timothy 6:18</span>). Perhaps Jews and pagans had pillaged their property (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:34">Hebrews 10:34</span>), poor as they already were.</p>
<p><b>Blasphemy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βλασφημιαν</span></span>). Reviling believers in Christ. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:22">Mark 7:22</span>. The precise charge by these Jews is not indicated, but see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:45">Acts 13:45</span>.</p>
<p><b>Of them which say </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ των λεγοντων</span></span>). "From those saying" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> with the ablative plural of the present active articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>They are Jews </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιουδαιους εινα εαυτους</span></span>). This is the accusative of general reference and the infinitive in indirect discourse after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:36">Acts 5:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:9">Acts 8:9</span>) even though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγοντων</span></span> is here ablative (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span>), common idiom. These are actual Jews and only Jews, not Christians.</p>
<p><b>And they are not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουκ εισιν</span></span>). Another parenthesis like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2">Revelation 2:2</span>. These are Jews in name only, not spiritual Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:15">Galatians 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:28">Romans 2:28</span>).</p>
<p><b>A synagogue of Satan </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγωγη του Σατανα</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span> again and note <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:13">Revelation 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:24">Revelation 2:24</span>, serving the devil (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>) instead of the Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:3">Numbers 16:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+20:4">Numbers 20:4</span>). </p>
