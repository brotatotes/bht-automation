<p><b> The dead, the great and the small </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους νεκρους τους μεγαλους κα τους μικρους</span></span>). The general resurrection of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:13">Revelation 20:13</span> is pictured by anticipation as already over. No living are mentioned after the battle of verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:7-10">Revelation 20:7-10</span>, though some will be living when Jesus comes to judge the quick and the dead (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:1">2 Timothy 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13">1 Thessalonians 4:13</span>). All classes and conditions (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:18">Revelation 11:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:16">Revelation 13:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:5">Revelation 19:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:18">Revelation 19:18</span>) John saw "standing before the throne" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστωτας ενωπιον του θρονου</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Books were opened </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βιβλια ηνοιχθησαν</span></span>). First aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιγω</span></span>. Like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:10">Daniel 7:10</span>. The record of each human being has been kept in God's books.</p>
<p><b>Were judged </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκριθησαν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>. The sentence upon each rests upon written evidence.</p>
<p><b>Another book which is the book of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλο βιβλιον ο εστιν της ζωης</span></span>). This book has already been mentioned (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>). "It is the roll of living citizens of Jerusalem" (Swete), "the church of the first born enrolled in heaven" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:23">Hebrews 12:23</span>). The books are "the vouchers for the book of life" (Alford). We are saved by grace, but character at last (according to their works) is the test as the fruit of the tree (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:16">Matthew 7:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:20">Matthew 7:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:32">Matthew 10:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31-46">Matthew 25:31-46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:6">John 15:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:10">Romans 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:23">Revelation 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:12">Revelation 20:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:12">Revelation 22:12</span>). </p>
