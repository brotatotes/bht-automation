<p><b> Gave up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδωκεν</span></span>). Just "gave" (first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>), but for the sea to give is to give up (effective aorist). Sea as well as land delivers its dead (all kinds of dead, good and bad). Swete notes that accidental deaths will not prevent any from appearing. Milligan is sure that the sea here means "the sea of the troubled and sinful world."</p>
<p><b>Death and Hades </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θανατος κα ο αιδης</span></span>). "An inseparable pair" (Swete) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:8">Revelation 6:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:14">Revelation 20:14</span>. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> "the gates of Hades" means the power of death. Etymologically Hades is the unseen world where all who die are as opposed to this visible world, but in actual use Hades is sometimes treated as the abode of the unrighteous (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:23">Luke 16:23</span>). Charles thinks that this is true here, though there is nothing to show it apart from the personification of death and Hades and the casting of both into the lake of fire in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:14">Revelation 20:14</span>. Here again "each man" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαστος</span></span>) receives judgment according to his deeds (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:27">Matthew 16:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:13">1 Corinthians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:6">Romans 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:12">Romans 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:17">1 Peter 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:23">Revelation 2:23</span>). </p>
