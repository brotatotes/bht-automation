<p><b> If any was not found written in the book of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε τις ουχ ευρεθη εν τη βιβλω της ζωης</span></span>). Condition of first class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε</span></span> and the first aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκω</span></span>. In this short sentence the doom is told of all who are out of Christ, for they too follow the devil and the two beasts into the lake of fire (the counterpart of the Gehenna of fire, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:22">Matthew 5:22</span>). There is no room here for soul sleeping, for an intermediate state, for a second chance, or for annihilation of the wicked. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+12:2">Daniel 12:2</span> there is a resurrection to death as well as to life and so in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:15">Acts 24:15</span>. </p>
