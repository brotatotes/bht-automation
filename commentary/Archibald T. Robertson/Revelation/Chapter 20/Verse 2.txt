<p><b> He laid hold on </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκρατησεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρατεω</span></span>, to seize.</p>
<p><b>The dragon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον δρακοντα</span></span>). Accusative after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκρατησεν</span></span> instead of the genitive as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:1">Revelation 2:1</span>. He has been behind the beast and the false prophet from the start. Now he is seized.</p>
<p><b>The old serpent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο οφις ο αρχαιος</span></span>). Precisely the description in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span>, only the nominative is here retained, though in apposition with the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον δρακοντα</span></span>, a frequent anacoluthon in the Apocalypse (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>, etc.). Swete calls it a parenthesis.</p>
<p><b>Which is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος εστιν</span></span>). The relative here relieves the construction and takes the place of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο καλουμενος</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span> before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Διαβολος κα ο Σατανας</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>And bound him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εδησεν αυτον</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>For a thousand years </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χιλια ετη</span></span>). Accusative of extent of time. Here we confront the same problem found in the 1260 days. In this book of symbols how long is a thousand years? All sorts of theories are proposed, none of which fully satisfy one. Perhaps Peter has given us the only solution open to us in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:8">2 Peter 3:8</span> when he argues that "one day with the Lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day." It will help us all to remember that God's clock does not run by ours and that times and seasons and programs are with him. This wonderful book was written to comfort the saints in a time of great trial, not to create strife among them. </p>
