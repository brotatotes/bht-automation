<p><b> Into the abyss </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την αβυσσον</span></span>). The one in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:1">Revelation 9:1</span> and the one spoken of by the legion of demons in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:31">Luke 8:31</span> under the charge of the angel of the abyss (Apollyon, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:11">Revelation 9:11</span>) who is either Satan himself or a kindred power. "Already he has been cast out of Heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span>), now he is cast out of the earth, and returns to his own place" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>Shut it and sealed it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκλεισεν κα εσφραγισεν</span></span>). Effective first aorists active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλειω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφραγιζω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>That he should deceive no more </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη πλανηση</span></span>). Negative purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη</span></span> and the first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλαναω</span></span>. Glorious relief after the strain of the previous visions of conflict. Small wonder that Christians today cherish this blessed hope whatever the actual meaning may be.</p>
<p><b>Until should be finished </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ τελεσθη</span></span>). Temporal clause of future purpose with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ</span></span> (as a conjunction like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εως</span></span>) and the first aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελεω</span></span>. Repeated in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:5">Revelation 20:5</span> and see <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ</span></span> and the subjunctive in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:3">Revelation 7:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+15:8">Revelation 15:8</span>.</p>
<p><b>He must be loosed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε λυθηνα</span></span>). Sad necessity, alas, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> and the first aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>For a little time </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μικρον χρονον</span></span>). Accusative of time. Whatever the thousand years means, it is here said plainly that after it is over the devil will again have power on earth "for a little time." </p>
