 Into the abyss  (εις την αβυσσον). The one in Revelation 9:1 and the one spoken of by the legion of demons in Luke 8:31 under the charge of the angel of the abyss (Apollyon, Revelation 9:11) who is either Satan himself or a kindred power. "Already he has been cast out of Heaven (Revelation 12:9), now he is cast out of the earth, and returns to his own place" (Swete).Shut it and sealed it  (εκλεισεν κα εσφραγισεν). Effective first aorists active indicative of κλειω and σφραγιζω.That he should deceive no more  (ινα μη πλανηση). Negative purpose clause with ινα μη and the first aorist active subjunctive of πλαναω. Glorious relief after the strain of the previous visions of conflict. Small wonder that Christians today cherish this blessed hope whatever the actual meaning may be.Until should be finished  (αχρ τελεσθη). Temporal clause of future purpose with αχρ (as a conjunction like εως) and the first aorist passive subjunctive of τελεω. Repeated in verse Revelation 20:5 and see αχρ and the subjunctive in Revelation 7:3; Revelation 15:8.He must be loosed  (δε λυθηνα). Sad necessity, alas, with δε and the first aorist passive infinitive of λυω.For a little time  (μικρον χρονον). Accusative of time. Whatever the thousand years means, it is here said plainly that after it is over the devil will again have power on earth "for a little time."
