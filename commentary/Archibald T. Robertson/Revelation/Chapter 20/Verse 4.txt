<p><b> And they sat upon them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εκαθισαν επ' αυτους</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθιζω</span></span>. Another period here apparently synchronous (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:7">Revelation 20:7</span>) with the confinement of Satan in the abyss. No subject is given for this plural verb. Apparently Christ and the Apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:30">Luke 22:30</span>) and some of the saints (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:3">1 Corinthians 6:3</span>), martyrs some hold.</p>
<p><b>Judgment was given unto them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριμα εδοθη αυτοις</span></span>). First aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>. Picture of the heavenly court of assizes.</p>
<p><b>The souls </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας ψυχας</span></span>). Accusative after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον</span></span> at the beginning of the verse.</p>
<p><b>Of them that had been beheaded </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των πεπελεκισμενων</span></span>). Genitive of the articular perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πελεκιζω</span></span>, old word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πελεκυς</span></span> an axe, the traditional instrument for execution in republican Rome, but later supplanted by the sword), to cut off with an axe, here only in N.T. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:24">Revelation 18:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:2">Revelation 19:2</span> for previous mention of these martyrs for the witness of Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:17">Revelation 12:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>). Others also besides martyrs shared in Christ's victory, those who refused to worship the beast or wear his mark as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:15">Revelation 13:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:9">Revelation 14:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:2">Revelation 16:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>And they lived </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εζησαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζαω</span></span>. If the ingressive aorist, it means "came to life" or "lived again" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:8">Revelation 2:8</span> and so as to verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:5">Revelation 20:5</span>. If it is the constative aorist here and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:5">Revelation 20:5</span>, then it could mean increased spiritual life. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21-29">John 5:21-29</span> for the double sense of life and death (now literal, now spiritual) precisely as we have the second death in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:11">Revelation 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:6">Revelation 20:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:14">Revelation 20:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>And reigned with Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εβασιλευσαν μετα του Χριστου</span></span>). Same use of the first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλευω</span></span>, but more clearly constative. Beckwith and Swete take this to apply solely to the martyrs, the martyrs' reign with Christ. </p>
