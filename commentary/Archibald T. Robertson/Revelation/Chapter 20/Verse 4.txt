 And they sat upon them  (κα εκαθισαν επ' αυτους). First aorist active indicative of καθιζω. Another period here apparently synchronous (verse Revelation 20:7) with the confinement of Satan in the abyss. No subject is given for this plural verb. Apparently Christ and the Apostles (Matthew 19:28; Luke 22:30) and some of the saints (1 Corinthians 6:3), martyrs some hold.Judgment was given unto them  (κριμα εδοθη αυτοις). First aorist passive of διδωμ. Picture of the heavenly court of assizes.The souls  (τας ψυχας). Accusative after ειδον at the beginning of the verse.Of them that had been beheaded  (των πεπελεκισμενων). Genitive of the articular perfect passive participle of πελεκιζω, old word (from πελεκυς an axe, the traditional instrument for execution in republican Rome, but later supplanted by the sword), to cut off with an axe, here only in N.T. See Revelation 6:9; Revelation 18:24; Revelation 19:2 for previous mention of these martyrs for the witness of Jesus (Revelation 1:9; Revelation 12:17; Revelation 19:10). Others also besides martyrs shared in Christ's victory, those who refused to worship the beast or wear his mark as in Revelation 13:15; Revelation 14:9; Revelation 16:2; Revelation 19:20.And they lived  (κα εζησαν). First aorist active indicative of ζαω. If the ingressive aorist, it means "came to life" or "lived again" as in Revelation 2:8 and so as to verse Revelation 20:5. If it is the constative aorist here and in verse Revelation 20:5, then it could mean increased spiritual life. See John 5:21-29 for the double sense of life and death (now literal, now spiritual) precisely as we have the second death in Revelation 2:11; Revelation 20:6; Revelation 20:14.And reigned with Christ  (κα εβασιλευσαν μετα του Χριστου). Same use of the first aorist active indicative of βασιλευω, but more clearly constative. Beckwith and Swete take this to apply solely to the martyrs, the martyrs' reign with Christ.
