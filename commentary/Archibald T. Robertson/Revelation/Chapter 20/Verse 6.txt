 Blessed and holy  (μακαριος κα αγιος). A fifth beatitude (Revelation 1:3; Revelation 14:13; Revelation 16:15; Revelation 19:9) already and two more to come (Revelation 22:7; Revelation 22:14, seven in all). Here αγιος is added to the usual μακαριος. The second death (ο δευτερος θανατος). The spiritual death of Revelation 2:11; Revelation 20:14; Revelation 21:8 in contrast to the first or physical death. This language raises a question about the interpretation of the first and the second resurrections, whether both are of the body or one of the spirit. There seems no way to reach a solid conception about it. In 1 Corinthians 15:23 there is no mention of the resurrection of any save "those of Christ" (ο του Χριστου), though the end follows (verse Revelation 20:24). However, Paul elsewhere (Acts 24:15) speaks of the resurrection of the just and of the unjust as if one event.Priests of God and of Christ  (ιερεις του θεου κα του Χριστου). As in Revelation 1:6; Revelation 5:10; Revelation 22:3; Revelation 22:5.Shall reign with him  (βασιλευσουσιν μετ' αυτου). As promised in the same passages. The servants of God are to be priests with Christ and to reign with him (Matthew 19:28). In Revelation 5:10 επ της γης (upon earth) occurs, but this item does not appear here. "No hint is given as to where this service is to be rendered and this royalty to be exercised" (Swete).
