<p><b> Blessed and holy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακαριος κα αγιος</span></span>). A fifth beatitude (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:13">Revelation 14:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:15">Revelation 16:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9">Revelation 19:9</span>) already and two more to come (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:7">Revelation 22:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:14">Revelation 22:14</span>, seven in all). Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιος</span></span> is added to the usual <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακαριος</span></span>. The second death (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δευτερος θανατος</span></span>). The spiritual death of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:11">Revelation 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:14">Revelation 20:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span> in contrast to the first or physical death. This language raises a question about the interpretation of the first and the second resurrections, whether both are of the body or one of the spirit. There seems no way to reach a solid conception about it. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:23">1 Corinthians 15:23</span> there is no mention of the resurrection of any save "those of Christ" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο του Χριστου</span></span>), though the end follows (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:24">Revelation 20:24</span>). However, Paul elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:15">Acts 24:15</span>) speaks of the resurrection of the just and of the unjust as if one event.</p>
<p><b>Priests of God and of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερεις του θεου κα του Χριστου</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:6">Revelation 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:10">Revelation 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:3">Revelation 22:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:5">Revelation 22:5</span>.</p>
<p><b>Shall reign with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλευσουσιν μετ' αυτου</span></span>). As promised in the same passages. The servants of God are to be priests with Christ and to reign with him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:10">Revelation 5:10</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ της γης</span></span> (upon earth) occurs, but this item does not appear here. "No hint is given as to where this service is to be rendered and this royalty to be exercised" (Swete). </p>
