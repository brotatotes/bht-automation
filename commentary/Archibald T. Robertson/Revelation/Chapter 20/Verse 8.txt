<p><b> To deceive the nations </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλανησα τα εθνη</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of purpose of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλαναω</span></span>, Satan's chief task (chapters 12 to 18, in particular <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:3">Revelation 20:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span>).</p>
<p><b>Which are in the four corners of the earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα εν ταις τεσσαρσ γωνιαις της γης</span></span>). Clearly the reign with Christ, if on earth, was not shared in by all on earth, for Satan finds a large and ready following on his release. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:1">Revelation 7:1</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:12">Isaiah 11:12</span>) for "the four corners of the earth."</p>
<p><b>Gog and Magog </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον Γωγ κα Μαγωγ</span></span>). Accusative in explanatory apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα εθνη</span></span> (the nations). Magog is first mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+10:2">Genesis 10:2</span>. The reference here seems to be <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+38:2">Ezekiel 38:2</span>, where both are mentioned. Josephus (<i>Ant</i>. I. 6. 1) identifies Magog with the Scythians, with Gog as their prince. In the rabbinical writings Gog and Magog appear as the enemies of the Messiah. Some early Christian writers thought of the Goths and Huns, but Augustine refuses to narrow the imagery and sees only the final protest of the world against Christianity.</p>
<p><b>To gather them together to the war </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγαγειν αυτους εις τον πολεμον</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive of purpose of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναγω</span></span>, a congenial task for Satan after his confinement. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:14">Revelation 16:14</span> for this very phrase and also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:14">Revelation 17:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:19">Revelation 19:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>Of whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων--αυτων</span></span>). Pleonasm or redundant pronoun as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:8">Revelation 3:8</span> and often (of whom--of them).</p>
<p><b>As the sand of the sea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως η αμμος της θαλασσης</span></span>). Already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:18">Revelation 12:18</span>. Clearly then the millennium, whatever it is, does not mean a period when Satan has no following on earth, for this vast host rallies at once to his standard. </p>
