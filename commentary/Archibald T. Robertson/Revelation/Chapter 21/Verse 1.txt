<p><b> A new heaven and a new earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουρανον καινον κα γην καινην</span></span>). This new vision (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδον</span></span>) is the picture of the bliss of the saints.</p>
<p><b>The first heaven and the first earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πρωτος ουρανος κα η πρωτη γη</span></span>)</p>
<p><b>are passed away </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηλθαν</span></span>, went away, second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απερχομα</span></span>). "Fled away" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφυγεν</span></span>) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:11">Revelation 20:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>And the sea is no more </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα η θαλασσα ουκ εστιν ετ</span></span>). The sea had given up its dead (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:13">Revelation 20:13</span>). There were great risks on the sea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:17">Revelation 18:17</span>). The old physical world is gone in this vision. It is not a picture of renovation of this earth, but of the disappearance of this earth and sky (not heaven where God dwells). It is a glorious picture here in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:1-8">Revelation 21:1-8</span> in sharp contrast to the lake of fire in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:11-15">Revelation 20:11-15</span>. The symbolism in neither case is to be pressed too literally, but a stern and a glorious reality exists behind it all. </p>
