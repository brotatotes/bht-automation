<p><b> He carried me away in the Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απηνεγκεν με εν πνευματ</span></span>). See same language in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:7">Revelation 17:7</span> when John received a vision of the Harlot City in a wilderness. Here it is "to a mountain great and high" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ ορος μεγα κα υψηλον</span></span>). So it was with Ezekiel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+40:2">Ezekiel 40:2</span>) and so the devil took Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:8">Matthew 4:8</span>). It was apparently not Mount Zion (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>), for the New Jerusalem is seen from this mountain. "The Seer is carried thither 'in spirit' (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:10">Revelation 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span>); the Angel's <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δευρο</span></span> is a <i>sursum cor</i> to which his spirit under the influence of the 'Spirit of revelation' (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span>) at once responds" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>And he shewed me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εδειξεν μο</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεικνυμ</span></span>, just as he had said he would do in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δειξω σο</span></span>, I will shew thee). Precisely the same words about Jerusalem as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>, save the absence of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινην</span></span> (New). </p>
