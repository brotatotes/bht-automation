<p><b> Had </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχων</span></span>). Masculine present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχον</span></span> (neuter like to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τειχος</span></span>), and the participle occurs independently as if a principal verb (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειχεν</span></span>) as often in this book.</p>
<p><b>Twelve foundations </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμελιους δωδεκα</span></span>). Foundation stones, old adjective (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμα</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>), here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11">1 Corinthians 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:19">2 Timothy 2:19</span>, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιθους</span></span> (stones understood), though often neuter substantive to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμελιον</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:48">Luke 6:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:26">Acts 16:26</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:10">Hebrews 11:10</span>. Twelve because of the twelve apostles as foundation stones (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>).</p>
<p><b>On them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ' αυτων</span></span>). On the twelve foundation stones.</p>
<p><b>Names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονοματα των δωδεκα αποστολων του αρνιου</span></span>). Jesus had spoken of twelve thrones for the apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>); names of all twelve are here written, not just that of Peter, as some would argue from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>. As a matter of fact, Christ is the corner stone or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακρογωνιαιον</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:6">1 Peter 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:10">1 Corinthians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>), though rejected by the Sanhedrin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:42">Matthew 21:42</span>). One may wonder if the name of Judas is on that stone or that of Matthias. </p>
