<p><b> Lieth foursquare </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετραγωνος κειτα</span></span>). Present middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κειμα</span></span>. The predicate adjective is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τετρα</span></span> (Aeolic for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεσσαρες</span></span> four) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γωνος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γωνια</span></span> corner, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:5">Matthew 6:5</span>) here only in N.T. As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+48:16">Ezekiel 48:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+48:20">Ezekiel 48:20</span>. It is a tetragon or quadrilateral quadrangle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:12">Revelation 21:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>The length thereof is as great as the breadth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το μηκος αυτης οσον το πλατος</span></span>). It is rectangular, both walls and city within. Babylon, according to Herodotus, was a square, each side being 120 stadia. Diodorus Siculus says that Nineveh was also foursquare.</p>
<p><b>With the reed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω καλαμω</span></span>). Instrumental case (cf. verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:15">Revelation 21:15</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλαμος</span></span>) and for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετρεω</span></span> (aorist active indicative here)</p>
<p><b>Twelve thousand furlongs </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ σταδιων δωδεκα χιλιαδων</span></span>). This use of the genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταδιων</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> is probably correct (reading of Aleph P), though A Q have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταδιους</span></span> (more usual, but confusing here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χιλιαδων</span></span>). Thucydides and Xenophon use <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> with the genitive in a like idiom (in the matter of). It is not clear whether the 1500 miles (12,000 furlongs) is the measurement of each of the four sides or the sum total.

<p><b>Equal </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισα</span></span>). That is, it is a perfect cube like the Holy of Holies in Solomon's temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+6:19">1 Kings 6:19</span>). This same measurement (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλατοσ, μηκοσ, υψος</span></span>) is applied to Christ's love in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:18">Ephesians 3:18</span>, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαθος</span></span> (depth) added. It is useless to try to reduce the measurements or to put literal interpretations upon this highly wrought symbolic language. Surely the meaning is that heaven will be large enough for all, as Jesus said (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:1">John 14:1</span>) without insisting on the materialistic measurement of a gorgeous apartment house full of inside rooms. </p>
