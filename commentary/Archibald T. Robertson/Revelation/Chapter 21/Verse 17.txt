<p><b> A hundred and forty and four cubits </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκατον τεσσερακοντα τεσσαρων πηχων</span></span>). Another multiple of 12 (12x12=144) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:4">Revelation 7:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>. It is not clear whether it is the height or the breadth of the wall that is meant, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υψος</span></span> (height) comes just before. That would be 216 feet high (cf. verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:12">Revelation 21:12</span>), not enormous in comparison with the 7,000,000 feet (1500 miles) height of the city.</p>
<p><b>According to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετρον ανθρωπου, ο εστιν αγγελου</span></span>). No preposition for "according to," just the accusative case of general reference in apposition with the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμετρησεν</span></span>. Though measured by an angel, a human standard was employed, man's measure which is angel's (Bengel). </p>
