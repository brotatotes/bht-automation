<p><b> The holy city, new Jerusalem </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την πολιν την αγιαν Ιερουσαλημ καινην</span></span>). "The New Earth must have a new metropolis, not another Babylon, but another and greater Jerusalem" (Swete), and not the old Jerusalem which was destroyed A.D. 70. It was called the Holy City in a conventional way (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:5">Matthew 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:53">Matthew 27:53</span>), but now in reality because it is new and fresh (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινην</span></span>), this heavenly Jerusalem of hope (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:22">Hebrews 12:22</span>), this Jerusalem above (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:26">Galatians 4:26</span>) where our real citizenship is (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:20">Philippians 3:20</span>).</p>
<p><b>Coming down out of heaven from God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβαινουσαν εκ του ουρανου απο του θεου</span></span>). Glorious picture caught by John and repeated from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span> and again in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:10">Revelation 21:10</span>. But Charles distinguishes this new city of God from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9-22">Revelation 21:9-22</span> because there is no tree of life in this one. But one shrinks from too much manipulation of this symbolism. It is better to see the glorious picture with John and let it tell its own story.</p>
<p><b>Made ready </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητοιμασμενην</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετοιμαζω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7">Revelation 19:7</span>. The Wife of the Lamb made herself ready in her bridal attire.</p>
<p><b>As a bride adorned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως νυμφην κεκοσμημενην</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοσμεω</span></span>, old verb (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοσμος</span></span> ornament like our cosmetics), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:19">Revelation 21:19</span>. Only here the figure of bride is not the people of God as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7">Revelation 19:7</span>, but the abode of the people of God (the New Jerusalem).</p>
<p><b>For her husband </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω ανδρ αυτης</span></span>). Dative case of personal interest. </p>
