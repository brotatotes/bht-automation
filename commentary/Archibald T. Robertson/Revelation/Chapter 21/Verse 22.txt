<p><b> I saw no temple therein </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναον ουκ ειδον εν αυτη</span></span>). "Temple I did not see in it." The whole city is a temple in one sense (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:16">Revelation 21:16</span>), but it is something more than a temple even with its sanctuary and Shekinah Glory in the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p><b>For the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb are the temple thereof </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο γαρ Κυριος ο θεος ο παντοκρατωρ, ναος αυτης εστιν κα το αρνιον</span></span>). "For the Lord God, the Almighty, is the sanctuary of it and the Lamb." The Eternal Presence is the Shekinah Glory of God (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:3">Revelation 21:3</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:16">2 Corinthians 6:16</span> we are the sanctuary of God here, but now God is our Sanctuary, and so is the Lamb as in chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:4">Revelation 21:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:5">Revelation 21:5</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:8">Revelation 1:8</span> and often for the description of God here. </p>
