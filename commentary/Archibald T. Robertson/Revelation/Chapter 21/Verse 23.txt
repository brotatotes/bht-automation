<p><b> To shine upon it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα φαινωσιν αυτη</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the present active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαινω</span></span>, to keep on shining. Light is always a problem in our cities. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:19">Isaiah 60:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>Did lighten it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφωτισεν αυτην</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωτιζω</span></span>, to illumine, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φως</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:36">Luke 11:36</span>). If the sun and moon did shine, they would give no added light in the presence of the Shekinah Glory of God. See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:11">Revelation 21:11</span> for "the glory of God." Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:1">Revelation 18:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:3">Revelation 21:3</span>. "Their splendour is simply put to shame by the glory of God Himself" (Charles).</p>
<p><b>And the lamp thereof is the Lamb </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο λυχνος αυτης το αρνιον</span></span>). Charles takes <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο λυχνος</span></span> as predicate, "and the Lamb is the lamp thereof." Bousset thinks that John means to compare Christ to the moon the lesser light (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:16">Genesis 1:16</span>), but that contrast is not necessary. Swete sees Christ as the one lamp for all in contrast with the many <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυχνια</span></span> of the churches on earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:12">Revelation 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>). "No words could more clearly demonstrate the purely spiritual character of St. John's conception of the New Jerusalem" (Swete). </p>
