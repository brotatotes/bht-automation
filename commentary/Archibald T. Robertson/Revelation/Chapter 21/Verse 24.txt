<p><b> Amidst the light thereof </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια του φωτος αυτης</span></span>). Rather "by the light thereof." From <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:3">Isaiah 60:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:11">Isaiah 60:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:20">Isaiah 60:20</span>. All the moral and spiritual progress of moderns is due to Christ, and the nations of earth will be represented, including "the kings" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο βασιλεις</span></span>), mentioned also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:3">Isaiah 60:3</span>, "do bring their glory into it" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερουσιν την δοξαν αυτων εις αυτην</span></span>). Present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερω</span></span>. Swete is uncertain whether this is a picture of heaven itself or "some gracious purpose of God towards humanity which has not yet been revealed" and he cites <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:2">Revelation 22:2</span> in illustration. The picture is beautiful and glorious even if not realized here, but only in heaven. </p>
