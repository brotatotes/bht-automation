 Amidst the light thereof  (δια του φωτος αυτης). Rather "by the light thereof." From Isaiah 60:3; Isaiah 60:11; Isaiah 60:20. All the moral and spiritual progress of moderns is due to Christ, and the nations of earth will be represented, including "the kings" (ο βασιλεις), mentioned also in Isaiah 60:3, "do bring their glory into it" (φερουσιν την δοξαν αυτων εις αυτην). Present active indicative of φερω. Swete is uncertain whether this is a picture of heaven itself or "some gracious purpose of God towards humanity which has not yet been revealed" and he cites Revelation 22:2 in illustration. The picture is beautiful and glorious even if not realized here, but only in heaven.
