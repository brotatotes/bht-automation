 Shall in no wise be shut  (ου μη κλεισθωσιν). Double negative with the first aorist passive subjunctive of κλειω.By day  (ημερας). Genitive of time. Mentioned alone without νυκτος (by night), "for there shall be no night there" (νυξ γαρ ουκ εστα εκε). This looks like a continued picture of heaven.
