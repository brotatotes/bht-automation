<p><b> There shall in no wise enter into it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη εισελθη εις αυτην</span></span>). Double negative again with the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισερχομα</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> repeated. Like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:1">Isaiah 52:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+44:9">Ezekiel 44:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>Anything unclean </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν κοινον</span></span>). Common use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν</span></span> with negative like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν</span></span>, and the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινος</span></span> for defiled or profane as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:2">Mark 7:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:14">Acts 10:14</span>, not just what is common to all (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4">Titus 1:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>Or he that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ο</span></span>). "And he that."</p>
<p><b>Maketh an abomination and a lie </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιων βδελυγμα κα ψευδος</span></span>). Like Babylon (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:4">Revelation 17:4</span> which see for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βδελυγμα</span></span>) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span> for those in the lake of fire and brimstone, and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:15">Revelation 22:15</span> for "every one loving and doing a lie." These recurrent glimpses of pagan life on earth and of hell in contrast to heaven in this picture raise the question already mentioned whether John is just running parallel pictures of heaven and hell after the judgment or whether, as Charles says: "The unclean and the abominable and the liars are still on earth, but, though the gates are open day and night, they cannot enter." In apocalyptic writing literalism and chronology cannot be insisted on as in ordinary books. The series of panoramas continue to the end.</p>
<p><b>But only they which are written </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη ο γεγραμμενο</span></span>). "Except those written." For "the book of life" see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:15">Revelation 20:15</span>. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1">Daniel 12:1</span>. </p>
