 Shall wipe away every tear from their eyes  (εξαλειψε παν δακρυον εκ των οφθαλμων αυτων). More exactly, "shall wipe out every tear out of their eyes" (repetition of εξ) like a tender mother as in Revelation 7:17 (Isaiah 25:8). There is no more that ought to cause a tear, for death (θανατος) is no more, mourning (πενθος), associated with death and crying (κραυγη, wailing), and pain (πονος as in Revelation 16:10) are all gone. There is peace and bliss.
