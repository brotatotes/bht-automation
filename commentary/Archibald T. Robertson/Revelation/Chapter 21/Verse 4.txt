<p><b> Shall wipe away every tear from their eyes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξαλειψε παν δακρυον εκ των οφθαλμων αυτων</span></span>). More exactly, "shall wipe out every tear out of their eyes" (repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span>) like a tender mother as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:17">Revelation 7:17</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+25:8">Isaiah 25:8</span>). There is no more that ought to cause a tear, for death (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θανατος</span></span>) is no more, mourning (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πενθος</span></span>), associated with death and crying (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κραυγη</span></span>, wailing), and pain (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πονος</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:10">Revelation 16:10</span>) are all gone. There is peace and bliss. </p>
