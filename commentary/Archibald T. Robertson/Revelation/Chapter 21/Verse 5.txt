<p><b> Behold, I make all things new </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιδου καινα ποιω παντα</span></span>). The first time since <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:8">Revelation 1:8</span> that God has been represented as speaking directly, though voices have come out of the throne before (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:3">Revelation 21:3</span>) and out of the sanctuary (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:1">Revelation 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:17">Revelation 16:17</span>), which may be from God himself, though more likely from one of the angels of the Presence. This message is not addressed to John (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:14">Revelation 7:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:7">Revelation 17:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:6">Revelation 21:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span>), but to the entire world of the blessed. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+43:18">Isaiah 43:18</span> for the words (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιδου εγω ποιω καινα</span></span>). The idea of a new heaven and a new earth is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:17">Isaiah 65:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:22">Isaiah 66:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+102:25">Psalms 102:25</span>. For the locative here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ τω θρονω</span></span>) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:10">Revelation 7:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:4">Revelation 19:4</span> (genitive more usual, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:9">Revelation 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:1">Revelation 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:7">Revelation 5:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:13">Revelation 5:13</span>, etc.). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:11">Revelation 20:11</span> for the picture.</p>
<p><b>And he saith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα λεγε</span></span>). Probably this means a change of speakers, made plain by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μο</span></span> (to me) in many MSS. An angel apparently (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:13">Revelation 14:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9">Revelation 19:9</span>) assures John and urges him to write (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γραψον</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:11">Revelation 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:1">Revelation 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:8">Revelation 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:12">Revelation 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:18">Revelation 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:1">Revelation 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:7">Revelation 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:3">Revelation 14:3</span>). The reason given (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>, for) is precisely the saying in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span> and he uses the two adjectives (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστο κα αληθινο</span></span>) employed in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:11">Revelation 19:11</span> about God himself, and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span> about Christ. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9">Revelation 19:9</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθινο</span></span> occurs also about "the words of God" as here. They are reliable and genuine. </p>
