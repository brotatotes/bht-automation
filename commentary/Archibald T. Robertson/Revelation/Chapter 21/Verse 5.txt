 Behold, I make all things new  (Ιδου καινα ποιω παντα). The first time since Revelation 1:8 that God has been represented as speaking directly, though voices have come out of the throne before (Revelation 21:3) and out of the sanctuary (Revelation 16:1; Revelation 16:17), which may be from God himself, though more likely from one of the angels of the Presence. This message is not addressed to John (Revelation 7:14; Revelation 17:7; Revelation 21:6; Revelation 22:6), but to the entire world of the blessed. See Isaiah 43:18 for the words (Ιδου εγω ποιω καινα). The idea of a new heaven and a new earth is in Isaiah 65:17; Isaiah 66:22; Psalms 102:25. For the locative here with επ (επ τω θρονω) see Revelation 7:10; Revelation 19:4 (genitive more usual, Revelation 4:9; Revelation 5:1; Revelation 5:7; Revelation 5:13, etc.). See Revelation 20:11 for the picture.And he saith  (κα λεγε). Probably this means a change of speakers, made plain by μο (to me) in many MSS. An angel apparently (as in Revelation 14:13; Revelation 19:9) assures John and urges him to write (γραψον as in Revelation 1:11; Revelation 2:1; Revelation 2:8; Revelation 2:12; Revelation 2:18; Revelation 3:1; Revelation 3:7; Revelation 3:14; Revelation 14:3). The reason given (οτ, for) is precisely the saying in Revelation 22:6 and he uses the two adjectives (πιστο κα αληθινο) employed in Revelation 19:11 about God himself, and Revelation 3:14 about Christ. In Revelation 19:9 αληθινο occurs also about "the words of God" as here. They are reliable and genuine.
