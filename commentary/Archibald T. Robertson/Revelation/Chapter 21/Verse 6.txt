 They are come to pass  (Γεγοναν). Second perfect active indicative of γινομα with -αν for -ασ. See Revelation 16:17 for a like use of γεγονεν, "They have come to pass." Here again it is the voice of God because, as in Revelation 1:8, He says:I am the Alpha and the Omega  (Εγω το Αλφα κα το Ο) with the addition "the beginning and the end" (η αρχη κα το τελος), the whole used in Revelation 22:13 of Christ. In Isaiah 44:6 there is something like the addition, and in Colossians 1:18; Revelation 3:14 η αρχη is applied to Christ, while here God is the First Cause (αρχη) and the Finality (τελος) as in Romans 11:36; Ephesians 4:6. But God works through Christ (John 1:3; Hebrews 1:2; Colossians 1:12-20). God is the bountiful Giver (James 1:5; James 1:17) of the Water of Life. See Revelation 7:17; Revelation 22:1; Revelation 22:17 for this metaphor, which is based on Isaiah 55:1. It is God's own promise (Εγω δωσω), "I will give."Of the fountain  (εκ της πηγης). For this partitive use of εκ see Matthew 25:8, without εκ Revelation 2:17.Freely  (δωρεαν). See Matthew 10:8; John 4:10; Romans 3:24; Acts 8:20; Revelation 22:17.
