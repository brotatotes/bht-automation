 Their part shall be  (το μερος αυτων). In contrast to the state of the blessed (verses Revelation 21:3-7) the state of "those who have disfranchised themselves from the Kingdom of God" (Charles) is given. They are with Satan and the two beasts, and are the same with those not in the book of life (Revelation 20:15) in the lake of fire and brimstone (Revelation 19:20; Revelation 20:10; Revelation 20:14), that is the second death (Revelation 2:11; Revelation 20:6; Revelation 20:14). See also Revelation 14:10. There are eight epithets here used which apply to various sections of this direful list of the doomed and the damned, all in the dative (case of personal interest).For the fearful  (τοις δειλοις). Old word (from δειδω, to fear) for the cowardly, who recanted under persecution, in N.T. only here, Matthew 8:26; Mark 4:40.Unbelieving  (απιστοις). "Faithless," "untrustworthy," in contrast with Christ "ο πιστος" (Revelation 1:5). Cf. Revelation 2:10; Revelation 2:13; Revelation 3:14; Revelation 17:14. Disloyalty is close kin to cowardice.Abominable  (εβδελυγμενοις). Perfect passive participle of βδελυσσω, old verb, in N.T. only here and Romans 2:22, common in LXX, to pollute (Exodus 5:21). Those who have become defiled by the impurities of emperor-worship (Revelation 7:4; Revelation 21:27; Romans 2:22; Titus 1:16).Murderers  (φονευσιν). As a matter of course and all too common always (Mark 7:21; Romans 1:29; Revelation 9:21).Fornicators  (πορνοις). Again all too common always, then and now (1 Corinthians 5:10; 1 Timothy 1:9). These two crimes often go together.Sorcerers  (φαρμακοις). Old word, in N.T. only here and Revelation 22:15. Closely connected with idolatry and magic (Revelation 9:21; Revelation 13:13).Idolaters  (ειδωλολατραις). See 1 Corinthians 5:10; 1 Corinthians 10:7; Ephesians 5:5; Revelation 22:15. With a powerful grip on men's lives then and now.All liars  (πασ τοις ψευδεσιν). Repeated in Revelation 22:15 and stigmatized often (Revelation 2:2; Revelation 3:9; Revelation 14:5; Revelation 21:8; Revelation 21:27; Revelation 22:15). Not a "light" sin.
