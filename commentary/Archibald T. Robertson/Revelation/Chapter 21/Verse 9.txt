 One of the seven angels  (εις εκ των επτα αγγελων). As in Revelation 17:1 with the same introduction when the angel made the announcement about the harlot city (Babylon), so here the description of the heavenly city, the New Jerusalem, is given by one of the same group of angels who had the seven bowls. Thus the νυμφη (Bride) is placed in sharp contrast with the πορνη (Harlot). The New Jerusalem was briefly presented in verse Revelation 21:2, but now is pictured at length (Revelation 21:9-22) in a nearer and clearer vision.The bride the wife of the Lamb  (την νυμφην την γυναικα του αρνιου). Twice already the metaphor of the Bride has been used (Revelation 19:7; Revelation 21:2), here termed "wife" (γυναικα), mentioned proleptically as in Revelation 19:7 if the marriage is not yet a reality. For the use of the same metaphor elsewhere in the N.T. see on Revelation 19:7.
