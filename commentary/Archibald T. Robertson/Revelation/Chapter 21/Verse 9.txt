<p><b> One of the seven angels </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις εκ των επτα αγγελων</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span> with the same introduction when the angel made the announcement about the harlot city (Babylon), so here the description of the heavenly city, the New Jerusalem, is given by one of the same group of angels who had the seven bowls. Thus the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυμφη</span></span> (Bride) is placed in sharp contrast with the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορνη</span></span> (Harlot). The New Jerusalem was briefly presented in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>, but now is pictured at length (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9-22">Revelation 21:9-22</span>) in a nearer and clearer vision.</p>
<p><b>The bride the wife of the Lamb </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την νυμφην την γυναικα του αρνιου</span></span>). Twice already the metaphor of the Bride has been used (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7">Revelation 19:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>), here termed "wife" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυναικα</span></span>), mentioned proleptically as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7">Revelation 19:7</span> if the marriage is not yet a reality. For the use of the same metaphor elsewhere in the N.T. see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7">Revelation 19:7</span>. </p>
