<p><b> And he saith unto me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα λεγε μο</span></span>). The angel resumes as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9">Revelation 19:9</span>.</p>
<p><b>Seal not up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη σφραγισηις</span></span>). Prohibition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the ingressive first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφραγιζω</span></span>. Charles takes this to be the command of Christ because in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:7">Revelation 22:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:18">Revelation 22:18</span> "the words of the prophecy of this book" come from Christ. But that is not a conclusive argument, though Charles, as already stated, rearranges these chapters to suit his own notion. Once only (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:4">Revelation 10:4</span>) was John directed to seal and not to write. See there for discussion of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφραγιζω</span></span>. This book is to be left open for all to read (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:18">Revelation 13:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:9">Revelation 17:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:7">Revelation 22:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:18">Revelation 22:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>At hand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγγυς</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>. </p>
