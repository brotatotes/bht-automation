<p><b> Let him do unrighteousness still </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικησατω ετ</span></span>). First aorist (constative) active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικεω</span></span>, viewed here as a whole. The language is probably ironical, with a reminder of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+12:10">Daniel 12:10</span>, in no sense a commendation of their lost estate. Charles rejects this verse as not like John. It is the hopelessness of the final state of the wicked which is here pictured. So as to "Let him be made filthy still" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυπανθητω ετ</span></span>). First aorist (constative) passive imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυπαινω</span></span>, old verb, to make foul or filthy (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυπος</span></span>, filth, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:21">1 Peter 3:21</span>, as is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυπαρος</span></span>, filthy), here only in N.T. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετ</span></span> is not perfectly clear, whether "still" or "yet more." It is the time when Christ has shut the door to those outside who are now without hope (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:10">Matthew 25:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:25">Luke 13:25</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ρυπαρος</span></span> occurs elsewhere in N.T. only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:2">James 2:2</span>, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυπαρια</span></span> (filthiness) only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:21">James 1:21</span>. So then "the righteous" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο δικαιος</span></span>) is to do righteousness still (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνην ποιησατω ετ</span></span>, first constative aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>) and "the holy" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αγιος</span></span>) to be made holy still (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιασθητω ετ</span></span>, first constative aorist passive imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιαζω</span></span>). The states of both the evil and the good are now fixed forever. There is no word here about a "second chance" hereafter. </p>
