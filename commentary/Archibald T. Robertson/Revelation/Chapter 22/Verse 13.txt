<p><b> I am the Alpha and the Omega </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω το Αλφα κα το Ο</span></span>). Applied to God in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:8">Revelation 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:6">Revelation 21:6</span>, and here alone to Christ, crowning proof in this book of Christ's deity. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:6">Revelation 21:6</span> God is termed, as Christ is here, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αρχη κα το τελος</span></span> (the beginning and the end), while <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πρωτος κα ο εσχατος</span></span> (the first and the last) is applied only to Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:17">Revelation 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:8">Revelation 2:8</span>). Solemn assurance is thus given that Christ is qualified to be the Judge of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:12">Revelation 22:12</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31-46">Matthew 25:31-46</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span> Jesus is the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρχηγος κα τελειωτης της πιστεως</span></span> (the author and finisher of faith). Christ was the Creator of the universe for the Father. So now he is the Consummation of redemption. </p>
