<p><b> I Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω Ιησους</span></span>). The last and most solemn attestation to the book that from Jesus (the historic Jesus known to the churches), in harmony with <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Have sent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεμψα</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεμπω</span></span>, used here in the same sense as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποστειλας</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span> as his personal messenger. It is the Jesus of history here speaking, who is also the Christ of theology and the Lamb of God.</p>
<p><b>For the churches </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ ταις εκκλησιαις</span></span>). For this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:11">Revelation 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:16">John 12:16</span>. It is not just for the seven churches (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>), but for all the churches in the world then and now.</p>
<p><b>I am the root and the offspring of David </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω ειμ η ριζα κα το γενος Δαυειδ</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:5">Revelation 5:5</span> for "the root of David," to which John now adds <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το γενος</span></span> in the sense of "offspring" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:28">Acts 17:28</span>), not of family or race (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:6">Acts 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:13">Acts 7:13</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:42-45">Matthew 22:42-45</span>.</p>
<p><b>The bright, the morning star </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αστηρ ο λαμπρος ο πρωινος</span></span>). The Davidic King is called a star in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+24:17">Numbers 24:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:78">Luke 1:78</span>. This "day-star" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωσφορος</span></span>) is interpreted as Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:19">2 Peter 1:19</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:28">Revelation 2:28</span> the phrase "the morning star" occurs in Christ's words, which is here interpreted. Christ is the Light that was coming into the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>). </p>
