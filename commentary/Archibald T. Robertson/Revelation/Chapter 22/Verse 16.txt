 I Jesus  (Εγω Ιησους). The last and most solemn attestation to the book that from Jesus (the historic Jesus known to the churches), in harmony with Revelation 1:1.Have sent  (επεμψα). First aorist active indicative of πεμπω, used here in the same sense as αποστειλας in Revelation 1:1 as his personal messenger. It is the Jesus of history here speaking, who is also the Christ of theology and the Lamb of God.For the churches  (επ ταις εκκλησιαις). For this use of επ see Revelation 10:11; John 12:16. It is not just for the seven churches (Revelation 1:4), but for all the churches in the world then and now.I am the root and the offspring of David  (Εγω ειμ η ριζα κα το γενος Δαυειδ). See Revelation 5:5 for "the root of David," to which John now adds το γενος in the sense of "offspring" (Acts 17:28), not of family or race (Acts 4:6; Acts 7:13). Cf. Matthew 22:42-45.The bright, the morning star  (ο αστηρ ο λαμπρος ο πρωινος). The Davidic King is called a star in Numbers 24:17; Luke 1:78. This "day-star" (φωσφορος) is interpreted as Christ (2 Peter 1:19). In Revelation 2:28 the phrase "the morning star" occurs in Christ's words, which is here interpreted. Christ is the Light that was coming into the world (John 1:9; John 8:12).
