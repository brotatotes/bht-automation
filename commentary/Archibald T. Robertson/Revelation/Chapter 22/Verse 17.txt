<p><b> The Spirit and the bride </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πνευμα κα η νυμφη</span></span>). The Holy Spirit, speaking through the prophets or the Spirit of prophecy (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:7">Revelation 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:4">Revelation 16:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:24">Revelation 18:24</span>), joins with the bride (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>), the people of God, in a response to the voice of Jesus just heard. After the picture of heaven in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1-5">Revelation 22:1-5</span> there is intense longing (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7">Revelation 19:7</span>) of God's people for the consummation of the marriage of the Lamb and the Bride. So now "the prophets and the saints" (Swete) make a common plea to the Lord Jesus to "come" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ερχου</span></span>, present middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, Come on) as he has just said twice that he would do (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:12">Revelation 22:12</span>). The call for Christ is to be repeated by every hearer (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ακουων</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Let him come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχεσθω</span></span>). Change of person and this verb applied not to Christ as just before, but to the one who wishes to greet Christ. The thirsty man is bidden to come himself before it is too late. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διψαω</span></span>, used for spiritual thirst, and in particular <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:35">John 6:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span> for one thirsting for the water of life (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:6">Revelation 21:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:1">Isaiah 55:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>He that will </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θελων</span></span>). Even if not yet eagerly thirsting. This one is welcome also. For this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελω</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:13">Philippians 2:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>Let him take </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαβετω</span></span>). Second ingressive aorist active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>. In accordance with the free promise in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:6">Revelation 21:6</span>, "freely" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωρεαν</span></span>) here as there. This gracious and wide invitation is cheering after the gloomy picture of the doomed and the damned. The warnings against the dragon and the two beasts with all their dreadful consequences are meant to deter men from falling victims to all the devil's devices then and now. The door of mercy still stands wide open today, for the end has not yet come. The series of panoramas is over, with the consummation pictured as a reality. Now we drop back to the standpoint before we saw the visions through John's eyes. In verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:17">Revelation 22:17</span> we hear the voice of the Spirit of God inviting all who hear and see to heed and to come and drink of the water of life freely offered by the Lamb of God. </p>
