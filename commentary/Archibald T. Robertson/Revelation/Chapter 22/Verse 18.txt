<p><b> I testify </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω μαρτυρω</span></span>). Commentators disagree keenly about the words in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:18">Revelation 22:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:19">Revelation 22:19</span>. Charles rejects them as an interpolation and out of harmony with the rest of the book. Beckwith takes them to be John's own warning, drawn from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+4:2">Deuteronomy 4:2</span> "to every man that heareth" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντ τω ακουοντ</span></span>, dative of the articular present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακουω</span></span>, which compare <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>). Swete properly holds these verses to be from Jesus himself, still bearing solemn witness to this book, with warning against wilful perversion of its teachings.</p>
<p><b>If any man shall add </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν τις επιθη</span></span>). Condition of the third class with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιτιθημ</span></span>, with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> added with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτα</span></span>, as also in the conclusion <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιθησε επ' αυτον</span></span> (future active). This warning is directed against perversions of this book, not about the New Testament or the Bible as a whole, though it may be true there also. Surely no warning was more needed when we consider the treatment accorded the Apocalypse, so that Dr. Robert South said that the Apocalypse either found one crazy or left him so. </p>
