Connected probably with the river in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span>, though many connect it with verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:2">Revelation 22:2</span>. Only one street mentioned here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:21">Revelation 21:21</span>.</p>

<p><b>The tree of life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυλον ζωης</span></span>). For the metaphor see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:11">Genesis 1:11</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:7">Revelation 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:14">Revelation 22:14</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ξυλον</span></span> is used for a green tree in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:31">Luke 23:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+47:12">Ezekiel 47:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>Bearing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιουν</span></span>). Neuter active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span> (making, producing, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:17">Matthew 7:17</span>). Some MSS. have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιων</span></span> (masculine), though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ξυλον</span></span> is neuter.</p>

<p><b>For the healing of the nations </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις θεραπειαν των εθνων</span></span>). Spiritual healing, of course, as leaves (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυλλα</span></span>) are often used for obtaining medicines.
