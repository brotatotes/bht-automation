 In the midst of the street thereof  (εν μεσω της πλατειας αυτης). Connected probably with the river in verse Revelation 22:1, though many connect it with verse Revelation 22:2. Only one street mentioned here as in Revelation 21:21.On this side of the river and on that  (του ποταμου εντευθεν κα εκειθεν). Εντευθεν occurs as a preposition in Daniel 12:5 (Theodoret) and may be so here (post-positive), purely adverbial in John 19:18.The tree of life  (ξυλον ζωης). For the metaphor see Genesis 1:11 and Revelation 2:7; Revelation 22:14. Ξυλον is used for a green tree in Luke 23:31; Ezekiel 47:12.Bearing  (ποιουν). Neuter active participle of ποιεω (making, producing, as in Matthew 7:17). Some MSS. have ποιων (masculine), though ξυλον is neuter.Twelve manner of fruits  (καρπους δωδεκα). "Twelve fruits."Yielding  (αποδιδουν). Neuter active participle of αποδιδωμ, to give back, but some MSS. have αποδιδους (masculine) like ποιων.For the healing of the nations  (εις θεραπειαν των εθνων). Spiritual healing, of course, as leaves (φυλλα) are often used for obtaining medicines. Here again the problem occurs whether this picture is heaven before the judgment or afterwards. Charles distinguishes sharply between the Heavenly City for the millennial reign and the New Jerusalem that descends from heaven after the judgment. Charles rearranges these chapters to suit his theory. But chronology is precarious here.
