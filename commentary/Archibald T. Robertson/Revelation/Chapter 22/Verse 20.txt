 He which testifieth  (ο μαρτυρων). That is Jesus (Revelation 1:2) who has just spoken (Revelation 22:18).Yea: I come quickly  (Ναι, ερχομα ταχυ). Affirmation again of the promise in Revelation 22:7; Revelation 22:12. On Να (Yes) see Revelation 1:7 for the Lord's assent to the call. Then John expresses his absolute belief in the Lord's promise: "Amen: come, Lord Jesus" (Αμην, ερχου, Κυριε Ιησου). On Αμην see Revelation 1:7. On ερχου see Revelation 22:17. Note Κυριε with Ιησου. As in 1 Corinthians 12:3; Philippians 2:11. For Paul's confidence in the deity of Christ and the certainty of his second coming see Titus 2:13; 2 Timothy 4:8. Μαρανα θα (1 Corinthians 16:22).
