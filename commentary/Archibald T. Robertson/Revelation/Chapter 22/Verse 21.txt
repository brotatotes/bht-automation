 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with the saints  (η χαρις του Κυριου Ιησου μετα των αγιων). John's own benediction, an unusual ending for an apocalypse, but suitable for one meant to be read in the churches (Revelation 1:3). Grace is Paul's unvarying word in conclusion of his letters, as is true of Hebrews 13:25. "The saints" or the consecrated (ο αγιο) is John's constant word for believers in Christ (Revelation 8:3; Revelation 11:18; Revelation 13:7; Revelation 13:10; Revelation 14:12; Revelation 16:6; Revelation 17:6; Revelation 18:20; Revelation 18:24; Revelation 19:8; Revelation 20:9). It is a good word for the close of this marvellous picture of God's gracious provision for his people in earth and heaven.
