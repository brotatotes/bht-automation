<p><b> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with the saints </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η χαρις του Κυριου Ιησου μετα των αγιων</span></span>). John's own benediction, an unusual ending for an apocalypse, but suitable for one meant to be read in the churches (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>). Grace is Paul's unvarying word in conclusion of his letters, as is true of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:25">Hebrews 13:25</span>. "The saints" or the consecrated (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αγιο</span></span>) is John's constant word for believers in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:3">Revelation 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:18">Revelation 11:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:7">Revelation 13:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:10">Revelation 13:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:12">Revelation 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:6">Revelation 16:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:6">Revelation 17:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:20">Revelation 18:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:24">Revelation 18:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:8">Revelation 19:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:9">Revelation 20:9</span>). It is a good word for the close of this marvellous picture of God's gracious provision for his people in earth and heaven. </p>
