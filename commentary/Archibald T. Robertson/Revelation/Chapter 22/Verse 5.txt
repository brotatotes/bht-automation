<p><b> Shall be night no more </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νυξ ουκ εστα ετ</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:25">Revelation 21:25</span>.</p>
<p><b>They need </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχουσιν χρειαν</span></span>). Present active indicative, "They have need," though A has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσιν</span></span> (shall have), future like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστα</span></span>. Here again there is repetition of part of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:23">Revelation 21:23</span>, but for the purpose of showing the delightsomeness of the New Jerusalem with no need of lamp or sun (change to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φως</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλιου</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωτος</span></span>, "they have no light of sun").</p>
<p><b>Shall give them light </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωτισε</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωτιζω</span></span>, while aorist <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφωτισεν</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:23">Revelation 21:23</span>.</p>
<p><b>They shall reign </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλευσουσιν</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλευω</span></span>. Reign eternally in contrast with the limited millennial reign of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:6">Revelation 20:6</span>. This glorious eternal reign with Christ occurs repeatedly in the book (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:6">Revelation 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:10">Revelation 5:10</span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:30">Luke 22:30</span>. Christ's Kingdom is spiritual (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:36">John 18:36</span>). "The visions of the Apocalypse are now ended; they have reached their climax in the New Jerusalem" (Swete). Now John gives the parting utterances of some of the speakers, and it is not always clear who is speaking. </p>
