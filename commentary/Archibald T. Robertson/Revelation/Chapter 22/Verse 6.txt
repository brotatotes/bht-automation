 He said unto me  (ειπεν μο). Apparently the same angel as in Revelation 22:1 (Revelation 21:9; Revelation 21:15).These words  (ουτο ο λογο). The same words used in Revelation 21:5 by the angel there. Whatever the application there, here the angel seems to endorse as "faithful and true" (πιστο κα αληθινο) not merely the preceding vision (Revelation 21:9-22), but the revelations of the entire book. The language added proves this: "Sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass" (απεστειλεν τον αγγελον αυτου δειξα τοις δουλοις αυτου α δε γενεσθα εν ταχε), a direct reference to Revelation 1:1 concerning the purpose of Christ's revelation to John in this book. For "the God of the spirits of the prophets" (ο θεος των πνευματων των προφητων) see Revelation 19:10; 1 Corinthians 14:32. Probably the prophets' own spirits enlightened by the Holy Spirit (Revelation 10:7; Revelation 11:8; Revelation 22:9).
