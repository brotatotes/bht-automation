<p><b> He said unto me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπεν μο</span></span>). Apparently the same angel as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:15">Revelation 21:15</span>).</p>
<p><b>These words </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτο ο λογο</span></span>). The same words used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:5">Revelation 21:5</span> by the angel there. Whatever the application there, here the angel seems to endorse as "faithful and true" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστο κα αληθινο</span></span>) not merely the preceding vision (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9-22">Revelation 21:9-22</span>), but the revelations of the entire book. The language added proves this: "Sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεστειλεν τον αγγελον αυτου δειξα τοις δουλοις αυτου α δε γενεσθα εν ταχε</span></span>), a direct reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span> concerning the purpose of Christ's revelation to John in this book. For "the God of the spirits of the prophets" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος των πνευματων των προφητων</span></span>) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:32">1 Corinthians 14:32</span>. Probably the prophets' own spirits enlightened by the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:7">Revelation 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:8">Revelation 11:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:9">Revelation 22:9</span>). </p>
