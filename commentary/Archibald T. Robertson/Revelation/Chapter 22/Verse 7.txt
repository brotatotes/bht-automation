<p><b> And behold, I come quickly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ιδου ερχομα ταχυ</span></span>). Christ is the speaker, either through this angel or more probably directly from Christ without introduction as in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:12">Revelation 22:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:16">Revelation 22:16</span>. About Christ coming quickly see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:5">Revelation 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:16">Revelation 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:11">Revelation 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:15">Revelation 16:15</span>, and already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:2">Revelation 1:2</span>. Once more we must recall that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταχυ</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ταχε</span></span> are according to God's time, not ours (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:8">2 Peter 3:8</span>).</p>
<p><b>Blessed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μακαριος</span></span>). This beatitude is like in substance the first (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>) and is in Christ's own words like the one in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:15">Revelation 16:15</span>. This book is here called a "prophecy" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προφητειας</span></span>) as in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:10">Revelation 22:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:18">Revelation 22:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:19">Revelation 22:19</span>. It is Christ's revelation from God, a direct message from God. Part of it is prediction of doom on Christ's enemies, but most of it is a comforting picture of final triumph and bliss for the faithful in a time of great distress and persecution. </p>
