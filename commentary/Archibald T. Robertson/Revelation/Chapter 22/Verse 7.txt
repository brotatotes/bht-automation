 And behold, I come quickly  (κα ιδου ερχομα ταχυ). Christ is the speaker, either through this angel or more probably directly from Christ without introduction as in verses Revelation 22:12; Revelation 22:16. About Christ coming quickly see Revelation 2:5; Revelation 2:16; Revelation 3:11; Revelation 16:15, and already in Revelation 1:2. Once more we must recall that ταχυ and εν ταχε are according to God's time, not ours (2 Peter 3:8).Blessed  (μακαριος). This beatitude is like in substance the first (Revelation 1:3) and is in Christ's own words like the one in Revelation 16:15. This book is here called a "prophecy" (προφητειας) as in verses Revelation 22:10; Revelation 22:18; Revelation 22:19. It is Christ's revelation from God, a direct message from God. Part of it is prediction of doom on Christ's enemies, but most of it is a comforting picture of final triumph and bliss for the faithful in a time of great distress and persecution.
