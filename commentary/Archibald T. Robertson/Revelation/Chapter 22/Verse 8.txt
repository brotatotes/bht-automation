<p><b> And I John </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Καγω Ιωαννης</span></span>). Here John the Seer is the speaker. He had already given his name (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>). Here he claims to be the "one who hears and sees these things" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ακουων κα βλεπων ταυτα</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>I fell down to worship </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεσα προσκυνησα</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιπτω</span></span> (with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-α</span></span> form) and the first aorist active infinitive of purpose of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσκυνεω</span></span>. It was a natural, though a wrong, thing to do, especially after Christ's own voice followed that of the angel "which shewed me these things" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του δεικνυοντος ταυτα</span></span>). Genitive singular of the articular present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεικνυω</span></span>. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span>. </p>
