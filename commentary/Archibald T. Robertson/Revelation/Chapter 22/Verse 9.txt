 See thou do it not  (Hορα μη). The angel promptly interposes (λεγε, dramatic present). See Revelation 19:10 for discussion of this same phrase ορα μη when John had once before started to worship the angel in his excitement. Here we have added to the words in Revelation 19:10 "the prophets (των προφητων) and also "them which keep the words of this book" (των τηρουντων τους λογους του βιβλιου τουτου), the last a repetition from Revelation 22:7. In both places we have "Worship God" (τω θεω προσκυνησον). And not an angel.
