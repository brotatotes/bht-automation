<p><b> See thou do it not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hορα μη</span></span>). The angel promptly interposes (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγε</span></span>, dramatic present). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span> for discussion of this same phrase <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορα μη</span></span> when John had once before started to worship the angel in his excitement. Here we have added to the words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span> "the prophets (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των προφητων</span></span>) and also "them which keep the words of this book" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των τηρουντων τους λογους του βιβλιου τουτου</span></span>), the last a repetition from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:7">Revelation 22:7</span>. In both places we have "Worship God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω θεω προσκυνησον</span></span>). And not an angel. </p>
