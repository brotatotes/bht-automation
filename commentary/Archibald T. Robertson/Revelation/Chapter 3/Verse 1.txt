<p><b> In Sardis </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Σαρδεσιν</span></span>). Some thirty miles south-east of Thyatira, old capital of Lydia, wealthy and the home of Croesus, conquered by Cyrus and then by Alexander the Great, in B.C. 214 by Antiochus the Great, at the crossing of Roman roads, in a plain watered by the river Pactolus, according to Pliny the place where the dyeing of wool was discovered, seat of the licentious worship of Cybele and the ruins of the temple still there, called by Ramsay (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 354) "the city of Death," city of softness and luxury, of apathy and immorality, "a contrast of past splendour and present unresting decline" (Charles). Along with Laodicea it was blamed most of all the seven churches.</p>
<p><b>That hath the seven Spirits of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εχων τα επτα πνευματα του θεου</span></span>). For which picture of the Holy Spirit see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>And the seven stars </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τους επτα αστερας</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>A name that thou livest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα οτ ζηις</span></span>). A name in contrast with reality. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> clause in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>And thou art dead </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα νεκρος ε</span></span>). "The paradox of death under the name of life" (Swete). Not complete (a nucleus of life) death (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:2">Revelation 3:2</span>), but rapidly dying. See the picture in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:17">James 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:9">2 Corinthians 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:5">2 Timothy 3:5</span>. </p>
