 I come quickly  (ερχομα ταχυ). As in Revelation 2:16; Revelation 22:7; Revelation 22:12; Revelation 22:20. "The keynote of the book" (Beckwith). But allow the author's own meaning of "quickly."Hold fast that which thou hast  (κρατε ο εχεις). Sort of motto for each church (Revelation 2:25).That no one take  (ινα μηδεις λαβη). Purpose clause with ινα and second aorist active subjunctive of λαμβανω. Here to take away "thy crown" (Revelation 2:10) which will be thine if really won and not forfeited by failure (2 Timothy 4:8). In that case it will go to another (Matthew 25:28; Romans 11:17).
