 He that overcometh  (ο νικων). Nominative absolute as in Revelation 2:26, resumed by the accusative αυτον (him).A pillar  (στυλον). Old word for column, in N.T. only here, Revelation 10:1; Galatians 2:9; 1 Timothy 3:15. Metaphorical and personal use with a double significance of being firmly fixed and giving stability to the building. Philadelphia was a city of earthquakes. "Temple" (ναος) here is also metaphorical (Revelation 7:15), as in 1 Timothy 3:15 for the people of God. In Revelation 21:22 we read that there is no temple in the heavenly Jerusalem (Revelation 21:10-22) descending as the new Jerusalem with God himself as the temple, though the metaphorical temple is mentioned in Revelation 7:15.He shall go out thence no more  (εξω ου μη ελθη). Strong double negative ου μη with the second aorist active subjunctive of ερχομα. The subject is ο νικων (the one overcoming). "Fixity of character is at last achieved" (Charles). He, like the στυλος (pillar), remains in place.Upon him  (επ' αυτον). Upon ο νικων (the victor), not upon the pillar (στυλος). He receives this triple name (of God, of the city of God, of Christ) on his forehead (Revelation 14:1; Revelation 7:3; Revelation 17:5; Revelation 22:4) just as the high-priest wore the name of Jehovah upon his forehead (Exodus 28:36; Exodus 28:38), the new name (Revelation 2:17), without any magical or talismanic power, but as proof of ownership by God, as a citizen of the New Jerusalem, with the new symbol of the glorious personality of Christ (Revelation 19:12), in contrast with the mark of the beast on others (Revelation 13:17; Revelation 14:17). For citizenship in God's city see Galatians 4:26; Philippians 3:20; Hebrews 11:10; Hebrews 12:22; Hebrews 13:14.The new Jerusalem  (της καινης Ιερουσαλημ). Not νεας (young), but καινης (fresh). See also Revelation 21:2; Revelation 21:10 and already Galatians 4:26; Hebrews 12:22. Charles distinguishes between the Jerusalem before the final judgment and this new Jerusalem after that event. Perhaps so! In the Apocalypse always this form Ιερουσαλημ (Revelation 3:12; Revelation 21:2; Revelation 21:10), but in John's Gospel Hιεροσολυμα (Revelation 1:19, etc.).Which cometh down  (η καταβαινουσα). Nominative case in apposition with the preceding genitive πολεως as in Revelation 1:5; Revelation 2:20, etc.Mine own new name  (το ονομα μου το καινον). For which see Revelation 2:17; Revelation 19:12; Revelation 19:16. Christ himself will receive a new name along with all else in the future world (Gressmann).
