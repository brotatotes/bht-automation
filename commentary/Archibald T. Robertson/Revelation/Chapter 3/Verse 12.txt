<p><b> He that overcometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο νικων</span></span>). Nominative absolute as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:26">Revelation 2:26</span>, resumed by the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτον</span></span> (him).</p>
<p><b>A pillar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στυλον</span></span>). Old word for column, in N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:1">Revelation 10:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span>. Metaphorical and personal use with a double significance of being firmly fixed and giving stability to the building. Philadelphia was a city of earthquakes. "Temple" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ναος</span></span>) here is also metaphorical (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:15">Revelation 7:15</span>), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span> for the people of God. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:22">Revelation 21:22</span> we read that there is no temple in the heavenly Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:10-22">Revelation 21:10-22</span>) descending as the new Jerusalem with God himself as the temple, though the metaphorical temple is mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:15">Revelation 7:15</span>.</p>
<p><b>He shall go out thence no more </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξω ου μη ελθη</span></span>). Strong double negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span> with the second aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>. The subject is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο νικων</span></span> (the one overcoming). "Fixity of character is at last achieved" (Charles). He, like the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στυλος</span></span> (pillar), remains in place.</p>
<p><b>Upon him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ' αυτον</span></span>). Upon <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο νικων</span></span> (the victor), not upon the pillar (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στυλος</span></span>). He receives this triple name (of God, of the city of God, of Christ) on his forehead (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:3">Revelation 7:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:5">Revelation 17:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:4">Revelation 22:4</span>) just as the high-priest wore the name of Jehovah upon his forehead (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:36">Exodus 28:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:38">Exodus 28:38</span>), the new name (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>), without any magical or talismanic power, but as proof of ownership by God, as a citizen of the New Jerusalem, with the new symbol of the glorious personality of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:12">Revelation 19:12</span>), in contrast with the mark of the beast on others (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:17">Revelation 13:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:17">Revelation 14:17</span>). For citizenship in God's city see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:26">Galatians 4:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:20">Philippians 3:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:10">Hebrews 11:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:22">Hebrews 12:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:14">Hebrews 13:14</span>.</p>
<p><b>The new Jerusalem </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της καινης Ιερουσαλημ</span></span>). Not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νεας</span></span> (young), but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινης</span></span> (fresh). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:10">Revelation 21:10</span> and already <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:26">Galatians 4:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:22">Hebrews 12:22</span>. Charles distinguishes between the Jerusalem before the final judgment and this new Jerusalem after that event. Perhaps so! In the Apocalypse always this form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιερουσαλημ</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:10">Revelation 21:10</span>), but in John's Gospel <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hιεροσολυμα</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:19">Revelation 1:19</span>, etc.).</p>
<p><b>Which cometh down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η καταβαινουσα</span></span>). Nominative case in apposition with the preceding genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολεως</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:20">Revelation 2:20</span>, etc.</p>
<p><b>Mine own new name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ονομα μου το καινον</span></span>). For which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:12">Revelation 19:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:16">Revelation 19:16</span>. Christ himself will receive a new name along with all else in the future world (Gressmann). </p>
