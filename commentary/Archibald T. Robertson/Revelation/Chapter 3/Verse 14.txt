<p><b> In Laodicea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Λαοδικια</span></span>). Forty miles south-east of Philadelphia and some forty miles east of Ephesus, the last of the seven churches addressed with special messages, on the river Lycus on the border of Phrygia, near Colossae and Hierapolis, recipient of two letters by Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:16">Colossians 4:16</span>), on the great trade-route from Ephesus to the east and seat of large manufacturing and banking operations (especially of woollen carpets and clothing, Ramsay, <i>Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia</i>, p. 40ff.), centre of the worship of Asklepios and seat of a medical school and also of a provincial court where Cicero lived and wrote many of his letters, home of many Jews, called by Ramsay (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 413) "the City of Compromise," the church here founded apparently by Epaphras (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:7">Colossians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:12">Colossians 4:12</span>), now a deserted ruin, one of six cities with this name (meaning justice of the people). No praise is bestowed on this church, but only blame for its lukewarmness.</p>
<p><b>The Amen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Αμην</span></span>). Personal (masculine article) name here alone, though in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:16">Isaiah 65:16</span> we have "the God of Amen" understood in the LXX as "the God of truth" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον θεον τον αληθινον</span></span>). Here applied to Christ. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μαρτυς ο πιστος</span></span> (the faithful witness) and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:7">Revelation 3:7</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αληθινος</span></span> (the genuine), "whose testimony never falls short of the truth" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>The beginning of the creation of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αρχη της κτισεως του θεου</span></span>). Not the first of creatures as the Arians held and Unitarians do now, but the originating source of creation through whom God works (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>, a passage probably known to the Laodiceans, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>, as is made clear by <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:8">Revelation 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:13">Revelation 5:13</span>). </p>
