<p><b> I am rich </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ πλουσιος ειμ</span></span>). Recitative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> like quotation marks before direct quotation. Old adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλουτος</span></span>, riches, wealth. Laodicea was a wealthy city and the church "carried the pride of wealth into its spiritual life" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>Have gotten riches </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπλουτηκα</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλουτεω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλουτος</span></span>, used here of imagined spiritual riches which the church did not possess, just the opposite of church in Smyrna (poor in wealth, rich in grace). This church was in a rich city and was rich in pride and conceit, but poor in grace and ignorant of its spiritual poverty (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ οιδας</span></span>, knowest not).</p>
<p><b>The wretched one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ταλαιπωρος</span></span>). Old adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τλαω</span></span>, to endure, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πωρος</span></span>, a callus, afflicted, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:24">Romans 7:24</span>. Note the one article in the predicate with all these five adjectives unifying the picture of sharp emphasis on "thou" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ</span></span>), "thou that boastest."</p>
<p><b>Miserable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελεεινος</span></span>). Pitiable as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:19">1 Corinthians 15:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>Poor </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πτωχος</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:9">Revelation 2:9</span> for spiritual poverty. Perhaps some local example of self-complacency is in mind.</p>
<p><b>Blind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυφλος</span></span>). Spiritual blindness as often (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:17">Matthew 23:17</span>), and note "eye-salve" in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:18">Revelation 3:18</span>.</p>
<p><b>Naked </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυμνος</span></span>). "The figure completes the picture of actual poverty" (Beckwith). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:15">Revelation 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:16">Revelation 3:16</span>. </p>
