<p><b> He that overcometh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο νικων</span></span>). Absolute nominative again as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span>, but resumed this time by the dative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτω</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:26">Revelation 2:26</span>.</p>
<p><b>To sit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθισα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθιζω</span></span>. This promise grows out of the prophecy that the saints will share in the Messiah's rule, made to the twelve (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:29">Luke 22:29</span>), repeated by Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:2">1 Corinthians 6:2</span>), enlarged in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1-5">Revelation 22:1-5</span> (to last forever, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11">2 Timothy 2:11</span>). James and John took this hope and promise literally (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:40">Mark 10:40</span>) not metaphorically.</p>
<p><b>As I also overcame </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως καγω ενικησα</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νικαω</span></span>, looking back on the victory as over in the past. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33">John 16:33</span> before the Cross Jesus says <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εγω νενικηκα τον κοσμον</span></span> (perfect active), emphasizing the abiding effect of the victory.</p>
<p><b>Sat down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαθισα</span></span>). "I took my seat" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>) where Christ is now (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:3">Revelation 22:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:1">Colossians 3:1</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27">Revelation 2:27</span>. Each of these seven messages begins alike and ends alike. Each is the message of the Christ and of the Holy Spirit to the angel of the church. Each has a special message suited to the actual condition of each church. In each case the individual who overcomes has a promise of blessing. Christ the Shepherd knows his sheep and lays bare the particular peril in each case. </p>
