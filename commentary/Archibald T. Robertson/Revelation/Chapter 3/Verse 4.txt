 A few names  (ολιγα ονοματα). This use of ονομα for persons is seen in the Koine (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 196f.) as in Acts 1:15; Revelation 11:13.Did not defile  (ουκ εμολυναν). First aorist active indicative of μολυνω (1 Corinthians 8:7; 1 Peter 1:4), pollution.They shall walk  (περιπατησουσιν). Future active of περιπατεω, promise of fellowship with Christ (μετ' εμου, with me) "in white" (εν λευκοις), as symbols of purity (Revelation 7:9; Revelation 7:13) like the angel (Matthew 28:3), with possibly a reference to Enoch (Genesis 5:22). For they are worthy (οτ αξιο εισιν). To walk with Christ, not worthy in the same sense as God and Christ (Revelation 4:11; Revelation 5:9), but in a relative sense. See Revelation 16:6 for bad sense of αξιος.
