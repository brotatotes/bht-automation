<p><b> In Philadelphia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Φιλαδελφια</span></span>). Some twenty-eight miles south-east of Sardis, in Lydia, subject to earthquakes, rebuilt by Tiberius after the great earthquake of A.D. 17, for a time called in coins Neo-Caesarea, in wine-growing district with Bacchus (Dionysos) as the chief deity, on fine Roman roads and of commercial importance, though not a large city, called by Ramsay (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 392) "the Missionary City" to promote the spread of the Graeco-Roman civilization and then of Christianity, later offering stubborn resistance to the Turks (1379-90 A.D.) and now called Ala-Sheher (reddish city, Charles, from the red hills behind it). The chief opposition to the faithful little church is from the Jews (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9-11">Revelation 3:9-11</span>). There are some 1,000 Christians there today.</p>
<p><b>The holy, he that is true </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο αγιοσ, ο αληθινος</span></span>). Separate articles (four in all) for each item in this description. "The holy, the genuine." Asyndeton in the Greek. Latin Vulgate, <i>Sanctus et Verus</i>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hο αγιος</span></span> is ascribed to God in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:8">Revelation 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:10">Revelation 6:10</span> (both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθινος</span></span> as here), but to Christ in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:24">Mark 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:34">Luke 4:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:69">John 6:69</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:27">Acts 4:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:30">Acts 4:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:20">1 John 2:20</span>, a recognized title of the Messiah as the consecrated one set apart. Swete notes that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθινος</span></span> is <i>verus</i> as distinguished from <i>verax</i> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθης</span></span>). So it is applied to God in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:10">Revelation 6:10</span> and to Christ in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:11">Revelation 19:11</span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:32">John 6:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:1">John 15:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>He that hath the key of David </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εχων την κλειν Δαυειδ</span></span>). This epithet comes from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+22:22">Isaiah 22:22</span>, where Eliakim as the chief steward of the royal household holds the keys of power. Christ as the Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:5">Revelation 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:16">Revelation 22:16</span>) has exclusive power in heaven, on earth, and in Hades (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:9">Romans 14:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9">Philippians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>). Christ has power to admit and exclude of his own will (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:10">Matthew 25:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:22">Ephesians 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:11-16">Revelation 19:11-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:16">Revelation 22:16</span>).</p>
<p><b>And none shall shut </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουδεις κλεισε</span></span>). Charles calls the structure Hebrew (future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλειω</span></span>), and not Greek because it does not correspond to the present articular participle just before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ανοιγων</span></span> (the one opening), but it occurs often in this book as in the very next clause, "and none openeth" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουδεις ανοιγε</span></span>) over against <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλειων</span></span> (present active participle, opening) though here some MSS. read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλειε</span></span> (present active indicative, open). </p>
