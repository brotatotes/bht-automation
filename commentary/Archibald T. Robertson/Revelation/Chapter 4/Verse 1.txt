 After these things  (μετα ταυτα). Change in the panorama, not chronology (Revelation 7:1; Revelation 7:9; Revelation 15:5; Revelation 18:1; Revelation 19:1). This vision is of heaven, not of earth as was true of chapters Revelation 4:1; Revelation 4:2. The first vision of Christ and the messages to the seven churches began in Revelation 1:12. This new vision of the throne in heaven (Revelation 4:1-11) succeeds that to which it here alludes.I saw  (ειδον). Second aorist active indicative of οραω.Behold  (ιδου). Exclamation of vivid emotion as John looked. No effect on the structure and nominative case θυρα (door) follows it.Opened  (ηνεωιγμενη). Perfect (triple reduplication) passive participle of ανοιγω as in Revelation 3:8 (door of opportunity) and Revelation 3:20 (door of the heart), here the door of revelation (Swete).In heaven  (εν τω ουρανω). As in Ezekiel 1:1; Mark 1:10; John 1:51. In Revelation always in singular except Revelation 12:12.The first  (η πρωτη). Reference is to Revelation 1:10.Speaking  (λαλουσης). From λαλεω, rather λεγουσης of Revelation 1:10 from λεγω, both agreeing with σαλπιγγος (trumpet).Saying  (λεγων). Present active participle of λεγω repeating the idea of λαλουσης, but in the nominative masculine singular construed with φωνη (feminine singular), construction according to sense because of the person behind the voice as in Revelation 11:15; Revelation 19:14.Come up  (αναβα). Short Koine form for αναβηθ (second aorist active imperative second person singular of αναβαινω).Hither  (ωδε). Originally "here," but vernacular use (John 6:25; John 10:27).I will show  (δειξω). Future active of δεικνυμ in same sense in Revelation 1:1.Hereafter  (μετα ταυτα). Some editors (Westcott and Hort) connect these words with the beginning of verse Revelation 4:2.
