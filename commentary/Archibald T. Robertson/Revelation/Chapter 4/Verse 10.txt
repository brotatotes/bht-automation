<p><b> Shall fall down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεσουντα</span></span>, future middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιπτω</span></span>),</p>

<p><b>shall cast their crowns </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλουσιν τους στεφανους</span></span>, future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαλλω</span></span>). The two actions by the two groups (living creatures, elders) are coordinated (simultaneous in the repetition). They thus acknowledge that all this kingly dignity comes from God, who is King of kings and Lord of lords. Charles takes the elders, however, to be angels, not redeemed men. </p>
