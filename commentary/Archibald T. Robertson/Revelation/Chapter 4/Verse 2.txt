 Straightway I was in the Spirit  (ευθεως εγενομην εν πνευματ). But John had already "come to be in the Spirit" (Revelation 1:10, the very same phrase). Perhaps here effective aorist middle indicative while ingressive aorist in Revelation 1:10 (sequel or result, not entrance), "At once I found myself in the Spirit" (Swete), not "I came to be in the Spirit" as in Revelation 1:10.Was set  (εκειτο). Imperfect middle of κειμα, old verb, used as passive of τιθημ. As the vision opens John sees the throne already in place as the first thing in heaven. This bold imagery comes chiefly from 1 Kings 22:19; Isaiah 6:1; Ezekiel 1:26-28; Daniel 7:9. One should not forget that this language is glorious imagery, not actual objects in heaven. God is spirit. The picture of God on the throne is common in the O.T. and the N.T. (Matthew 5:34; Matthew 23:22; Hebrews 1:3 and in nearly every chapter in the Revelation, Revelation 1:4, etc.). The use of καθημενος (sitting) for the name of God is like the Hebrew avoidance of the name Jahweh and is distinguished from the Son in Revelation 6:16; Revelation 7:10.Upon the throne  (επ τον θρονον). Επ with the accusative, as in Revelation 4:4; Revelation 6:2; Revelation 6:4; Revelation 11:16; Revelation 20:4, but in verses Revelation 4:9; Revelation 4:10; Revelation 4:1; Revelation 4:7; Revelation 4:13; Revelation 6:16; Revelation 7:15 we have επ του θρονου (genitive), while in Revelation 7:10; Revelation 19:14; Revelation 21:5 we have επ τω θρονω (locative) with no great distinction in the resultant idea.
