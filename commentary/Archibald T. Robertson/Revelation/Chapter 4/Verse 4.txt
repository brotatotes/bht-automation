 Round about the throne  (κυκλοθεν του θρονου). Here as a preposition with the genitive, though only adverb in Revelation 4:8 (only N.T. examples save Textus Rec. in Revelation 5:11).Four and twenty thrones  (θρονο εικοσ τεσσαρες). So P Q, but Aleph A have accusative θρονους (supply ειδον from Revelation 4:1) and τεσσαρες (late accusative in -ες). This further circle of thrones beyond the great throne.I saw four and twenty elders  (εικοσ τεσσαρας πρεσβυτερους). No ειδον in the text, but the accusative case calls for it. Twenty-four as a symbolic number occurs only in this book and only for these elders (Revelation 4:4; Revelation 4:10; Revelation 5:8; Revelation 11:16; Revelation 19:4). We do not really know why this number is chosen, perhaps two elders for each tribe, perhaps the twelve tribes and the twelve apostles (Judaism and Christianity), perhaps the twenty-four courses of the sons of Aaron (1 Chronicles 24:1-19), perhaps some angelic rank (Colossians 1:16) of which we know nothing. Cf. Ephesians 2:6.Sitting  (καθημενους). Upon their thrones.Arrayed  (περιβεβλημενους). Perfect passive participle of περιβαλλω (to throw around).In white garments  (ιματιοις λευκοις). Locative case here as in Revelation 3:5 (with εν), though accusative in Revelation 7:9; Revelation 7:13.Crowns of gold  (στεφανους χρυσους). Accusative case again like πρεσβυτερους after ειδον (Revelation 4:1), not ιδου. In Revelation 19:14 εχων (having) is added. John uses διαδημα (diadem) for the kingly crown in Revelation 12:3; Revelation 13:1; Revelation 19:12, but it is not certain that the old distinction between διαδεμ as the kingly crown and στεφανος as the victor's wreath is always observed in late Greek.
