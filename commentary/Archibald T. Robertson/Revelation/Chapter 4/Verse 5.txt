 Out of the throne  (εκ του θρονου). Back to the throne itself. The imagery is kin to that in Exodus 19:16; Exodus 24:9; Ezekiel 1:22; Ezekiel 1:27.Proceed  (εκπορευοντα). Graphic historical present.Lightnings and voices and thunders  (αστραπα κα φωνα κα βροντα). So exactly in Revelation 11:19; Revelation 16:18, but in Revelation 8:5 with βροντα first, αστραπα last, all old and common words. "The thunderstorm is in Hebrew poetry a familiar symbol of the Divine power: cf., e.g., 1 Samuel 2:10; Psalms 18:9; Job 37:4." (Swete).Seven lamps of fire  (επτα λαμπαδες πυρος). Return to the nominative (ιδου, not ειδον) with ησαν (were) understood. Metaphor drawn from Ezekiel 1:13; Zechariah 4:12. Our word "lamp," but here a torch as in Revelation 8:10, identified with the Holy Spirit (the Seven Spirits of God) as in Revelation 1:4; Revelation 3:1, not λυχνια (lampstands) as in Revelation 1:12; Revelation 1:20, nor λυχνος a hand-lamp with oil (Matthew 5:15). "These torches blaze perpetually before the throne of God" (Swete).
