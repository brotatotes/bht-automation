<p><b> As it were a glassy sea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως θαλασσα υαλινη</span></span>). Old adjective (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υαλος</span></span>, glass, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:18">Revelation 21:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:21">Revelation 21:21</span>), in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+15:2">Revelation 15:2</span>. Possibly from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υε</span></span> (it rains), like a raindrop. At any rate here it is the appearance, not the material. Glass was made in Egypt 4,000 years ago. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:10">Exodus 24:10</span> the elders see under the feet of God in the theophany a paved work of sapphire stone (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:26">Ezekiel 1:26</span>). The likeness of the appearance of sky to sea suggests the metaphor here (Beckwith).</p>
<p><b>Like crystal </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοια κρυσταλλω</span></span>). Associative-instrumental case after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοια</span></span>. Old word, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρυος</span></span> (ice and sometimes used for ice), in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span>, not semi-opaque, but clear like rock-crystal.</p>
<p><b>In the midst of the throne </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν μεσω του θρονου</span></span>). As one looks from the front, really before.</p>
<p><b>Round about the throne </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυκλω του θρονου</span></span>). Merely an adverb in the locative case (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:19">Romans 15:19</span>), as a preposition in N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:11">Revelation 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:11">Revelation 7:11</span>. This seems to mean that on each of the four sides of the throne was one of the four living creatures either stationary or moving rapidly round (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:12">Ezekiel 1:12</span>).</p>
<p><b>Four living creatures </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεσσερα ζωα</span></span>). Not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θηρια</span></span> (beasts), but living creatures. Certainly kin to the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωα</span></span> of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:2">Revelation 4:2</span> which are cherubim (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+10:2">Ezekiel 10:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+10:20">Ezekiel 10:20</span>), though here the details vary as to faces and wings with a significance of John's own, probably representing creation in contrast with the redeemed (the elders).</p>
<p><b>Full of eyes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεμοντα οφθαλμων</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεμω</span></span>, to be full of, with the genitive, signifying here unlimited intelligence (Beckwith), the ceaseless vigilance of nature (Swete). </p>
