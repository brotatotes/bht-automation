<p><b> When the living creatures shall give </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν δωσουσιν τα ζωα</span></span>). Indefinite temporal clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> and the future active indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωσουσιν</span></span>) rather than the more common second aorist active subjunctive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωσιν</span></span>) with the notion of repetition rather than unbroken continuance, "whenever they give." The giving of praise and glory to God by the four living creatures (representatives of nature) is met by corresponding worship by the redeemed (the four and twenty elders). "Created life adores the Uncreated" (Swete), "to the one living for ages of ages." </p>
