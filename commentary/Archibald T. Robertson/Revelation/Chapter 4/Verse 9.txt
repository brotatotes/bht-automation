Indefinite temporal clause with οταν and the future active indicative (δωσουσιν) rather than the more common second aorist active subjunctive (δωσιν) with the notion of repetition rather than unbroken continuance, "whenever they give."

"Created life adores the Uncreated" (Swete), "to the one living for ages of ages."
