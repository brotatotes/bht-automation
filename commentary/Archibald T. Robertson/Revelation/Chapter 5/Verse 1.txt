 In the right hand  (επ την δεξιαν). "Upon the right hand" (επ, not εν), the open palm. Anthropomorphic language drawn from Ezekiel 2:9.A book  (βιβλιον). Diminutive of βιβλος, but no longer so used, βιβλαριδιον occurring instead (Revelation 10:2).Written  (γεγραμμενον). Perfect passive predicate participle of γραφω.Within and on the back  (εσωθεν κα οπισθεν). "Within and behind." Description of a roll like that in Luke 4:17, not a codex as some scholars think. Usually these papyrus rolls were written only on the inside, but this one was so full of matter that it was written also on the back side (οπισθεν), and so was an οπισθογραφον like that in Ezekiel 2:10. There are many allegorical interpretations of this fact which are all beside the point.Sealed  (κατεσφραγισμενον). Perfect passive predicate participle of κατασφραγιζω, old compound (perfective use of κατα), to seal up (down), here only in N.T.With seven seals  (σφραγισιν επτα). Instrumental case of σφραγις, old word used in various senses, proof or authentication (1 Corinthians 9:2; Romans 4:11), signet-ring (Revelation 7:2), impression made by the seal (Revelation 9:4; 2 Timothy 2:19), the seal on books closing the book (Revelation 5:1; Revelation 5:2; Revelation 5:5; Revelation 5:9; Revelation 6:1; Revelation 6:3; Revelation 6:5; Revelation 6:7; Revelation 6:9; Revelation 6:12; Revelation 8:1). "A will in Roman law bore the seven seals of the seven witnesses" (Charles). But this sealed book of doom calls for no witnesses beyond God's own will. Alford sees in the number seven merely the completeness of God's purposes.
