 And I saw  (κα ειδον). A new feature introduced by the outer and vaster circle (κυκλω) of angels who catch up the new song of redemption in antiphonal singing, answering the song of the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders. Some MSS. read ως (as if) before φωνην (voice). Ten thousand times ten thousand (μυριαδες μυριαδων κα χιλιαδες χιλιαδων). Literally, "myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands," a mild husteron-proteron. The regular order in I Enoch 40:I. See Daniel 7:10 for χιλια χιλιαδες (thousand thousands) and μυρια μυριαδες (countless myriads). They are all efforts to express the innumerable hosts of the angels.
