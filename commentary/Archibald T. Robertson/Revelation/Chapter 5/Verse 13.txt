<p><b> Every created thing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν κτισμα</span></span>). Every creature in a still wider antiphonal circle beyond the circle of angels (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτιζω</span></span>, for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:4">1 Timothy 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:18">James 1:18</span>), from all the four great fields of life (in heaven, upon the earth, under the earth as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:3">Revelation 5:3</span>, with on the sea <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ της θαλασσης</span></span> added). No created thing is left out. This universal chorus of praise to Christ from all created life reminds one of the profound mystical passage in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:20-22">Romans 8:20-22</span> concerning the sympathetic agony of creation (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτισις</span></span>) in hope of freedom from the bondage of corruption. If the trail of the serpent is on all creation, it will be ultimately thrown off.</p>
<p><b>Saying </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγοντας</span></span>). Masculine (construction according to sense, personifying the created things) if genuine, though some MSS. have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγοντα</span></span> (grammatical gender agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα</span></span>) present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγω</span></span>, to say.</p>
<p><b>And to the Lamb </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τω αρνιω</span></span>). Dative case. Praise and worship are rendered to the Lamb precisely as to God on the throne. Note separate articles here in the doxology as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:11">Revelation 4:11</span> and the addition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το κρατος</span></span> (active power) in place of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ισχυς</span></span> (reserve of strength) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:12">Revelation 5:12</span>. </p>
