<p><b> Amen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αμην</span></span>). The four living creatures give their approval to the doxology after the antiphonal songs.</p>
<p><b>Fell down and worshipped </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επεσαν κα προσεκυνησαν</span></span>). In silent adoration that closes the whole service of praise to the One upon the throne and to the Lamb. As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:10">Revelation 4:10</span> so here the representatives of the redeemed bow in silent worship. Pliny says that the Christians sing a song to Christ as to God. He is here worshipped by the universe (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:10">Philippians 2:10</span>). </p>
