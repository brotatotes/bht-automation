<p><b> He taketh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειληφεν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λαμβανω</span></span>, not used for the aorist (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλθεν</span></span>, he came), but vivid dramatic picture of the actual scene, "he has taken it." </p>
