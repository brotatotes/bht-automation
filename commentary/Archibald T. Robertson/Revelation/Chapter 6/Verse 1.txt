<p><b> And I saw </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ειδον</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:1">Revelation 5:1</span>. The vision unfolds without anything being said about opening the book and reading from it. In a more vivid and dramatic fashion the Lamb breaks the seals one by one and reveals the contents and the symbolism. The first four seals have a common note from one of the four <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωα</span></span> and the appearance of a horse. No effort will be made here to interpret these seals as referring to persons or historical events in the past, present, or future, but simply to relate the symbolism to the other symbols in the book. It is possible that there is some allusion here to the symbolism in the so-called "Little Apocalypse" of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:13">Revelation 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:24">Revelation 6:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:21">Revelation 6:21</span>. The imagery of the four horses is similar to that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+1:7-11">Zechariah 1:7-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:1-8">Zechariah 6:1-8</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+14:12">Jeremiah 14:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+24:10">Jeremiah 24:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+42:17">Jeremiah 42:17</span>). In the Old Testament the horse is often the emblem of war (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+39:25">Job 39:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+76:6">Psalms 76:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+21:31">Proverbs 21:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+26:10">Ezekiel 26:10</span>). "Homer pictures the horses of Rhesus as whiter than snow, and swift as the wind" (Vincent).</p>
<p><b>When the Lamb opened </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε ηνοιξεν το αρνιον</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοιγω</span></span>. This same phrase recurs in rhythmical order at the opening of each seal (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:1">Revelation 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:3">Revelation 6:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:5">Revelation 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:7">Revelation 6:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:12">Revelation 6:12</span>) till the last (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:1">Revelation 8:1</span>), where we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν ηνοιξεν</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε</span></span> calling particular attention to it).</p>
<p><b>One </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιαν</span></span>). Probably used here as an ordinal (the first) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:1">Matthew 28:1</span>. See Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 671f.</p>
<p><b>Of </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>). This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span> with the ablative in the partitive sense is common in the Apocalypse, as twice in this verse (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ των</span></span>, etc.). So <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενος εκ των</span></span> (one of the four living creatures) is "the first of," etc.</p>
<p><b>In a voice of thunder </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν φωνη βροντης</span></span>). Old word used of John and James (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:17">Mark 3:17</span>) and elsewhere in N.T. only <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:29">John 12:29</span> and a dozen times in the Apocalypse.</p>
<p><b>Come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ερχου</span></span>). Present middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχομα</span></span>, but with exclamatory force (not strictly linear). The command is not addressed to the Lamb nor to John (the correct text omits <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ιδε</span></span> "and see") as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span>, but to one of the four horsemen each time. Swete takes it as a call to Christ because <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχου</span></span> is so used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:17">Revelation 22:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:20">Revelation 22:20</span>, but that is not conclusive. </p>
