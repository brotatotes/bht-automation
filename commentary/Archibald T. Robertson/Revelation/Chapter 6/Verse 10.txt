 How long  (εως ποτε). "Until when." Cf. Matthew 7:17; John 10:24.O Master  (ο δεσποτης). Nominative articular form, but used as vocative (δεσποτα) as in Revelation 4:11 (John 20:28). On δεσποτης (correlative of δουλος) see Luke 2:29. Here (alone in the Apocalypse) it is applied to God as in Luke 2:29; Acts 4:24, but to Christ in Judges 1:4; 2 Peter 2:1.The holy and true  (ο αγιος κα αληθινος). See Revelation 3:7 for these attributes of God.Avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth  (εκδικεις το αιμα ημων εκ των κατοικουντων επ της γης). This same idiom in Revelation 19:2 and see it also in Luke 18:7, "a passage which goes far to answer many questions in theodicy" (Swete). We find εκδικεω, late compound, used with εκ as here in Deuteronomy 18:19; 1 Samuel 24:13, but with απο in Luke 18:3. For επ της γης (upon the earth) see Revelation 3:10.
