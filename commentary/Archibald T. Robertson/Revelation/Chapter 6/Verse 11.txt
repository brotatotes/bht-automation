For the verb αναπαυω see on Matthew 11:28.Until should be fulfilled  (εως πληρωθωσιν). Future indefinite temporal clause with εως and the first aorist passive subjunctive of πληροω, to fill full (Matthew 23:32; Colossians 2:10), "until be filled full" (the number of), regular Greek idiom.Which should be killed  (ο μελλοντες αποκτεννεσθα).

John foresees more persecution coming (Revelation 2:10; Revelation 3:10).
