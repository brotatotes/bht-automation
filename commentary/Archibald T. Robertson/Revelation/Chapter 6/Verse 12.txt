<p><b> There was a great earthquake </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεισμος μεγας εγενετο</span></span>). "There came a great earthquake." Jesus spoke of earthquakes in his great eschatological discourse (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:8">Mark 13:8</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span> the powers of the heavens will be shaken. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σεισμος</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σειω</span></span>, to shake, and occurs also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:5">Revelation 8:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:13">Revelation 11:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:18">Revelation 16:18</span>. The reference is not a local earthquake like those so common in Asia Minor.</p>
<p><b>As sackcloth of hair </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως σακκος τριχινος</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σακκος</span></span> (Attic <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σακος</span></span>), Latin <i>saccus</i>, English <i>sack</i>, originally a bag for holding things (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+42:25">Genesis 42:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+42:35">Genesis 42:35</span>), then coarse garment of hair (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τριχινος</span></span>, old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θριξ</span></span>, here only in N.T.) clinging to one like a sack, of mourners, suppliants, prophets leading austere lives (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:4">Matthew 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:21">Matthew 11:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:13">Luke 10:13</span>). Here the hair is that of the black goat (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:3">Isaiah 50:3</span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:10">Joel 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+32:7">Ezekiel 32:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:10">Isaiah 13:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:24">Mark 13:24</span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ec+12:2">Ecclesiastes 12:2</span> for eclipses treated as symbols of old age. Apocalyptic pictures all have celestial phenomena following earthquakes.</p>
<p><b>As blood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως αιμα</span></span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:20">Acts 2:20</span> we find Peter interpreting the apocalyptic eschatological language of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:31">Joel 2:31</span> about the sun being turned into darkness and the moon into blood as pointing to the events of the day of Pentecost as also "the great day of the Lord." Peter's interpretation of Joel should make us cautious about too literal an exegesis of these grand symbols. </p>
