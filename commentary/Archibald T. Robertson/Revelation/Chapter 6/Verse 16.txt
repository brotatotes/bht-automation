 They say  (λεγουσιν). Vivid dramatic present active indicative, as is natural here.Fall on us  (Πεσατε εφ' ημας). Second aorist (first aorist ending) imperative of πιπτω, tense of urgency, do it now.And hide us  (κα κρυψατε ημας). Same tense of urgency again from κρυπτω (verb in verse Revelation 6:15). Both imperatives come in inverted order from Hosea 10:8 with καλυψατε (cover) in place of κρυψατε (hide), quoted by Jesus on the way to the Cross (Luke 23:30) in the order here, but with καλυψατε, not κρυψατε.From the face of him that  (απο προσωπου του, etc.). "What sinners dread most is not death, but the revealed Presence of God" (Swete). Cf. Genesis 3:8.And from the wrath of the Lamb  (κα απο της οργης του αρνιου). Repetition of "the grave irony" (Swete) of Revelation 5:5. The Lamb is the Lion again in the terribleness of his wrath. Recall the mourning in Revelation 1:7. See Matthew 25:41 where Jesus pronounces the woes on the wicked.
