<p><b> The great day </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ημερα η μεγαλη</span></span>). The phrase occurs in the O.T. prophets (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:11">Joel 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:31">Joel 2:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zep+1:14">Zephaniah 1:14</span>. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:6">Jude 1:6</span>) and is here combined with "of their wrath" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της οργης αυτων</span></span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zep+1:15">Zephaniah 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zep+1:18">Zephaniah 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zep+2:3">Zephaniah 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:5">Romans 2:5</span>. "Their" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτων</span></span>) means the wrath of God and of the Lamb put here on an equality as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:17">Revelation 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:3">Revelation 22:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:13">Revelation 22:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:11">1 Thessalonians 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:16">2 Thessalonians 2:16</span>. Beckwith holds that this language about the great day having come "is the mistaken cry of men in terror caused by the portents which are bursting upon them." There is something, to be sure, to be said for this view which denies that John commits himself to the position that this is the end of the ages.</p>
<p><b>And who is able to stand? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τις δυνατα σταθηναι?</span></span>). Very much like the words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="na+1:6">Nahum 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:2">Malachi 3:2</span>. First aorist passive infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>. It is a rhetorical question, apparently by the frightened crowds of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:15">Revelation 6:15</span>. Swete observes that the only possible answer to that cry is the command of Jesus in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:36">Luke 21:36</span>: "Keep awake on every occasion, praying that ye may get strength to stand (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σταθηνα</span></span>, the very form) before the Son of Man." </p>
