 And I saw and behold  (κα ειδον κα ιδου). This combination is frequent in the Apocalypse (Revelation 4:1; Revelation 6:2; Revelation 6:5; Revelation 6:8; Revelation 14:1; Revelation 14:14; Revelation 19:11).A white horse  (ιππος λευκος). In Zechariah 6:1-8 we have red, black, white, and grizzled bay horses like the four winds of heaven, ministers to do God's will. White seems to be the colour of victory (cf. the white horse of the Persian Kings) like the white horse ridden by the Roman conqueror in a triumphant procession.Had  (εχων). Agreeing in gender and case with ο καθημενος.A bow  (τοξον). Old word (Zechariah 9:13 of a great bow), here only in N.T.Was given  (εδοθη). First aorist passive indicative of διδωμ.A crown  (στεφανος). See on Revelation 4:4 for this word.He came forth  (εξηλθεν). Second aorist active indicative of εξερχομα, either to come out or to go out (went forth).Conquering  (νικων). Present active participle of νικαω.And to conquer  (κα ινα νικηση). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of νικαω. Here ως νικησων (future active participle with ως) could have been used. The aorist tense here points to ultimate victory. Commentators have been busy identifying the rider of the white horse according to their various theories. "It is tempting to identify him with the Rider on the white horse in Revelation 19:11, whose name is 'the Word of God'" (Swete). Tempting, "but the two riders have nothing in common beyond the white horse."
