 A red horse  (ιππος πυρρος). Old adjective from πυρ (fire), flame-coloured, blood-red (2 Kings 3:22), in N.T. only here and Revelation 12:3, like Zechariah 1:8; Zechariah 6:2 (roan horse).To take peace from the earth  (λαβειν την ειρηνην εκ της γης). Second aorist active infinitive of λαμβανω, and here the nominative case, the subject of εδοθη (see verse Revelation 6:2), "to take peace out of the earth." Alas, how many red horses have been ridden through the ages.And that they should slay one another  (κα ινα αλληλους σφαξουσιν). Epexegetical explanatory purpose clause with ινα and the future active of σφαζω (Revelation 5:6) instead of the more usual subjunctive (verse Revelation 6:2). Cf. Robertson, Grammar, p. 998f. This is what war does to perfection, makes cannon fodder (cf. John 14:27) of men.A great sword  (μαχαιρα μεγαλη). Μαχαιρα may be a knife carried in a sheath at the girdle (John 18:10) or a long sword in battle as here. Ρομφαια, also a large sword, is the only other word for sword in the N.T. (Revelation 1:16; Revelation 2:12; Revelation 2:16; Revelation 6:8; Revelation 19:15; Revelation 19:21).
