 A black horse  (ιππος μελας). Lust of conquest brings bloodshed, but also famine and hunger. "The colour of mourning and famine. See Jeremiah 4:28; Jeremiah 8:21; Malachi 3:14, where mournfully is, literally, in black" (Vincent).Had  (εχων) as in verse Revelation 6:2.A balance  (ζυγον). Literally, a yoke (old word from ζευγνυμ, to join), of slavery (Acts 15:10; Galatians 5:1), of teaching (Matthew 11:29), of weight or measure like a pair of scales evenly balancing as here (Ezekiel 5:1; Ezekiel 45:10). The rider of this black horse, like the spectral figure of hunger, carries in his hand a pair of scales. This is also one of the fruits of war.
