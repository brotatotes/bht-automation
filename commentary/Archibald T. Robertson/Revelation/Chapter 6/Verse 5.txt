<p><b> A black horse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιππος μελας</span></span>). Lust of conquest brings bloodshed, but also famine and hunger. "The colour of mourning and famine. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+4:28">Jeremiah 4:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+8:21">Jeremiah 8:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:14">Malachi 3:14</span>, where <i>mournfully</i> is, literally, in black" (Vincent).</p>
<p><b>Had </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχων</span></span>) as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:2">Revelation 6:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>A balance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζυγον</span></span>). Literally, a yoke (old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζευγνυμ</span></span>, to join), of slavery (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:10">Acts 15:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>), of teaching (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>), of weight or measure like a pair of scales evenly balancing as here (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+5:1">Ezekiel 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+45:10">Ezekiel 45:10</span>). The rider of this black horse, like the spectral figure of hunger, carries in his hand a pair of scales. This is also one of the fruits of war. </p>
