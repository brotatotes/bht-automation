<p><b> As it were a voice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως φωνην</span></span>). "This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span>, giving a certain vagueness or mysteriousness to a phrase, is one of the characteristics of the writer's style, e.g., <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:1">Revelation 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:3">Revelation 14:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:1">Revelation 19:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+19:6">Revelation 19:6</span>" (Beckwith). This voice comes from the midst of the four living creatures, "the protest of nature against the horrors of famine" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>A measure </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χοινιξ</span></span>). Old word for less than a quart with us, here only in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Of wheat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σιτου</span></span>). Old word for wheat, a number of times in N.T., in Rev. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:13">Revelation 18:13</span>. This was enough wheat to keep a man of moderate appetite alive for a day.</p>
<p><b>For a penny </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δηναριου</span></span>). Genitive of price, the wages of a day laborer (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:2">Matthew 20:2</span>), about eighteen cents in our money today.</p>
<p><b>Of barley </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριθων</span></span>). Old word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κριθη</span></span>, usually in plural as here. Barley was the food of the poor and it was cheaper even in the famine and it took more of it to support life. Here the proportion is three to one (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+7:18">2 Kings 7:18</span>). The proclamation forbids famine prices for food (solid and liquid).</p>
<p><b>Hurt thou not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη αδικησηις</span></span>). Prohibition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and the ingressive first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικεω</span></span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:3">Revelation 7:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:4">Revelation 9:4</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικεω</span></span> for injury to vegetable life. "The prohibition is addressed to the nameless rider who represents Dearth" (Swete). Wheat and barley, oil and the vine, were the staple foods in Palestine and Asia Minor. </p>
