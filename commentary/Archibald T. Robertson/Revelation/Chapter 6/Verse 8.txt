<p><b> A pale horse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιππος χλωρος</span></span>). Old adjective. Contracted from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χλοερος</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χλοη</span></span>, tender green grass) used of green grass (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:39">Mark 6:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:7">Revelation 8:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:4">Revelation 9:4</span>), here for yellowish, common in both senses in old Greek, though here only in N.T. in this sense, greenish yellow. We speak of a sorrel horse, never of a green horse. Zechariah (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:3">Zechariah 6:3</span>) uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποικιλος</span></span> (grizzled or variegated). Homer used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χλωρος</span></span> of the ashen colour of a face blanched by fear (pallid) and so the pale horse is a symbol of death and of terror.</p>
<p><b>His name was Death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα αυτω ο θανατος</span></span>). Anacoluthon in grammatical structure like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:1">John 3:1</span> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:26">Revelation 2:26</span>) and common enough. Death is the name of this fourth rider (so personified) and there is with Death "his inseparable comrade, Hades (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+20:13">Revelation 20:13</span>)" (Swete). Hades (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αιδης</span></span>, alpha privative, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδειν</span></span>, to see, the unseen) is the abode of the dead, the keys of which Christ holds (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>).</p>
<p><b>Followed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκολουθε</span></span>). Imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακολουθεω</span></span>, kept step with death, whether on the same horse or on another horse by his side or on foot John does not say.</p>
<p><b>Over the fourth part of the earth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ το τεταρτον της γης</span></span>). Partitive genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γης</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεταρτον</span></span>. Wider authority (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσια</span></span>) was given to this rider than to the others, though what part of the earth is included in the fourth part is not indicated.</p>
<p><b>To kill </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκτεινα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκτεινω</span></span>, explanation of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξουσια</span></span> (authority). The four scourges of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eze+14:21">Ezekiel 14:21</span> are here reproduced with instrumental <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> with the inanimate things (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρομφαιαι, λιμω θανατω</span></span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο</span></span> for the beasts (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θηριων</span></span>). Death here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θανατω</span></span>) seems to mean pestilence as the Hebrew does (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λοιμος</span></span> -- cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιμος</span></span> famine). Cf. the "black death" for a plague. </p>
