<p><b> Under the altar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποκατω του θυσιαστηριου</span></span>). "Under" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποκατω</span></span>), for the blood of the sacrifices was poured at the bottom of the altar (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+4:7">Leviticus 4:7</span>). The altar of sacrifice (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+39:39">Exodus 39:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+40:29">Exodus 40:29</span>), not of incense. The imagery, as in Hebrews, is from the tabernacle. For the word see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:23">Matthew 5:23</span>, often in Rev. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:3">Revelation 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:5">Revelation 8:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:13">Revelation 9:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:1">Revelation 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:18">Revelation 14:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:7">Revelation 16:7</span>). This altar in heaven is symbolic, of course, the antitype for the tabernacle altar (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span>). The Lamb was slain (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:12">Revelation 5:12</span>) and these martyrs have followed the example of their Lord.</p>
<p><b>The souls </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τας ψυχας</span></span>). The lives, for the life is in the blood (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+17:11">Leviticus 17:11</span>), were given for Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:17">Philippians 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:6">2 Timothy 4:6</span>).</p>
<p><b>Of the slain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των εσφαγμενων</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>. Christians were slain during the Neronian persecution and now again under Domitian. A long line of martyrs has followed.</p>
<p><b>For the word of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τον λογον του θεου</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>, the confession of loyalty to Christ as opposed to emperor-worship.</p>
<p><b>And for the testimony which they held </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα δια την μαρτυριαν ην ειχον</span></span>). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>. Probably <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> equals "even" here, explaining the preceding. The imperfect tense <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειχον</span></span> suits the repetition of the witness to Christ and the consequent death. </p>
