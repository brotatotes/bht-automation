 Were standing  (ιστηκεισαν). Past perfect active of ιστημ intransitive and used like an imperfect as in John 19:25.Round about  (κυκλω). Preposition (in a circle) with genitive as in Revelation 4:6; Revelation 5:11. The angels here rejoice in the salvation of men (Luke 15:7; Luke 15:10; 1 Peter 1:12).Upon their faces  (επ τα προσωπα αυτων). In reverential worship of God as in Revelation 11:16. For this worship (fell and worshipped) see also Revelation 4:10; Revelation 5:14; Revelation 11:16; Revelation 19:4; Revelation 19:10; Revelation 22:8. The dative τω θεω (God) with προσκυνεω (to worship) is the usual construction for that meaning. When it means merely to do homage the accusative case is usual in this book (Charles). But in the Fourth Gospel the reverse order is true as to the cases with προσκυνεω (Abbott, Joh. Vocab. pp. 138-142).
