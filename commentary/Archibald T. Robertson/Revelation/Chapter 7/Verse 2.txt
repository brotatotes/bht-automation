<p><b> Ascend </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινοντα</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβαινω</span></span>, "ascending," "going up," picturing the process.</p>
<p><b>From the sun-rising </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο ανατολης ηλιου</span></span>). Same phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:12">Revelation 16:12</span>. From the east, though why is not told. Swete suggests it is because Palestine is east of Patmos. The plural <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο ανατολων</span></span> occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:1">Matthew 2:1</span> without <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηλιου</span></span> (sun).</p>
<p><b>The seal of the living God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφραγιδα θεου ζωντος</span></span>). Here the signet ring, like that used by an Oriental monarch, to give validity to the official documents. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζωντος</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεου</span></span> accents the eternal life of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:6">Revelation 10:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+15:7">Revelation 15:7</span>) as opposed to the ephemeral pagan gods.</p>
<p><b>To whom it was given </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οις εδοθη αυτοις</span></span>). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοθη</span></span> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:2">Revelation 6:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:4">Revelation 6:4</span>, etc. The repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτοις</span></span> in addition to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οις</span></span> (both dative) is a redundant Hebraism (in vernacular <i>Koine</i> to some extent) often in the Apocalypse (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:8">Revelation 3:8</span>). The angels are here identified with the winds as the angels of the churches with the churches (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>).</p>
<p><b>To hurt </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικησα</span></span>). First aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικεω</span></span>, subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοθη</span></span>, common use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικεω</span></span> in this sense of to hurt in the Apocalypse (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:11">Revelation 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:6">Revelation 6:6</span> already), in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:19">Luke 10:19</span> also. The injury is to come by letting loose the winds, not by withholding them. </p>
