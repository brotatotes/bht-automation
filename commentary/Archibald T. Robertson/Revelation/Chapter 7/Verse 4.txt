<p><b> The number of the sealed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον αριθμον των εσφραγισμενων</span></span>). Accusative case object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσα</span></span> and genitive of the perfect passive articular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφραγιζω</span></span>. He did not see the sealing or count them himself, but only heard.</p>
<p><b>A hundred and forty and four thousand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκατον τεσσερακοντα τεσσαρες χιλιαδες</span></span>). Symbolical, of course, and not meant to be a complete number of the sealed (or saved) even in that generation, let alone for all time. The number connotes perfection (Alford), 12x12x1000 = a hundred and forty-four thousands (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χιλιαδες</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:11">Revelation 5:11</span>). Nominative absolute, not agreeing in case either with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αριθμον</span></span> (accusative) or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσφραγισμενων</span></span> (genitive). So as to the case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσφραγισμενο</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Out of every tribe of the children of Israel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ πασης φυλης υιων Ισραηλ</span></span>). There are two opposite views here, one taking the sealed as referring only to Jews (either actual Jews as a remnant or just Jewish Christians), the other including Gentiles as well as Jewish Christians, that is the true Israel as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:9">Revelation 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span> and like Paul in Galatians and Romans. This is the more probable view and it takes the twelve tribes in a spiritual sense. But in either view there remains the difficulty about names of the tribes. The list is not geographical, since Levi is included, but Dan is omitted and Manasseh put in his place, though he as the son of Joseph is included in Joseph. Irenaeus suggested that Antichrist was expected to come from the tribe of Dan and hence the omission here. There are various lists of the tribes in the O.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+35:22">Genesis 35:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+46:8">Genesis 46:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+46:49">Genesis 46:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+1:1">Exodus 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+1:2">Numbers 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+13:4">Numbers 13:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+26:34">Numbers 26:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+27:11">Deuteronomy 27:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+33:6">Deuteronomy 33:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+33:13-22">Deuteronomy 33:13-22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+33:5">Deuteronomy 33:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+33:1">Deuteronomy 33:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+12:24">Deuteronomy 12:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+27:16">Deuteronomy 27:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+27:48">Deuteronomy 27:48</span>) and given in various orders. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ch+7:12">1 Chronicles 7:12</span> both Dan and Zebulon are omitted. Joseph is given here in place of Ephraim. The distribution is equal (12,000) to each tribe. </p>
