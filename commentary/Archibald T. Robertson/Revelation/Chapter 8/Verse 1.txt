<p><b> And when he opened </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα οταν ηνοιξεν</span></span>). Here modal <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> is used with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτε</span></span> (used about the opening of the preceding six seals), but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οταν</span></span> is not here rendered more indefinite, as is sometimes true (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:11">Mark 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:9">Revelation 4:9</span>), but here and possibly (can be repetition) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:19">Mark 11:19</span> it is a particular instance, not a general rule (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 973).</p>
<p><b>There followed a silence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο σιγη</span></span>). Second aorist middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>. "There came silence." Dramatic effect by this profound stillness with no elder or angel speaking, no chorus of praise nor cry of adoration, no thunder from the throne (Swete), but a temporary cessation in the revelations. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+10:4">Revelation 10:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>About the space of half an hour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως ημιωρον</span></span>). Late and rare word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημ</span></span>, half, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωρα</span></span>, hour), here only in N.T. Accusative of extent of time. </p>
