 Was smitten  (επληγη). Second aorist passive indicative of πλησσω, old verb (like πληγη plague), here only in N.T.That should be darkened  (ινα σκοτισθη). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist passive subjunctive of σκοτιζω, from σκοτος (darkness) as in Matthew 24:29, but σκοτοω in Revelation 9:2.And the day should not shine  (κα η ημερα μη φανη). Negative purpose clause with ινα μη and the first aorist active subjunctive of φαινω, to shed light upon, as in Revelation 18:23, not the second aorist passive subjunctive φανη with different accent. The eclipse here is only partial and is kin to the ninth Egyptian plague (Exodus 10:21).
