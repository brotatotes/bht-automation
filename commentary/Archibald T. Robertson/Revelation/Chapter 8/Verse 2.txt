<p><b> Stand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστηκασιν</span></span>). Perfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span> (intransitive). Another "hebdomad" so frequent in the Apocalypse. The article (the seven angels) seems to point to seven well-known angels. In Enoch 20:7 the names of seven archangels are given (Uriel, Raphael, Raguel, Michael, Sariel, Gabriel, Remiel) and "angels of the Presence" is an idea like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:9">Isaiah 63:9</span>. We do not know precisely what is John's idea here.</p>
<p><b>Seven trumpets </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επτα σαλπιγγες</span></span>). We see trumpets assigned to angels in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:52">1 Corinthians 15:52</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:4">Revelation 4:4</span>. See also the use of trumpets in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jos+6:13">Joshua 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:1">Joel 2:1</span>. These seven trumpets are soon to break the half hour of silence. Thus the seven trumpets grow out of the opening of the seventh seal, however that fact is to be interpreted. </p>
