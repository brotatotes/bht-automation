<p><b> Another angel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλος αγγελος</span></span>). Not one of the seven of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:2">Revelation 8:2</span> and before they began to sound the trumpets. This preliminary incident of the offering of incense on the altar covers verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:3-6">Revelation 8:3-6</span>.</p>
<p><b>Stood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσταθη</span></span>). Ingressive first aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span> (intransitive), "took his place."</p>
<p><b>Over the altar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ του θυσιαστηριου</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span> for the word for the burnt-offering, here apparently the altar of incense (clearly so in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:11">Luke 1:11</span>; possibly also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:13">Revelation 9:13</span>), but it is not clear that in apocalyptic the distinction between the two altars of the tabernacle and temple is preserved. Aleph C Q have the genitive, while A P have the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ το θυσιαστηριον</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>A golden censer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιβανωτον χρυσουν</span></span>). Old word for frankincense (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιβανος</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:11">Matthew 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:13">Revelation 18:13</span>), but here alone in N.T. and for censer, as is plain by the use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρυσουν</span></span> (golden) with it. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+7:50">1 Kings 7:50</span>.</p>
<p><b>Much incense </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυμιαματα πολλα</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:8">Revelation 5:8</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυμιαμα</span></span> (the aromatic substance burnt, also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:13">Revelation 18:13</span>), but here for the live coals on which the incense falls.</p>
<p><b>That he should add </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα δωσε</span></span>). Sub-final clause (subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοθη</span></span>, was given, singular because <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυμιαματα</span></span> neuter plural) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the future active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδωμ</span></span>, to give, instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δω</span></span>, the second aorist subjunctive.</p>
<p><b>Unto the prayers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταις προσευχαις</span></span>). Dative case. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:18">Revelation 5:18</span> the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυμιαματα</span></span> are the prayers.</p>
<p><b>Upon the golden altar </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ το θυσιαστηριον το χρυσουν το</span></span>). Accusative case here, not genitive as above, and apparently the altar of incense as indicated by the word golden (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:1">Exodus 30:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="le+4:17">Leviticus 4:17</span>). Note triple article here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το</span></span> (once before the substantive, once before the adjective, once before the adjunct "the one before the throne"). </p>
