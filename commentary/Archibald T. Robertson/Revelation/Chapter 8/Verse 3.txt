 Another angel  (αλλος αγγελος). Not one of the seven of verse Revelation 8:2 and before they began to sound the trumpets. This preliminary incident of the offering of incense on the altar covers verses Revelation 8:3-6.Stood  (εσταθη). Ingressive first aorist passive of ιστημ (intransitive), "took his place."Over the altar  (επ του θυσιαστηριου). See Revelation 6:9 for the word for the burnt-offering, here apparently the altar of incense (clearly so in Luke 1:11; possibly also Revelation 9:13), but it is not clear that in apocalyptic the distinction between the two altars of the tabernacle and temple is preserved. Aleph C Q have the genitive, while A P have the accusative επ το θυσιαστηριον.A golden censer  (λιβανωτον χρυσουν). Old word for frankincense (from λιβανος, Matthew 2:11; Revelation 18:13), but here alone in N.T. and for censer, as is plain by the use of χρυσουν (golden) with it. Cf. 1 Kings 7:50.Much incense  (θυμιαματα πολλα). See Revelation 5:8 for θυμιαμα (the aromatic substance burnt, also in Revelation 18:13), but here for the live coals on which the incense falls.That he should add  (ινα δωσε). Sub-final clause (subject of εδοθη, was given, singular because θυμιαματα neuter plural) with ινα and the future active indicative of διδωμ, to give, instead of δω, the second aorist subjunctive.Unto the prayers  (ταις προσευχαις). Dative case. In Revelation 5:18 the θυμιαματα are the prayers.Upon the golden altar  (επ το θυσιαστηριον το χρυσουν το). Accusative case here, not genitive as above, and apparently the altar of incense as indicated by the word golden (Exodus 30:1; Leviticus 4:17). Note triple article here το (once before the substantive, once before the adjective, once before the adjunct "the one before the throne").
