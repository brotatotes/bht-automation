<p><b> As it were </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span>). "As if," not a great mountain, but a blazing mass as large as a mountain.</p>
<p><b>Burning with fire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρ καιομενον</span></span>). Present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καιω</span></span>. Somewhat like Enoch 18:13, but perhaps with the picture of a great volcanic eruption like that of Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Strabo tells of an eruption B.C. 196 which made a new island (Palaea Kaumene).</p>
<p><b>Became blood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγενετο αιμα</span></span>). Like the Nile in the first plague (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:20">Exodus 7:20</span>). Cf. also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:3">Revelation 16:3</span>. </p>
