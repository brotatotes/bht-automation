 Of the creatures  (των κτισματων). See Revelation 5:13 for this word κτισμα. Even they that had life (τα εχοντα ψυχας). Here the nominative articular participle is in apposition with the genitive κτισματων, as often in this book. See Exodus 7:20 for the destruction of fish, and Zephaniah 1:3.Was destroyed  (διεφθαρησαν). Second aorist passive indicative of διαφθειρω, old compound, to corrupt, to consume, to destroy (perfective use of δια), also Revelation 11:18. The plural πλοιον just before the verb makes the idea plural.
