<p><b> Of the creatures </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των κτισματων</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:13">Revelation 5:13</span> for this word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτισμα</span></span>. Even they that had life (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα εχοντα ψυχας</span></span>). Here the nominative articular participle is in apposition with the genitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κτισματων</span></span>, as often in this book. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:20">Exodus 7:20</span> for the destruction of fish, and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="zep+1:3">Zephaniah 1:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Was destroyed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διεφθαρησαν</span></span>). Second aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαφθειρω</span></span>, old compound, to corrupt, to consume, to destroy (perfective use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>), also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:18">Revelation 11:18</span>. The plural <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλοιον</span></span> just before the verb makes the idea plural. </p>
