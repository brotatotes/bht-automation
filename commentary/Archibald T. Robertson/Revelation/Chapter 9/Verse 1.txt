Αβυσσος is an old adjective (alpha privative and βυθος, depth, without depth), but η αβυσσος (supply χωρα place), the bottomless place. It occurs in Romans 10:7 for the common receptacle of the dead for Hades (Sheol), but in Luke 8:31 a lower depth is sounded (Swete), for the abode of demons, and in this sense it occurs in Revelation 9:1; Revelation 9:2; Revelation 9:11; Revelation 11:7; Revelation 17:8; Revelation 20:1; Revelation 20:3. Φρεαρ is an old word for well or cistern (Luke 14:5; John 4:11) and it occurs in Revelation 9:1 for the mouth of the abyss which is pictured as a cistern with a narrow orifice at the entrance and this fifth angel holds the key to it.
