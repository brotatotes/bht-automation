<p><b> As king </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλεα</span></span>). Predicate accusative and anarthrous. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+30:27">Proverbs 30:27</span> it is stated that the locust has no king, but this is not true of these demonic locusts. Their king is "the angel of the abyss (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:1">Revelation 9:1</span>) whose orders they obey."</p>
<p><b>His name is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα αυτω</span></span>). "Name to him" (nominative absolute and dative, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:8">Revelation 6:8</span>).</p>
<p><b>In Hebrew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εβραιστ</span></span>). Adverb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+16:16">Revelation 16:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:2">John 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:13">John 19:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:17">John 19:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:20">John 19:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:16">John 20:16</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αβαδδων</span></span>. A word almost confined to the Wisdom books (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+26:6">Job 26:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+88:11">Psalms 88:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="pr+15:11">Proverbs 15:11</span>). It is rendered in the LXX by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Απωλεια</span></span>, destruction.</p>
<p><b>In the Greek tongue </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τη Hελληνικη</span></span>). With <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γλωσση</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαλεκτω</span></span> understood. As usual, John gives both the Hebrew and the Greek.</p>
<p><b>Apollyon </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Απολλυων</span></span>). Present active masculine singular participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολλυω</span></span>, meaning "destroying," used here as a name and so "Destroyer," with the nominative case retained though in apposition with the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ονομα</span></span>. The personification of Abaddon occurs in the Talmud also. It is not clear whether by Apollyon John means Death or Satan. Bousset even finds in the name Apollyon an indirect allusion to Apollo, one of whose symbols was the locust, a doubtful point assuredly. </p>
