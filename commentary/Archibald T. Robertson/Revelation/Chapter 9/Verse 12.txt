 The first woe  (η ουα η μια). Note feminine gender ascribed to the interjection ουα as in Revelation 11:14, perhaps because θλιψις is feminine, though we really do not know. Note also the ordinal use of μια (one) like πρωτη (first) as in Revelation 6:1; Mark 16:2.There come yet two Woes  (ερχετα ετ δυο Ουα). Singular number ερχετα instead of ερχοντα, though δυο ουα. It is true that ουα is an interjection and indeclinable, but it is here used with δυο and is feminine just before, and not neuter.
