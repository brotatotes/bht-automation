<p><b> The first woe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ουα η μια</span></span>). Note feminine gender ascribed to the interjection <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουα</span></span> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:14">Revelation 11:14</span>, perhaps because <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θλιψις</span></span> is feminine, though we really do not know. Note also the ordinal use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μια</span></span> (one) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτη</span></span> (first) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:1">Revelation 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:2">Mark 16:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>There come yet two Woes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχετα ετ δυο Ουα</span></span>). Singular number <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχετα</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερχοντα</span></span>, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυο ουα</span></span>. It is true that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουα</span></span> is an interjection and indeclinable, but it is here used with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυο</span></span> and is feminine just before, and not neuter. </p>
