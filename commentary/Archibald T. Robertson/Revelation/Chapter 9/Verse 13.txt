<p><b> A voice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φωνην μιαν</span></span>). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μιαν</span></span> as indefinite article see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13">Revelation 8:13</span>. Accusative case here after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηκουσα</span></span>, though genitive in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13">Revelation 8:13</span>, a distinction between sound and sense sometimes exists (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:9">Acts 22:9</span>), but not here as the words are clearly heard in both instances.</p>
<p><b>From </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ</span></span>). "Out of the horns." Note triple use of the genitive article here as of the accusative article with this identical phrase in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+8:3">Revelation 8:3</span> ("the altar the golden the one before the throne"). </p>
