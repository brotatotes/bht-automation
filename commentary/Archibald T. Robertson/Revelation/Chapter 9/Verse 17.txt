<p><b> And thus I saw in the vision </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουτως ειδον εν τη ορασε</span></span>). Nowhere else does John allude to his own vision, though often in Dan. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+7:2">Daniel 7:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+8:2">Daniel 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+8:15">Daniel 8:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="da+9:21">Daniel 9:21</span>).</p>
<p><b>Having </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχοντας</span></span>). Accusative masculine plural of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span>, probably referring to the riders (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους καθημενους επ' αυτων</span></span>) rather than to the horses (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους ιππους</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Breastplates as of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θωρακας πυρινους κα υακινθινους κα θειωδεις</span></span>). There is no <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span> (as) in the Greek, but that is the idea of these three adjectives which are only metaphors. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πυρινος</span></span> is an old adjective (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πυρ</span></span>, fire), here only in N.T. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hυακινθος</span></span> is also an old word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υακινθος</span></span>, hyacinth, then of a sapphire stone <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:20">Revelation 21:20</span>), of a red color bordering on black, here only in the N.T. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Θειωδης</span></span> is a late word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θειον</span></span>, brimstone), sulphurous, here only in N.T.</p>
<p><b>As the heads of lions </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως κεφαλα λεοντων</span></span>). This of the horses, war-horses as always in the Bible except in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:28">Isaiah 28:28</span>. These horses likewise have "fire and smoke and brimstone" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θειον</span></span>, brimstone, is old word, in N.T. only in Rev. and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:29">Luke 17:29</span>) proceeding (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπορευετα</span></span>, singular because it comes first and the subjects afterwards) out of their mouths. Both rider and horse are terrible. </p>
