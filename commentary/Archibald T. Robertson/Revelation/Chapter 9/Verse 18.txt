 By these three plagues  (απο των τριων πληγων τουτων). Our "plague" or stroke from πλησσω, as in Luke 10:30 and often in Rev. (Revelation 9:20; Revelation 11:6; Revelation 15:1; Revelation 15:6; Revelation 15:8; Revelation 16:9; Revelation 18:4; Revelation 18:8; Revelation 22:18). It is used in Exodus 11:1 for the plagues in Egypt. The three plagues here are the fire, smoke, and brimstone which proceed from the mouths of the horses.Was killed  (απεκτανθησαν). First aorist passive indicative of αποκτεινω, to kill, third person plural, though το τριτον is neuter singular because a collective idea. See same form in verse Revelation 9:20.
