 Of their murders  (εκ των φονων αυτων). Heads the list, but "sorceries" (εκ των φαρμακων) comes next. Φαρμακον was originally enchantment, as also in Revelation 21:8, then drug.

The two other items are fornication (πορνειας) and thefts (κλεμματων, old word from κλεπτω, here alone in N.T.), all four characteristic of demonic worship and idolatry. See other lists of vices in Mark 7:21; Galatians 5:20; Revelation 21:8; Revelation 22:15. Our word "pharmacy" as applied to drugs and medicine has certainly come a long way out of a bad environment, but there is still a bad odour about "patent medicines."
