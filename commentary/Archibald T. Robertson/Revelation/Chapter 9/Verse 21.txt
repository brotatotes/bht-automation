<p><b> Of their murders </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ των φονων αυτων</span></span>). Heads the list, but "sorceries" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ των φαρμακων</span></span>) comes next. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φαρμακον</span></span> was originally enchantment, as also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span>, then drug. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φαρμακια</span></span> see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+18:34">Revelation 18:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:20">Galatians 5:20</span>. The two other items are fornication (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πορνειας</span></span>) and thefts (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλεμματων</span></span>, old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλεπτω</span></span>, here alone in N.T.), all four characteristic of demonic worship and idolatry. See other lists of vices in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:21">Mark 7:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:20">Galatians 5:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+22:15">Revelation 22:15</span>. Our word "pharmacy" as applied to drugs and medicine has certainly come a long way out of a bad environment, but there is still a bad odour about "patent medicines." </p>
