<p><b> Men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ανθρωπο</span></span>). Generic use of the article (men as a class).</p>
<p><b>Shall not find it </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη ευρησουσιν αυτον</span></span>). Strong double negative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μη</span></span> with the future active indicative according to Aleph Q, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρωσιν</span></span> (second aorist active subjunctive) according to A P (either construction regular). The idea here is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="job+3:21">Job 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+8:3">Jeremiah 8:3</span>. "Such a death as they desire, a death which will end their sufferings, is impossible; physical death is no remedy for the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασανισμος</span></span> of an evil conscience" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>They shall desire to die </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιθυμησουσιν αποθανειν</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιθυμεω</span></span>, a climax to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζητησουσιν</span></span> (they shall seek), to desire vehemently. Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span> shows a preference for death if his work is done, in order to be with Christ, a very different feeling from what we have here.</p>
<p><b>Fleeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φευγε</span></span>). Vivid futuristic present active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φευγω</span></span>. Even death does not come to their relief. </p>
