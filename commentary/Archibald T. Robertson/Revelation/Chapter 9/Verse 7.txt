 The shapes  (τα ομοιωματα). Old word from ομοιοω, to make like (from ομοιος, like), likeness, in N.T. only here, Romans 5:14; Philippians 2:7, "the likenesses were like" (ομοια). Hομοιωμα is "midway between μορφη and σχημα" (Lightfoot).Unto horses  (ιπποις). Associative-instrumental case, as is the rule with ομοιος (Revelation 1:15; Revelation 2:18; Revelation 4:6; Revelation 9:10; Revelation 9:19; Revelation 11:1; Revelation 13:2; Revelation 13:11), but with the accusative in Revelation 1:13; Revelation 14:14. So also ομοιο χρυσω (like gold) in this same verse.Prepared for war  (ητοιμασμενοις εις πολεμον). Perfect passive participle of ετοιμαζω. This imagery of war-horses is like that in Joel 2:4. "The likeness of a locust to a horse, especially to a horse equipped with armour, is so striking that the insect is named in German Heupferd (hay horse), and in Italian cavalett a little horse" (Vincent).As it were crowns  (ος στεφανο). Not actual crowns, but what looked like crowns of gold, as conquerors, as indeed they were (Revelation 4:4; Revelation 6:2; Revelation 12:1; Revelation 14:14). These locusts of the abyss have another peculiar feature.As men's faces  (ως προσωπα ανθρωπων). Human-looking faces in these demonic locusts to give added terror, "suggesting the intelligence and capacity of man" (Swete). Vincent actually sees "a distinct resemblance to the human countenance in the face of the locust."
