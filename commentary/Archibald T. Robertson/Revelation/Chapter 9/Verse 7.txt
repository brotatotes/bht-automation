<p><b> The shapes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα ομοιωματα</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιοω</span></span>, to make like (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιος</span></span>, like), likeness, in N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:14">Romans 5:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>, "the likenesses were like" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοια</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hομοιωμα</span></span> is "midway between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μορφη</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχημα</span></span>" (Lightfoot).</p>
<p><b>Unto horses </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιπποις</span></span>). Associative-instrumental case, as is the rule with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:15">Revelation 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:18">Revelation 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6">Revelation 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:10">Revelation 9:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:19">Revelation 9:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+11:1">Revelation 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:2">Revelation 13:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+13:11">Revelation 13:11</span>), but with the accusative in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+1:13">Revelation 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</span>. So also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομοιο χρυσω</span></span> (like gold) in this same verse.</p>
<p><b>Prepared for war </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητοιμασμενοις εις πολεμον</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ετοιμαζω</span></span>. This imagery of war-horses is like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:4">Joel 2:4</span>. "The likeness of a locust to a horse, especially to a horse equipped with armour, is so striking that the insect is named in German <i>Heupferd</i> (hay horse), and in Italian <i>cavalett</i> a little horse" (Vincent).</p>
<p><b>As it were crowns </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος στεφανο</span></span>). Not actual crowns, but what looked like crowns of gold, as conquerors, as indeed they were (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+4:4">Revelation 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+6:2">Revelation 6:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+12:1">Revelation 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</span>). These locusts of the abyss have another peculiar feature.</p>
<p><b>As men's faces </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως προσωπα ανθρωπων</span></span>). Human-looking faces in these demonic locusts to give added terror, "suggesting the intelligence and capacity of man" (Swete). Vincent actually sees "a distinct resemblance to the human countenance in the face of the locust." </p>
