<p><b> As it were breastplates of iron </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως θωρακας σιδερους</span></span>). The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θωραξ</span></span> was originally the breast (from the neck to the navel), then the breastplate, only N.T. usage (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:9">Revelation 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:17">Revelation 9:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:8">1 Thessalonians 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:14">Ephesians 6:14</span>). The armour for the breastplate was usually of iron (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σιδερους</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27">Revelation 2:27</span>), but with the locusts it only seemed to be so (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως</span></span>). However, the scaly backs and flanks of the locusts do resemble coats of mail. "The locusts of the Abyss may be the memories of the past brought home at times of Divine visitation" (Swete).</p>
<p><b>The sound of their wings </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η φωνη των πτερυγων</span></span>). Graphic picture of the onrush of the swarms of demonic locusts and the hopelessness of resisting them.</p>
<p><b>As the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to war </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως φωνη αρματων ιππων πολλων τρεχοντων εις πολεμον</span></span>). Both metaphors here, the clatter and clangour of the chariot wheels and the prancing of the horses are found in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:4">Joel 2:4</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τρεχοντων</span></span> is present active predicate participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρεχω</span></span>, to run. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ki+7:6">2 Kings 7:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+47:3">Jeremiah 47:3</span>. </p>
