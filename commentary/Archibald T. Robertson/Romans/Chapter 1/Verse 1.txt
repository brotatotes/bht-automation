<p><b> To the Romans </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς Ρωμαιους</span></span>). This is the title in Aleph A B C, our oldest Greek MSS. for the Epistle. We do not know whether Paul gave any title at all. Later MSS. add other words up to the Textus Receptus: The Epistle of Paul to the Romans. The Epistle is put first in the MSS. because it is the most important of Paul's Epistles. </p>
<p><b> Paul </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παυλος</span></span>). Roman name (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παυλυς</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:9">Acts 13:9</span> for the origin of this name by the side of Saul.</p>
<p><b>Servant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλος</span></span>). Bond-slave of Jesus Christ (or Christ Jesus as some MSS. give it and as is the rule in the later Epistles) for the first time in the Epistles in the opening sentence, though the phrase already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:10">Galatians 1:10</span>. Recurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεσμιος</span></span> (bondsman) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:1">Philemon 1:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>Called to be an apostle </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλητος αποστολος</span></span>). An apostle by vocation (Denney) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλητος</span></span> is not used, but the rest of the verse has the same idea.</p>
<p><b>Separated </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφωρισμενος</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφοριζω</span></span> for which verb see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:15">Galatians 1:15</span>. Paul is a spiritual Pharisee (etymologically), separated not to the oral tradition, but to God's gospel, a chosen vessel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span>). By man also (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span>). Many of Paul's characteristic words like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιον</span></span> have been already discussed in the previous Epistles that will call for little comment from now on. </p>
