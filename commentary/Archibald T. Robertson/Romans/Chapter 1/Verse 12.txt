<p><b> That is </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτο δε εστιν</span></span>). "An explanatory correction" (Denney). The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span> should not be ignored. Instead of saying that he had a spiritual gift for them, he wishes to add that they also have one for him.</p>
<p><b>That I with you may be comforted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνπαρακληθηνα εν υμιν</span></span>). "My being comforted in you (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν υμιν</span></span>) together (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν-</span></span>) with you," a mutual blessing to each party (you and me). </p>
