<p><b> For therein </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ εν αυτω</span></span>). In the gospel (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>) of which Paul is not ashamed.</p>
<p><b>A righteousness of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη θεου</span></span>). Subjective genitive, "a God kind of righteousness," one that each must have and can obtain in no other way save "from faith unto faith" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ πιστεως εις πιστιν</span></span>), faith the starting point and faith the goal (Lightfoot).</p>
<p><b>Is revealed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαλυπτετα</span></span>). It is a revelation from God, this God kind of righteousness, that man unaided could never have conceived or still less attained. In these words we have Paul's statement in his own way of the theme of the Epistle, the content of the gospel as Paul understands it. Every word is important: <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωτηριαν</span></span> (salvation), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευαγγελιον</span></span> (gospel), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαλυπτετα</span></span> (is revealed), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη θεου</span></span> (righteousness of God), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span> (faith) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευοντ</span></span> (believing). He grounds his position on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:4">Habakkuk 2:4</span> (quoted also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:11">Galatians 3:11</span>). By "righteousness" we shall see that Paul means both "justification" and "sanctification." It is important to get a clear idea of Paul's use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη</span></span> here for it controls the thought throughout the Epistle. Jesus set up a higher standard of righteousness (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη</span></span>) in the Sermon on the Mount than the Scribes and Pharisees taught and practised (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:20">Matthew 5:20</span>) and proves it in various items. Here Paul claims that in the gospel, taught by Jesus and by himself there is revealed a God kind of righteousness with two ideas in it (the righteousness that God has and that he bestows). It is an old word for quality from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιος</span></span>, a righteous man, and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικη</span></span>, right or justice (called a goddess in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:4">Acts 28:4</span>), and that allied with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεικνυμ</span></span>, to show, to point out. Other allied words are <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοω</span></span>, to declare or make <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:26">Romans 3:26</span>), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιωμα</span></span>, that which is deemed <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιος</span></span> (sentence or ordinance as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:32">Romans 1:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:26">Romans 2:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:4">Romans 8:4</span>), <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιωσις</span></span>, the act of declaring <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιος</span></span> (only twice in N.T., <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Δικαιοσυνη</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοω</span></span> are easy to render into English, though we use justice in distinction from righteousness and sanctification for the result that comes after justification (the setting one right with God). Paul is consistent and usually clear in his use of these great words. </p>
