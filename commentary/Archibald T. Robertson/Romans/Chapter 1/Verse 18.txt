<p><b> For the wrath of God is revealed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαλυπτετα γαρ οργη θεου</span></span>). Note in Romans Paul's use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>, now argumentative, now explanatory, now both as here. There is a parallel and antecedent revelation (see verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>) of God's wrath corresponding to the revelation of God's righteousness, this an unwritten revelation, but plainly made known. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Οργη</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οργαω</span></span>, to teem, to swell. It is the temper of God towards sin, not rage, but the wrath of reason and law (Shedd). The revelation of God's righteousness in the gospel was necessary because of the failure of men to attain it without it, for God's wrath justly rested upon all both Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18-32">Romans 1:18-32</span>) and Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:1-3">Romans 2:1-3</span>).</p>
<p><b>Ungodliness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασεβειαν</span></span>). Irreligion, want of reverence toward God, old word (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:16">2 Timothy 2:16</span>).</p>
<p><b>Unrighteousness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδικιαν</span></span>). Lack (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικη</span></span>) of right conduct toward men, injustice (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:14">Romans 9:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:6">Luke 18:6</span>). This follows naturally from irreverence. The basis of ethical conduct rests on the nature of God and our attitude toward him, otherwise the law of the jungle (cf. Nietzsche, "might makes right").</p>
<p><b>Hold down the truth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αληθειαν κατεχοντων</span></span>). Truth (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αληθεια, αληθης</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ληθω</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λανθανω</span></span>, to conceal) is out in the open, but wicked men, so to speak, put it in a box and sit on the lid and "hold it down in unrighteousness." Their evil deeds conceal the open truth of God from men. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:6">2 Thessalonians 2:6</span> for this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεχω</span></span>, to hinder. </p>
