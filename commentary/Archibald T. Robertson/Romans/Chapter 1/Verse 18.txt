 For the wrath of God is revealed  (αποκαλυπτετα γαρ οργη θεου). Note in Romans Paul's use of γαρ, now argumentative, now explanatory, now both as here. There is a parallel and antecedent revelation (see verse Romans 1:17) of God's wrath corresponding to the revelation of God's righteousness, this an unwritten revelation, but plainly made known. Οργη is from οργαω, to teem, to swell. It is the temper of God towards sin, not rage, but the wrath of reason and law (Shedd). The revelation of God's righteousness in the gospel was necessary because of the failure of men to attain it without it, for God's wrath justly rested upon all both Gentiles (Romans 1:18-32) and Jews (Romans 2:1-3).Ungodliness  (ασεβειαν). Irreligion, want of reverence toward God, old word (cf. 2 Timothy 2:16).Unrighteousness  (αδικιαν). Lack (α privative and δικη) of right conduct toward men, injustice (Romans 9:14; Luke 18:6). This follows naturally from irreverence. The basis of ethical conduct rests on the nature of God and our attitude toward him, otherwise the law of the jungle (cf. Nietzsche, "might makes right").Hold down the truth  (την αληθειαν κατεχοντων). Truth (αληθεια, αληθης, from α privative and ληθω or λανθανω, to conceal) is out in the open, but wicked men, so to speak, put it in a box and sit on the lid and "hold it down in unrighteousness." Their evil deeds conceal the open truth of God from men. Cf. 2 Thessalonians 2:6 for this use of κατεχω, to hinder.
