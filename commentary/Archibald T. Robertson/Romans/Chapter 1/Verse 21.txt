<p><b> Because that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διοτ</span></span>). As in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:19">Romans 1:19</span>.</p>
<p><b>Knowing God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνοντες τον θεον</span></span>). Second aorist active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινωσκω</span></span>, to know by personal experience. Definite statement that originally men had some knowledge of God. No people, however degraded, have yet been found without some yearning after a god, a seeking to find the true God and get back to him as Paul said in Athens (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:27">Acts 17:27</span>).</p>
<p><b>Glorified not as God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ ως θεον εδοξασαν</span></span>). They knew more than they did. This is the reason for the condemnation of the heathen (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:12-16">Romans 2:12-16</span>), the failure to do what they know.</p>
<p><b>Their senseless heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ασυνετος αυτων καρδια</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Καρδια</span></span> is the most comprehensive term for all our faculties whether feeling (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:2">Romans 9:2</span>), will (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:5">1 Corinthians 4:5</span>), intellect (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:6">Romans 10:6</span>). It may be the home of the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:5">Romans 5:5</span>) or of evil desires (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:24">Romans 1:24</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:21">Mark 7:21</span> for list of vices that come "out of the heart." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ασυνετος</span></span> is a verbal adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιημ</span></span>, to put together, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative, unintelligent, not able to put together the manifest evidence about God (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>). So darkness settled down on their hearts (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσκοτισθη</span></span>, first aorist ingressive passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκοτιζω</span></span>, to darken). </p>
