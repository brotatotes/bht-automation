<p><b> Professing themselves to be wise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φασκοντες εινα σοφο</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σοφο</span></span> is predicate nominative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα</span></span> in indirect discourse agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φασκοντες</span></span> (old verb, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φημ</span></span>, to say, rare in N.T.) in case and number according to regular Greek idiom (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 1038).</p>
<p><b>Became vain </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εματαιωθησαν</span></span>). Ingressive first aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ματαιοω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ματαιος</span></span> (empty). Empty reasonings as often today.</p>
<p><b>Became fools </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμωρανθησαν</span></span>). Ingressive first aorist passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωραινω</span></span>, to be a fool, old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μωρος</span></span>, a fool. An oxymoron or sharp saying, true and one that cuts to the bone.</p>
<p><b>For the likeness of an image </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ομοιωματ εικονος</span></span>). Both words, "a likeness which consists in an image or copy" (Lightfoot). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span> for "likeness of men" and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span> for "image of God." Paul shows indignant contempt for these grotesque efforts to present pictures of a deity that had been lost (Denney). Why is it that heathen images of gods in the form of men and beasts are so horrible to look upon? </p>
