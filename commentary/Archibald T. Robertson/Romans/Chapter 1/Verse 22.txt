 Professing themselves to be wise  (φασκοντες εινα σοφο). Σοφο is predicate nominative with εινα in indirect discourse agreeing with φασκοντες (old verb, from φημ, to say, rare in N.T.) in case and number according to regular Greek idiom (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1038).Became vain  (εματαιωθησαν). Ingressive first aorist passive indicative of ματαιοω from ματαιος (empty). Empty reasonings as often today.Became fools  (εμωρανθησαν). Ingressive first aorist passive of μωραινω, to be a fool, old word from μωρος, a fool. An oxymoron or sharp saying, true and one that cuts to the bone.For the likeness of an image  (εν ομοιωματ εικονος). Both words, "a likeness which consists in an image or copy" (Lightfoot). See Philippians 2:7 for "likeness of men" and Colossians 1:15 for "image of God." Paul shows indignant contempt for these grotesque efforts to present pictures of a deity that had been lost (Denney). Why is it that heathen images of gods in the form of men and beasts are so horrible to look upon?
