<p><b> Wherefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διο</span></span>). Paul's inexorable logic. See it also in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:26">Romans 1:26</span> with the same verb and in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα</span></span> like "and so."</p>
<p><b>God gave them up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδωκεν αυτους ο θεος</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραδιδωμ</span></span>, old and common verb to hand over (beside, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα</span></span>) to one's power as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:12">Matthew 4:12</span>. These people had already wilfully deserted God who merely left them to their own self-determination and self-destruction, part of the price of man's moral freedom. Paul refers to this stage and state of man in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:30">Acts 17:30</span> by "overlooked" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπεριδων</span></span>). The withdrawal of God's restraint sent men deeper down. Three times Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδωκεν</span></span> here (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:24">Romans 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:26">Romans 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</span>), not three stages in the giving over, but a repetition of the same withdrawal. The words sound to us like clods on the coffin as God leaves men to work their own wicked will.</p>
<p><b>That their bodies should be dishonoured </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ατιμαζεσθα τα σωματα αυτων</span></span>). Contemplated result expressed by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του</span></span> (genitive article) and the passive infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατιμαζεσθα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ατιμος</span></span>, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιμος</span></span>, dishonoured) with the accusative of general reference. Christians had a new sense of dignity for the body (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:4">1 Thessalonians 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:13">1 Corinthians 6:13</span>). Heathenism left its stamp on the bodies of men and women. </p>
