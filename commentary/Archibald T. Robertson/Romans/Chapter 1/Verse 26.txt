<p><b> Unto vile passions </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις παθη ατιμιας</span></span>). Unto passions of dishonour. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Παθος</span></span>, old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πασχω</span></span>, to experience, originally meant any feeling whether good or bad, but in N.T. always in bad sense as here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:5">1 Thessalonians 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:5">Colossians 3:5</span> (only N.T. examples).</p>
<p><b>That which is against nature </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την παρα φυσιν</span></span>). The degradation of sex is what Paul here notes as one of the results of heathenism (the loss of God in the life of man). They passed by the Creator. </p>
