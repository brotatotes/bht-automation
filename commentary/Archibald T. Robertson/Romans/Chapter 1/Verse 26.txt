 Unto vile passions  (εις παθη ατιμιας). Unto passions of dishonour. Παθος, old word from πασχω, to experience, originally meant any feeling whether good or bad, but in N.T. always in bad sense as here, 1 Thessalonians 4:5; Colossians 3:5 (only N.T. examples).That which is against nature  (την παρα φυσιν). The degradation of sex is what Paul here notes as one of the results of heathenism (the loss of God in the life of man). They passed by the Creator.
