<p><b> And even as they refused </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα καθως ουκ εδοκιμασαν</span></span>). "And even as they rejected" after trial just as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμαζω</span></span> is used of testing coins. They tested God at first and turned aside from him.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγνωσε</span></span>). Full knowledge (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span> additional, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γνωσις</span></span>). They had a dim memory that was a caricature.</p>
<p><b>Unto a reprobate mind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις αδοκιμον νουν</span></span>). Play on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εδοκιμασαν</span></span>. They rejected God and God rejected their mental attitude and gave them over (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:24">Romans 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:26">Romans 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</span>). See this adjective already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27">1 Corinthians 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:5-7">2 Corinthians 13:5-7</span>. Like an old abandoned building, the home of bats and snakes, left "to do those things which are not fitting" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιειν τα μη καθηκοντα</span></span>), like the night clubs of modern cities, the dives and dens of the underworld, without God and in the darkness of unrestrained animal impulses. This was a technical term with Stoics (II Macc. 6:4). </p>
