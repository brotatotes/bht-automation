 Who was declared  (του ορισθεντος). Articular participle (first aorist passive) of οριζω for which verb see on Luke 22:22; Acts 2:23. He was the Son of God in his preincarnate state (2 Corinthians 8:9; Philippians 2:6) and still so after his Incarnation (verse Romans 1:3, "of the seed of David"), but it was the Resurrection of the dead (εξ αναστασεως νεκρων, the general resurrection implied by that of Christ) that definitely marked Jesus off as God's Son because of his claims about himself as God's Son and his prophecy that he would rise on the third day. This event (cf. Romans 1:1) gave God's seal "with power" (εν δυναμε), "in power," declared so in power (2 Corinthians 13:4). The Resurrection of Christ is the miracle of miracles. "The resurrection only declared him to be what he truly was" (Denney).According to the spirit of holiness  (κατα πνευμα αγιωσυνης). Not the Holy Spirit, but a description of Christ ethically as κατα σαρκα describes him physically (Denney). Hαγιωσυνη is rare (1 Thessalonians 3:13; 2 Corinthians 7:1 in N.T.), three times in LXX, each time as the attribute of God. "The πνευμα αγιωσυνης, though not the Divine nature, is that in which the Divinity or Divine Personality Resided " (Sanday and Headlam).Jesus Christ our Lord  (Ιησου Χριστου του κυριου ημων). These words gather up the total personality of Jesus (his deity and his humanity).
