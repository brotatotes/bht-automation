<p><b> Who was declared </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ορισθεντος</span></span>). Articular participle (first aorist passive) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οριζω</span></span> for which verb see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:22">Luke 22:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>. He was the Son of God in his preincarnate state (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span>) and still so after his Incarnation (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:3">Romans 1:3</span>, "of the seed of David"), but it was the Resurrection of the dead (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ αναστασεως νεκρων</span></span>, the general resurrection implied by that of Christ) that definitely marked Jesus off as God's Son because of his claims about himself as God's Son and his prophecy that he would rise on the third day. This event (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span>) gave God's seal "with power" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν δυναμε</span></span>), "in power," declared so in power (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:4">2 Corinthians 13:4</span>). The Resurrection of Christ is the miracle of miracles. "The resurrection only declared him to be what he truly was" (Denney).</p>
<p><b>According to the spirit of holiness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα πνευμα αγιωσυνης</span></span>). Not the Holy Spirit, but a description of Christ ethically as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα σαρκα</span></span> describes him physically (Denney). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hαγιωσυνη</span></span> is rare (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:1">2 Corinthians 7:1</span> in N.T.), three times in LXX, each time as the attribute of God. "The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα αγιωσυνης</span></span>, though not the Divine nature, is that in which the Divinity or Divine Personality Resided " (Sanday and Headlam).</p>
