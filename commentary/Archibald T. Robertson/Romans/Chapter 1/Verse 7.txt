 In Rome  (εν Ρωμη). One late uncial (G of tenth century) and a cursive omit these words here and one or two other late MSS. omit εν Ρωμη in verse Romans 1:15. This possibly proves the Epistle was circulated as a circular to a limited extent, but the evidence is late and slight and by no means shows that this was the case in the first century. It is not comparable with the absence of εν Εφεσω in Ephesians 1:1 from Aleph and B (the two oldest and best MSS.).Beloved of God  (αγαπητοις θεου). Ablative case of θεου after the verbal adjective like διδακτο θεου (taught of God) in John 6:45 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 516).From God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ  (απο θεου πατρος ημων κα κυριου Ιησου Χριστου). "St. Paul, if not formally enunciating a doctrine of the Divinity of Christ, held a view which cannot really be distinguished from it" (Sanday and Headlam). Paul's theology is clearly seen in the terms used in verses Romans 1:1-7.
