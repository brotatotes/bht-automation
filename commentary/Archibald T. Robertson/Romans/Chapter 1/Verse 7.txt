<p><b> In Rome </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Ρωμη</span></span>). One late uncial (G of tenth century) and a cursive omit these words here and one or two other late MSS. omit <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Ρωμη</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:15">Romans 1:15</span>. This possibly proves the Epistle was circulated as a circular to a limited extent, but the evidence is late and slight and by no means shows that this was the case in the first century. It is not comparable with the absence of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Εφεσω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:1">Ephesians 1:1</span> from Aleph and B (the two oldest and best MSS.).</p>
<p><b>Beloved of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπητοις θεου</span></span>). Ablative case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεου</span></span> after the verbal adjective like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδακτο θεου</span></span> (taught of God) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:45">John 6:45</span> (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 516).</p>
<p><b>From God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο θεου πατρος ημων κα κυριου Ιησου Χριστου</span></span>). "St. Paul, if not formally enunciating a doctrine of the Divinity of Christ, held a view which cannot really be distinguished from it" (Sanday and Headlam). Paul's theology is clearly seen in the terms used in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1-7">Romans 1:1-7</span>. </p>
