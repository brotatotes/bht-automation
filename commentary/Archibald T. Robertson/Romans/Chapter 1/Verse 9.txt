<p><b> I serve </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λατρευω</span></span>). Old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λατρον</span></span>, hire, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λατρις</span></span>, hireling, so to serve for hire, then to serve in general gods or men, whether sacred services (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9">Hebrews 9:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:2">Hebrews 10:2</span>) or spiritual service as here. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3">Philippians 3:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Unceasingly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδιαλειπτως</span></span>). Late adverb for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:2">1 Thessalonians 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:13">1 Thessalonians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:17">1 Thessalonians 5:17</span>, only other N.T. examples.</p>
<p><b>Always </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντοτε</span></span>). One might think that Paul prayed for no others, but he uses both adverbs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:2">1 Thessalonians 1:2</span>. He seems to have had prayer lists. He never omitted the Romans. </p>
