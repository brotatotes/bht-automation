 Desire  (ευδοκια). No papyri examples of this word, though ευδοκησις occurs, only in LXX and N.T., but no example for "desire" unless this is one, though the verb ευδοκεω is common in Polybius, Diodorus, Dion, Hal. It means will, pleasure, satisfaction (Matthew 11:26; 2 Thessalonians 1:11; Philippians 1:15; Philippians 2:13; Ephesians 1:5; Ephesians 1:9).Supplication  (δεησις). Late word from δεομα, to want, to beg, to pray. In the papyri. See Luke 1:13. It is noteworthy that, immediately after the discussion of the rejection of Christ by the Jews, Paul prays so earnestly for the Jews "that they may be saved" (εις σωτηριαν), literally "unto salvation." Clearly Paul did not feel that the case was hopeless for them in spite of their conduct. Bengel says: Non orasset Paul si absolute reprobati essent (Paul would not have prayed if they had been absolutely reprobate). Paul leaves God's problem to him and pours out his prayer for the Jews in accordance with his strong words in Romans 9:1-5.
