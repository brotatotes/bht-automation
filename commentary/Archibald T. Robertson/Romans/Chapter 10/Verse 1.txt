<p><b> Desire </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδοκια</span></span>). No papyri examples of this word, though <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδοκησις</span></span> occurs, only in LXX and N.T., but no example for "desire" unless this is one, though the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδοκεω</span></span> is common in Polybius, Diodorus, Dion, Hal. It means will, pleasure, satisfaction (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:26">Matthew 11:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:11">2 Thessalonians 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:15">Philippians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:13">Philippians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5">Ephesians 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:9">Ephesians 1:9</span>).</p>
<p><b>Supplication </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεησις</span></span>). Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δεομα</span></span>, to want, to beg, to pray. In the papyri. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:13">Luke 1:13</span>. It is noteworthy that, immediately after the discussion of the rejection of Christ by the Jews, Paul prays so earnestly for the Jews "that they may be saved" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις σωτηριαν</span></span>), literally "unto salvation." Clearly Paul did not feel that the case was hopeless for them in spite of their conduct. Bengel says: <i>Non orasset Paul si absolute reprobati essent</i> (Paul would not have prayed if they had been absolutely reprobate). Paul leaves God's problem to him and pours out his prayer for the Jews in accordance with his strong words in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:1-5">Romans 9:1-5</span>. </p>
