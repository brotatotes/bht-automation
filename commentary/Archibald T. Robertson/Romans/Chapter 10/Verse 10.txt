<p><b> Man believeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευετα</span></span>). Impersonal construction, "it is believed" (present passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>). The order is reversed in this verse and the true order (faith, then confession).</p>
<p><b>Confession is made </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογειτα</span></span>). Impersonal construction again, "it is confessed," "man confesses." Both <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρδια</span></span> (heart) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">στοματ</span></span> (mouth) are in the instrumental case. </p>
