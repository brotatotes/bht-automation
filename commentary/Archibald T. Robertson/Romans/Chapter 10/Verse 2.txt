<p><b> A zeal for God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ζηλον θεου</span></span>). Objective genitive like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:9">Philippians 3:9</span>, "through faith in Christ" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια πιστεως Χριστου</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>But not according to knowledge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλ' ου κατ' επιγνωσιν</span></span>). They had knowledge of God and so were superior to the Gentiles in privilege (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:9-11">Romans 2:9-11</span>), but they sought God in an external way by rules and rites and missed him (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:30-33">Romans 9:30-33</span>). They became zealous for the letter and the form instead of for God himself. </p>
