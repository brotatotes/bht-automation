<p><b> Being ignorant of God's righteousness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγνοουντες την του θεου δικαιοσυνην</span></span>). A blunt thing to say, but true as Paul has shown in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:1-3">Romans 2:1-3</span>. They did not understand the God-kind of righteousness by faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>). They misconceived it (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span>).</p>
<p><b>They did not subject themselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ υπεταγησαν</span></span>). Second aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτασσω</span></span>, common <i>Koine</i> verb, to put oneself under orders, to obey, here the passive in sense of the middle (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:7">James 4:7</span>) like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκριθην</span></span>, I answered. </p>
