 Being ignorant of God's righteousness  (αγνοουντες την του θεου δικαιοσυνην). A blunt thing to say, but true as Paul has shown in Romans 2:1-3. They did not understand the God-kind of righteousness by faith (Romans 1:17). They misconceived it (Romans 2:4).They did not subject themselves  (ουχ υπεταγησαν). Second aorist passive indicative of υποτασσω, common Koine verb, to put oneself under orders, to obey, here the passive in sense of the middle (James 4:7) like απεκριθην, I answered.
