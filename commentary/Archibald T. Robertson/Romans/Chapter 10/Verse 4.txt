<p><b> The end of the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τελος νομου</span></span>). Christ put a stop to the law as a means of salvation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:14">Romans 6:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:31">Romans 9:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:14">Colossians 2:14</span>) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:16">Luke 16:16</span>. Christ is the goal or aim of the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24">Galatians 3:24</span>). Christ is the fulfilment of the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17">Matthew 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:10">Romans 13:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:5">1 Timothy 1:5</span>). But here (Denney) Paul's main idea is that Christ ended the law as a method of salvation for "every one that believeth" whether Jew or Gentile. Christ wrote <i>finis</i> on law as a means of grace. </p>
