<p><b> Saith thus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως λεγε</span></span>). Paul personifies "the from faith righteousness" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η εκ πιστεως δικαιοσυνη</span></span>). A free reproduction from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+30:11-14">Deuteronomy 30:11-14</span>. Paul takes various phrases from the LXX and uses them for "his inspired conviction and experiences of the gospel" (Denney). He does not quote Moses as saying this or meaning this.</p>
<p><b>Say not in thy heart </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη ειπηις εν τη καρδια σου</span></span>). Second aorist active subjunctive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="de+8:17">Deuteronomy 8:17</span>. To say in the heart is to think (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span>).</p>
<p><b>That is, to bring Christ down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτ' εστιν Χριστον καταγαγειν</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive of the common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταγω</span></span>, to bring or lead down. It is dependent on the preceding verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναβησετα</span></span> (shall ascend). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τουτ' εστιν</span></span> (that is) is what is called <i>Midrash</i> or interpretation as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:8">Romans 9:8</span>. It occurs three times here (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:6-8">Romans 10:6-8</span>). Paul applies the words of Moses to Christ. There is no need for one to go to heaven to bring Christ down to earth. The Incarnation is already a glorious fact. Today some men scout the idea of the Deity and Incarnation of Christ. </p>
