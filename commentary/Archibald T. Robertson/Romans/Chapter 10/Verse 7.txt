<p><b> Into the abyss </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις την αβυσσον</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:31">Luke 8:31</span> for this old Greek word (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βυσσος</span></span>) bottomless like sea (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+106:26">Psalms 106:26</span>), our abyss. In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+9:1">Revelation 9:1</span> it is the place of torment. Paul seems to refer to Hades or Sheol (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:27">Acts 2:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:31">Acts 2:31</span>), the other world to which Christ went after death.</p>
<p><b>To bring Christ up </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Χριστον αναγαγειν</span></span>). Second aorist active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναγω</span></span> and dependent on <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταβησετα</span></span> (shall descend). Christ has already risen from the dead. The deity and resurrection of Christ are precisely the two chief points of attack today on the part of sceptics. </p>
