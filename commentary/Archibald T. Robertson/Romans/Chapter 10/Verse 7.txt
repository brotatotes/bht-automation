 Into the abyss  (εις την αβυσσον). See Luke 8:31 for this old Greek word (α privative and βυσσος) bottomless like sea (Psalms 106:26), our abyss. In Revelation 9:1 it is the place of torment. Paul seems to refer to Hades or Sheol (Acts 2:27; Acts 2:31), the other world to which Christ went after death.To bring Christ up  (Χριστον αναγαγειν). Second aorist active infinitive of αναγω and dependent on καταβησετα (shall descend). Christ has already risen from the dead. The deity and resurrection of Christ are precisely the two chief points of attack today on the part of sceptics.
