<p><b> But what saith it? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα τ λεγει?</span></span>). That is "the from faith righteousness."</p>
<p><b>The word of faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ρημα της πιστεως</span></span>). The gospel message concerning faith (objective genitive). Only here. In contrast to the law.</p>
<p><b>Which we preach </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κηρυσσομεν</span></span>). The living voice brings home to every one the faith kind of righteousness. Paul seizes upon the words of Moses with the orator's instinct and with rhetorical skill (Sanday and Headlam) applies them to the facts about the gospel message about the Incarnation and Resurrection of Christ. </p>
