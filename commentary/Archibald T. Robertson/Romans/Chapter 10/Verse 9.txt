<p><b> If thou shalt confess </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν ομολογησηις</span></span>). Third class condition (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ομολογεω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>With thy mouth Jesus as Lord </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω στοματ σου Κυριον Ιησουν</span></span>). This is the reading of nearly all the MSS. But B 71 Clem of Alex. read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ρημα εν τω στοματ σου οτ Κυριος Ιησους</span></span> (the word in thy mouth that Jesus is Lord). The idea is the same, the confession of Jesus as Lord as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+2:11">Philippians 2:11</span>. No Jew would do this who had not really trusted Christ, for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span> in the LXX is used of God. No Gentile would do it who had not ceased worshipping the emperor as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span>. The word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κυριος</span></span> was and is the touchstone of faith.</p>
<p><b>And shalt believe </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα πιστευσηις</span></span>). Same construction. Faith precedes confession, of course. </p>
