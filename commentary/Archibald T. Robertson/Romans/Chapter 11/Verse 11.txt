<p><b> Did they stumble that they might fall? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη επταισαν ινα πεσωσιν?</span></span>). Negative answer expected by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:1">Romans 11:1</span>. First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πταιω</span></span>, old verb, to stumble, only here in Paul (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:2">James 3:2</span>), suggested perhaps by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκανδαλον</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:9">Romans 11:9</span>. If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> is final, then we must add "merely" to the idea, "merely that they might fall" or make a sharp distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πταιω</span></span>, to stumble, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιπτω</span></span>, to fall, and take <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεσωσιν</span></span> as effective aorist active subjunctive to fall completely and for good. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hινα</span></span>, as we know, can be either final, sub-final, or even result. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:29">1 Corinthians 7:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:17">Galatians 5:17</span>. Paul rejects this query in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:11">Romans 11:11</span> as vehemently as he did that in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:1">Romans 11:1</span>.</p>
<p><b>By their fall </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω αυτων παραπτωματ</span></span>). Instrumental case. For the word, a falling aside or a false step from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραπιπτω</span></span>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15-20">Romans 5:15-20</span>.</p>
<p><b>Is come </b>. No verb in the Greek, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινετα</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγονεν</span></span> is understood.</p>
<p><b>For to provoke them to jealousy </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το παραζηλωσα</span></span>). Purpose expressed by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> and the articular infinitive, first aorist active, of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραζηλοω</span></span>, for which verb see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:22">1 Corinthians 10:22</span>. As an historical fact Paul turned to the Gentiles when the Jews rejected his message (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:45">Acts 13:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:28">Acts 28:28</span>, etc.).</p>
<p><b>The riches of the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλουτος κοσμου</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:12">Romans 10:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>Their loss </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ηττημα αυτων</span></span>). So perhaps in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:7">1 Corinthians 6:7</span>, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+31:8">Isaiah 31:8</span> defeat is the idea. Perhaps so here.</p>
<p><b>Fulness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληρωμα</span></span>). Perhaps "completion," though the word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span>, to fill, has a variety of senses, that with which anything is filled (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:26">1 Corinthians 10:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:28">1 Corinthians 10:28</span>), that which is filled (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span>).</p>
<p><b>How much more? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποσω μαλλον</span></span>). Argument <i>a fortiori</i> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:24">Romans 11:24</span>. Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:25">Romans 11:25</span> illustrates the point. </p>
