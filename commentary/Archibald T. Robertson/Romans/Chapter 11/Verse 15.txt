 The casting away of them  (η αποβολη αυτων). Objective genitive (αυτων) with αποβολη, old word from αποβαλλω, to throw off (Mark 10:50), in N.T. only here and Acts 27:22.The reconciling of the world  (καταλλαγη κοσμου). See Romans 5:10 for καταλλαγη (reconciling). It explains verse Romans 11:12.The receiving  (η προσλημψις). Old word from προσλαμβανω, to take to oneself, only here in N.T.Life from the dead  (ζωη εκ νεκρων). Already the conversion of Jews had become so difficult. It is like a miracle of grace today, though it does happen. Many think that Paul means that the general resurrection and the end will come when the Jews are converted. Possibly so, but it is by no means certain. His language may be merely figurative.
