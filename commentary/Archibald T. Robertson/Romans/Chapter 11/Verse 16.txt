<p><b> First fruit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαρχη</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:20">1 Corinthians 15:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:23">1 Corinthians 15:23</span>. The metaphor is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="nu+15:19">Numbers 15:19</span>. The LXX has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απαρχην φυραματος</span></span>, first of the dough as a heave offering.</p>
<p><b>The lump </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το φυραμα</span></span>). From which the first fruit came. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:21">Romans 9:21</span>. Apparently the patriarchs are the first fruit.</p>
<p><b>The root </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ριζα</span></span>). Perhaps Abraham singly here. The metaphor is changed, but the idea is the same. Israel is looked on as a tree. But one must recall and keep in mind the double sense of Israel in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:6">Romans 9:6</span>. (the natural and the spiritual). </p>
