<p><b> Branches </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαδων</span></span>). From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαω</span></span>, to break.</p>
<p><b>Were broken off </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξεκλασθησαν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλαω</span></span>. Play on the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλαδος</span></span> (branch) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκκλαω</span></span>, to break off. Condition of first class, assumed as true. Some of the individual Jews (natural Israel) were broken off the stock of the tree (spiritual Israel).</p>

<p><b>Being a wild olive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγριελαιος ων</span></span>). This word, used by Aristotle, occurs in an inscription. Ramsay (<i>Pauline Studies</i>, pp. 219ff.) shows that the ancients used the wild-olive graft upon an old olive tree to reinvigorate the tree precisely as Paul uses the figure here and that both the olive tree and the graft were influenced by each other, though the wild olive graft did not produce as good olives as the original stock. But it should be noted that in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:24">Romans 11:24</span> Paul expressly states that the grafting of Gentiles on to the stock of the spiritual Israel was "contrary to nature" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα φυσιν</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Wast grafted in </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενεκεντρισθης</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ενκεντριζω</span></span>, to cut in, to graft, used by Aristotle. Belongs "to the higher <i>Koine</i>" (literary <i>Koine</i>) according to Milligan.</p>
<p><b>Partaker </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνκοινωνος</span></span>). Co-partner.</p>
<p><b>Fatness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιοτητος</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιων</span></span> (fat), only here in N.T. Note three genitives here "of the root of the fatness of the olive." </p>
