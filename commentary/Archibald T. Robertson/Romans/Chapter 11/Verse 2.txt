<p><b> Whom he foreknew </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ον προεγνω</span></span>). The same form and sense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>, which see. Probably the Hebrew sense of choice beforehand. The nation of Israel was God's chosen people and so all the individuals in it could not be cast off.</p>
<p><b>Wot ye not? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ οιδατε?</span></span>). "Know ye not?" Why keep the old English "wot"?</p>
<p><b>Of Elijah </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν Ελεια</span></span>). "In the case of Elijah." Cf. "in the bush" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:26">Mark 12:26</span>).</p>
<p><b>He pleadeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντυγχανε</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:27">Romans 8:27</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εντυγχανω</span></span> means to happen on one and so to converse with (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:24">Acts 25:24</span>), to plead for (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:27">Romans 8:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:34">Romans 8:34</span>), to plead against as here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>, but the "against" is in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>. </p>
