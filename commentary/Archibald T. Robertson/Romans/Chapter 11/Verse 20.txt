<p><b> Well </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλως</span></span>). Perhaps ironical, though Paul may simply admit the statement (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:32">Mark 12:32</span>) and show the Gentile his real situation.</p>
<p><b>By unbelief </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη απιστια</span></span>)</p>
<p><b>--by faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστε</span></span>). Instrumental case with both contrasted words (by unbelief, by belief). </p>
