<p><b> Contrary to nature </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα φυσιν</span></span>). This is the gist of the argument, the power of God to do what is contrary to natural processes. He put the wild olive (Gentile) into the good olive tree (the spiritual Israel) and made the wild olive (contrary to nature) become the good olive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλλιελαιος</span></span>, the garden olive, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλλος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελαια</span></span> in Aristotle and a papyrus).</p>
<p><b>Into their own olive tree </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη ιδια ελαια</span></span>). Dative case. Another argument <i>a fortiori</i>, "how much more" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολλω μαλλον</span></span>). God can graft the natural Israel back upon the spiritual Israel, if they become willing. </p>
