 And so  (κα ουτως). By the complement of the Gentiles stirring up the complement of the Jews (verses Romans 11:11).All Israel  (πας Ισραηλ). What does Paul mean? The immediate context (use of πας in contrast with απο μερουσ, πληρωμα here in contrast with πληρωμα in verse Romans 11:12) argues for the Jewish people "as a whole." But the spiritual Israel (both Jews and Gentiles) may be his idea in accord with Romans 9:6 (Galatians 6:16) as the climax of the argument. At any rate we should strive for and pray for the conversion of Jews as a whole. Paul here quotes from Isaiah 59:20; Isaiah 27:9.The Deliverer  (ο ρυομενος). Present middle articular participle of ρυομα, to rescue, to deliver. See on 1 Thessalonians 1:10; 2 Corinthians 1:10. The Hebrew Goel, the Avenger, the Messiah, the Redeemer (Deuteronomy 25:5-10; Job 19:25; Ruth 3:12). Paul interprets it of Jesus as Messiah.
