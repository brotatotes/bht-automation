<p><b> They have digged down </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεσκαψαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατασκαπτω</span></span>, to dig under or down. Old verb, here only in N.T. (critical text). LXX has <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθειλαν</span></span> "pulled down." Paul has reversed the order of the LXX of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:10">1 Kings 19:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:14">1 Kings 19:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:18">1 Kings 19:18</span>.</p>
<p><b>Altars </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυσιαστηρια</span></span>). Late word (LXX, Philo, Josephus, N.T. eccl. writers) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θυσιαζω</span></span>, to sacrifice. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:23">Acts 17:23</span>.</p>
<p><b>And I am left alone </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καγω υπελειφθην μονος</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπολειπω</span></span>, old word, to leave under or behind, here only in N.T. Elijah's mood was that of utter dejection in his flight from Jezebel.</p>
<p><b>Life </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχην</span></span>). It is not possible to draw a clear distinction between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχη</span></span> (soul) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span> (spirit). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ψυχη</span></span> is from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψυχω</span></span>, to breathe or blow, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνεω</span></span>, to blow. Both are used for the personality and for the immortal part of man. Paul is usually dichotomous in his language, but sometimes trichotomous in a popular sense. We cannot hold Paul's terms to our modern psychological distinctions. </p>
