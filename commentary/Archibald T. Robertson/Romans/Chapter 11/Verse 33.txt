<p><b> O the depth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ο βαθος</span></span>). Exclamation with omega and the nominative case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαθος</span></span> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:2">2 Corinthians 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:39">Romans 8:39</span>). Paul's argument concerning God's elective grace and goodness has carried him to the heights and now he pauses on the edge of the precipice as he contemplates God's wisdom and knowledge, fully conscious of his inability to sound the bottom with the plummet of human reason and words.</p>
<p><b>Unsearchable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεξεραυνητα</span></span>). Double compound (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span>) verbal adjective of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ερευναω</span></span> (old spelling <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-ευ-</span></span>), late and rare word (LXX, Dio Cassius, Heraclitus), only here in N.T. Some of God's wisdom can be known (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>), but not all.</p>
<p><b>Past tracing out </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανεξιχνιαστο</span></span>). Another verbal adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> privative and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξιχνιαζω</span></span>, to trace out by tracks (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιχνος</span></span> <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:12">Romans 4:12</span>).

Also in ecclesiastical writers. Some of God's tracks he has left plain to us, but others are beyond us. </p>
