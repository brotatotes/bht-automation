 First driven to him  (προεδωκεν αυτω). First aorist active indicative of προδιδωμ, to give beforehand or first. Old verb, here alone in N.T. From Job 41:11, but not like the LXX, Paul's own translation.Shall be recompensed  (ανταποδοθησετα). First future passive of double compound ανταποδιδωμ, to pay back (both αντ and απο), old word in good sense, as here and Luke 14:14; 1 Thessalonians 3:9 and in bad sense as 2 Thessalonians 1:6; Romans 12:19.
