<p><b> Remnant </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λιμμα</span></span>). Old word, but only here in N.T., but in papyri also and with this spelling rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λειμμα</span></span>. From <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λειπω</span></span>, to leave.</p>
<p><b>According to the election of grace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατ' εκλογην χαριτος</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:6-13">Romans 9:6-13</span>. The election is all of God. Verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:6">Romans 11:6</span> explains it further. </p>
