 Avenge not  (μη εκδικουντες). Independent participle again of late verb εκδικεω from εκδικος, exacting justice (Romans 13:4). See already Luke 18:5; 2 Corinthians 10:6.But give place unto wrath  (αλλα δοτε τοπον τη οργη). Second aorist active imperative of διδωμ, to give. "Give room for the (note article as in Romans 5:9; 1 Thessalonians 2:16) wrath" of God instead of taking vengeance in your own hands. See Ephesians 4:27 for διδοτε τοπον. Paul quotes Deuteronomy 32:35 (the Hebrew rather than the LXX). So have Hebrews 10:30 and the Targum of Onkelos, but the relation between them and Paul we cannot tell. Socrates and Epictetus condemned personal vindictiveness as Paul does here.I will recompense  (ανταποδωσω). Future active of the double compound verb quoted also in Romans 11:35.
