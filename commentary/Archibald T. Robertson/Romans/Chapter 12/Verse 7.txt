<p><b> Let us give ourselves </b>. There is no verb in the Greek. We must supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωμεν εαυτους</span></span> or some such phrase.</p>
<p><b>Or he that teacheth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειτε ο διδασκων</span></span>). Here the construction changes and no longer do we have the accusative case like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονιαν</span></span> (general word for Christian service of all kinds including ministers and deacons) as the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχοντες</span></span>, but the nominative articular participle. A new verb must be supplied of which <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο διδασκων</span></span> is the subject as with the succeeding participles through verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span>. Perhaps in each instance the verb is to be repeated from the participle like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διδασκετω</span></span> here (let him teach) or a general term <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιειτω</span></span> (let him do it) can be used for all of them as seems necessary before "with liberality" in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν απλοτητ</span></span>, in simplicity, for which word, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:22">Matthew 6:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:2">2 Corinthians 8:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:11">2 Corinthians 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:13">2 Corinthians 9:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>He that ruleth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο προισταμενος</span></span>). "The one standing in front" for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:12">1 Thessalonians 5:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>With diligence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν σπουδη</span></span>). "In haste" as if in earnest (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:25">Mark 6:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:11">2 Corinthians 7:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:8">2 Corinthians 8:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:16">2 Corinthians 8:16</span>), from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπευδω</span></span>, to hasten. Again verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:11">Romans 12:11</span>.</p>
<p><b>With cheerfulness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ιλαροτητ</span></span>). Late word, only here in N.T., from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλαρος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:7">2 Corinthians 9:7</span>) cheerful, hilarious. </p>
