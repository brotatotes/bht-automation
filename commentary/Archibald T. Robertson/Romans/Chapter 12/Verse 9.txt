 Without hypocrisy  (ανυποκριτος). Late double compound adjective for which see 2 Corinthians 6:6. Hypocritical or pretended love is no love at all as Paul describes αγαπη in Romans 12:1.Abhor  (αποστυγουντες). Old verb with intensive (απο) dislike, only here in N.T. The present active participle is here employed in the sense of the present active indicative as sometimes happens with the independent participle (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1132ff.). This same idiom appears with κολλωμενο (cleaving) for which verb see on 1 Corinthians 6:17, with προηγουμενο (preferring) in verse Romans 12:10 (old verb here only in N.T.), and with the participles in verses Romans 12:11-13 and again in verses Romans 12:16-18. One can supply εστε if he prefers.
