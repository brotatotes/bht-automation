 Every soul  (πασα ψυχη). As in Romans 2:9; Acts 2:43. A Hebraism for πας ανθρωπος (every man).To the higher powers  (εξουσιαις υπερεχουσαις). Abstract for concrete. See Mark 2:10 for εξουσια. Hυπερεχω is an old verb to have or hold over, to be above or supreme, as in 1 Peter 2:13.Except by God  (ε μη υπο θεου). So the best MSS. rather than απο θεου (from God). God is the author of order, not anarchy.The powers that be  (α ουσα). "The existing authorities" (supply εξουσια). Art ordained (τεταγμενα εισιν). Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of τασσω, "stand ordained by God." Paul is not arguing for the divine right of kings or for any special form of government, but for government and order. Nor does he oppose here revolution for a change of government, but he does oppose all lawlessness and disorder.
