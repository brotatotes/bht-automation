 And this  (κα τουτο). Either nominative absolute or accusative of general reference, a common idiom for "and that too" (1 Corinthians 6:6; 1 Corinthians 6:8, etc.).Knowing  (ειδοτες). Second perfect active participle, nominative plural without a principal verb. Either we must supply a verb like ποιησωμεν (let us do it) or ποιησατε (do ye do it) or treat it as an independent participle as in Romans 12:10.The season  (τον καιρον). The critical period, not χρονος (time in general).High time  (ωρα). Like our the "hour" has come, etc. MSS. vary between ημας (us) and υμας (you), accusative of general reference with εγερθηνα (first aorist passive infinitive of εγειρω, to awake, to wake up), "to be waked up out of sleep" (εξ υπνου).Nearer to us  (εγγυτερον ημων). Probably so, though ημων can be taken equally well with η σωτηρια (our salvation is nearer). Final salvation, Paul means, whether it comes by the second coming of Christ as they all hoped or by death. It is true of us all.
