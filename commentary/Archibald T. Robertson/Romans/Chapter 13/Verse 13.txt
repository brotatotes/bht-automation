 Honestly  (ευσχημονως). Paul is fond of the metaphor "walk" (περιπατεω), 33 times though not in the Pastoral Epistles. This old adverb (from ευσχημων, graceful) occurs also in 1 Thessalonians 4:12; 1 Corinthians 14:40. The English word "honest" means honourable (Latin honor) and so decent. Wycliff translates 1 Corinthians 12:32 by "unhonest," "honesty," "honest" for "less honourable, honour, honourable."Not in revelling  (μη κωμοις). Plural "revellings." See on Galatians 5:21.Drunkenness  (μεθαις). Plural again, "drunkennesses." See on Galatians 5:21.In chambering  (κοιταις). Plural also. See on Romans 9:10.Wantonness  (ασελγειαις). Plural likewise. See on 2 Corinthians 12:21; Galatians 5:19.Not in strife and jealousy  (μη εριδ κα ζηλω). Singular here, but some MSS. have the plural like the previous words. Quarrelling and jealousy go with the other vices (Shedd).
