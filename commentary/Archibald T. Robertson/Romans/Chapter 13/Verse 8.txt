<p><b> Save to love one another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη το αλληλους αγαπαιν</span></span>). "Except the loving one another." This articular infinitive is in the accusative case the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οφειλετε</span></span> and partitive apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεν</span></span> (nothing). This debt can never be paid off, but we should keep the interest paid up.</p>
<p><b>His neighbour </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον ετερον</span></span>). "The other man," "the second man." "Just as in the relations of man and God <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span> has been substituted for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομος</span></span>, so between man and man <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπη</span></span> takes the place of definite legal relations" (Sanday and Headlam). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:37-40">Matthew 22:37-40</span> for the words of Jesus on this subject. Love is the only solution of our social relations and national problems. </p>
