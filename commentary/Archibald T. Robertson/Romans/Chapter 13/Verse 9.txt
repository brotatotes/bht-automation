 For this  (το γαρ). For the article (το) pointing to a sentence see Romans 8:26, here to the quotation. The order of the commandments here is like that in Luke 18:20; James 2:11 and in B for Romans 13:5, but different from that of the Hebrew in Romans 13:20; Romans 13:5. The use of ου with the volitive future in prohibitions in place of μη and the imperative or subjunctive is a regular Greek idiom.And if there be any other  (κα ε τις ετερα). Paul does not attempt to give them all.It is summed up  (ανακεφαλαιουτα). Present passive indicative of ανακεφαλαιοω, late literary word or "rhetorical term" (ανα, κεφαλαιον, head or chief as in Hebrews 8:1). Not in the papyri, but κεφαλαιον, quite common for sum or summary. In N.T. only here and Ephesians 1:10.Namely  (εν τω). See το γαρ at the beginning of the verse, though omitted by B F. The quotation is from Leviticus 19:18. Quoted in Matthew 5:43; Matthew 22:39; Mark 12:31; Luke 10:27; Galatians 5:14; James 2:8 it is called βασιλικος νομος (royal law).Thy neighbour  (τον πλησιον σου). Πλησιον is an adverb and with the article it means "the one near thee." See on Matthew 5:43.
