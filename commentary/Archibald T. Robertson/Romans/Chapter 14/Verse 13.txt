 Let us not therefore judge one another any more  (μηκετ ουν αλληλους κρινωμεν). Present active subjunctive (volitive). "Let us no longer have the habit of criticizing one another." A wonderfully fine text for modern Christians and in harmony with what the Master said (Matthew 7:1).That no man put a stumbling block in his brother's way or an occasion of falling  (το μη τιθενα προσκομμα τω αδελφω η σκανδαλον). Articular present active infinitive of τιθημ in apposition with τουτο, accusative case after κρινατε: "Judge this rather, the not putting a stumbling block (see Romans 9:32 for προσκομμα) or a trap (σκανδαλον, Romans 9:33) for his brother" (αδελφω, dative of disadvantage).
