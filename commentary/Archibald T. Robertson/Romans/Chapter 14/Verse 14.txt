<p><b> I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδα κα πεπεισμα εν κυριω Ιησου</span></span>). He knows it and stands persuaded (perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πειθω</span></span>, to persuade), but in the sphere of the Lord Jesus (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:1">Romans 9:1</span>), not by mere rational processes.</p>
<p><b>Unclean of itself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καινον δι' εαυτου</span></span>). So Paul takes his stand with the "strong" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:4">1 Corinthians 8:4</span>, but he is not a libertine. Paul's liberty as to food is regulated by his life in the Lord. For this use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινος</span></span>, not as common to all (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:44">Acts 2:44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:32">Acts 4:32</span>), but unhallowed, impure, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:2">Mark 7:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:5">Mark 7:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:14">Acts 10:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:28">Acts 10:28</span>. God made all things for their own uses.</p>
<p><b>Save that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε μη</span></span>). The exception lies not in the nature of the food (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' εαυτου</span></span>), but in the man's view of it (to him, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκεινω</span></span>, dative case). </p>
