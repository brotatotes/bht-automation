<p>Because of meat (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια βρωμα</span></span>). "Because of food."</p>
<p><b>In love </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα αγαπην</span></span>). "According to love" as the regulating principle of life. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span> where Paul pleads for love in place of knowledge on this point.</p>
<p><b>Destroy not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη απολλυε</span></span>). Present active imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολλυω</span></span>, the very argument made in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:10">1 Corinthians 8:10</span>.</p>
<p><b>With thy meat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω βρωματ σου</span></span>). Instrumental case, "with thy food." It is too great a price to pay for personal liberty as to food. </p>
