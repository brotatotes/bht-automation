<p><b> The kingdom of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η βασιλεια του θεου</span></span>). Not the future kingdom of eschatology, but the present spiritual kingdom, the reign of God in the heart, of which Jesus spoke so often. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:21">1 Corinthians 4:21</span>. Paul scores heavily here, for it is not found in externals like food and drink, but in spiritual qualities and graces. </p>
