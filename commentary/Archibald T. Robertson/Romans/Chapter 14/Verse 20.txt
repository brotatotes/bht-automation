 Overthrow not  (μη καταλυε). "Destroy not," "do not loosen down" (carrying on the metaphor in οικοδομη, building).The work of God  (το εργον του θεου). The brother for whom Christ died, verse Romans 14:15. Perhaps with a side-glance at Esau and his mess of pottage.But it is evil  (αλλα κακον). Paul changes from the plural κοινα to the singular κακον.With offence  (δια προσκομματος). "With a stumbling-block" as in verse Romans 14:13. This use of δια (accompaniment) is common. So then it is addressed to the "strong" brother not to cause a stumbling-block by the way he eats and exercises his freedom.
