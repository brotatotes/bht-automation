<p><b> Overthrow not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη καταλυε</span></span>). "Destroy not," "do not loosen down" (carrying on the metaphor in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οικοδομη</span></span>, building).</p>
<p><b>The work of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το εργον του θεου</span></span>). The brother for whom Christ died, verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:15">Romans 14:15</span>. Perhaps with a side-glance at Esau and his mess of pottage.</p>
<p><b>But it is evil </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα κακον</span></span>). Paul changes from the plural <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινα</span></span> to the singular <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακον</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>With offence </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια προσκομματος</span></span>). "With a stumbling-block" as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:13">Romans 14:13</span>. This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> (accompaniment) is common. So then it is addressed to the "strong" brother not to cause a stumbling-block by the way he eats and exercises his freedom. </p>
