 Have thou to thyself before God  (συ--κατα σεαυτον εχε ενωπιον του θεου). Very emphatic position of συ at the beginning of the sentence, "Thou there." The old MSS. put ην (relative "which") after πιστιν and before εχεις. This principle applies to both the "strong" and the "weak." He is within his rights to act "according to thyself," but it must be "before God" and with due regard to the rights of the other brethren.In that which he approveth  (εν ο δοκιμαζε). This beatitude cuts both ways. After testing and then approving (Romans 1:28; Romans 2:18) one takes his stand which very act may condemn himself by what he says or does. "It is a rare felicity to have a conscience untroubled by scruples" (Denney).
