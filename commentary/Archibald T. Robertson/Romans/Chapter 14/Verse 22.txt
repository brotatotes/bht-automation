<p><b> Have thou to thyself before God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ--κατα σεαυτον εχε ενωπιον του θεου</span></span>). Very emphatic position of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ</span></span> at the beginning of the sentence, "Thou there." The old MSS. put <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ην</span></span> (relative "which") after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστιν</span></span> and before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχεις</span></span>. This principle applies to both the "strong" and the "weak." He is within his rights to act "according to thyself," but it must be "before God" and with due regard to the rights of the other brethren.</p>
<p><b>In that which he approveth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ο δοκιμαζε</span></span>). This beatitude cuts both ways. After testing and then approving (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:18">Romans 2:18</span>) one takes his stand which very act may condemn himself by what he says or does. "It is a rare felicity to have a conscience untroubled by scruples" (Denney). </p>
