<p><b> He that doubteth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο διακρινομενος</span></span>). Present middle participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακρινω</span></span>, to judge between (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>), to hesitate. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:6">James 1:6</span> for this same picture of the double-minded man. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:20">Romans 4:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:23">Mark 11:23</span>.</p>
<p><b>Is condemned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακεκριτα</span></span>). Perfect passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακρινω</span></span> (note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα-</span></span>), "stands condemned."</p>
<p><b>If he eat </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν φαγη</span></span>). Third class condition, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν</span></span> and second aorist active subjunctive. If in spite of his doubt, he eat.</p>
<p><b>Whatsoever is not of faith is sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παν ο ουκ εκ πιστεως αμαρτια εστιν</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>Faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span>) here is subjective, one's strong conviction in the light of his relation to Christ and his enlightened conscience. To go against this combination is sin beyond a doubt. Some MSS. (A L etc.) put the doxology here which most place in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25-27">Romans 16:25-27</span>. But they all give chapters 15 and 16. Some have supposed that the Epistle originally ended here, but that is pure speculation. Some even suggest two editions of the Epistle. But chapter 15 goes right on with the topic discussed in chapter 14. </p>
