<p><b> We the strong </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημεις ο δυνατο</span></span>). Paul identifies himself with this wing in the controversy. He means the morally strong as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:10">2 Corinthians 12:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:9">2 Corinthians 13:9</span>, not the mighty as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:26">1 Corinthians 1:26</span>.</p>
<p><b>The infirmities </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα ασθενηματα</span></span>). "The weaknesses" (cf. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ασθενων</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:2">Romans 14:2</span>), the scruples "of the not strong" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των αδυνατων</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:8">Acts 14:8</span> where it is used of the man weak in his feet (impotent).</p>
<p><b>To bear </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασταζειν</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:2">Galatians 6:2</span>, common in the figurative sense.</p>
<p><b>Not to please ourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη εαυτοις αρεσκειν</span></span>). Precisely Paul's picture of his own conduct in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:33">1 Corinthians 10:33</span>. </p>
