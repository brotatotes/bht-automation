 We the strong  (ημεις ο δυνατο). Paul identifies himself with this wing in the controversy. He means the morally strong as in 2 Corinthians 12:10; 2 Corinthians 13:9, not the mighty as in 1 Corinthians 1:26.The infirmities  (τα ασθενηματα). "The weaknesses" (cf. ασθενων in Romans 14:1; Romans 14:2), the scruples "of the not strong" (των αδυνατων). See Acts 14:8 where it is used of the man weak in his feet (impotent).To bear  (βασταζειν). As in Galatians 6:2, common in the figurative sense.Not to please ourselves  (μη εαυτοις αρεσκειν). Precisely Paul's picture of his own conduct in 1 Corinthians 10:33.
