<p><b> I myself also </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αυτος εγω</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:25">Romans 7:25</span> for a like emphasis on himself, here in contrast with "ye yourselves" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα αυτο</span></span>). The argument of the Epistle has been completed both in the main line (chapters <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:1-8">Romans 15:1-8</span>) and the further applications (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:1-15">Romans 9:1-15</span>). Here begins the Epilogue, the personal matters of importance.</p>
<p><b>Full of goodness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεστο αγαθοσυνης</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:11">2 Thessalonians 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span> for this LXX and Pauline word (in ecclesiastical writers also) made from the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαθος</span></span>, good, by adding <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-συνη</span></span> (common ending for words like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη</span></span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:29">Romans 1:29</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεστος</span></span> with genitive and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπληρωμενο</span></span> (perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span> as here), but there with instrumental case after it instead of the genitive. Paul gives the Roman Christians (chiefly Gentiles) high praise. The "all knowledge" is not to be pressed too literally, "our Christian knowledge in its entirety" (Sanday and Headlam).</p>
<p><b>To admonish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουθετειν</span></span>). To put in mind (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νουθετης</span></span> and this from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νους</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τιθημ</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:12">1 Thessalonians 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:14">1 Thessalonians 5:14</span>. "Is it laying too much stress on the language of compliment to suggest that these words give a hint of St. Paul's aim in this Epistle?" (Sanday and Headlam). The strategic position of the church in Rome made it a great centre for radiating and echoing the gospel over the world as Thessalonica did for Macedonia (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:8">1 Thessalonians 1:8</span>). </p>
