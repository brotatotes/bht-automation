 I write  (εγραψα). Epistolary aorist.The more boldly  (τολμηροτερως). Old comparative adverb from τολμηρως. Most MSS. read τολμηροτερον. Only here in N.T.In some measure  (απο μερους). Perhaps referring to some portions of the Epistle where he has spoken plainly (Romans 6:12; Romans 6:19; Romans 8:9; Romans 11:17; Romans 14:3; Romans 14:4; Romans 14:10, etc.).As putting you again in remembrance  (ος επαναμιμνησκων υμας). Delicately put with ως and επ in the verb, "as if calling back to mind again" (επ). This rare verb is here alone in the N.T.
