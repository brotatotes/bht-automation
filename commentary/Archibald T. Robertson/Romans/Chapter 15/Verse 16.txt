<p><b> That I should be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το εινα με</span></span>). The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το</span></span> idiom with the infinitive again (verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:8">Romans 15:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:13">Romans 15:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>Minister </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λειτουργον</span></span>). Predicate accusative in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span> and see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:6">Romans 13:6</span> for the word. "The word here derives from the context the priestly associations which often attach to it in the LXX" (Denney). But this purely metaphorical use does not show that Paul attached a "sacerdotal" character to the ministry.</p>
<p><b>Ministering </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερουργουντα</span></span>). Present active participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερουργεω</span></span>, late verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερουργος</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιεροσ, εργω</span></span>), in LXX, Philo, and Josephus, only here in N.T. It means to work in sacred things, to minister as a priest. Paul had as high a conception of his work as a preacher of the gospel as any priest did.</p>
<p><b>The offering up of the Gentiles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η προσφορα των εθνων</span></span>). Genitive of apposition, the Gentiles being the offering. They are Paul's offering. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:26">Acts 21:26</span>.</p>
<p><b>Acceptable </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευπροσδεκτος</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:2">2 Corinthians 6:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:12">2 Corinthians 8:12</span>. Because "sanctified in the Holy Spirit" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγιασμενη εν πνευματ αγιω</span></span>, perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιαζω</span></span>). </p>
