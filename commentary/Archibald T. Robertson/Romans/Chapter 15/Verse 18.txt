<p><b> Any things save those which Christ wrought through me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ων ου κατειργασατο Χριστος δι' εμου</span></span>). Rather, "any one of those things which Christ did not work through me." The antecedent of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ων</span></span> is the unexpressed <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span> and the accusative relative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">α</span></span> (object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατειργασατο</span></span>) is attracted into the genitive case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτων</span></span> after a common idiom.</p>
<p><b>By word and deed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογω κα εργω</span></span>). Instrumental case with both words. By preaching and life (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:19">Luke 24:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:1">Acts 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:22">Acts 7:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:11">2 Corinthians 10:11</span>). </p>
