<p><b> In power of signs and wonders </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν δυναμε σημειων κα τερατων</span></span>). Note all three words as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span>, only here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμις</span></span> is connected with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημεια</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τερατα</span></span>. See all three words used of Paul's own work in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:12">2 Corinthians 12:12</span> and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:9">2 Thessalonians 2:9</span> of the Man of Sin. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:5">1 Thessalonians 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:4">1 Corinthians 2:4</span> for the "power" of the Holy Spirit in Paul's preaching. Note repetition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν δυναμε</span></span> here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευματος αγιου</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>So that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωστε</span></span>). Result expressed by the perfect active infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεπληρωκενα</span></span> (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πληροω</span></span>) with the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span> (general reference).</p>
<p><b>Round about even unto Illyricum </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυκλω μεχρ του Ιλλυρικου</span></span>). "In a ring" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυκλω</span></span>, locative case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κυκλος</span></span>). Probably a journey during the time when Paul left Macedonia and waited for II Corinthians to have its effect before coming to Corinth. If so, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:2">Romans 15:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:1-3">Acts 20:1-3</span>. When he did come, the trouble with the Judaizers was over. Illyricum seems to be the name for the region west of Macedonia (Dalmatia). Strabo says that the Egnatian Way passed through it. Arabia and Illyricum would thus be the extreme limits of Paul's mission journeys so far. </p>
