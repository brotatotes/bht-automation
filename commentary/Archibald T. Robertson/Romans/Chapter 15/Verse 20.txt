<p><b> Yea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως δε</span></span>). "And so," introducing a limitation to the preceding statement.</p>
<p><b>Making it my aim </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλοτιμουμενον</span></span>). Present middle participle (accusative case agreeing with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">με</span></span>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλοτιμεομα</span></span>, old verb, to be fond of honour (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φιλοσ, τιμη</span></span>). In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:11">1 Thessalonians 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:9">2 Corinthians 5:9</span>. A noble word in itself, quite different in aim from the Latin word for</p>
<p><b>ambition </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμβιο</span></span>, to go on both sides to carry one's point).</p>
<p><b>Not where </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ οπου</span></span>). Paul was a pioneer preacher pushing on to new fields after the manner of Daniel Boone in Kentucky.</p>
<p><b>That I might now build upon another man's foundation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα μη επ' αλλοτριον θεμελιον οικοδομω</span></span>). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλοτριος</span></span> (not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλος</span></span>) see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:4">Romans 14:4</span>. For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεμελιον</span></span>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:48">Luke 6:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11">1 Corinthians 3:11</span>. This noble ambition of Paul's is not within the range of some ministers who can only build on another's foundation as Apollos did in Corinth. But the pioneer preacher and missionary has a dignity and glory all his own. </p>
