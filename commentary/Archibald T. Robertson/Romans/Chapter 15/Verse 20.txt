 Yea  (ουτως δε). "And so," introducing a limitation to the preceding statement.Making it my aim  (φιλοτιμουμενον). Present middle participle (accusative case agreeing with με) of φιλοτιμεομα, old verb, to be fond of honour (φιλοσ, τιμη). In N.T. only here and 1 Thessalonians 4:11; 2 Corinthians 5:9. A noble word in itself, quite different in aim from the Latin word forambition  (αμβιο, to go on both sides to carry one's point).Not where  (ουχ οπου). Paul was a pioneer preacher pushing on to new fields after the manner of Daniel Boone in Kentucky.That I might now build upon another man's foundation  (ινα μη επ' αλλοτριον θεμελιον οικοδομω). For αλλοτριος (not αλλος) see Romans 14:4. For θεμελιον, see Luke 6:48; 1 Corinthians 3:11. This noble ambition of Paul's is not within the range of some ministers who can only build on another's foundation as Apollos did in Corinth. But the pioneer preacher and missionary has a dignity and glory all his own.
