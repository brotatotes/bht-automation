<p><b> For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηυδοκησαν γαρ Μακεδονια κα Αχαια</span></span>). "For Macedonia and Achaia took pleasure." The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηυδοκησαν</span></span> (first aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευδοκεω</span></span>) shows that it was voluntary (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:4">2 Corinthians 8:4</span>). Paul does not here mention Asia and Galatia.</p>
<p><b>A certain contribution </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνιαν τινα</span></span>). Put thus because it was unknown to the Romans. For this sense of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κοινωνιαν</span></span>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:4">2 Corinthians 8:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:13">2 Corinthians 9:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>For the poor among the saints </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τους πτωχους των αγιων</span></span>). Partitive genitive. Not all there were poor, but <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:32-5">Acts 4:32-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1-6">Acts 6:1-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:29">Acts 11:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:10">Galatians 2:10</span> prove that many were. </p>
