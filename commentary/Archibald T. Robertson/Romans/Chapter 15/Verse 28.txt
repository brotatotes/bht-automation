First aorist middle participle (antecedent action, having sealed) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφραγιζω</span></span>, old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφραγις</span></span>, a seal (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:11">Romans 4:11</span>), to stamp with a seal for security (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:66">Matthew 27:66</span>) or for confirmation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:22">2 Corinthians 1:22</span>) and here in a metaphorical sense. Paul was keenly sensitive that this collection should be actually conveyed to Jerusalem free from all suspicion (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:18-23">2 Corinthians 8:18-23</span>).</p>
<p><b>I will go on by you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απελευσομα δι' υμων</span></span>). Future middle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απερχομα</span></span>, to go off or on.

He repeats the point of verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:24">Romans 15:24</span>, his temporary stay in Rome with Spain as the objective. How little we know what is ahead of us and how grateful we should be for our ignorance on this point. </p>
