<p><b> That I may be delivered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα ρυσθω</span></span>). First aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ρυομα</span></span>, old verb to rescue. This use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> is the sub-final one after words of beseeching or praying. Paul foresaw trouble all the way to Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:23">Acts 20:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:4">Acts 21:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:13">Acts 21:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>May be acceptable to the saints </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευπροσδεκτος τοις αγιοις γενητα</span></span>). "May become (second aorist middle subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γινομα</span></span>) acceptable to the saints." The Judaizers would give him trouble. There was peril of a schism in Christianity. </p>
