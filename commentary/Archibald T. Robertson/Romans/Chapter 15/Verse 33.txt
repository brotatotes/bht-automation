<p><b> The God of peace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος της ειρηνης</span></span>). One of the characteristics of God that Paul often mentions in benedictions (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:16">2 Thessalonians 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11">2 Corinthians 13:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+4:9">Philippians 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:20">Romans 16:20</span>). Because of the "amen" here some scholars would make this the close of the Epistle and make chapter 16 a separate Epistle to the Ephesians. But the MSS. are against it. There is nothing strange at all in Paul's having so many friends in Rome though he had not yet been there himself. Rome was the centre of the world's life as Paul realized (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:15">Romans 1:15</span>). All men sooner or later hoped to see Rome. </p>
