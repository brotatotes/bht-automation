<p><b> I commend </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιστημ</span></span>). The regular word for letters of commendation as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:1">2 Corinthians 3:1</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συστατικων επιστολων</span></span>). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:5">Romans 3:5</span>. So here verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:1">Romans 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:2">Romans 16:2</span> constitute Paul's recommendation of Phoebe, the bearer of the Epistle. Nothing else is known of her, though her name (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φοιβη</span></span>) means bright or radiant.</p>
<p><b>Sister </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αδελφην</span></span>). In Christ, not in the flesh.</p>
<p><b>Who is a servant of the church </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουσαν διακονον της εκκλησιας</span></span>). The etymology of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονος</span></span> we have had repeatedly. The only question here is whether it is used in a general sense or in a technical sense as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8-13">1 Timothy 3:8-13</span>. In favour of the technical sense of "deacon" or "deaconess" is the addition of "<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της εκκλησιας</span></span>" (of the church). In some sense Phoebe was a servant or minister of the church in Cenchreae. Besides, right in the midst of the discussion in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8-13">1 Timothy 3:8-13</span> Paul has a discussion of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γυναικας</span></span> (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:11">Romans 16:11</span>) either as women as deaconesses or as the wives of deacons (less likely though possible). The <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i> has numerous allusions to deaconesses. The strict separation of the sexes made something like deaconesses necessary for baptism, visiting the women, etc. Cenchreae, as the eastern port of Corinth, called for much service of this kind. Whether the deaconesses were a separate organization on a par with the deacons we do not know nor whether they were the widows alluded to in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:9">1 Timothy 5:9</span>. </p>
