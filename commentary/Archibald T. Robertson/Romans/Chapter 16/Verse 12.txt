<p><b> Tryphaena and Tryphosa </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τρυφαιναν κα Τρυφωσαν</span></span>). Probably sisters and possibly twins. Both names come from the same root, the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τρυφαω</span></span>, to live luxuriously (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:5">James 5:5</span>). Denney suggests "Dainty and Disdain."</p>
<p><b>Persis </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Περσιδα</span></span>). A freedwoman was so named. She is not Paul's "beloved," but the "beloved" of the whole church. </p>
