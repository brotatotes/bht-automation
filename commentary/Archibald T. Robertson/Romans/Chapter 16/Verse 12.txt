 Tryphaena and Tryphosa  (Τρυφαιναν κα Τρυφωσαν). Probably sisters and possibly twins. Both names come from the same root, the verb τρυφαω, to live luxuriously (James 5:5). Denney suggests "Dainty and Disdain."Persis  (Περσιδα). A freedwoman was so named. She is not Paul's "beloved," but the "beloved" of the whole church.
