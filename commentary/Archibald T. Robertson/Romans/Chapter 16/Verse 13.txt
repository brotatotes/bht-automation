<p><b> Rufus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ρουφον</span></span>). A very common slave name, possibly the Rufus of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:21">Mark 15:21</span>. The word means "red."</p>
<p><b>The chosen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον εκλεκτον</span></span>). Not "the elect," but "the select."</p>
<p><b>And mine </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα εμου</span></span>). Paul's appreciation of her maternal care once, not his real mother. </p>
