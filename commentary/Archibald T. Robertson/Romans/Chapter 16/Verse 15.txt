<p><b> Philologus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Φιλολογον</span></span>). Another common slave name.</p>
<p><b>Julia </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ιουλιαν</span></span>). The commonest name for female slaves in the imperial household because of Julius Caesar. Possibly these two were husband and wife.</p>
<p><b>Nereus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Νηρεα</span></span>). Found in inscriptions of the imperial household. But the sister's name is not given. One wonders why.</p>
<p><b>Olympas </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ολυμπαν</span></span>). Possibly an abbreviation for Olympiodorus.</p>
<p><b>All the saints that are with them </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τους συν αυτοις παντας αγιους</span></span>). Possibly another church in the house. These unnamed, the "and others," constitute the great majority in all our churches. </p>
