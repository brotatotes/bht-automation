<p><b> Worthily of the saints </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιως των αγιων</span></span>). Adverb with the genitive as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:27">Philippians 1:27</span> because the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αξιος</span></span> is used with the genitive (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:8">Luke 3:8</span>). "Receive her in a way worthy of the saints." This word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγιος</span></span> had come to be the accepted term for followers of Christ.</p>
<p><b>Assist her </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραστητε</span></span>). Second aorist (intransitive) active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παριστημ</span></span>, to stand by, with the dative case ("beside her"), the very word used by Paul of the help of Jesus in his trial (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεστη</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:17">2 Timothy 4:17</span>). Used with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσδεξησθε</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>In whatsoever matter </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ω πραγματ</span></span>). Incorporation of the antecedent (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πραγματ</span></span>) into the relative clause (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ω</span></span>).</p>
<p><b>She may have need of you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν υμων χρηιζη</span></span>). Indefinite relative clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αν</span></span> and the present subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χρηιζω</span></span> with genitive.</p>
<p><b>A succourer </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προστατις</span></span>). Old and rare feminine form for the masculine <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προστατης</span></span>, from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προιστημ</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προστατεω</span></span>, common, but not in the N.T.), here only in the N.T. and not in the papyri. The word illustrates her work as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διακονον</span></span> and is perhaps suggested here by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραστητε</span></span>, just before.</p>
<p><b>Of mine own self </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εμου αυτου</span></span>). "Of me myself." </p>
