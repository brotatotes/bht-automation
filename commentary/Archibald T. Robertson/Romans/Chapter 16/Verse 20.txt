<p><b> Shall bruise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συντριψε</span></span>). Future active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συντριβω</span></span>, old verb, to rub together, to crush, to trample underfoot. Blessed promise of final victory over Satan by "the God of peace." "Shortly" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν ταχε</span></span>). As God counts time. Meanwhile patient loyalty from us. </p>
