<p><b> Gaius my host </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Γαιος ο ξενος μου</span></span>). Perhaps the same Gaius of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span>), but whether the one of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:1">3 John 1:1</span> we do not know. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ξενος</span></span> was a guest friend, and then either a stranger (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:35">Matthew 25:35</span>) or a host of strangers as here. This Gaius was plainly a man of some means as he was the host of all the church. Erastus (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:20">2 Timothy 4:20</span>) was "the treasurer of the city" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο οικονομος της πολεως</span></span>), one of the outstanding men of Corinth, the "steward" (house-manager) or city manager. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42">Luke 12:42</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:1">Luke 16:1</span>. He is probably the administrator of the city's property.</p>
<p><b>Quartus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κουαρτος</span></span>). Latin name for fourth. </p>
