 Laid down their own necks  (τον εαυτων τραχελον υπεθηκαν). First aorist active of υποτιθημ, old verb to place under (the axe of the executioner), only here in N.T. in this sense, though in 1 Timothy 4:16 to suggest. If literal or figurative, the incident may be connected with the uproar created by Demetrius in Ephesus. Certainly Paul felt deep obligation toward them (see Acts 20:34).Not only I  (ουκ εγω μονος). Rather, "not I alone" (adjective μονος). The Gentile churches also (great mission workers).
