<p><b> Laid down their own necks </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον εαυτων τραχελον υπεθηκαν</span></span>). First aorist active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποτιθημ</span></span>, old verb to place under (the axe of the executioner), only here in N.T. in this sense, though in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:16">1 Timothy 4:16</span> to suggest. If literal or figurative, the incident may be connected with the uproar created by Demetrius in Ephesus. Certainly Paul felt deep obligation toward them (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:34">Acts 20:34</span>).</p>
<p><b>Not only I </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εγω μονος</span></span>). Rather, "not I alone" (adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μονος</span></span>). The Gentile churches also (great mission workers). </p>
