<p><b> Andronicus and Junias </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ανδρονιχου κα Ιουνιαν</span></span>). The first is a Greek name found even in the imperial household. The second name can be either masculine or feminine.</p>
<p><b>Kinsmen </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συγγενεις</span></span>). Probably only fellow-countrymen as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:13">Romans 9:13</span>.</p>
<p><b>Fellow-prisoners </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναιχμαλωτυς</span></span>). Late word and rare (in Lucian). One of Paul's frequent compounds with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συν</span></span>. Literally, fellow captives in war. Perhaps they had shared one of Paul's numerous imprisonments (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span>). In N.T. only here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:23">Philemon 1:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>.</p>
<p><b>Of note </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επισημο</span></span>). Stamped, marked (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ σημα</span></span>). Old word, only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:16">Matthew 27:16</span> (bad sense) in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Among the apostles </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τοις αποστολοις</span></span>). Naturally this means that they are counted among the apostles in the general sense true of Barnabas, James, the brother of Christ, Silas, and others. But it can mean simply that they were famous in the circle of the apostles in the technical sense.</p>
<p><b>Who have been in Christ before me </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο κα προ εμου γεγοναν εν Χριστω</span></span>). Andronicus and Junias were converted before Paul was. Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγοναν</span></span> (<i>Koine</i> form by analogy) instead of the usual second perfect active indicative form <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γεγονασιν</span></span>, which some MSS. have. The perfect tense notes that they are still in Christ. </p>
