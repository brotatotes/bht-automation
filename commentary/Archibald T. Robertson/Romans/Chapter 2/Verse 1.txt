<p><b> Wherefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διο</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:24">Romans 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:26">Romans 1:26</span> for this relative conjunction, "because of which thing."</p>
<p><b>Without excuse </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναπολογητος</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21">Romans 1:21</span>.</p>
<p><b>Whosoever thou art that judgest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πας ο κρινων</span></span>). Literally, "every one that judgest," vocative case in apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανθρωπε</span></span>. Paul begins his discussion of the failure of the Jew to attain to the God-kind of righteousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:1-3">Romans 2:1-3</span>) with a general statement applicable to all as he did (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18">Romans 1:18</span>) in the discussion of the failure of the Gentiles (Lightfoot). The Gentile is readily condemned by the Jew when he sins and equally so is the Jew condemned by the Gentile in like case. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κρινω</span></span> does not of itself mean to condemn, but to pick out, separate, approve, determine, pronounce judgment, condemn (if proper).</p>
<p><b>Another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον ετερον</span></span>). Literally, "the other man." The notion of two in the word, one criticizing the other.</p>
<p><b>Thou condemnest thyself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεαυτον κατακρινεις</span></span>). Note <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κρινω</span></span>, to make plain the adverse judgment.</p>
<p><b>For </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαρ</span></span>). Explanatory reason for the preceding statement. The critic</p>
<p><b>practises </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρασσεις</span></span>, not single acts <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιεω</span></span>, but the habit <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρασσω</span></span>) the same things that he condemns. </p>
