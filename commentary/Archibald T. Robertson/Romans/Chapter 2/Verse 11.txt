 Respect of persons  (προσωπολημψια). Milligan (Vocabulary) considers this word (in N.T. only here, Colossians 3:25; Ephesians 6:9) and προσωπολημπτης (Acts 10:34) and προσωπολημπτεω (James 2:9) the earliest definitely known Christian words, not in LXX or non-Christian writings. See on Acts 10:34 for the formation in imitation of the Hebrew to take note of the face (προσωπον, λαμβανω), to judge by the face or appearance.
