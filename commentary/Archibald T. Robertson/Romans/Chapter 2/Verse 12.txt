<p><b>Without law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανομως</span></span>). Old adverb "contrary to law," "unjustly," but here in ignorance of the Mosaic law (or of any law). Nowhere else in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Shall also perish without law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανομως κα απολουντα</span></span>). Future middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολλυμ</span></span>, to destroy. This is a very important statement.
