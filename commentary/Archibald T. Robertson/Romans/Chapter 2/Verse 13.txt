<p><b> Not the hearers--but the doers </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γαρ ο ακροαται--αλλ' ο ποιητα</span></span>). The law was read in the synagogue, but there was no actual virtue in listening. The virtue is in doing. See a like contrast by James between "hearers" and "doers" of the gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:22-25">James 1:22-25</span>).</p>
<p><b>Before God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρα τω θεω</span></span>). By God's side, as God looks at it.</p>
<p><b>Shall be justified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιωθησοντα</span></span>). Future passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοω</span></span>, to declare righteous, to set right. "Shall be declared righteous." Like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:22-25">James 1:22-25</span>. </p>
