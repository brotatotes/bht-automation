<p><b> That have no law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα μη νομον εχοντα</span></span>). Better, "that have not the law" (the Mosaic law).</p>
<p><b>By nature </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσε</span></span>). Instrumental case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυσις</span></span>, old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φυω</span></span>, to beget. The Gentiles are without the Mosaic law, but not without some knowledge of God in conscience and when they do right "they are a law to themselves" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαυτοις εισιν νομος</span></span>). This is an obvious reply to the Jewish critic. </p>
