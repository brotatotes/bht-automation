<p><b> Bearest the name </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επονομαζη</span></span>). Present passive indicative in condition of first class of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επονομαζω</span></span>, old word, to put a name upon (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>), only here in N.T. "Thou art surnamed Jew" (Lightfoot). Jew as opposed to Greek denoted nationality while Hebrew accented the idea of language.</p>
<p><b>Restest upon the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επαναπαυη νομω</span></span>). Late and rare double compound, in LXX and once in the Didache. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:6">Luke 10:6</span> which see. It means to lean upon, to refresh oneself back upon anything, here with locative case (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νομω</span></span>). It is the picture of blind and mechanical reliance on the Mosaic law.</p>
<p><b>Gloriest in God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχασα εν θεω</span></span>). <i>Koine</i> vernacular form for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχα</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχαεσαι, καυχασα</span></span>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχαομα</span></span> as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:23">Romans 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:7">1 Corinthians 4:7</span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακαυχασα</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:18">Romans 11:18</span>. The Jew gloried in God as a national asset and private prerogative (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:15">2 Corinthians 10:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:13">Galatians 6:13</span>).</p>
<p><b>Approvest the things that are excellent </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκιμαζεις τα διαφεροντα</span></span>). Originally, "Thou testest the things that differ," and then as a result comes the approval for the excellent things. As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:10">Philippians 1:10</span> it is difficult to tell which stage of the process Paul has in mind.</p>
<p><b>Instructed out of the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηχουμενος εκ του νομου</span></span>).

See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:4">Luke 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:19">1 Corinthians 14:19</span>. The Jew's "ethical discernment was the fruit of catechetical and synagogical instruction in the Old Testament" (Shedd). </p>
