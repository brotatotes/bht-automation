<p><b> A guide of the blind </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδηγον τυφλων</span></span>). Accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδηγον</span></span> in predicate with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα</span></span> to agree with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σεαυτον</span></span>, accusative of general reference with infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα</span></span> in indirect discourse after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πεποιθας</span></span>. Late word (Polybius, Plutarch) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οδος</span></span>, way, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηγεομα</span></span>, to lead, one who leads the way. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τυφλων</span></span> is objective genitive plural. The Jews were meant by God to be guides for the Gentiles, for salvation is of the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:22">John 4:22</span>).</p>
<p><b>A light </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φως</span></span>). "A light for those in darkness" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των εν σκοτε</span></span>, objective genitive again). But this intention of God about the Jews had resulted in conceited arrogance on their part. </p>
