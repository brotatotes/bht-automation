<p><b> A corrector of the foolish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδευτην αφρονων</span></span>). Old word (from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παιδευω</span></span>) for instructor, in Plato, and probably so here, though corrector or chastiser in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:9">Hebrews 12:9</span> (the only N.T. instances). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:16">Luke 23:16</span>. Late inscriptions give it as instructor (Preisigke). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αφρονων</span></span> is a hard word for Gentiles, but it is the Jewish standpoint that Paul gives. Each termed the other "dogs."</p>
<p><b>Of babes </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">νηπιων</span></span>). Novitiates or proselytes to Judaism just as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:1">Galatians 4:1</span>. Paul used it of those not of legal age.</p>
<p><b>The form </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την μορφωσιν</span></span>). Rare word only in Theophrastus and Paul (here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:5">2 Timothy 3:5</span>). Pallis regards it as a Stoical term for education. Lightfoot considers the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μορφωσις</span></span> as "the rough-sketch, the pencilling of the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μορφη</span></span>," the outline or framework, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:5">2 Timothy 3:5</span> "the outline without the substance." This is Paul's picture of the Jew as he sees himself drawn with consummate skill and subtle irony. </p>
