<p><b> Thou therefore that teachest another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ουν διδασκων ετερον</span></span>). Paul suddenly breaks off (anacoluthon) the long sentence that began in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:17">Romans 2:17</span> and starts over again with a phrase that gathers it all up in small compass (teachest) and drives it home (therefore) on the Jew (thyself).</p>
<p><b>Not to steal </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη κλεπτειν</span></span>). Infinitive with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> in indirect command (indirect discourse) after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερυσσων</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Dost thou steal? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κλεπτεισ?</span></span>). The preaching (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κερυσσων</span></span>) was fine, but the practice? A home-thrust.</p>
<p><b>Should not commit adultery </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη μοιχευειν</span></span>). Infinitive in direct command again after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγων</span></span>. "The Talmud charges the crime of adultery upon the three most illustrious Rabbins" (Vincent). </p>
