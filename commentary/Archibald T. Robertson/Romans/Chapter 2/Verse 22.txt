 That abhorrest  (ο βδελυσσομενος). Old word to make foul, to stink, to have abhorrence for. In LXX, in N.T. only here and Revelation 21:8. The very word used by Jesus to express their horror of idols (ειδωλα, see on Acts 7:41; 1 Corinthians 12:2). See Matthew 24:15 for "abomination."Dost thou rob temples?  (ιεροσυλεισ?). Old verb from ιεροσυλος (Acts 19:37) and that from ιερον, temple, and συλαω, to rob. The town clerk (Acts 19:37) said that these Jews (Paul and his companions) were "not robbers of temples," proof that the charge was sometimes made against Jews, though expressly forbidden the Jews (Josephus, Ant. IV. 8, 10). Paul refers to the crime of robbing idol temples in spite of the defilement of contact with idolatry.
