<p><b> That abhorrest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο βδελυσσομενος</span></span>). Old word to make foul, to stink, to have abhorrence for. In LXX, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+21:8">Revelation 21:8</span>. The very word used by Jesus to express their horror of idols (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειδωλα</span></span>, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:41">Acts 7:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:2">1 Corinthians 12:2</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:15">Matthew 24:15</span> for "abomination."</p>
<p><b>Dost thou rob temples? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιεροσυλεισ?</span></span>). Old verb from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιεροσυλος</span></span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:37">Acts 19:37</span>) and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιερον</span></span>, temple, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συλαω</span></span>, to rob. The town clerk (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:37">Acts 19:37</span>) said that these Jews (Paul and his companions) were "not robbers of temples," proof that the charge was sometimes made against Jews, though expressly forbidden the Jews (Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. IV. 8, 10). Paul refers to the crime of robbing idol temples in spite of the defilement of contact with idolatry. </p>
