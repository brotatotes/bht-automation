<p><b> Because of you </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' υμας</span></span>). Free quotation from the LXX of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:5">Isaiah 52:5</span>. The Jews were jealous for the Name of God and would not pronounce the Tetragrammaton and yet acted so that the Gentiles blasphemed that Name. </p>
