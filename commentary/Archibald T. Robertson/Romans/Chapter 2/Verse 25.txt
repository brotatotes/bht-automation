<p><b> If thou be a doer of the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εαν νομον πρασσεις</span></span>). Condition of third class and the present (continued action) subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρασσω</span></span>, a verb meaning to do as a habit.</p>
<p><b>Is become uncircumcision </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ακροβυστια γεγονεν</span></span>). The Jew is then like the Gentile, with no privilege at all. Circumcision was simply the seal of the covenant relation of Israel with God. </p>
