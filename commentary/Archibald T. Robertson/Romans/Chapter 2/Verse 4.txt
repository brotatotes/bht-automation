 Or despiseth thou?  (η καταφρονεισ?). Another alternative, that of scorn of God's kindness (χρηστοτητος, 2 Corinthians 6:6) and forbearance (ανοχης, old word, holding back from ανεχω, only here in N.T.) and longsuffering (μακροθυμιας, late word for which see 2 Corinthians 6:4; 2 Corinthians 6:6). Καταφρονεω is old verb to think down on (κατα, φρονεω) as in Matthew 6:24; 1 Corinthians 11:22. This upstart Jew actually thinks down on God. And then "the riches" (του πλουτου) of all that comes from God.Leadeth thee to repentance  (εις μετανοιαν σε αγε). The very kindness (το χρηστον, the kindly quality) of God is trying to lead (conative present αγε) thee to a right-about face, a change of mind and attitude (μετανοιαν) instead of a complacent self-satisfaction and pride of race and privilege.
