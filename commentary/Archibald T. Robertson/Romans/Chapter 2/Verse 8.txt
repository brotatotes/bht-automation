 But unto them that are factious and obey not the truth but obey unrighteousness  (τοις δε εξ εριθειας κα απειθουσιν τη αληθεια πειθομενοις δε αδικια). The other side with δε and the articular present participles in the dative again, only with εξ εριθειας, there is no participle ουσιν. But the construction changes and the substantives that follow are not the object of αποδωσε like ζωην αινωνιον above, but are in the nominative as if with εσοντα (shall be) understood (anger and wrath, both οργη and θυμος, tribulation and anguish, again a pair θλιψις κα στενοχωρια on which see 2 Corinthians 5:4; 2 Corinthians 12:10).
