<p><b> What advantage then hath the Jew? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ουν το περισσον του Ιουδαιου?</span></span>). Literally, "What then is the overplus of the Jew?" What does the Jew have over and above the Gentile? It is a pertinent question after the stinging indictment of the Jew in chapter 2.</p>
<p><b>The profit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η ωφελια</span></span>). The help. Old word, only here in N.T. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:36">Mark 8:36</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωφελε</span></span>, the verb to profit. </p>
