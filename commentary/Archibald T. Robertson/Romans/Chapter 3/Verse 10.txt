<p><b> As it is written </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθως γεγραπτα οτ</span></span>). Usual formula of quotation as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:4">Romans 3:4</span> with recitative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> added as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:8">Romans 3:8</span>. Paul here uses a catena or chain of quotations to prove his point in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:9">Romans 3:9</span> that Jews are in no better fix than the Greeks for all are under sin. Dr. J. Rendel Harris has shown that the Jews and early Christians had <i>Testimonia</i> (quotations from the Old Testament) strung together for certain purposes as proof-texts. Paul may have used one of them or he may have put these passages together himself. Verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:10-12">Romans 3:10-12</span> come from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:1-3">Psalms 14:1-3</span>; first half of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:13">Romans 3:13</span> as far as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδολιουσαν</span></span> from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+4:9">Psalms 4:9</span>, the second half from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+140:3">Psalms 140:3</span>; verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:14">Romans 3:14</span> from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+10:7">Psalms 10:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:15-17">Romans 3:15-17</span> from an abridgment of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:7">Isaiah 59:7</span>; verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:18">Romans 3:18</span> from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+35:1">Psalms 35:1</span>. Paul has given compounded quotations elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:16">2 Corinthians 6:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:25">Romans 9:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:27">Romans 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:26">Romans 11:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:34">Romans 11:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:19">Romans 12:19</span>). Curiously enough this compounded quotation was imported bodily into the text (LXX) of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:14">Romans 3:14</span> after verse 4 in Aleph B, etc.</p>
<p><b>There is none righteous, no, not one </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εστιν δικαιος ουδε εις</span></span>). "There is not a righteous man, not even one." This sentence is like a motto for all the rest, a summary for what follows. </p>
