<p><b> That every mouth may be stopped </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα παν στομα φραγη</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and second aorist passive subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φρασσω</span></span>, old verb to fence in, to block up. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:10">2 Corinthians 11:10</span>. Stopping mouths is a difficult business. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:11">Titus 1:11</span> where Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστομιζειν</span></span> (to stop up the mouth) for the same idea. Paul seems here to be speaking directly to Jews (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις εν τω νομω</span></span>), the hardest to convince. With the previous proof on that point he covers the whole ground for he made the case against the Gentiles in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18-32">Romans 1:18-32</span>.</p>
<p><b>May be brought under the judgement of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποδικος γενητα τω θεω</span></span>). "That all the world (Jew as well as Gentile) may become (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενητα</span></span>) answerable (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υποδικος</span></span>, old forensic word, here only in N.T.) to God (dative case <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω θεω</span></span>)." Every one is "liable to God," in God's court. </p>
