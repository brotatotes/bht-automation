<p><b> Much every way </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πολυ κατα παντα</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Πολυ</span></span> points back to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το περισσον</span></span>. So it means the overplus of the Jew is much from every angle.</p>
<p><b>First of all </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρωτον μεν</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:8">Romans 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:18">1 Corinthians 11:18</span> Paul does not add to his "first." He singles out one privilege of the many possessed by the Jew.</p>
<p><b>They were intrusted with </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευθησαν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστευω</span></span>, to intrust, with accusative of the thing and dative of the person in the active. In the passive as here the accusative of the thing is retained as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:4">1 Thessalonians 2:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>The oracles of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα λογια του θεου</span></span>). In the accusative case, therefore, the object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιστευθησαν</span></span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λογιον</span></span> is probably a diminutive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span>, word, though the adjective <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογιος</span></span> also occurs (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:24">Acts 18:24</span>). The word was early used for "oracles" from Delphi and is common in the LXX for the oracles of the Lord. But from Philo on it was used of any sacred writing including narrative. It occurs four times in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:38">Acts 7:38</span>, which see; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:2">Romans 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:11">1 Peter 4:11</span>). It is possible that here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:38">Acts 7:38</span> the idea may include all the Old Testament, though the commands and promises of God may be all. </p>
