<p><b> Even </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δε</span></span>). Not adversative here. It defines here.</p>
<p><b>Through faith in Jesus Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια πιστεως [Ιησου] Χριστου</span></span>). Intermediate agency (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) is faith and objective genitive, "in Jesus Christ," not subjective "of Jesus Christ," in spite of Haussleiter's contention for that idea. The objective nature of faith in Christ is shown in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:16">Galatians 2:16</span> by the addition <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις Χριστον Ιησουν επιστευσαμεν</span></span> (we believed in Christ), by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της εις Χριστον πιστεως υμων</span></span> (of your faith in Christ) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+2:5">Colossians 2:5</span>, by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πιστε τη εν Χριστω Ιησου</span></span> (in faith that in Christ Jesus) in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:13">1 Timothy 3:13</span>, as well as here by the added words "unto all them that believe" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις παντας τους πιστευοντας</span></span>) in Jesus, Paul means.</p>
<p><b>Distinction </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διαστολη</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:7">1 Corinthians 14:7</span> for the difference of sounds in musical instruments. Also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:12">Romans 10:12</span>. The Jew was first in privilege as in penalty (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:9">Romans 2:9</span>), but justification or setting right with God is offered to both on the same terms. </p>
