 Sinned  (ηρμαρτον). Constative second aorist active indicative of αμαρτανω as in Romans 5:12. This tense gathers up the whole race into one statement (a timeless aorist).And fall short  (κα υστερουντα). Present middle indicative of υστερεω, to be υστερος (comparative) too late, continued action, still fall short. It is followed by the ablative case as here, the case of separation.
