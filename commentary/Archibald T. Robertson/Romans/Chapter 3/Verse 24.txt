<p><b> Being justified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιουμενο</span></span>). Present passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοω</span></span>, to set right, repeated action in each case, each being set right.</p>
<p><b>Freely </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δωρεαν</span></span>). As in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:21">Galatians 2:21</span>.</p>
<p><b>By his grace </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη αυτου χαριτ</span></span>). Instrumental case of this wonderful word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χαρις</span></span> which so richly expresses Paul's idea of salvation as God's free gift.</p>
<p><b>Through the redemption </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια της απολυτρωσεως</span></span>). A releasing by ransom (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο, λυτρωσις</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυτροω</span></span> and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυτρον</span></span>, ransom). God did not set men right out of hand with nothing done about men's sins. We have the words of Jesus that he came to give his life a ransom (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λυτρον</span></span>) for many (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:45">Mark 10:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Λυτρον</span></span> is common in the papyri as the purchase-money in freeing slaves (Deissmann, <i>Light from the Ancient East</i>, pp. 327f.).</p>
<p><b>That is in Christ Jesus </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη εν Χριστω Ιησου</span></span>). There can be no mistake about this redemption. It is like <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>. </p>
