<p><b> Set forth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προεθετο</span></span>). Second aorist middle indicative. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:13">Romans 1:13</span> for this word. Also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:9">Ephesians 1:9</span>, but nowhere else in N.T. God set before himself (purposed) and did it publicly before (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προ</span></span>) the whole world.</p>
<p><b>A propitiation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλαστηριον</span></span>). The only other N.T. example of this word is in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:5">Hebrews 9:5</span> where we have the "cherubim overshadowing the mercy seat" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ιλαστηριον</span></span>). In Hebrews the adjective is used as a substantive or as "the propitiatory place " But that idea does not suit here. Deissmann (<i>Bible Studies</i>, pp. 124-35) has produced examples from inscriptions where it is used as an adjective and as meaning "a votive offering" or "propitiatory gift." Hence he concludes about <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>: "The crucified Christ is the votive gift of the Divine Love for the salvation of men." God gave his Son as the means of propitiation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Hιλαστηριον</span></span> is an adjective (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλαστηριος</span></span>) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλασκομα</span></span>, to make propitiation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>) and is kin in meaning to <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιλασμος</span></span>, propitiation (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:10">1 John 4:10</span>). There is no longer room for doubting its meaning in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>.</p>
<p><b>Through faith, by his blood </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια πιστεως εν τω αυτου αιματ</span></span>). So probably, connecting <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν το αιματ</span></span> (in his blood) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προεθετο</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>To show his righteousness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ενδειξιν της δικαιοσυνης αυτου</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:24">2 Corinthians 8:24</span>. "For showing of his righteousness," the God-kind of righteousness. God could not let sin go as if a mere slip. God demanded the atonement and provided it.</p>
<p><b>Because of the passing over </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια την παρεσιν</span></span>). Late word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παριημ</span></span>, to let go, to relax. In Dionysius Hal., Xenophon, papyri (Deissmann, <i>Bible Studies</i>, p. 266) for remission of punishment, especially for debt, as distinct from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αφεσις</span></span> (remission).</p>
<p><b>Done aforetime </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προγεγονοτων</span></span>). Second perfect active genitive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προγινομα</span></span>. The sins before the coming of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:16">Acts 14:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:30">Acts 17:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span>).</p>
<p><b>Forbearance </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανοχη</span></span>). Holding back of God as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span>. In this sense Christ tasted death for every man (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>). </p>
