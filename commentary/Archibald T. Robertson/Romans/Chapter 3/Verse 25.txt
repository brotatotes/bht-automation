 Set forth  (προεθετο). Second aorist middle indicative. See on Romans 1:13 for this word. Also in Ephesians 1:9, but nowhere else in N.T. God set before himself (purposed) and did it publicly before (προ) the whole world.A propitiation  (ιλαστηριον). The only other N.T. example of this word is in Hebrews 9:5 where we have the "cherubim overshadowing the mercy seat" (το ιλαστηριον). In Hebrews the adjective is used as a substantive or as "the propitiatory place " But that idea does not suit here. Deissmann (Bible Studies, pp. 124-35) has produced examples from inscriptions where it is used as an adjective and as meaning "a votive offering" or "propitiatory gift." Hence he concludes about Romans 3:25: "The crucified Christ is the votive gift of the Divine Love for the salvation of men." God gave his Son as the means of propitiation (1 John 2:2). Hιλαστηριον is an adjective (ιλαστηριος) from ιλασκομα, to make propitiation (Hebrews 2:17) and is kin in meaning to ιλασμος, propitiation (1 John 2:2; 1 John 4:10). There is no longer room for doubting its meaning in Romans 3:25.Through faith, by his blood  (δια πιστεως εν τω αυτου αιματ). So probably, connecting εν το αιματ (in his blood) with προεθετο.To show his righteousness  (εις ενδειξιν της δικαιοσυνης αυτου). See 2 Corinthians 8:24. "For showing of his righteousness," the God-kind of righteousness. God could not let sin go as if a mere slip. God demanded the atonement and provided it.Because of the passing over  (δια την παρεσιν). Late word from παριημ, to let go, to relax. In Dionysius Hal., Xenophon, papyri (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 266) for remission of punishment, especially for debt, as distinct from αφεσις (remission).Done aforetime  (προγεγονοτων). Second perfect active genitive participle of προγινομα. The sins before the coming of Christ (Acts 14:16; Acts 17:30; Hebrews 9:15).Forbearance  (ανοχη). Holding back of God as in Romans 2:4. In this sense Christ tasted death for every man (Hebrews 2:9).
