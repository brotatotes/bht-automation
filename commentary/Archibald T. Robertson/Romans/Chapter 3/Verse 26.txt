<p><b> For the shewing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς την ενδειξιν</span></span>). Repeats point of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ενδειξιν</span></span> of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> instead of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>At this present season </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω νυν καιρω</span></span>). "In the now crisis," in contrast with "done aforetime."</p>
<p><b>That he might himself be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το εινα αυτον</span></span>). Purpose with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις</span></span> to and the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα</span></span> and the accusative of general reference.</p>
<p><b>Just and the justifier of </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιον κα δικαιουντα</span></span>). "This is the key phrase which establishes the connexion between the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη θεου</span></span> and the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοσυνη εκ πιστεως</span></span>" (Sanday and Headlam). Nowhere has Paul put the problem of God more acutely or profoundly. To pronounce the unrighteous righteous is unjust by itself (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:5">Romans 4:5</span>). God's mercy would not allow him to leave man to his fate. God's justice demanded some punishment for sin. The only possible way to save some was the propitiatory offering of Christ and the call for faith on man's part. </p>
