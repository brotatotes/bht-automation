<p><b> For what if? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ γαρ ει?</span></span>). But Westcott and Hort print it, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Τ γαρ? ε</span></span>. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:18">Philippians 1:18</span> for this exclamatory use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ γαρ</span></span> (for how? How stands the case?).</p>
<p><b>Some were without faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηπιστησαν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απιστεω</span></span>, old verb, to disbelieve. This is the common N.T. meaning (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:11">Luke 24:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:41">Luke 24:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:24">Acts 28:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:20">Romans 4:20</span>). Some of them "disbelieved," these "depositaries and guardians of revelation" (Denney). But the word also means to be unfaithful to one's trust and Lightfoot argues for that idea here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:13">2 Timothy 2:13</span>. The Revised Version renders it "faithless" there. Either makes sense here and both ideas are true of some of the Jews, especially concerning the Messianic promises and Jesus.</p>
<p><b>The faithfulness of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την πιστιν του θεου</span></span>). Undoubtedly <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστις</span></span> has this sense here and not "faith." God has been faithful (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:13">2 Timothy 2:13</span>) whether the Jews (some of them) were simply disbelievers or untrue to their trust. Paul can use the words in two senses in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:3">Romans 3:3</span>, but there is no real objection to taking <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηπιστησαν, απιστιαν, πιστιν</span></span>, all to refer to faithfulness rather than just faith. </p>
