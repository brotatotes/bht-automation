<p><b> Nay, we establish the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα νομον ιστανομεν</span></span>). Present indicative active of late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστανω</span></span> from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>. This Paul hinted at in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:21">Romans 3:21</span>. How he will show in chapter 4 how Abraham himself is an example of faith and in his life illustrates the very point just made. Besides, apart from Christ and the help of the Holy Spirit no one can keep God's law. The Mosaic law is only workable by faith in Christ. </p>
