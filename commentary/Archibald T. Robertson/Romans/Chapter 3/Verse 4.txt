 Let God be found true  (γινεσθω ο θεος αληθης). "Let God continue to be true" (present middle imperative).But every man a liar  (πας δε ανθρωπος ψευστης). The contrast in δε really means, "though every man be found a liar." Cf. Psalms 116:12.As it is written  (καθως γεγραπτα). Psalms 51:6.That thou mightest be justified  (οπως αν δικαιωθηις). Hοπως rather than the common ινα for purpose and αν with the first aorist passive subjunctive of δικαιοω. Used of God this verb here has to mean "declared righteous," not "made righteous."Mightest prevail  (νικησεις). Future active indicative with οπως of νικαω, to win a victory, though B L have νικησηις (first aorist active subjunctive, the usual construction).When thou comest into judgement  (εν τω κρινεσθα σε). "In the being judged as to thee" (present passive infinitive or, if taken as middle, "in the entering upon trial as to thee"). Common construction in the LXX from the Hebrew infinitive construct.
