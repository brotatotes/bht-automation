<p><b> What shall we say? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ερουμεν?</span></span>). Rhetorical question, common with Paul as he surveys the argument.</p>
<p><b>Commendeth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιστησιν</span></span>). This common verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνιστημ</span></span>, to send together, occurs in the N.T. in two senses, either to introduce, to commend (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:1">2 Corinthians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:2">2 Corinthians 4:2</span>) or to prove, to establish (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:11">2 Corinthians 7:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:18">Galatians 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8">Romans 5:8</span>). Either makes good sense here.</p>
<p><b>Who visiteth the wrath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο επιφερων την οργην</span></span>). "Who brings on the wrath," "the inflicter of the anger" (Vaughan).</p>
<p><b>I speak as a man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα ανθρωπον</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:15">Galatians 3:15</span> for same phrase. As if to say, "pardon me for this line of argument." Tholuck says that the rabbis often used <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα ανθρωπον</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ερουμεν</span></span>. Paul had not forgotten his rabbinical training. </p>
