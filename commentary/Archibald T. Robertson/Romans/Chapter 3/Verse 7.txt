<p><b> Through my lie </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω εμω ψευσματ</span></span>). ] Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψευδομα</span></span>, to lie, only here in N.T. Paul returns to the imaginary objection in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:5">Romans 3:5</span>. The MSS. differ sharply here between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε δε</span></span> (but if) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε γαρ</span></span> (for if). Paul "uses the first person from motives of delicacy" (Sanday and Headlam) in this supposable case for argument's sake as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:6">1 Corinthians 4:6</span>. So here he "transfers by a fiction" (Field) to himself the objection. </p>
