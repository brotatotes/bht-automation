 And why not  (κα μη). We have a tangled sentence which can be cleared up in two ways. One is (Lightfoot) to supply γενητα after μη and repeat τ (κα τ μη γενητα, deliberative subjunctive in a question): And why should it not happen? The other way (Sanday and Headlam) is to take μη with ποιησωμεν and make a long parenthesis of all in between. Even so it is confusing because οτ also (recitative οτ) comes just before ποιησωμεν. The parenthesis is necessary anyhow, for there are two lines of thought, one the excuse brought forward by the unbeliever, the other the accusation that Paul affirms that very excuse that we may do evil that good may come. Note the double indirect assertion (the accusative and the infinitive ημας λεγειν after φασιν and then the direct quotation with recitative οτ after λεγειν, a direct quotation dependent on the infinitive in indirect quotation.Let us do evil that good may come  (ποιησωμεν τα κακα ινα ελθη τα αγαθα). The volitive aorist subjunctive (ποιησωμεν) and the clause of purpose (ινα and the aorist subjunctive ελθη). It sounds almost uncanny to find this maxim of the Jesuits attributed to Paul in the first century by Jews. It was undoubtedly the accusation of Antinomianism because Paul preached justification by faith and not by works.
