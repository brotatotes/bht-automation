<p><b> And why not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα μη</span></span>). We have a tangled sentence which can be cleared up in two ways. One is (Lightfoot) to supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενητα</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> and repeat <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα τ μη γενητα</span></span>, deliberative subjunctive in a question): And why should it not happen? The other way (Sanday and Headlam) is to take <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησωμεν</span></span> and make a long parenthesis of all in between. Even so it is confusing because <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> also (recitative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>) comes just before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησωμεν</span></span>. The parenthesis is necessary anyhow, for there are two lines of thought, one the excuse brought forward by the unbeliever, the other the accusation that Paul affirms that very excuse that we may do evil that good may come. Note the double indirect assertion (the accusative and the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ημας λεγειν</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φασιν</span></span> and then the direct quotation with recitative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λεγειν</span></span>, a direct quotation dependent on the infinitive in indirect quotation.</p>
<p><b>Let us do evil that good may come </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησωμεν τα κακα ινα ελθη τα αγαθα</span></span>). The volitive aorist subjunctive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιησωμεν</span></span>) and the clause of purpose (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> and the aorist subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελθη</span></span>). It sounds almost uncanny to find this maxim of the Jesuits attributed to Paul in the first century by Jews. It was undoubtedly the accusation of Antinomianism because Paul preached justification by faith and not by works. </p>
