<p><b> What then? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ουν?</span></span>). Paul's frequent query, to be taken with verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:1">Romans 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:2">Romans 3:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>Are we in worse case than they? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προεχομεθα?</span></span>). The American Revisers render it: "Are we in better case than they?" There is still no fresh light on this difficult and common word though it occurs alone in the N.T. In the active it means to have before, to excel. But here it is either middle or passive. Thayer takes it to be middle and to mean to excel to one's advantage and argues that the context demands this. But no example of the middle in this sense has been found. If it is taken as passive, Lightfoot takes it to mean, "Are we excelled" and finds that sense in Plutarch. Vaughan takes it as passive but meaning, "Are we preferred?" This suits the context, but no other example has been found. So the point remains unsettled. The papyri throw no light on it.</p>
<p><b>No, in no wise </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου παντως</span></span>). "Not at all." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:10">1 Corinthians 5:10</span>.</p>
<p><b>We before laid to the charge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προηιτιασαμεθα</span></span>). First aorist middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προαιτιαομα</span></span>, to make a prior accusation, a word not yet found anywhere else. Paul refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18-32">Romans 1:18-32</span> for the Greeks and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:1-29">Romans 2:1-29</span> for the Jews. The infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα</span></span> with the accusative <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντας</span></span> is in indirect discourse.</p>
<p><b>Under sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπο αμαρτιαν</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:22">Galatians 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:14">Romans 7:14</span>. </p>
