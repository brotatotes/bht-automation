<p><b> The sign of circumcision </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σημειον περιτομης</span></span>). It is the genitive of apposition, circumcision being the sign.</p>
<p><b>A seal of the righteousness of the faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σφραγιδα της δικαιοσυνης της πιστεως</span></span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Σφραγις</span></span> is old word for the seal placed on books (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+5:1">Revelation 5:1</span>), for a signet-ring (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+7:2">Revelation 7:2</span>), the stamp made by the seal (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:19">2 Timothy 2:19</span>), that by which anything is confirmed (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:2">1 Corinthians 9:2</span>) as here. The circumcision did not convey the righteousness, but only gave outward confirmation. It came by faith and "the faith which he had while in uncircumcision" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της εν τη ακροβυστια</span></span>), "the in the state of uncircumcision faith." Whatever parallel exists between baptism and circumcision as here stated by Paul argues for faith before baptism and for baptism as the sign and seal of the faith already had before baptism.</p>
<p><b>That he might be </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το εινα αυτον</span></span>). This idiom may be God's purpose (contemplated result) as in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το λογισθηνα</span></span> below, or even actual result (so that he was) as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:20">Romans 1:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>Though they be in uncircumcision </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δι' ακροβυστιας</span></span>). Simply, "of those who believe while in the condition of uncircumcision." </p>
