<p><b> The father of circumcision </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πατερα περιτομης</span></span>). The accusative with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το εινα</span></span> to be repeated from verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:11">Romans 4:11</span>. Lightfoot takes it to mean, not "a father of a circumcised progeny," but "a father belonging to circumcision," a less natural interpretation.</p>
<p><b>But who also walk </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα κα τοις στοιχουσιν</span></span>). The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις</span></span> here is hard to explain, for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου μονον</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα κα</span></span> both come after the preceding <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις</span></span>. All the MSS. have it thus. A primitive error in a copyist is suggested by Hort who would omit the second <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις</span></span>. Lightfoot regards it less seriously and would repeat the second <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις</span></span> in the English: "To those who are, I do not say of circumcision only, but also to those who walk."</p>
<p><b>In the steps </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις ιχνεσιν</span></span>). Locative case. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:18">2 Corinthians 12:18</span>. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Στοιχεω</span></span> is military term, to walk in file as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:25">Galatians 5:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:16">Philippians 3:16</span>. </p>
