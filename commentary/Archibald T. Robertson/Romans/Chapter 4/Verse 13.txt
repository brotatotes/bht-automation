<p><b> That he should be the heir of the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το κληρονομον αυτον εινα κοσμου</span></span>). The articular infinitive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το εινα</span></span>) with the accusative of general reference in loose apposition with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η επαγγελια</span></span> (the promise). But where is that promise? Not just <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:7">Genesis 12:7</span>, but the whole chain of promises about his son, his descendants like the stars in heaven, the Messiah and the blessing to the world through him. In these verses (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:13-17">Romans 4:13-17</span>) Paul employs (Sanday and Headlam) the keywords of his gospel (faith, promise, grace) and arrays them against the current Jewish theology (law, works, merit). </p>
