 Of faith  (εκ πιστεως). As the source.According to grace  (κατα χαριν). As the pattern.To the end that  (εις το εινα). Purpose again as in Romans 4:11.Sure  (βεβαιαν). Stable, fast, firm. Old adjective from βαινω, to walk.Not to that only which is of the law  (ου τω εκ του νομου μονον). Another instance where μονον (see verse Romans 4:12) seems in the wrong place. Normally the order would be, ου μονον τω εκ του νομου, αλλα κα κτλ.
