<p><b> For our justification </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια την δικαιωσιν ημων</span></span>). The first clause (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεδοθη δια τα παραπτωματα</span></span>) is from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:12">Isaiah 53:12</span>. The first <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παραπτωματα</span></span> is probably retrospective, though it will make sense as prospective (to make atonement for our transgressions). The second <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> is quite clearly prospective with a view to our justification. Paul does not mean to separate the resurrection from the death of Christ in the work of atonement, but simply to show that the resurrection is at one with the death on the Cross in proof of Christ's claims. </p>
