<p><b> That justifieth the ungodly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον δικαιουντα τον ασεβη</span></span>). The impious, irreverent man. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:25">Romans 1:25</span>. A forensic figure (Shedd). The man is taken as he is and pardoned. "The whole Pauline gospel could be summed up in this one word-- God who justifies the ungodly" (Denney). </p>
