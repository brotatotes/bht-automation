<p><b> Being therefore justified by faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιωθεντες ουν εκ πιστεως</span></span>). First aorist passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιοω</span></span>, to set right and expressing antecedent action to the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχωμεν</span></span>. The <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν</span></span> refers to the preceding conclusive argument (chapters 1 to 4) that this is done by faith.</p>
<p><b>Let us have peace with God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρηνην εχωμεν προς τον θεον</span></span>). This is the correct text beyond a doubt, the present active subjunctive, not <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχομεν</span></span> (present active indicative) of the Textus Receptus which even the American Standard Bible accepts. It is curious how perverse many real scholars have been on this word and phrase here. Godet, for instance. Vincent says that "it is difficult if not impossible to explain it." One has only to observe the force of the <i>tense</i> to see Paul's meaning clearly. The mode is the volitive subjunctive and the present tense expresses linear action and so does not mean "make peace" as the ingressive aorist subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρηνην σχωμεν</span></span> would mean. A good example of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχωμεν</span></span> occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:38">Matthew 21:38</span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σχωμεν την κληρονομιαν αυτου</span></span>) where it means: "Let us get hold of his inheritance." Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειρηνην εχωμεν</span></span> can only mean: "Let us enjoy peace with God" or "Let us retain peace with God." We have in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:31">Acts 9:31</span> <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειχεν ειρηνην</span></span> (imperfect and so linear), the church "enjoyed peace," not "made peace." The preceding justification (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δικαιωθεντες</span></span>) "made peace with God." Observe <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς</span></span> (face to face) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον θεον</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span> (intermediate agent) with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του κυριου</span></span>. </p>
