Paul does not conceive it as his or our task to reconcile God to us. God has attended to that himself (Romans 3:25). We become reconciled to God by means of the death of God's Son. "Much more" again we shall be saved "by his life" (εν τη ζωη αυτου). "In his life," for he does live, "ever living to intercede for them" (Hebrews 7:25).
