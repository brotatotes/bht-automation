<p><b> Therefore </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια τουτο</span></span>). "For this reason." What reason? Probably the argument made in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1-11">Romans 5:1-11</span>, assuming our justification and urging exultant joy in Christ because of the present reconciliation by Christ's death and the certainty of future final salvation by his life.</p>
<p><b>As through one man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ωσπερ δι' ενος ανθρωπου</span></span>). Paul begins a comparison between the effects of Adam's sin and the effects of the redemptive work of Christ, but he does not give the second member of the comparison. Instead of that he discusses some problems about sin and death and starts over again in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>. The general point is plain that the effects of Adam's sin are transmitted to his descendants, though he does not say how it was done whether by the natural or the federal headship of Adam. It is important to note that Paul does not say that the whole race receives the full benefit of Christ's atoning death, but only those who do. Christ is the head of all believers as Adam is the head of the race. In this sense Adam "is a figure of him that was to come."</p>
<p><b>Sin entered into the world </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αμαρτια εις τον κοσμον εισηλθεν</span></span>). Personification of sin and represented as coming from the outside into the world of humanity. Paul does not discuss the origin of evil beyond this fact. There are some today who deny the fact of sin at all and who call it merely "an error of mortal mind" (a notion) while others regard it as merely an animal inheritance devoid of ethical quality.</p>
<p><b>And so death passed unto all men </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ουτως εις παντας ανθρωπους διηλθεν</span></span>). Note use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διερχομα</span></span> rather than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισερχομα</span></span>, just before, second aorist active indicative in both instances. By "death" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:17">Genesis 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:19">Genesis 3:19</span> physical death is meant, but in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:21">Romans 5:21</span> eternal death is Paul's idea and that lurks constantly behind physical death with Paul.</p>
<p><b>For that all sinned </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφ' ω παντες ημαρτον</span></span>). Constative (summary) aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτανω</span></span>, gathering up in this one tense the history of the race (committed sin). The transmission from Adam became facts of experience. In the old Greek <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εφ' ω</span></span> usually meant "on condition that," but "because" in N.T. (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 963). </p>
