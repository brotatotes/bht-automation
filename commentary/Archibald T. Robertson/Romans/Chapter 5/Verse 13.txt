 Until the law  (αχρ νομου). Until the Mosaic law. Sin was there before the Mosaic law, for the Jews were like Gentiles who had the law of reason and conscience (Romans 2:12-16), but the coming of the law increased their responsibility and their guilt (Romans 2:9).Sin is not imputed  (αμαρτια δε ουκ ελλογειτα). Present passive indicative of late verb ελλογαω (-εω) from εν and λογος, to put down in the ledger to one's account, examples in inscription and papyri.When there is no law  (μη οντος νομου). Genitive absolute, no law of any kind, he means. There was law before the Mosaic law. But what about infants and idiots in case of death? Do they have responsibility? Surely not. The sinful nature which they inherit is met by Christ's atoning death and grace. No longer do men speak of "elect infants."
