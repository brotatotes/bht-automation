<p><b> Until the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αχρ νομου</span></span>). Until the Mosaic law. Sin was there before the Mosaic law, for the Jews were like Gentiles who had the law of reason and conscience (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:12-16">Romans 2:12-16</span>), but the coming of the law increased their responsibility and their guilt (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:9">Romans 2:9</span>).</p>
<p><b>Sin is not imputed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτια δε ουκ ελλογειτα</span></span>). Present passive indicative of late verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελλογαω</span></span> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">-εω</span></span>) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογος</span></span>, to put down in the ledger to one's account, examples in inscription and papyri.</p>
<p><b>When there is no law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη οντος νομου</span></span>). Genitive absolute, no law of any kind, he means. There was law <i>before</i> the Mosaic law. But what about infants and idiots in case of death? Do they have responsibility? Surely not. The sinful nature which they inherit is met by Christ's atoning death and grace. No longer do men speak of "elect infants." </p>
