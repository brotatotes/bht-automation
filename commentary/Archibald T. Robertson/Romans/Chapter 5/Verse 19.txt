<p>Here again we have "the one" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του ενος</span></span>) with both Adam and Christ, but "disobedience" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρακοης</span></span>, for which see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:6">2 Corinthians 10:6</span>) contrasted with "obedience" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπακοης</span></span>), the same verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθιστημ</span></span>, old verb, to set down, to render, to constitute (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατεσταθησαν</span></span>, first aorist passive indicative, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατασταθησοντα</span></span>, future passive), and "the many" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο πολλο</span></span>) in both cases (but with different meaning as with "all men" above). </p>
