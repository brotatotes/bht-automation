<p><b> We have had </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εσχηκαμεν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχω</span></span> (same verb as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχωμεν</span></span>), still have it.</p>
<p><b>Our access </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεν προσαγωγην</span></span>). Old word from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσαγω</span></span>, to bring to, to introduce. Hence "introduction," "approach." Elsewhere in N.T. only <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:18">Ephesians 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:12">Ephesians 3:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>Wherein we stand </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν η εστηκαμεν</span></span>). Perfect active (intransitive) indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιστημ</span></span>. Grace is here present as a field into which we have been introduced and where we stand and we should enjoy all the privileges of this grace about us.</p>
<p><b>Let us rejoice </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καυχωμεθα</span></span>). "Let us exult." Present middle subjunctive (volitive) because <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εχωμεν</span></span> is accepted as correct. The exhortation is that we keep on enjoying peace with God and keep on exulting in hope of the glory of God. </p>
