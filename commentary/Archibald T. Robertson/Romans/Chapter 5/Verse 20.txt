<p><b> Came in beside </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεισηλθεν</span></span>). Second aorist active indicative of double compound <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παρεισερχομα</span></span>, late verb, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:4">Galatians 2:4</span> which see. See also <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εισηλθεν</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span>. The Mosaic law came into this state of things, in between Adam and Christ.</p>
<p><b>That the trespass might abound </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα πλεοναση το παραπτωμα</span></span>). It is usual to explain <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> here as final, as God's ultimate purpose. So Denney who refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span>. But Chrysostom explains <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> here as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκβασις</span></span> (result). This is a proper use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> in the <i>Koine</i> as we have seen. If we take it so here, the meaning is "so that the trespass abounded" (aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεονασω</span></span>, late verb, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:3">2 Thessalonians 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:15">2 Corinthians 8:15</span>). This was the actual effect of the Mosaic law for the Jews, the necessary result of all prohibitions.</p>
<p><b>Did abound more exceedingly </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερεπερισσευσεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερπερισσευω</span></span>. Late verb, in N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:4">2 Corinthians 7:4</span> which see. A strong word. If <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεοναζω</span></span> is comparative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλεον</span></span>) <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περισσευω</span></span> is superlative (Lightfoot) and then <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερπερισσευω</span></span> goes the superlative one better. See <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερπλεοναζω</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:14">1 Timothy 1:14</span>. The flood of grace surpassed the flood of sin, great as that was (and is). </p>
