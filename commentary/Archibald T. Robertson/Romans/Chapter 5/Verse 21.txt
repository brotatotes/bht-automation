<p><b> That--even so grace might reign </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα--ουτος κα η χαρις βασιλευση</span></span>). Final <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span> here, the purpose of God and the goal for us through Christ. Lightfoot notes the force of the aorist indicative (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβασιλευσεν</span></span>, established its throne) and the aorist subjunctive (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βασιλευση</span></span>, might establish its throne), the ingressive aorist both times. "This full rhetorical close has almost the value of a doxology" (Denney). </p>
