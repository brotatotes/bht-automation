 But let us also rejoice in our tribulations  (αλλα κα καυχωμεθα εν ταις θλιψεσιν). Present middle subjunctive of same verb as in verse Romans 5:2. Καυχωμα is more than "rejoice," rather "glory," "exult." These three volitive subjunctives (εχωμεν, καυχωμεθα, twice) hold up the high ideal for the Christian after, and because of, his being set right with God. It is one thing to submit to or endure tribulations without complaint, but it is another to find ground of glorying in the midst of them as Paul exhorts here.
