 What shall we say then?  (τ ουν ερουμεν?). "A debater's phrase" (Morison). Yes, and an echo of the rabbinical method of question and answer, but also an expression of exultant victory of grace versus sin. But Paul sees the possible perversion of this glorious grace.Shall we continue in sin?  (επιμενωμεν τη αμαρτιαι?). Present active deliberative subjunctive of επιμενω, old verb to tarry as in Ephesus (1 Corinthians 16:8) with locative case. The practice of sin as a habit (present tense) is here raised.That grace may abound  (ινα η χαρις πτεοναση). Final clause with ingressive aorist subjunctive, to set free the superfluity of grace alluded to like putting money in circulation. Horrible thought (μη γενοιτο) and yet Paul faced it. There are occasionally so-called pietists who actually think that God's pardon gives them liberty to sin without penalty (cf. the sale of indulgences that stirred Martin Luther).
