<p><b> Reckon ye also yourselves </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υμεις λογιζεσθε</span></span>). Direct middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λογιζομα</span></span> and complete proof that Paul does not mean that baptism makes one dead to sin and alive to God. That is a spiritual operation "in Christ Jesus" and only pictured by baptism. This is a plea to live up to the ideal of the baptized life. </p>
