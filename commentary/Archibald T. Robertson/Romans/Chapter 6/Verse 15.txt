<p><b> What then? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ ουν?</span></span>). Another turn in the argument about the excess of grace.</p>
<p><b>Shall we sin? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτεσωμεν?</span></span>). First aorist active deliberative subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αμαρτανω</span></span>. "Shall we commit sin" (occasional acts of sin as opposed to the life of sin as raised by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιμενωμεν τη αμαρτια</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1">Romans 6:1</span>)?</p>
<p><b>Because </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οτ</span></span>). The same reason as in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1">Romans 6:1</span> and taken up from the very words in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:14">Romans 6:14</span>. Surely, the objector says, we may take a night off now and then and sin a little bit "since we are under grace." </p>
