<p><b> Whereas ye were </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ητε</span></span>). Imperfect but no "whereas" in the Greek. Paul is not grateful that they were once slaves of sin, but only that, though they once were, they turned from that state.</p>
<p><b>To that form of doctrine whereunto ye were delivered </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις ον παρεδοθητε τυπον διδαχης</span></span>). Incorporation of the antecedent (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπον διδαχης</span></span>) into the relative clause: "to which form of doctrine ye were delivered." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:14">Romans 5:14</span> for <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τυπον</span></span>. It is hardly proper to take "form" here to refer to Paul's gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:16">Romans 2:16</span>), possibly an allusion to the symbolism of baptism which was the outward sign of the separation. </p>
