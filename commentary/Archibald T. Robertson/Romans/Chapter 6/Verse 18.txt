<p><b> Ye became servants of righteousness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδουλωθητε τη δικαιοσυνη</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλοω</span></span>, to enslave. "Ye were made slaves to righteousness." You have simply changed masters, no longer slaves of sin (set free from that tyrant), but ye are slaves of righteousness. There is no middle ground, no "no man's land" in this war. </p>
