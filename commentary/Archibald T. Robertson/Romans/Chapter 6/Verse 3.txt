<p><b> Were baptized into Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εβαπτισθημεν εις Χριστον</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">βαπτιζω</span></span>. Better, "were baptized unto Christ or in Christ." The translation "into" makes Paul say that the union with Christ was brought to pass by means of baptism, which is not his idea, for Paul was not a sacramentarian. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Εις</span></span> is at bottom the same word as <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν</span></span>. Baptism is the public proclamation of one's inward spiritual relation to Christ attained before the baptism. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:27">Galatians 3:27</span> where it is like putting on an outward garment or uniform.</p>
<p><b>Into his death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις τον θανατον αυτου</span></span>). So here "unto his death," "in relation to his death," which relation Paul proceeds to explain by the symbolism of the ordinance. </p>
