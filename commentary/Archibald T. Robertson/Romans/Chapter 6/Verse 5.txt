<p><b> For if we have become united with him by the likeness of his death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε γαρ συμφυτο γεγοναμεν τω ομοιωματ του θανατου αυτου</span></span>). Condition of the first class, assumed to be true. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Συμφυτο</span></span> is old verbal adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συμφυω</span></span>, to grow together. Baptism as a picture of death and burial symbolizes our likeness to Christ in his death.</p>
<p><b>We shall be also united in the likeness of his resurrection </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα κα της αναστασεως εσομεθα</span></span>). The conclusion to the previous condition introduced by <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα κα</span></span> as often and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το ομοιωματ</span></span> (in the likeness) must be understood before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της αναστασεως</span></span> (of his resurrection). Baptism is a picture of the past and of the present and a prophecy of the future, the matchless preacher of the new life in Christ. </p>
