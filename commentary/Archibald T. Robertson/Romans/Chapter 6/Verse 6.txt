<p><b> Our old man </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο παλαιος ημων ανθρωπος</span></span>). Only in Paul (here, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:9">Colossians 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span>).</p>
<p><b>Was crucified with him </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεσταυρωθη</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:19">Galatians 2:19</span> for this boldly picturesque word. This took place not at baptism, but only pictured there. It took place when "we died to sin" (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1">Romans 6:1</span>).</p>
<p><b>The body of sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το σωμα της αμαρτιας</span></span>). "The body of which sin has taken possession" (Sanday and Headlam), the body marked by sin.</p>
<p><b>That so we should no longer be in bondage to sin </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του μηκετ δουλευειν ημας τη αμαρτια</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">του</span></span> and the present active infinitive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δουλευω</span></span>, continue serving sin (as slaves). Adds "slavery" to living in sin (verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:2">Romans 6:2</span>). </p>
