 Our old man  (ο παλαιος ημων ανθρωπος). Only in Paul (here, Colossians 3:9; Ephesians 4:22).Was crucified with him  (συνεσταυρωθη). See on Galatians 2:19 for this boldly picturesque word. This took place not at baptism, but only pictured there. It took place when "we died to sin" (verse Romans 6:1).The body of sin  (το σωμα της αμαρτιας). "The body of which sin has taken possession" (Sanday and Headlam), the body marked by sin.That so we should no longer be in bondage to sin  (του μηκετ δουλευειν ημας τη αμαρτια). Purpose clause with του and the present active infinitive of δουλευω, continue serving sin (as slaves). Adds "slavery" to living in sin (verse Romans 6:2).
