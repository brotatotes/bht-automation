<p><b> This I found unto death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρεθη μοι--αυτη εις θανατον</span></span>). Literally, "the commandment the one for (meant for) life, this was found for me unto death." First aorist (effective) passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευρισκω</span></span>, to find, not active as the English has it. It turned out so for me (ethical dative). </p>
