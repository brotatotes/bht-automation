<p><b> I know not </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γινωσκω</span></span>). "I do not recognize" in its true nature. My spiritual perceptions are dulled, blinded by sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>). The dual life pictured here by Paul finds an echo in us all, the struggle after the highest in us ("what I really wish," <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θελω</span></span>, to practise it steadily, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρασσω</span></span>) and the slipping into doing (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ποιω</span></span>) "what I really hate" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο μισω</span></span>) and yet sometimes do. There is a deal of controversy as to whether Paul is describing his struggle with sin before conversion or after it. The words "sold under sin" in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:14">Romans 7:14</span> seem to turn the scale for the pre-conversion period. "It is the unregenerate man's experience, surviving at least in memory into regenerate days, and read with regenerate eyes" (Denney). </p>
