 So now  (νυν δε). A logical contrast, "as the case really stands."But sin that dwelleth in me  (αλλ' η ενοικουσα εν εμο αμαρτια). "But the dwelling in me sin." Not my true self, my higher personality, but my lower self due to my slavery to indwelling sin. Paul does not mean to say that his whole self has no moral responsibility by using this paradox. "To be saved from sin, a man must at the same time own it and disown it" (Denney).
