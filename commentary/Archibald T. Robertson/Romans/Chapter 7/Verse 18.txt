 In me  (εν εμο). Paul explains this by "in my flesh" (εν τη σαρκ μου), the unregenerate man "sold under sin" of verse Romans 7:14.No good thing  (ουκ--αγαθον). "Not absolutely good." This is not a complete view of man even in his unregenerate state as Paul at once shows.For to will is present with me  (το γαρ θελειν παρακειτα μο). Present middle indicative of παρακειμα, old verb, to lie beside, at hand, with dative μο. Only here in N.T.The wishing  is the better self,the doing not  the lower self.
