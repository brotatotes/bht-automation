<p><b> O wretched man that I am </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ταλαιπωρος εγω ανθρωπος</span></span>). "Wretched man I." Old adjective from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τλαω</span></span>, to bear, and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πωρος</span></span>, a callus. In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="re+3:17">Revelation 3:17</span>. "A heart-rending cry from the depths of despair" (Sanday and Headlam).</p>
<p><b>Out of the body of this death </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκ του σωματος του θανατου τουτου</span></span>). So the order of words demands. See verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:13">Romans 7:13</span> for "death" which finds a lodgment in the body (Lightfoot). If one feels that Paul has exaggerated his own condition, he has only to recall <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span> when he describes himself a chief of sinners. He dealt too honestly with himself for Pharisaic complacency to live long. </p>
