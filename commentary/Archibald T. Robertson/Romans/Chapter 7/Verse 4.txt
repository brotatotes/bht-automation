<p><b> Ye also were made to the law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα υμεις εθανατωθητε</span></span>). First aorist indicative passive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θανατοω</span></span>, old verb, to put to death (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:21">Matthew 10:21</span>) or to make to die (extinct) as here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:13">Romans 8:13</span>. The analogy calls for the death of the law, but Paul refuses to say that. He changes the structure and makes them dead to the law as the husband (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:3-6">Romans 6:3-6</span>). The relation of marriage is killed "through the body of Christ" as the "propitiation" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>) for us. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+1:22">Colossians 1:22</span>.</p>
<p><b>That we should be joined to another </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το γενεσθα ετερω</span></span>). Purpose clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις το</span></span> and the infinitive. First mention of the saints as wedded to Christ as their Husband occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:13">1 Corinthians 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:26">Galatians 4:26</span>. See further <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:22-33">Ephesians 5:22-33</span>.</p>
<p><b>That we might bring forth fruit unto God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα καρποφορησωμεν τω θεω</span></span>). He changes the metaphor to that of the tree used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:22">Romans 6:22</span>. </p>
