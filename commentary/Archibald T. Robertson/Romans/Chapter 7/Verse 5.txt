 In the flesh  (εν τη σαρκ). Same sense as in Romans 6:19 and Romans 7:18; Romans 7:25. The "flesh" is not inherently sinful, but is subject to sin. It is what Paul means by being "under the law." He uses σαρξ in a good many senses.Sinful passions  (τα παθηματα των αμαρτιων). "Passions of sins" or marked by sins.Wrought  (ενεργειτο). Imperfect middle of ενεργεω, "were active."To bring forth fruit unto death  (εις το καρποφορησα τω θανατω). Purpose clause again. Vivid picture of the seeds of sin working for death.
