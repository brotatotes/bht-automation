 But now  (νυν δε). In the new condition.Wherein we were holden  (εν ω κατειχομεθα). Imperfect passive of κατεχω, picture of our former state (same verb in Romans 1:18).In newness of spirit  (εν καινοτητ πνευματος). The death to the letter of the law (the old husband) has set us free to the new life in Christ. So Paul has shown again the obligation on us to live for Christ.
