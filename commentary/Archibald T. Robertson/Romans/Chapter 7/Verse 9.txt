<p><b> I was alive </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εζων</span></span>). Imperfect active. Apparently, "the lost paradise in the infancy of men" (Denney), before the conscience awoke and moral responsibility came, "a seeming life" (Shedd).</p>
<p><b>Sin revived </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αμαρτια ανεζησεν</span></span>). Sin came back to life, waked up, the blissful innocent stage was over, "the commandment having come" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελθουσης της εντολης</span></span>, genitive absolute).</p>
<p><b>But I died </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εγω δε απεθανον</span></span>). My seeming life was over for I was conscious of sin, of violation of law. I was dead before, but I did not know. Now I found out that I was spiritually dead. </p>
