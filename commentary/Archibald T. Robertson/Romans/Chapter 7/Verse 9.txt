 I was alive  (εζων). Imperfect active. Apparently, "the lost paradise in the infancy of men" (Denney), before the conscience awoke and moral responsibility came, "a seeming life" (Shedd).Sin revived  (η αμαρτια ανεζησεν). Sin came back to life, waked up, the blissful innocent stage was over, "the commandment having come" (ελθουσης της εντολης, genitive absolute).But I died  (εγω δε απεθανον). My seeming life was over for I was conscious of sin, of violation of law. I was dead before, but I did not know. Now I found out that I was spiritually dead.
