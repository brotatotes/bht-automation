<p><b> Therefore now </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αρα νυν</span></span>). Two particles. Points back to the triumphant note in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:25">Romans 7:25</span> after the preceding despair.</p>
<p><b>No condemnation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουδεν κατακριμα</span></span>). As sinners we deserved condemnation in our unregenerate state in spite of the struggle. But God offers pardon "to those in Christ Jesus (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τοις εν Χριστω Ιησου</span></span>). This is Paul's Gospel. The fire has burned on and around the Cross of Christ. There and there alone is safety. Those in Christ Jesus can lead the consecrated, the crucified, the baptized life. </p>
