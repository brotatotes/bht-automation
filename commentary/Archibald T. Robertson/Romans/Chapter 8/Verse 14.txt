<p><b> Sons of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιο θεου</span></span>). In the full sense of this term. In verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:16">Romans 8:16</span> we have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνα θεου</span></span> (children of God). Hence no great distinction can be drawn between <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνον</span></span>. The truth is that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιος</span></span> is used in various ways in the New Testament. In the highest sense, not true of any one else, Jesus Christ is God's Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>). But in the widest sense all men are "the offspring" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γενος</span></span>) of God as shown in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:28">Acts 17:28</span> by Paul. But in the special sense here only those are "sons of God" who are led by the Spirit of God, those born again (the second birth) both Jews and Gentiles, "the sons of Abraham" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υιο Αβρααμ</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7">Galatians 3:7</span>), the children of faith. </p>
