 The earnest expectation of creation  (η αποκαραδοκια της κτισεως). This substantive has so far been found nowhere save here and Philippians 1:20, though the verb αποκαραδοκεω is common in Polybius and Plutarch. Milligan (Vocabulary) thinks that Paul may have made the substantive from the verb. It is a double compound (απο, off from, καρα, head, δοκεω, Ionic verb, to watch), hence to watch eagerly with outstretched head.Waiteth for  (απεκδεχετα). See on 1 Corinthians 1:7; Galatians 5:5 for this rare word (possibly formed by Paul, Milligan). "To wait it out" (Thayer).The revealing of the sons of God  (την αποκαλυψιν των υιων του θεου). Cf. 1 John 3:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:8; Colossians 3:4. This mystical sympathy of physical nature with the work of grace is beyond the comprehension of most of us. But who can disprove it?
