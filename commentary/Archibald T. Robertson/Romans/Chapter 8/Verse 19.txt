<p><b> The earnest expectation of creation </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η αποκαραδοκια της κτισεως</span></span>). This substantive has so far been found nowhere save here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:20">Philippians 1:20</span>, though the verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαραδοκεω</span></span> is common in Polybius and Plutarch. Milligan (<i>Vocabulary</i>) thinks that Paul may have made the substantive from the verb. It is a double compound (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απο</span></span>, off from, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καρα</span></span>, head, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δοκεω</span></span>, Ionic verb, to watch), hence to watch eagerly with outstretched head.</p>
<p><b>Waiteth for </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απεκδεχετα</span></span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:5">Galatians 5:5</span> for this rare word (possibly formed by Paul, Milligan). "To wait it out" (Thayer).</p>
<p><b>The revealing of the sons of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την αποκαλυψιν των υιων του θεου</span></span>). Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4">Colossians 3:4</span>. This mystical sympathy of physical nature with the work of grace is beyond the comprehension of most of us. But who can disprove it? </p>
