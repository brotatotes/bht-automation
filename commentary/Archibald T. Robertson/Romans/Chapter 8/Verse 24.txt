<p><b> For by hope were we saved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τη γαρ ελπιδ εσωθημεν</span></span>). First aorist passive indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωζω</span></span>. The case of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ελπιδ</span></span> is not certain, the form being the same for locative, instrumental and dative. Curiously enough either makes good sense in this context: "We were saved in hope, by hope, for hope" (of the redemption of the body). </p>
