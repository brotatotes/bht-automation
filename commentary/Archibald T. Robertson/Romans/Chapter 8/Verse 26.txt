<p><b> Helpeth our infirmity </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναντιλαμβανετα τη ασθενεια ημων</span></span>). Present middle indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συναντιλαμβανομα</span></span>, late and striking double compound (Diodorus, LXX, Josephus, frequent in inscriptions, Deissmann, <i>Light, etc.</i>, p. 87), to lend a hand together with, at the same time with one. Only twice in N.T., here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:40">Luke 10:40</span> in Martha's plea for Mary's help. Here beautifully Paul pictures the Holy Spirit taking hold at our side at the very time of our weakness (associative instrumental case) and before too late.</p>
<p><b>How to pray </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το τ προσευξωμεθα</span></span>). Articular clause object of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">οιδαμεν</span></span> (we know) and indirect question with the deliberative aorist middle subjunctive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προσευξωμεθα</span></span>, retained in the indirect question.</p>
<p><b>As we ought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθο δε</span></span>). "As it is necessary." How true this is of all of us in our praying.</p>
<p><b>Maketh intercession </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερεντυγχανε</span></span>). Present active indicative of late double compound, found only here and in later ecclesiastical writers, but <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντυγχανω</span></span> occurs in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:27">Romans 8:27</span> (a common verb). It is a picturesque word of rescue by one who "happens on" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εντυγχανε</span></span>) one who is in trouble and "in his behalf" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span>) pleads "with unuttered groanings" (instrumental case) or with "sighs that baffle words" (Denney). This is work of our Helper, the Spirit himself. </p>
