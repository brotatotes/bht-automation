<p><b> He that searcheth </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο εραυνων</span></span>). God (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1sa+16:7">1 Samuel 16:7</span>).</p>
<p><b>According to the will of God </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα θεον</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:9-11">2 Corinthians 7:9-11</span> for this phrase <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα θεον</span></span> (according to God). The Holy Spirit is the "other Paraclete" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span>) who pleads God's cause with us as Christ is our Paraclete with the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>). But more is true as here, for the Holy Spirit interprets our prayers to God and "makes intercession for us in accord with God's will." </p>
