<p><b> All things work together </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">παντα συνεργε</span></span>). A B have <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο θεος</span></span> as the subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συνεργε</span></span> (old verb, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:16">1 Corinthians 16:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:1">2 Corinthians 6:1</span>). That is the idea anyhow. It is God who makes "all things work together" in our lives "for good" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις αγαθον</span></span>), ultimate good.</p>
<p><b>According to his purpose </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα προθεσιν</span></span>). Old word, seen already in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:13">Acts 27:13</span> and for "shewbread" in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:4">Matthew 12:4</span>. The verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προτιθημ</span></span> Paul uses in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</span> for God's purpose. Paul accepts fully human free agency but behind it all and through it all runs God's sovereignty as here and on its gracious side (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:11">Romans 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:11">Romans 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>). </p>
