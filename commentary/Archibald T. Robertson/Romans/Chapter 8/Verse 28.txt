 All things work together  (παντα συνεργε). A B have ο θεος as the subject of συνεργε (old verb, see on 1 Corinthians 16:16; 2 Corinthians 6:1). That is the idea anyhow. It is God who makes "all things work together" in our lives "for good" (εις αγαθον), ultimate good.According to his purpose  (κατα προθεσιν). Old word, seen already in Acts 27:13 and for "shewbread" in Matthew 12:4. The verb προτιθημ Paul uses in Romans 3:24 for God's purpose. Paul accepts fully human free agency but behind it all and through it all runs God's sovereignty as here and on its gracious side (Romans 9:11; Romans 3:11; 2 Timothy 1:9).
