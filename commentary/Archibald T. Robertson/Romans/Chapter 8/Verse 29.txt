 Foreknew  (προεγνω). Second aorist active indicative of προγινωσκω, old verb as in Acts 26:5. See Psalms 1:6 (LXX) and Matthew 7:23. This fore-knowledge and choice is placed in eternity in Ephesians 1:4.He foreordained  (προωρισεν). First aorist active indicative of προοριζω, late verb to appoint beforehand as in Acts 4:28; 1 Corinthians 2:7. Another compound with προ- (for eternity).Conformed to the image  (συμμορφους της εικονος). Late adjective from συν and μορφη and so an inward and not merely superficial conformity. Εικων is used of Christ as the very image of the Father (2 Corinthians 4:4; Colossians 1:15). See Philippians 2:6 for μορφη. Here we have both μορφη and εικων to express the gradual change in us till we acquire the likeness of Christ the Son of God so that we ourselves shall ultimately have the family likeness of sons of God. Glorious destiny.That he might be  (εις το εινα αυτον). Common idiom for purpose.First born among many brethren  (πρωτοτοκον εν πολλοις αδελφοις). Christ is "first born" of all creation (Colossians 1:15), but here he is "first born from the dead" (Colossians 1:18), the Eldest Brother in this family of God's sons, though "Son" in a sense not true of us.
