<p><b> Called </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκαλεσεν</span></span>)</p>
<p><b>--Justified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδικαιωσεν</span></span>)</p>
<p><b>--Glorified </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοξασεν</span></span>). All first aorist active indicatives of common verbs (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καλεω, δικαιοω, δοξαζω</span></span>). But the glorification is stated as already consummated (constative aorists, all of them), though still in the future in the fullest sense. "The step implied in <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοξασεν</span></span> is both complete and certain in the Divine counsels" (Sanday and Headlam). </p>
