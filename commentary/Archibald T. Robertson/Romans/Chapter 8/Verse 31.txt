<p><b> For these things </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">προς ταυτα</span></span>). From <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:12">Romans 8:12</span> on Paul has made a triumphant presentation of the reasons for the certainty of final sanctification of the sons of God. He has reached the climax with glorification (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εδοξασεν</span></span> in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:30">Romans 8:30</span>). But Paul lets the objector have his say as he usually does so that in verses <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:31-39">Romans 8:31-39</span> he considers the objections.</p>
<p><b>If God is for us, who is against us? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ε ο θεος υπερ ημων, τις καθ' ημων?</span></span>). This condition of the first class carries Paul's challenge to all doubters. There is no one on a par with God. Note the two prepositions in contrast (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">υπερ</span></span>, over, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>, down or against). </p>
