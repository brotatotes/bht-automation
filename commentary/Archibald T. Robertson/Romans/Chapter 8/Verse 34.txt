<p><b> Shall condemn </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατακρινων</span></span>). Can be either present active participle (condemns) or the future (shall condemn). It is a bold accuser who can face God with false charges or with true ones for that matter for we have an "Advocate" at God's Court (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>), "who is at the right hand of God" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος εστιν εν δεξια του θεου</span></span>) "who also maketh intercession for us" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ος κα εντυγχανε υπερ ημων</span></span>). Our Advocate paid the debt for our sins with his blood. The score is settled. We are free (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1">Romans 8:1</span>). </p>
