<p><b> Shall separate </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρισε</span></span>). Future active of old verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χοριζω</span></span> from adverb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρις</span></span> and that from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">χωρα</span></span>, space. Can any one put a distance between Christ's love and us (objective genitive)? Can any one lead Christ to cease loving us? Such things do happen between husband and wife, alas. Paul changes the figure from "who" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις</span></span>) to "what" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ</span></span>). The items mentioned will not make Christ love us less. Paul here glories in tribulations as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:3">Romans 5:3</span>. </p>
