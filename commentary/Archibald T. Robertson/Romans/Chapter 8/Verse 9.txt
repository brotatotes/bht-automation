<p><b> Not in the flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ εν σαρκ</span></span>). Not sold under sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:14">Romans 7:14</span>) any more.</p>
<p><b>But in the spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αλλα εν πνευματ</span></span>). Probably, "in the Holy Spirit." It is not Pantheism or Buddhism that Paul here teaches, but the mystical union of the believer with Christ in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><b>If so be that </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ειπερ</span></span>). "If as is the fact" (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:30">Romans 3:30</span>).</p>
<p><b>The Spirit of Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πνευμα Χριστου</span></span>). The same as "the Spirit of God" just before. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+1:19">Philippians 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:11">1 Peter 1:11</span>. Incidental argument for the Deity of Christ and probably the meaning of <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span> "the Spirit of the Lord." Condition of first class, assumed as true. </p>
