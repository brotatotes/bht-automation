<p>Paul quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mal+1:2">Malachi 1:2</span>.</p>
<p><b>But Esau I hated </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τον δε Εσαυ εμισησα</span></span>). This language sounds a bit harsh to us. It is possible that the word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισεω</span></span> did not always carry the full force of what we mean by "hate." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:24">Matthew 6:24</span> where these very verbs (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισεω</span></span> and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αγαπαω</span></span>) are contrasted. So also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:26">Luke 14:26</span> about "hating" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μισεω</span></span>) one's father and mother if coming between one and Christ. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:25">John 12:25</span> about "hating" one's life. There is no doubt about God's preference for Jacob and rejection of Esau, but in spite of Sanday and Headlam one hesitates to read into these words here the intense hatred that has always existed between the descendants of Jacob and of Esau. </p>
