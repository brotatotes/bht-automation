 Why doth he still find fault?  (τ ετ μεμφεται?). Old verb, to blame. In N.T. only here and Hebrews 8:8. Paul's imaginary objector picks up the admission that God hardened Pharaoh's heart. "Still" (ετ) argues for a change of condition since that is true.Withstandeth his will  (τω βουληματ αυτου ανθεστηκεν). Perfect active indicative of ανθιστημ, old verb, maintains a stand (the perfect tense). Many have attempted to resist God's will (βουλημα, deliberate purpose, in N.T. only here and Acts 27:43; 1 Peter 4:3). Elsewhere θελημα (Matthew 6:10).
