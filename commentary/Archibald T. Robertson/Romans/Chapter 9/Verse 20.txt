<p><b> Nay, but, O man, who art thou? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ο ανθρωπε, μεν ουν γε συ τις ει?</span></span>). "O man, but surely thou who art thou?" Unusual and emphatic order of the words, prolepsis of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">συ</span></span> (thou) before <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τις</span></span> (who) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν ουν γε</span></span> (triple particle, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μεν</span></span>, indeed, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουν</span></span>, therefore, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γε</span></span>, at least) at the beginning of clause as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:18">Romans 10:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:8">Philippians 3:8</span> contrary to ancient idiom, but so in papyri.</p>
<p><b>That repliest </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ανταποκρινομενος</span></span>). Present middle articular participle of double compound verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανταποκρινομα</span></span>, to answer to one's face (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αντι-</span></span>) late and vivid combination, also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:6">Luke 14:6</span>, nowhere else in N.T., but in LXX.</p>
<p><b>The thing formed </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το πλασμα</span></span>). Old word (Plato, Aristophanes) from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πλασσω</span></span>, to mould, as with clay or wax, from which the aorist active participle used here (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τω πλασαντ</span></span>) comes. Paul quotes these words from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:16">Isaiah 29:16</span> verbatim. It is a familiar idea in the Old Testament, the absolute power of God as Creator like the potter's use of clay (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+44:8">Isaiah 44:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:8-10">Isaiah 45:8-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+18:6">Jeremiah 18:6</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Μη</span></span> expects a negative answer.</p>
<p><b>Why didst thou make me thus? </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τ με εποιησας ουτωσ?</span></span>). The original words in Isaiah dealt with the nation, but Paul applies them to individuals. This question does not raise the problem of the origin of sin for the objector does not blame God for that but why God has used us as he has, made some vessels out of the clay for this purpose, some for that. Observe "thus" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουτως</span></span>). The potter takes the clay as he finds it, but uses it as he wishes. </p>
