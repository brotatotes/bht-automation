<p><b> Willing </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θελων</span></span>). Concessive use of the participle, "although willing," not causal, "because willing" as is shown by "with much long-suffering" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν πολλη μακροθυμια</span></span>, in much long-suffering).</p>
<p><b>His power </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το δυνατον αυτου</span></span>). Neuter singular of the verbal adjective rather than the substantive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δυναμιν</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Endured </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηνεγκεν</span></span>). Constative second aorist active indicative of the old defective verb <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φερω</span></span>, to bear.</p>
<p><b>Vessels of wrath </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σκευη οργης</span></span>). The words occur in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+50:25">Jeremiah 50:25</span> (LXX <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jer+27:25">Jeremiah 27:25</span>), but not in the sense here (objective genitive like <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τεκνα οργης</span></span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:3">Ephesians 2:3</span>, the objects of God's wrath).</p>
<p><b>Fitted </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατηρτισμενα</span></span>). Perfect passive participle of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταρτιζω</span></span>, old verb to equip (see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:21">Matthew 4:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11">2 Corinthians 13:11</span>), state of readiness.

<p><b>Unto destruction </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις απωλειαν</span></span>).
