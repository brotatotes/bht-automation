<p><b> In Hosea </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εν τω Hωσηε</span></span>). He quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:23">Romans 2:23</span> with some freedom. Hosea refers to the ten tribes and Paul applies the principle stated there to the Gentiles. Hosea had a son named <i>Lo-ammi</i> = <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου λαος</span></span>. So here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ου λαος μου</span></span> "the not people of mine." <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Ου</span></span> with substantives obliterates the meaning of the substantive, an idiom seen in Thucydides and other Greek writers. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:19">Romans 10:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:10">1 Peter 2:10</span>.</p>
<p><b>Which was not beloved </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">την ουκ ηγαπημενην</span></span>). The LXX rendering of <i>Lo-ruhamah</i> (not mercy, without mercy or love), name of Hosea's daughter. The use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουκ</span></span> with the perfect passive participle is emphatic, since <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μη</span></span> is the usual negative of the participle in the <i>Koine</i>. </p>
