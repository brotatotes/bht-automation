<p><b> I could wish </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηυχομην</span></span>). Idiomatic imperfect, "I was on the point of wishing." We can see that <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ευχομα</span></span> (I do wish) would be wrong to say. <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αν ηυχομην</span></span> would mean that he does not wish (conclusion of second class condition). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Αν ηυχομην</span></span> would be conclusion of fourth class condition and too remote. He is shut up to the imperfect indicative (Robertson, <i>Grammar</i>, p. 886).</p>
<p><b>Anathema </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθεμα</span></span>). See for this word as distinct from <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αναθημα</span></span> (offering) <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span> <b> I myself </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αυτος εγω</span></span>). Nominative with the infinitive <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εινα</span></span> and agreeing with subject of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ηυχομην</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>According to the flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα σαρκα</span></span>). As distinguished from Paul's Christian brethren. </p>
