<p><b> Did not arrive at that law </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εις νομον ουκ εφθασεν</span></span>). First aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">φθανω</span></span>, old verb to anticipate (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>), now just to arrive as here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:14">2 Corinthians 10:14</span>. The word "that" is not in the Greek. Legal righteousness Israel failed to reach, because to do that one had to keep perfectly all the law. </p>
