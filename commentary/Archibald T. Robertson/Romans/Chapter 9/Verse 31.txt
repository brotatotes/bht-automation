 Did not arrive at that law  (εις νομον ουκ εφθασεν). First aorist active indicative of φθανω, old verb to anticipate (1 Thessalonians 4:15), now just to arrive as here and 2 Corinthians 10:14. The word "that" is not in the Greek. Legal righteousness Israel failed to reach, because to do that one had to keep perfectly all the law.
