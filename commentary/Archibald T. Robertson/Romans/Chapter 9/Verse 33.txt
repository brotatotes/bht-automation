Paul repeats the phrase just used in the whole quotation from Isaiah 8:14 with the same idea in "a rock of offence" (πετραν σκανδαλου, "a rock of snare," a rock which the Jews made a cause of stumbling). The rest of the verse is quoted from Isaiah 28:16. However, the Hebrew means "shall not make haste" rather than "shall not be put to shame." In 1 Peter 2:8 we have the same use of these Scriptures about Christ. Either Peter had read Romans or both Paul and Peter had a copy of Christian Testimonia like Cyprian's later.
