<p>Paul repeats the phrase just used in the whole quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:14">Isaiah 8:14</span> with the same idea in "a rock of offence" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πετραν σκανδαλου</span></span>, "a rock of snare," a rock which the Jews made a cause of stumbling). The rest of the verse is quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>. However, the Hebrew means "shall not make haste" rather than "shall not be put to shame." In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:8">1 Peter 2:8</span> we have the same use of these Scriptures about Christ. Either Peter had read Romans or both Paul and Peter had a copy of Christian <i>Testimonia</i> like Cyprian's later. </p>
