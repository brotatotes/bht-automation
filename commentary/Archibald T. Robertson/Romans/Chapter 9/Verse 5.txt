<p><b> Of whom </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ ων</span></span>). Fourth relative clause and here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εξ</span></span> and the ablative.</p>
<p><b>Christ </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο Χριστος</span></span>). The Messiah.</p>
<p><b>As concerning the flesh </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">το κατα σαρκα</span></span>). Accusative of general reference, "as to the according to the flesh." Paul limits the descent of Jesus from the Jews to his human side as he did in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:3">Romans 1:3</span>.</p>
<p><b>Who is over all, God blessed for ever </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ο ον επ παντων θεος ευλογητος</span></span>). A clear statement of the deity of Christ following the remark about his humanity. This is the natural and the obvious way of punctuating the sentence. To make a full stop after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σαρκα</span></span> (or colon) and start a new sentence for the doxology is very abrupt and awkward. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span> for Paul's use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">θεος</span></span> applied to Jesus Christ. </p>
