<p><b> But it is not as though </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ οιον δε οτ</span></span>). Supply <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εστιν</span></span> after <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ουχ</span></span>: "But it is not such as that," an old idiom, here alone in N.T.</p>
<p><b>Hath come to nought </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπεπτωκεν</span></span>). Perfect active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">εκπιπτω</span></span>, old verb, to fall out.</p>
<p><b>For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ου γαρ παντες ο εξ Ισραηλ ουτο Ισραηλ</span></span>). "For not all those out of Israel (the literal Jewish nation), these are Israel (the spiritual Israel)." This startling paradox is not a new idea with Paul. He had already shown (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7-9">Galatians 3:7-9</span>) that those of faith are the true sons of Abraham. He has amplified that idea also in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:4">Romans 9:4</span>. So he is not making a clever dodge here to escape a difficulty. He now shows how this was the original purpose of God to include only those who believed.</p>
<p><b>Seed of Abraham </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σπερμα Αβρααμ</span></span>). Physical descent here, but spiritual seed by promise in verse <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:8">Romans 9:8</span>. He quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:12">Genesis 21:12</span>. </p>
