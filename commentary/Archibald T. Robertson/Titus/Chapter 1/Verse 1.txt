 According to the faith of God's elect  (κατα πιστιν εκλεκτων θεου). Here κατα expresses the aim of Paul's apostleship, not the standard by which he was chosen as in Philippians 3:14; a classic idiom, repeated here with επιγνωσιν, ευσεβειαν, επιταγην, "with a view to" in each case. For "God's elect" see Romans 8:33; Colossians 3:12.The knowledge  (επιγνωσιν). "Full knowledge," one of Paul's favourite words. For the phrase see 1 Timothy 2:4.Which is according to godliness  (της κατ' ευσεβειαν). "The (truth) with a view to godliness." The combination of faith and full knowledge of the truth is to bring godliness on the basis of the hope of life eternal.
