<p><b> According to the faith of God's elect </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα πιστιν εκλεκτων θεου</span></span>). Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> expresses the aim of Paul's apostleship, not the standard by which he was chosen as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:14">Philippians 3:14</span>; a classic idiom, repeated here with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγνωσιν, ευσεβειαν, επιταγην</span></span>, "with a view to" in each case. For "God's elect" see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:33">Romans 8:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12">Colossians 3:12</span>.</p>
<p><b>The knowledge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιγνωσιν</span></span>). "Full knowledge," one of Paul's favourite words. For the phrase see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:4">1 Timothy 2:4</span>.</p>
<p><b>Which is according to godliness </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">της κατ' ευσεβειαν</span></span>). "The (truth) with a view to godliness." The combination of faith and full knowledge of the truth is to bring godliness on the basis of the hope of life eternal. </p>
