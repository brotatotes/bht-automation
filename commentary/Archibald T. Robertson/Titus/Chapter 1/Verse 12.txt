<p><b> A prophet of their own </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ιδιος αυτων προφητης</span></span>). "Their own prophet." Self-styled "prophet" (or poet), and so accepted by the Cretans and by Cicero and Apuleius, that is Epimenides who was born in Crete at Cnossos. It is a hexameter line and Callimachus quoted the first part of it in a Hymn to Zeus. It is said that Epimenides suggested to the Athenians the erection of statues to "unknown gods" (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:23">Acts 17:23</span>).</p>
<p><b>Liars </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ψευστα</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:10">1 Timothy 1:10</span> for the word. The Cretans had a bad reputation on this line, partly due to their claim to having the tomb of Zeus.</p>
<p><b>Evil beasts </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κακα θηρια</span></span>). "Wicked wild beasts." Lock asks if the Minotaur was partly responsible.</p>
<p><b>Idle gluttons </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">γαστερες αργα</span></span>). "Idle bellies." Blunt and forceful. See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="php+3:19">Philippians 3:19</span> "whose god is the belly" (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">η κοιλια</span></span>). Both words give the picture of the sensual gormandizer. </p>
