See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2">1 Timothy 1:2</span> for this adjective with Timothy. Titus is not mentioned in Acts, possibly because he is Luke's brother. But one can get a clear picture of him by turning to <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:13">2 Corinthians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:6-15">2 Corinthians 7:6-15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6-24">2 Corinthians 8:6-24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:16-18">2 Corinthians 12:16-18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1-3">Galatians 2:1-3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4">Titus 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:12">Titus 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:10">2 Timothy 4:10</span>.

<p><b>After a common faith </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα κοινην πιστιν</span></span>). Here <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span> does mean standard, not aim, but it is a faith (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πιστιν</span></span>) common to a Gentile (a Greek) like Titus as well as to a Jew like Paul and so common to all races and classes (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:3">Jude 1:3</span>). <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">Κοινος</span></span> does not here have the notion of unclean as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:14">Acts 10:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:8">Acts 11:8</span>. </p>
