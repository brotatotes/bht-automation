<p><b> For this cause </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τουτου χαριν</span></span>). In N.T. only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:14">Ephesians 3:14</span>. Paul may be supplementing oral instruction as in Timothy's case and may even be replying to a letter from Titus (Zahn).</p>
<p><b>Left I thee in Crete </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απελειπον σε εν Κρητη</span></span>). This is the imperfect active of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολειπω</span></span>, though MSS. give the aorist active also (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απελιπον</span></span>) and some read <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατελειπον</span></span> or <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατελιπον</span></span>. Both are common verbs, though Paul uses <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλειπω</span></span> only in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:1">1 Thessalonians 3:1</span> except two quotations (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:4">Romans 11:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:31">Ephesians 5:31</span>) and <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολειπω</span></span> only here and <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:13">2 Timothy 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:20">2 Timothy 4:20</span>. Perhaps <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">απολειπω</span></span> suggests a more temporary stay than <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταλειπω</span></span>. Paul had apparently stopped in Crete on his return from Spain about A.D. 65.</p>
<p><b>That thou shouldest set in order </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα επιδιορθωση</span></span>). Late and rare double compound (inscriptions, here only in N.T.), first aorist middle subjunctive (final clause with <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ινα</span></span>) of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιδιορθοω</span></span>, to set straight (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ορθοω</span></span>) thoroughly (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια</span></span>) in addition (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επ</span></span>), a clean job of it.</p>
<p><b>The things that were wanting </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">τα λειποντα</span></span>). "The things that remain." See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:13">Titus 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:22">Luke 18:22</span>. Either things left undone or things that survive. In both senses the new pastor faces problems after the tornado has passed. Parry takes it "of present defects" in Cretan character.</p>
<p><b>And appoint </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα καταστησηις</span></span>). Final clause still and first aorist active subjunctive of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καθιστημ</span></span>, the word used in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:13">Acts 6:13</span> about the deacons. The word does not preclude the choice by the churches (in every city, <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα πολιν</span></span>, distributive use of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα</span></span>). This is a chief point in the <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">επιδορθωσις</span></span> (White).</p>
<p><b>Elders </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">πρεσβυτερους</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:17">1 Timothy 4:17</span>.</p>
<p><b>As I gave thee charge </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ως εγω σο διεταξαμην</span></span>). First aorist (constative) middle imperative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">διατασσω</span></span>, clear reference to previous personal details given to Titus on previous occasions. </p>
