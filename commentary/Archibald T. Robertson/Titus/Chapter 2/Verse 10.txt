 Not purloining  (μη νοσφιζομενους). Present middle participle of νοσφιζω, old verb (from νοσφ, apart), in middle to set apart for oneself, to embezzle, in N.T. only here and Acts 5:2.Fidelity  (πιστιν). See Galatians 5:22; 1 Timothy 5:12 for πιστις in the sense of faithfulness. Nowhere else in the N.T. do we have αγαθη with πιστις as here, but an Oxyr. papyrus (iii. 494, 9) has this very phrase (πασαν πιστιν ενδεικνυμενη). Westcott and Hort put αγαπην in the margin. See Titus 3:2.That they may adorn  (ινα κοσμωσιν). Final clause with ινα and present active subjunctive. See 1 Timothy 2:9 for κοσμεω. Paul shows slaves how they may "adorn" the teaching of God.
