 Hath appeared  (επεφανη). "Did appear," the first Epiphany (the Incarnation). Second aorist passive indicative of επιφαινω, old verb, in N.T. here, Titus 3:4; Luke 1:79; Acts 27:20.Bringing salvation  (σωτηριος). Old adjective from σωτηρ (Saviour), here alone in N.T. except το σωτηριον (salvation, "the saving act") in Luke 2:30; Luke 3:6; Ephesians 6:17.Instructing  (παιδευουσα). See 1 Timothy 1:20.Ungodliness  (ασεβειαν). See Romans 1:18.Worldly lusts  (τας κοσμικας επιθυμιας). Aristotle and Plutarch use κοσμικος (from κοσμος) about the universe as in Hebrews 9:1 about the earthly. Here it has alone in N.T. the sense of evil "in this present age" as with κοσμος in 1 John 2:16. The three adverbs set off the opposite (soberly σωφρονως, righteously δικαιως, godly ευσεβως).
