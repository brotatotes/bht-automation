<p><b> With all authority </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μετα πασης επιταγης</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:6">1 Corinthians 7:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:8">2 Corinthians 8:8</span>. Assertion of authority is sometimes necessary.</p>
<p><b>Let no man despise thee </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">μηδεις σου περιφρονειτω</span></span>). Present active imperative in prohibition of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">περιφρονεω</span></span>, old verb, only here in N.T., to think around (on all sides). Literally, "let no man think around thee" (and so despise thee). In <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span> it is <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">καταφρονειτω</span></span> (think down on), a stronger word of scorn, but this one implies the possibility of one making mental circles around one and so "out-thinking" him. The best way for the modern minister to command respect for his "authority" is to do thinking that will deserve it. </p>
