 With all authority  (μετα πασης επιταγης). See 1 Corinthians 7:6; 2 Corinthians 8:8. Assertion of authority is sometimes necessary.Let no man despise thee  (μηδεις σου περιφρονειτω). Present active imperative in prohibition of περιφρονεω, old verb, only here in N.T., to think around (on all sides). Literally, "let no man think around thee" (and so despise thee). In 1 Timothy 4:12 it is καταφρονειτω (think down on), a stronger word of scorn, but this one implies the possibility of one making mental circles around one and so "out-thinking" him. The best way for the modern minister to command respect for his "authority" is to do thinking that will deserve it.
