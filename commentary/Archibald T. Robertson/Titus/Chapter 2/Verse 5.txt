 Workers at home  (οικουργους). So the oldest MSS. (from οικοσ, εργου) instead of οικουρους, keepers at home (from κοισο, ουρος, keeper). Rare word, found in Soranus, a medical writer, Field says. Cf. 1 Timothy 5:13. "Keepers at home" are usually "workers at home."Kind  (αγαθας). See Romans 5:7. See Colossians 3:18; Ephesians 5:22 for the same use of υποτασσομα, to be in subjection. Note ιδιοις (their own). See 1 Timothy 6:1 for the same negative purpose clause (ινα μη βλασφημητα).
