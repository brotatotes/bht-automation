<p><b> Done </b> (not in the Greek, only the article <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">των</span></span>), "not as a result of works those in righteousness which we did." Same idea as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span>.</p>
<p><b>According to his mercy he saved us </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κατα το αυτου ελεος εσωσεν</span></span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ps+109:26">Psalms 109:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:4">Ephesians 2:4</span>. Effective aorist active indicative of <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">σωζω</span></span>.</p>
<p><b>Through the washing of regeneration </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">δια λουτρου παλινγενεσιας</span></span>). Late and common word with the Stoics (Dibelius) and in the Mystery-religions (Angus), also in the papyri and Philo. Only twice in the N.T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span> with which compare <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">αποκαταστασια</span></span> in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:21">Acts 3:21</span>, and here in personal sense of new birth). For <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">λουτρον</span></span>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:26">Ephesians 5:26</span>, here as there the laver or the bath. Probably in both cases there is a reference to baptism, but, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:3-6">Romans 6:3-6</span>, the immersion is the picture or the symbol of the new birth, not the means of securing it.</p>
<p><b>And renewing of the Holy Spirit </b> (<span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">κα ανακαινωσεως πνευματος αγιου</span></span>). "And renewal by the Holy Spirit" (subjective genitive). For the late word <span class="_800000"><span lang="el-GR">ανακαινωσις</span></span>, see <span class="scriptRef" com="rwp" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:2">Romans 12:2</span>. Here, as often, Paul has put the objective symbol before the reality. The Holy Spirit does the renewing, man submits to the baptism after the new birth to picture it forth to men. </p>
