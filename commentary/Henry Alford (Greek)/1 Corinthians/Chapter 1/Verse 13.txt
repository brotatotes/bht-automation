<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] Some (Lachmann has so printed it) take μεμέρισται ὁ χρ . as an assertion, ‘ <em> Christ has been divided</em> (by you),’ or, as Chrys. mentions, διενείματο πρὸς ἀνθρώπους κ . ἐμερίσατο τὴν ἐκκλησίαν . But it is far better to take it, as commonly, interrogatively: <strong> Is Christ</strong> (the <em> Person</em> of Christ, as the centre and bond of Christian unity not, the <em> Gospel</em> of Christ (Grot., al.), nor the <em> Church</em> of Christ (Estius, Olsh.): nor the <em> power</em> of Christ (Theodoret), i.e. his right over all) <strong> divided</strong> (not in the primary sense (Meyer, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+1:0">Exodus 1:0</span> ), against Himself, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:24-25">Mark 3:24-25</span> , where we have ἐφ ʼ ἑαυτήν , but ‘ <em> into various parts</em> , one under one leader, another under another, which in fact would amount, after all, to a division against Himself)? The question applies to <em> all addressed</em> , not to the ἐγὼ χριστοῦ only, as Meyer, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+1:0">Exodus 1:0</span> . In that case μεμέρισται ῥ χρ . would mean ‘Has Christ become the property of one part only?’ as indeed Dr. Burton renders it.
	</p>
<p>Meyer urges against the interrogative rendering, that the questions begin immediately after, with μή . But we may fairly set against this argument, that the μή introduces a new <em> form</em> of interrogation respecting a new individual, viz. Paul: and that it was natural, for solemnity’s sake, to express the other question differently. In μεμέρισται <strong> ὁ χριστός</strong> , the Majesty of Christ’s Person is set against the unworthy insinuation conveyed by μεμέρισται , in μὴ Παῦλος ἐσταυρώθη ὑπὲρ ὑμ ., the meanness of the individual, Paul, is set against the triumph of divine Love implied in ἐστ . ὑπ . ὑμῶν . Two such contrasts could hardly but be differently expressed.

<p><strong> μὴ Π</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐστ</strong> <strong> .</strong> κ . τ . λ .] <strong> Surely Paul was not crucified for you?</strong> By repudiating all possibility of <em> himself</em> being the Head and ἐπώνυμος of their church, he does so <em> à fortiori</em> for Cephas and Apollos: for <em> he founded</em> the Church at Corinth.
