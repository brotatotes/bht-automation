<p><strong> 19.</strong> ] <strong> For</strong> (continuation of reason for οὐκ ἐν σοφίᾳ λόγου : because it was prophesied that such wisdom should be brought to nought by God) <strong> it is written, &amp;c</strong> . The citation is after the LXX, with the exception of ἀθετήσω for κρύψω . The Heb. is ‘the wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the prudence of the prudent shall disappear.’ (Lowth.) But Calv. says most truly, ‘Perit sapientia, sed Domino destruente: sapientia evanescit, sed inducta a Domino et deleta.’</p>
