<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] This verse plainly is a continuation of the opposition to 1Co 1:22 before begun, but itself springs by way of opposition out of Ἰουδ . μὲν σκάνδ ., ἔθν . δὲ μωρίαν , and carries the thought back to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18">1 Corinthians 1:18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:21">1 Corinthians 1:21</span> .

<p><strong> αὐτοῖς δὲ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κλητοῖς</strong> ] Not, ‘ <em> but to the elect themselves</em> ,’ which would be either αὐτοῖς δὲ κλητοῖς , or τοῖς δὲ κλητοῖς αὐτοῖς ; but <strong> to these, viz. the elect</strong> , the αὐτοῖς serving to identify them with the σωζόμενοι of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18">1 Corinthians 1:18</span> . There it was <strong> ἡμῖν</strong> , here αὐτοῖς , because by the mention of <em> preaching</em> joined with ἡμεῖς , he has now separated off the <em> hearers</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> δύναμιν</strong> <strong> , as</strong> fulfilling the requirement of the seekers after a <em> sign</em> : <strong> σοφίαν</strong> , of those who sought <em> wisdom</em> . The repetition of χριστόν gives solemnity, at the same time that it concentrates the δύναμις and σοφία in the Person of Christ; q. d. ‘ <em> Christ even in His humiliation unto death, the power of God and wisdom of God</em> .’
	</p>
<p>The use of δύναμις and σοφία here as applied to Him who was the greatest example of both, would not justify the absolute use of σοφία in this sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:21">1 Corinthians 1:21</span> .</p>
