<p><strong> 30.</strong> ] <strong> But</strong> (contrast to the boasting just spoken of) <strong> of Him are ye</strong> (from Him ye, who once were as οὐκ ὄντα , ἐστέ . He is the author of your spiritual life) in (in union with) <strong> Christ Jesus, Who was made</strong> (not ‘is made:’ see reff. On γενήθη see 1Th 1:5 note) <strong> to us from God wisdom</strong> (standing us in stead of all earthly wisdom and raising us above it by being ἀπὸ θεοῦ ; Wisdom in His incarnation, in His life of obedience, in His teaching, in His death of atonement, in His glorification and sending of the Spirit: and not only Wisdom, but all that we can want to purify us from guilt, to give us righteousness before God, to sanctify us after His likeness, ( <strong> and</strong> ) <strong> both righteousness</strong> (the source of our justification before God), <strong> and sanctification</strong> (by His Spirit; observe the <strong> τε καί</strong> , implying that in these two, δικαιος . and ἁγιασμ ., the Christian life is complete that they are so joined as to form one whole <strong> our righteousness as well as our sanctification</strong> . As Bisping well remarks, “ δικ . and ἁγ . are closely joined by the τε ( καί ) and form but one idea, that of Christian justification: δικαιοσύνη the negative side, in Christ’s justifying work ἁγιασμός the positive, sanctification, the imparting to us of sanctifying grace”), <strong> and redemption</strong> (by satisfaction made for our sin, reff.: or perhaps <em> deliverance</em> , from all evil, and especially from eternal death, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span> ; but I prefer the other). The foregoing construction of the sentence is justified, (1) as regards ἀπὸ θεοῦ belonging to ἐγενήθη , and not to σοφία , by the position of ἡμῖν , which has been altered in rec. to connect σοφία with ἀπὸ θ ., (2) as regards the whole four substantives being co-ordinate, and not the last three merely explicative of σοφία , by the usage of τε καί καί , e.g. Herod. i. 23, διθύραμβον πρῶτον ἀνθρώπων τῶν ἡμεῖς ἴδμεν ποιήσαντά τε καὶ ὀνομάσαντα καὶ διδάξαντα , and Hom. Od. ο . 78, ἀμφότερον , κῦδός τε καὶ ἀγλαΐη καὶ ὄνειαρ , so that (see Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 103; Donaldson, Gr. Gram. 551) the words coupled by τε καί (compare the exegesis above) rank as <em> but one</em> with regard to those coupled to them by καί , compare <strong> ἀμφότερον</strong> above. Hence these <em> three</em> cannot be under one category, as explicative of σοφία , but must be thus ranged: σοφία δικαιοσύνη τε καὶ ἁγιασμός , καὶ ἀπολύτρωσις .</p>
