<p><strong> 27, 28</strong> .] <strong> τὰ μωρά</strong> , neut. for more generalization, but = τοὺς μωρούς . This is shewn by τοὺς σοφούς following, in that case it being necessary to use the masculine.
	</p>
<p><strong> τοῦ κόσμ</strong> ., <strong> of</strong> (belonging to) <strong> the world</strong> : not <em> in the eyes of the world</em> , as Theodoret, Luth., Grot., Est., al., which would not fit τὰ ἀγενῆ τ . κόσμ ., nor the <em> sense</em> : for they were not only <em> seemingly</em> but <em> really</em> foolish, when God chose them.
	</p>
<p><strong> καταισχύνῃ</strong> , by shewing to the wise and the strong, the foolish and the weak entering the kingdom of heaven before them.
	</p>
<p><strong> τὰ ἀγενῆ</strong> , matter of <em> fact</em> <strong> the low-born</strong> :
	</p>
<p><strong> τὰ ἐξουθενημένα</strong> , matter of <em> estimation</em> , <strong> the despised</strong> .
	</p>
<p>Without the καί , which is certainly the true reading, τὰ μὴ ὄντα <em> may</em> belong to all four, the μωρά , ἀσθενῆ , ἀγενῆ , and ἐξουθεν ., but more probably it has reference only to the last two. Nothing (as e.g. μέγα τι ) must be supplied after μὴ ὄντα : it means <strong> as good as having no existence</strong> : μή being subjective, and implying that the non-existence is not <em> absolute</em> but <em> estimative</em> . Were it absolute <em> matter of fact</em> , it would be expressed by τὰ οὐκ ὄντα , as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:10">1 Peter 2:10</span> , οἱ οὐκ ἠλεημένοι , νῦν δὲ ἐλεηθέντες . See Hartung, Partikellehre, ii. p. 131; Winer, edn. 6, § 55. 5; and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3">Philippians 3:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:4">Ephesians 5:4</span> . Olshausen refines on the expression too much, when he explains it of those who have lost their old carnal life and have not yet acquired their new spiritual one: it more probably means, things (persons) of absolutely <em> no account</em> in the world, unassignable among men, which the ἀγενῆ and ἐξουθενημένα are.

<p>Meyer remarks that the threefold repetition of ἐξελ . ὁ θεός , with the three contrasts to σοφοί , δυνατοί , and εὐγενεῖς , announces the fact with a triumphant emphasis.
	</p>
<p><strong> καταργ</strong> .] ‘reduce to the state of οὐκ ὄντα .’ All the ὄντα , the <em> realities</em> , of the world, are of absolutely <em> no account</em> , unassignable, in God’s spiritual kingdom.</p>
