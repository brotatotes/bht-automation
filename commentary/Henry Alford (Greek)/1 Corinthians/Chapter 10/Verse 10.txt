<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] <strong> γογγύζετε</strong> has been by Estius, Grot., al., and De Wette, understood of murmuring <em> against their teachers</em> , as the Israelites against Moses and Aaron, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:2">Numbers 14:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:41">Numbers 16:41</span> . But not to mention that this was in fact <em> murmuring against God</em> , such a reference would require something more specific than the mere word γογγύζετε . The warning is substantially the same as the last, but regards more the spirit, and its index the tongue. Theophyl.: αἰνίττεται δὲ αὐτοὺς καὶ διὰ τούτου , ὅτι ἐν τοῖς πειρασμοῖς οὐκ ἔφερον γενναίως , ἀλλ ʼ ἐγόγγυζον λέγοντες Πότε ἥξει τὰ ἀγαθά , καὶ ἕως πότε αἱ κακώσεις ; similarly Chrys.

<p>The destruction referred to must be that related <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:41">Numbers 16:41</span> ff. when the pestilence (which though it is not so specified <em> there</em> , was administered on another occasion by a destroying angel, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2sa+24:16-17">2 Samuel 24:16-17</span> , see also Exo 12:23 ) took off 14,700 of the people. The punishment of the unbelieving congregation in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:0">Numbers 14:0</span> , to which this is commonly referred, does not seem to answer to the expression ἀπώλοντο ὑπὸ τ . ὀλοθρευτοῦ , nor to the τινες , seeing that all except Joshua and Caleb were involved in it.</p>
