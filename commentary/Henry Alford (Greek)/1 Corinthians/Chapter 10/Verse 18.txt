<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] Another example of κοινωνία , from <em> the Jewish feasts after sacrifice</em> .

<p><strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἰσρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κατὰ σάρκα</strong> ] (= τ . Ἰσρ . <strong> τὸν</strong> κατὰ σάρκα : so we have τοῖς κυρίοις κατὰ σάρκα , Eph 6:5 ), the <strong> actual</strong> material <strong> Israel</strong> , as distinguished from ὁ Ἰσρ . κατὰ πνεῦμα , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:29">Galatians 4:29</span> ; and ὁ Ἰσρ . τοῦ θεοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:16">Galatians 6:16</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> οἱ ἐσθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θυσ</strong> .] viz. those parts of the sacrifices which were not offered; see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span> .
	</p>
<p>The parts to be offered are specified, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+3:3">Leviticus 3:3</span> ; the practice of eating the remainder of the meat sanctioned and regulated, ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+7:15-18">Leviticus 7:15-18</span> .

<p><strong> κοινωνοὶ τοῦ θυσ</strong> .] <strong> partakers with the altar</strong> (in a strict and peculiar sense, the <em> altar</em> having <em> part</em> of the animal, the <em> partaker another part</em> ; and by the fact of the <em> religious consecration</em> of the offered part, this connexion becomes a <em> religious connexion</em> . The question has been raised, and with reason, why the Apostle did not say κοινωνοὶ τοῦ <strong> θεοῦ</strong> ? Meyer answers, because the Jew was <em> already in covenant with God</em> , and the Apostle wished to express a <em> closer connexion</em> , brought about by the sacrifice in question: De Wette, because he was unwilling to ascribe so much to the mere act of sacrifice, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span> ff.: and to this latter view I incline, because, as De W. remarks, θεοῦ would have <em> suited the analogy better</em> than θυσιαστηρίου , but Paul avoids it, and evidently is reluctant to use it. But to carry this view further, and suppose with Rückert that he would not concede to the Ἰσρ . κατὰ σάρκα any κοινωνία θεοῦ , is (Meyer) contradicted by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:4-5">Romans 9:4-5</span> . Still the inference lies open, to which our Saviour’s saying points, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:20-21">Matthew 23:20-21</span> . The altar is GOD’S <em> altar</em> ).</p>
