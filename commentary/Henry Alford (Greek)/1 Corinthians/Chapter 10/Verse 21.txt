<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] <em> Reason of the</em> οὐ θέλω , sententiously expressed without γάρ .
	</p>
<p><strong> οὐ δύνασθε</strong> applies of course to the <em> real spiritual participation</em> of the table of the Lord so as to profit by it: to <em> moral</em> possibility. The <strong> ποτήριον δαιμονίων</strong> is said as corresponding to the cup of which mention has been already made, not as Grot., al., and De Wette fancy, referring to the <em> libation</em> at an idol feast.

<p><strong> τράπεζα</strong> is said by Pollux vi. 12 (Suicer) to be used in the sense of τὰ σιτία τὰ ἐπ ʼ αὐτῶν τῶν τραπεζῶν τιθέμενα . Compare the description in Herod. iii. 18, of the Ἡλίου τράπεζα , Polyb. iv. 35. 4, ὥστε περὶ τὸν βωμὸν κ . τὴν τράπεζαν τῆς θεοῦ κατασφαγῆναι τοὺς Ἐφόρους ἅπαντας , and ref. Isa.
	</p>
<p>From this passage probably, the τράπεζα κυρίου became an expression current in all ages of the Christian Church: see Suicer in voc.</p>
