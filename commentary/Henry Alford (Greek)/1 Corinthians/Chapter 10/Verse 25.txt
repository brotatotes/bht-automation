<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] The key to understanding this and the following verse is, to remember that <strong> συνείδησις</strong> is used in each case of the conscience of the <em> person spoken of</em> , i.e. in the two first cases, that of the <em> reader</em> , in the third, as explained by the Apostle, that of the <em> weak brother</em> : see there. <strong> Every thing which is being sold</strong> (offered for sale) <strong> in the flesh-market</strong> ( <strong> μάκελλον</strong> is adopted from the Latin. It was also used by the Rabbis, in the form מקולין . See Stanley, and examples in Wetst.), <strong> eat, making no enquiry</strong> (whether it is meat offered to idols or not), <strong> on account of your conscience</strong> (to be joined with ἐσθίετε μηδ . ἀνακ ., not with ἀνακρίνοντες only, as is shewn by the parallel below, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:28">1 Corinthians 10:28</span> , where the <em> reason given</em> is joined to ἐσθίετε ). The meaning being, ‘ <em> eat without enquiry, that your conscience may not be offended</em> ,’ If you <em> made enquiry</em> , and heard in reply, that the meat <em> had been</em> offered to idols, <em> your conscience would be offended</em> , and you would eat διὰ προσκόμματος to <em> yourselves</em> . De Wette, al., understand τὴν συν ., <em> all through</em> , of the <em> conscience of another</em> , and apply to all the explanation of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:29">1 Corinthians 10:29</span> . But as Meyer well observes, no reader could possibly refer τὴν συνείδ . to any one but himself, <em> no other person having been mentioned</em> , until <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:28">1 Corinthians 10:28</span> , where ἐκεῖνον τὸν μηνύσαντα is introduced, and τὴν συνείδησιν is to be referred (but even then not without <em> special explanation given</em> ) to the <em> new</em> subject.</p>
