<p><strong> 29</strong> .] Explanation of the last διὰ τὴν συνείδησιν , as meaning <em> not your own</em> , but <em> that of the informer</em> . True to his interpretation (see above), De W. supposes τοῦ ἑτέρου not to refer to τὸν μηνύσαντα , but to ‘ <em> your weak Christian brother</em> ;’ but then how very harsh and clumsy are the various references to understood persons; and how simple, on the other interpretation, is the reference in each case of τὴν συν . to the subject of the clause.

<p><strong> ἵνα τί γάρ</strong> ] <strong> For why is my freedom judged by a conscience not mine own?</strong> i.e. ‘ <em> Why should I be to treated</em> (hazard by my actions such treatment) <em> that the exercise of my Christian freedom, eating as I do and giving thanks, should become matter of condemnation to another, who conscientiously disapproves of it</em> ?’ <strong> If</strong> (no copula) <strong> I partake thankfully</strong> ([not, as E. V., ‘ <em> by grace</em> ’] dat. of the manner, cf. Soph. Antig. 616, σοφίᾳ γὰρ ἔκ του κλεινὸν ἔπος πέφανται , and Bernhardy, Syntax, p.101), <strong> why am I to be spoken ill of for that for which I give thanks</strong> ? These words have been misunderstood. It has been generally supposed that the Apostle is <em> impressing a duty</em> , not to <em> give occasion</em> for the condemnation of their liberty by another’s conscience. But the ground on which he is <em> here</em> arguing, is the unfitness, absurdity, <em> injustice to oneself</em> and the cause of God, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:31">1 Corinthians 10:31</span> , of <em> so acting as to be condemned</em> for that in which a man not only allows himself, but for which he <em> gives thanks to God</em> . The sentiment is the same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:16">Romans 14:16</span> , μὴ βλασφημείσθω ὑμῶν τὸ ἀλαθόν .
