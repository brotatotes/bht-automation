<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] They had what answered to the one Christian sacrament, Baptism: now the Apostle shews that they were not without a symbolic correspondence to the other, the Lord’s Supper. The two elements in this Christian sacrament were anticipated in their case by the manna and the miraculous stream from the rock: these elements, in their case, as well as ours, symbolizing THE BODY AND BLOOD OF CHRIST. The whole passage is a standing testimony, incidentally, but <em> most providentially</em> , given by the great Apostle to the <em> importance</em> of the <em> Christian sacraments</em> , as <em> necessary to membership of Christ</em> , and <em> not mere signs or remembrances</em> : and an inspired protest against those who, whether as individuals or sects, would lower their dignity, or deny their necessity.

<p><strong> βρῶμα πνευματικὸν</strong> κ.τ.λ. ] The manna is thus called, from its being no mere physical production, but miraculously given by God the work of His Spirit. Thus Isaac is called, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:29">Galatians 4:29</span> , <strong> ὁ κατὰ πνεῦμα</strong> γεννηθείς , in opposition to Ishmael, ὁ κατὰ σάρκα γεννηθείς . Josephus calls the manna θεῖον βρῶμα καὶ παράδοξον , Antt. iii. 1. 6: and in Ps. 77:24, it is said ἄρτον οὐρανοῦ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς .

<p>We can scarcely avoid recognizing in these words a tacit reference to our Lord’s discourse, or at all events to the substanee of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:31-58">John 6:31-58</span> . “For the sense of πνευματικός , as ‘ <em> typical</em> ,’ ‘seen in the light of the spirit,’ cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+11:8">Revelation 11:8</span> , ἥτις καλεῖται πνευματικῶς Σόδομα .” Stanley.</p>
