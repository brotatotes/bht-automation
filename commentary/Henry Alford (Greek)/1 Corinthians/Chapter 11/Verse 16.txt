<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] Cuts off the subject, already abundantly decided, with a settlement of any possible difference, by appeal to universal apostolic and ecclesiastic custom. <strong> But if any man seems to be contentious</strong> (i.e. ‘if any arises who appears to dispute the matter, who seems not satisfied with the <em> reasons</em> I have given, but is still disputatious;’ this is the only admissible sense of δοκεἶ in this construction: see reff.: for the meaning, ‘ <em> if it pleases any one,</em> ’ &amp;c. would require τινι δοκεῖ : and ‘ <em> if any one thinks that he may</em> ,’ &amp;c. would not agree with φιλονεικεῖν , which is in itself <em> wrong</em> ).

<p><strong> τοιαύτην συνήθειαν</strong> ] The best modern Commentators, e.g. Meyer and De Wette, agree with Chrys. in understanding this, τοιαύτ . συνήθ ., ὥστε φιλονεικεῖν κ . ἐρίζειν κ . ἀντιτάττεσθαι . p. 235. And so Ambrose, Beza, Calvin, Estius, Calov., al. But surely it would be very unlikely, that after <em> so long a treatment of a particular subject</em> , the Apostle should wind up all by merely a censure of a fault <em> common</em> to their behaviour on <em> this and all the other</em> matters of dispute. Such a rendering seems to me almost to <em> stultify the conclusion</em> : ‘If any will dispute about it still, remember that it is neither our practice, nor that of the Churches, <em> to dispute</em> .’ It would seem to me, but for the weighty names on the other side, hardly to admit of a question, that the συνήθεια alludes to <em> the practice</em> (see ref. John) <em> of women praying uncovered</em> . So Theodoret, Grot. Michaelis, Rosenm., Billroth, Olsh., al., and Theophyl. altern. He thus cuts off all further disputation on the matter by <em> appealing to universal Christian usage</em> : and to make the appeal more solemn, adds <strong> τοῦ θεοῦ</strong> to αἱ ἐκκλ ., the assemblies which are held in honour of and for prayer to God, and are <em> His own Churches</em> . Obs. <strong> αἱ</strong> ἐκκλησί <strong> αι</strong> , not <strong> ἡ</strong> ἐκκλησί <strong> α</strong> . The <em> plurality of independent testimonies to the absence of the custom</em> , is that on which the stress is laid. This appeal, ‘to THE CHURCHES,’ was much heard again at the Reformation: but has since been too much forgotten. See, on the influence of this passage on the Christian church, the general remarks of Stanley, edn. 2, pp. 198 200.</p>
