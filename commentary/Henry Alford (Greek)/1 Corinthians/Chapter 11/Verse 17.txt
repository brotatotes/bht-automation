<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] Refers back to what has been said since <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:2">1 Corinthians 11:2</span> , and forms a transition to what is yet to be said. <strong> But this</strong> (viz. <em> what has gone before</em> , respecting the <em> veiling of women</em> ; not, as Chrys., Theophyl, Grot., Bengel, al., that which follows: see below) <strong> I command you</strong> (not ‘ <em> announce to you,</em> ’ nor ‘ <em> declare to you from report</em> ,’ which are senses of παραγγ . unknown to the N. T., where it only means ‘ <em> to command</em> ,’ ‘to deliver <em> by way of precept</em> :’ see reff., and ch. 1Co 7:10 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:11">1 Thessalonians 4:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:4">2 Thessalonians 3:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:6">2 Thessalonians 3:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:10">2 Thessalonians 3:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:12">2 Thessalonians 3:12</span> . This makes it hardly possible to refer τοῦτο to <em> what follows</em> ; for if so, some definite command should immediately succeed) <strong> not praising</strong> (refers to the ἐπαινῶ of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:2">1 Corinthians 11:2</span> , and <em> excepts what has been said since</em> from that category); <strong> because you come together not for the better</strong> (so that edification results) <strong> but for the worse</strong> (so that propriety is violated, and the result is to the hindering of the faith). These last words ὅτι … συνέρχ , are introduced with a manifest view to include <em> more</em> than the subject hitherto treated, and to <em> prepare the way</em> for other abuses of their assemblies to be noticed.</p>
