<p><strong> 19.</strong> ] <strong> δεῖ</strong> , in the divine appointment, the ἵνα which follows expressing <em> God’s purpose</em> thereby. Our Lord had said ἀνάγκη ἐλθεῖν τὰ σκάνδαλα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:7">Matthew 18:7</span> : and Justin Martyr, Tryph. 35, p. 132, quotes among His sayings prophetic of division in the church, ἔσονται σχίσματα κ . αἱρέσεις . From the pointed manner in which δεῖ γὰρ <strong> καὶ αἱρέσεις</strong> <strong> …</strong> is said, I should be inclined to think that the Apostle <em> tacitly referred to the same saying of our Lord</em> : <strong> for there must be</strong> (not only dissensions, but) <strong> even heresies</strong> (not in the ecclesiastical or doctrinal sense, as Pelag., Est., Calv., Beza, see reff., but indicating a further and more matured separation, where not only is there present dissension, as in the Agapæ, but a deliberate choice and maintenance of party distinction. It does not appear, in spite of all that has been written in Germany on the supposed parties of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:10">1 Corinthians 1:10</span> , that such separations had yet taken place among the Corinthians. Nor even in Clement’s Epistle, forty years after this, do we find any allusion to such, but only, as here, to a general spirit of dissension and variance, see chaps, 3 and 14, pp. 213, 257. Chrys. would refer αἱρ . <em> only to the Agapæ</em> : οὐ ταύτας λέγων τὰς τῶν δογμάτων , ἀλλὰ τὰς τῶν σχισμάτων τούτων , p. 242, and so Theophyl., Œc [51] But this hardly justifies the climax, δεῖ γὰρ καὶ αἱρ .) <strong> among you, that the approved [also]</strong> (i.e. as well as the other party, who would become manifest by their very conduct) <strong> may be made manifest among you</strong> ; viz. through a better and nobler spirit being shewn by them, than by the contentious and separatists.
