<p><strong> 22.</strong> ] <strong> For</strong> (a reason for the blame in the foregoing: this should not be: for) <strong> have you no houses, to eat, &amp;c.</strong> : meaning, ‘ <em> at home</em> is the place to satiate the appetite, <em> not the assembly of the brethren.</em> ’

<p><strong> Or do ye shew your contempt for</strong> (pres.) <strong> the congregation of God</strong> ( θεοῦ to express, as Bengel, ‘dignitatem ecclesiæ.’ This contempt was expressed by their <em> not sharing</em> with the congregation the portion which they brought), <strong> and put to shame those who have not</strong> (houses to eat and to drink in, and therefore come to the daily ἀγάπαι to be fed. There is no reason for rendering with the majority of Commentators τοὺς μὴ ἔχοντας , ‘the <em> poor</em> ;’ the μὴ ἔχοντας has a distinct reference to the ἔχετε before. Meyer refers in support of the meaning, ‘the poor,’ to Wetst. on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:13">2 Corinthians 8:13</span> , where nothing on the subject is found: De Wette, to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:11">Luke 3:11</span> , where the case is as here, the preceding ἔχων being referred to. The meaning is <em> allowable</em> , e.g. πρὸς γὰρ <strong> τὸν ἔχονθ</strong> <strong> ʼ</strong> ὁ φθόνος ἕρπει , Soph. Aj. 157: πρὸς τῶν ἐχόντων , Φοῖβε , τὸν νόμον τίθης , Eurip. Alc. 57: πότε μὲν ἐπ ʼ ἦμαρ εἶχον , εἶτ ʼ οὐκ εἶχον ἄν , where however it is qualified by ἐπ ʼ ἦμαρ )? <strong> What must I say to you? Shall I praise you in this matter? I praise you not</strong> . (See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:17">1 Corinthians 11:17</span> .)</p>
