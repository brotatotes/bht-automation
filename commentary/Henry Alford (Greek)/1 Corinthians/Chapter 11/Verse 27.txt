<p><strong> 27</strong> .] A <em> consequence</em> , from the nature of the ordinance being, <em> to proclaim the death of the Lord: the guilt of the unworthy participation of either of the elements</em> . The death of the Lord was brought about by the breaking of His body and shedding His blood: this Death we proclaim in the ordinance by the bread broken the wine poured out, of which we partake: whoever therefore shall <em> either</em> eat the bread <em> or</em> drink the cup of the Lord unworthily (see below 1Co 11:29 ) shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord: i.e. “ <em> crimini et pœnæ corporis et sanguinis Christi violati obnoxius erit</em> :” Meyer. Such an one proclaims the death of Christ, and yet <em> in an unworthy spirit</em> with no regard to that Death as <em> his</em> atonement, or a proof of Christ’s love: he proclaims that Death <em> as an indifferent person</em> : he therefore <em> partakes of the guilt of it</em> . Chrysostom strikingly says, σφαγὴν τὸ πρᾶγμα ἀπέφηνεν , οὐκέτι θυσίαν , p. 247. But the idea ὡς καὶ αὐτὸς ἐκχέας τὸ αἷμα , Theophyl. (and Chrys., τί δήποτε ; ὅτι ἐξέχεεν αὐτό , καὶ σφαγ ., &amp;c., as above), is irrelevant here, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:29">1 Corinthians 11:29</span> . The Romanists absurdly enough defend by this ἤ (the meaning of which is not to be changed to καί , as is <em> most unfairly</em> done in our E. V., and the completeness of the argument thereby destroyed) their practice of <em> communicating only in one kind</em> . Translated into <em> common language</em> , and applied to the ordinary sustenance of the body, their reasoning stands thus: ‘Whoever eats to excess, <em> or</em> drinks to excess, is guilty of sin: <em> therefore</em> eating, without drinking, will sustain life.’</p>
