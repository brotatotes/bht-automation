<p><strong> 29.</strong> ] <strong> For he who eats and drinks</strong> (scil. of the bread and of the cup: certainly not, as Meyer, ‘the <em> mere eater and drinker</em> , he who partakes as a mere act of eating and drinking,’ which is harsh to the last degree, and refuted by the parallel, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:27">1 Corinthians 11:27</span> . ἀναξίως is spurious, see var. readd.) <strong> eats and drinks judgment to himself</strong> (i.e. brings on himself judgment by eating and drinking. κρῖμα , as is evident by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:30-32">1 Corinthians 11:30-32</span> , is not ‘ <em> damnation</em> ’ ( κατάκριμα ), as rendered in our E. V., a mistranslation, which has done infinite mischief), <strong> not appreciating</strong> ( <em> dijudicans</em> , Vulg. μὴ ἐξετάζων , μὴ ἐννοῶν ὡς χρή , τὸ μέγεθος τῶν προκειμένων , μὴ λογιζόμενος τὸν ὄγκον τῆς δωρεᾶς . Chrys. Hom. xxviii. p. 251) <strong> the Body</strong> (scil. of the Lord: here standing for the <em> whole</em> of that which is symbolized by the Bread and the Cup, <em> the Body and Blood</em> . The mystery of these, spiritually present in the elements, he, not being spiritual, <em> does not appreciate</em> : and therefore, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:27">1 Corinthians 11:27</span> , falls under the divine judgment, as trifling with the death of Christ. The interpretation of Stanley, “not discerning that the body of the Lord is in himself and in the Christian society, and that it is as the body of the Lord, or as a member of that body, that ha partakes of the bread,” is surely somewhat farfetched, after τοῦτό μου ἐστὶν τὸ σῶμα , 1Co 11:24 ).</p>
