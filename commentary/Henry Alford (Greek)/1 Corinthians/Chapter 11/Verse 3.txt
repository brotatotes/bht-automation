<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] “It appears, that the Christian women at Corinth claimed for their sex an equality with the other, taking occasion by the doctrine of Christian freedom and abolition of sexual distinctions in Christ ( Gal 3:28 ). The gospel unquestionably did much for the emancipation of women, who in the East and among the Ionian Greeks (not among the Dorians and the Romans) were kept in unworthy dependence. Still this was effected in a quiet and gradual manner; whereas in Corinth they seem to have taken up the cause of female independence somewhat too eagerly. The women over-stepped the bounds of their sex, in coming forward to pray and to prophesy in the assembled church with uncovered heads. Both of these the Apostle disapproved, as well their coming forward to pray and to prophesy, as their removing the veil: here however he blames the latter practice only, and reserves the former till ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:34">1 Corinthians 14:34</span> . In order to confine the women to their true limits, he reminds them of their subjection to the <em> man</em> , to whom again he assigns his place in the spiritual order of creation, and traces this precedence up to God Himself.” De Wette.

<p><strong> παντὸς ἀνδρός</strong> ] ‘of every <em> Christian</em> man’ (as Chrys., al., Meyer, De W.), certainly, and for such the Apostle was writing: but not <em> only</em> of every Christian man: the Headship of Christ is <em> over all things</em> to His Church, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:22">Ephesians 1:22</span> , and thus He is Head of <strong> every man</strong> . The word κεφαλή in each case means the head <em> next above</em> . This must be borne in mind, for Christ is THE HEAD of the Christian <em> woman</em> , as well as of the Christian <em> man</em> . God is the Head of Christ, not <em> only</em> according to His human Nature: the Son is, <em> in his Sonship</em> , necessarily <em> subordinate to the Father</em> : see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:23">1 Corinthians 3:23</span> , note, and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:28">1 Corinthians 15:28</span> . From χριστός , the order <em> descends</em> first: then, in order to complete the whole, <em> ascends</em> up to God.

<p>Observe that though ( Gal 3:28 ) the distinction of the sexes is <em> abolished</em> in Christ, <em> as far as the offer of and standing in grace</em> is concerned, yet for <em> practical purposes</em> , and for <em> order</em> and <em> seemliness</em> , it <em> subsists</em> and <em> must be observed</em> .</p>
