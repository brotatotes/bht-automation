<p><strong> 31.</strong> ] <strong> δέ</strong> contrasts with this state of sicknesses and deaths: <em> it might be otherwise</em> . This <strong> διεκρινόμεθα</strong> (parallel with δοκιμαζέτω before) should be rendered by the <em> same word</em> as διακρίνων before, the idea being the same. ‘ <em> Appreciate,</em> ’ if etymologically understood, is the nearest to the meaning: in Latin <em> dijudico</em> , which the Vulg. has, is an excellent rendering, preserving also the ‘judico,’so essential to the following clause. In the E. V. ‘ <em> If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged,</em> ’ the tenses are wrong: it should be, ‘ <em> If we had judged ourselves, we should not have been judged</em> :’ ‘no such punishments would have befallen us.’

<p>Thus I wrote in some former editions: and so also Stanley. But this collocation of the (imperfect) tenses may be rendered either way. Donaldson, Gr. Gr., p. 204, renders εἴ τι εἶχεν , ἐδίδου ἄν , ‘ <em> si quid haberet, daret</em> :’ and so we have it in Æschyl. Suppl. 244, καὶ τἄλλα πόλλ ʼ ἐπεικάσαι δίκαιον ἦν , εἰ μὴ παρόντι φθόγγος ἦν ὁ σημανῶν : Æschin. Ctes. p. 86, εἰ δ ʼ ἦν ἀναγκαῖον ῥηθῆναι , οὐ Δημοσθένους ἦν ὁ λόγος : and other places (Bernhardy, p. 376). But as certainly, we find the other sense: e.g. Herod. iii. 25, of Cambyses, εἰ … ἀπῆγε ὀπίσω τὸν στρατὸν … ἦν ἂν σοφὸς ἀνήρ . So that the E. V. may <em> here</em> be kept, if thought desirable. In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:46">John 5:46</span> , our translators have adopted the other rendering: ‘Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me:’ but in ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:39">John 8:39</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:42">John 8:42</span> , have rendered as here.</p>
