<p><strong> 10.</strong> <strong> ἐνεργ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> δυν</strong> .] <strong> operations of miraculous powers</strong> (in general).
	</p>
<p><strong> προφητεία</strong> ] <strong> speaking in the Spirit</strong> . Meyer gives an excellent definition of it: “discourse flowing from the revelation and impulse of the Holy Spirit, which, not being attached to any particular office in the church, but improvised, disclosed the depths of the human heart and of the divine counsel, and thus was exceedingly effectual for the enlightening, exhortation, and consolation of believers, and the winning of unbelievers. The <em> prophet</em> differs from the <em> speaker with tongues</em> .… in that he speaks <em> with the understanding</em> , not ecstatically: from the διδάσκαλος , thus: ὁ μέν προφητεύων πάντα ἀπὸ τοῦ πνεύματος φθέγγεται · ὁ δὲ διδάσκων ἐστὶν ὅπου καὶ ἐξ οἰκείας διαλέγεται , as Chrys. on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span> .” (Hom. xxxii. p. 286.)
	</p>
<p><strong> διακρίσεις πν</strong> .] <strong> discernings of spirits:</strong> i.e. the power of distinguishing between the operation of the Spirit of God and the evil spirit, or the unassisted human spirit: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span> , and compare προσέχοντες πνεύμασιν πλάνοις , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span> . The exercise of this power is alluded to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:29">1 Corinthians 14:29</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> γένη</strong> <strong> γλωσσῶν</strong> ] <strong> kinds of tongues</strong> , i.e. the power of uttering, in ecstasy, as the mouthpiece of the Spirit, prayer and praise in <em> languages unknown to the utterer</em> , or even in a <em> spiritual language unknown to man</em> . See this subject dealt with in the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span> , and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:2">1 Corinthians 14:2</span> ff.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἑρμηνεία γλωσσῶν</strong> ] the power of <em> giving a meaning to what was thus ecstatically spoken</em> . This was not always resident in the speaker himself: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:13">1 Corinthians 14:13</span> .</p>
