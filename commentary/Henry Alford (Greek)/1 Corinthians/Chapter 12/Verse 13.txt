<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] This shewn from our being <em> baptized into one</em> body, and <em> receiving one</em> Spirit. <strong> For in</strong> (see on 1Co 12:9 ) <strong> one Spirit also</strong> (the emphasis on ἑνὶ πν ., to which words καί belongs) <strong> we all were baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or freemen; and we all were made to drink of one Spirit</strong> (or, ‘ <em> all watered by one Spirit</em> ,’ viz. the <em> water of baptism</em> , here taken as identical with the Spirit whose influence accompanied it). So (understanding the whole verse of <em> baptism</em> ) Chrys., Theophyl., Œc [56] , Rückert, Meyer, De Wette. Luther, Beza, Calv., Estius, Grot., al., refer the latter half to the <em> Lord’s Supper:</em> and this is <em> mentioned</em> by Chrys. and Theophyl.: Bilhoth and Olsh. to the abiding influence of the Spirit in strengthening and refreshing. But the aor. <strong> ἐποτίσθημεν</strong> , referring to a <em> fact gone by</em> , is fatal to both these latter interpretations: besides that it would be <em> harsh</em> to understand even <strong> εἰς</strong> ἓν πν . ἐποτίσθ . (see var. readd.) and <em> impossible</em> to understand <strong> ἓν πν</strong> . ἐποτ ., of the cup in the Lord’s Supper.
