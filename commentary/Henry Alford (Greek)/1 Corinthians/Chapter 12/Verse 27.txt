<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] <em> Application of all that has been said of the physical body, to the Corinthians as the mystical body of Christ:</em> and to <em> individuals</em> among them, as <em> members in particular</em> , i.e. each according to his allotted part in the body. <em> Each church</em> is said to be <em> the body of Christ</em> , as each is said to be <em> the temple of God</em> (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span> , note): not that there are many bodies or many temples; but that each church is an image of the whole aggregate, a microcosm, having the same characteristics. Chrys. would understand ἐκ μέρους ὅτι ἡ ἐκκλησία ἡ παρ ʼ ὑμῖν μέρος ἐστὶ τῆς πανταχοῦ κειμένης ἐκκλησίας , καὶ τοῦ σώματος τοῦ διὰ πασῶν συνισταμένον τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν (Hom. xxxii. p. 285): but this, though true, does not appear to have been here before the Apostle, only <em> the whole Corinthian church as the body of Christ</em> , and its individual components as members, each in his appointed place.</p>
