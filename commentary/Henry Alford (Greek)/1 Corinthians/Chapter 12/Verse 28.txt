<p><strong> 28.</strong> ] <em> The divine disposition of the members in the spiritual body</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> οὓς μέν</strong> was apparently intended to be followed by οὓς (or ἄλλους ) δέ , but meanwhile another arrangement, πρῶτον , δεύτ ., τρίτ ., occurs to the Apostle, and οὓς μέν is left uncorrected, standing alone. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span> , where τοὺς μέν is followed by τοὺς δέ , regularly.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν τῇ ἐκκλ</strong> .] <strong> in the (universal) church</strong> , a sense more frequently found in the Epistle to the Ephesians, than in any other part of St. Paul’s writings.
	</p>
<p><strong> πρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀποστόλους</strong> ] Not merely <em> the Twelve</em> are thus designated, but they and others who bore the same name and had equal power, e.g. Paul himself, and Barnabas, and James the Lord’s brother: see also note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:7">Romans 16:7</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> προφ</strong> .] See above, on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10">1 Corinthians 12:10</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> διδασκάλους</strong> ] See reff.: those who had the gift of expounding and unfolding doctrine and applying it to practice, the λόγος σοφίας and the λόγος γνώσεως .
	</p>
<p><strong> δυνάμεις</strong> ] He here passes to the <em> abstract</em> nouns from the <em> concrete</em> , perhaps because no definite class of persons was endowed with each of the following, but they were promiscuously granted to all orders in the church: more probably, however, <em> without any assignable reason;</em> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:6-8">Romans 12:6-8</span> , he passes from the abstract to the concrete.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀντιλήμψεις</strong> ] i.e. ἀντέχεσθαι τῶν ἀσθενῶν and the like, as Chrys. forming one department of the διακονίαι of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:5">1 Corinthians 12:5</span> ; as do also <strong> κυβερνήσεις</strong> , a higher department, that of the presbyters or bishops the <em> direction</em> of the various churches.
	</p>
<p><strong> γένη γλωσσῶν</strong> ] εἶδες ποῦ τέθεικε τουτὶ τὸ χάρισμα , καὶ πῶς πανταχοῦ τὴν ἐσχάτην αὐτῷ νέμει τάξιν ; Chrys. p. 287. There certainly seems to be intention in placing this <em> last</em> in rank: but I am persuaded that we must not, with Meyer, seek for a <em> classified</em> arrangement: here, as above, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:7-11">1 Corinthians 12:7-11</span> , it seems rather <em> suggestive than logical:</em> the χαρ . ἰαμ . naturally suggesting the ἀντιλήμψεις , and those again, the assistances to carry out the work of the church, as naturally bringing in the κυβερνήσεις , the government and guidance of it.</p>
