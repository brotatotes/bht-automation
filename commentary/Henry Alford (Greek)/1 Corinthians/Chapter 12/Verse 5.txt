<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] <strong> and there are varieties of ministries</strong> (appointed <em> services</em> in the church, in which as their channels of manifestation the χαρίσματα would work), <strong> and the same Lord</strong> (Christ, the Lord of the church, whose it is to appoint all ministrations in it. These διακονίαι must not be narrowed to the <em> ecclesiastical orders</em> , but kept commensurate in extent with the gifts which are to find scope by their means, see 1Co 12:7-10 ): <strong> and varieties of operations</strong> (effects of divine ἐνέργειαι : not to be limited to <em> miraculous</em> effects, but understood again commensurately with the gifts of whose working they are the results), <strong> and the same GOD. Who works all of them in all persons</strong> (all the χαρίσματα in all who are gifted). Thus we have GOD THE FATHER, the First Source and Operator of all spiritual influence in all: GOD THE SON, the Ordainer in His Church of all ministries by which this influence may be legitimately brought out for edification: GOD THE HOLY GHOST, dwelling and working in the church, and effectuating in each man such measure of His gifts as He sees fit.</p>
