<p><strong> λόγος σοφίας</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> λόγος γνώσεως</strong> ] <em> What is the distinction</em> ? According to Neander, <strong> σοφία</strong> is the <em> skill</em> , which is able to reduce the whole <em> practical</em> Christian life into its due order in accordance with its foundation principles (see Pfl. u. Leit. p. 247); <strong> γνῶσις</strong> , the <em> theoretical insight</em> into divine things: and similarly Olsh. and Billroth. But Bengel, al., take them conversely, <strong> γνώσ</strong> . for the practical, <strong> σοφ</strong> <strong> .</strong> for the theoretical. Both, as De W. remarks, have their grounds in usage: σοφία is <em> practical</em> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:9">Colossians 1:9</span> , as is γνῶσις <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:14">Romans 15:14</span> , but they are <em> theoretical</em> respectively in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:17">1 Corinthians 1:17</span> ff. and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span> . Estius explains <strong> λόγος σοφίας</strong> , ‘gratiam de iis quæ ad doctrinam religionis ac pietatis spectant disserendi ex causis supremis,’ as ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span> f.: and <strong> λόγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γνώσεως</strong> , he says, “gratia est disserendi de rebus Christianæ religionis, ex iis quæ sunt humanæ scientiæ vel experientiæ.” Meyer says, “ σοφία is the <em> higher Christian wisdom</em> (see on ch. 1Co 2:6 ) in and of itself; so that discourse which expresses its truths, makes them clear, applies them, &amp;c. is λόγος σοφίας . But this does not necessarily imply the speculative penetration of these truths, the philosophical treatment of them by deeper and more scientific investigation, in other words, γνῶσις : and discourse which aims at this is λόγος γνώσεως .” This last view is most in accordance with the subsequently recognized meaning of γνῶσις and γνωστικός , and with the Apostle’s own use of σοφία in the passage referred to, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span> .
