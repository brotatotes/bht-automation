<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] The double accus. after ψωμίζω is found in the reff. to LXX: but here the accus. of the <em> person</em> is omitted, and left to be supplied from the context: <strong> If I bestow in food all my substance</strong> . See the quotation from Coleridge in Stanley’s note.

<p><strong> παραδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τὸ σῶμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> μ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἵνα καυθ</strong> .] So ref. Dan., καὶ παρέδωκαν τὰ σώματα αὐτῶν εἰς ἐμπυρισμόν , LXX. Theod.: see also 2Ma 7:37 . He evidently means <em> in self-sacrifice</em> : for country, or friends. Both the deeds mentioned in this verse are such as ordinarily are held to be the fruits of love, but they may be done <em> without it</em> , and if so, are worthless. Stanley prefers καυχήσωμαι and Lachmann has edited it. The objections to it seem to me to be, (1) It leaves παραδῶ standing in a very vague and undefined meaning “deliver, <em> to what</em> ?” (2) It introduces an irrelevant and confusing element, a <em> boastful motive</em> , into a set of hypotheses which put forward merely an act or set of acts on the one side, and the absence of love on the other: and indeed, worse still, (3) it makes an hypothesis which would reduce the self-sacrifice to nothing, and would <em> imply</em> the absence of love; and so would render ἀγάπην δὲ μὴ ἔχω unnecessary.</p>
