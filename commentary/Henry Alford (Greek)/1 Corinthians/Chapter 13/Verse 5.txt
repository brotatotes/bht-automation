<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] <strong> οὐκ ἀσχημονεῖ</strong> seems to be <em> general</em> , without particular reference to the disorders in public speaking with tongues. τὰ ἑαυ <strong> τῆς</strong> Love is so personified, as here to he identified with the man possessing the grace, who does not seek τὰ ἑαυ <strong> τοῦ</strong> : see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:33">1 Corinthians 10:33</span> .

<p><strong> οὐ λογίζ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τὸ κακόν</strong> ] <strong> imputeth not (the) evil:</strong> οὐδὲν πονηρὸν οὐ μόνον οὐ κατασκενάζει ἀλλ ʼ οὐδὲ ὑποπτεύει κατὰ τοῦ φιλουμένου , Chrys. Hom. xxxiii. p. 304: and so Theod., Theophyl., Estius, Rückert, Meyer: and this is better and more accordant with the sense of λογίζεται , than the more general rendering ‘ <em> thinketh no evil</em> .’ And we must not overlook the article, which seems here to have the force of implying that the evil actually exists, ‘ <em> the evil</em> ’ which is, but Love does not impute it. So Theodoret, συγγινώσκει τοῖς ἐπταισμένοις , οὐκ ἐπὶ κακῷ σκόπῳ ταῦτα γεγενῆσθαι ὑπολαμβάνων .</p>
