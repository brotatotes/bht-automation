<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] <strong> έν τῷ νόμῳ</strong> , as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:34">John 10:34</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:34">John 12:34</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:25">John 15:25</span> ; where the <em> Psalms</em> are thus quoted. The passage stands in the LXX: διὰ φαυλισμὸν χειλέων , διὰ γλώσσης ἑτέρας ὅτι λαλήσουσι τῷ λαῷ τούταῳ … κ . οὐκ ἠθέλησαν ἀκούειν . The context is thus: The scoffers in Jerusalem (see 1Co 14:14 ) are introduced as scorning the simplicity of the divine commands, which were line upon line, precept upon precept, as if to children ( 1Co 14:9-10 ). Jehovah threatens them that, since they would not hear these simple commands, He would speak to them by men of other tongues, viz. the Assyrians, their captors.

<p>Here as in many other cases, the historical sense is not so much considered, as the aptness of the expressions used for illustrating the matter in hand; viz. that belief would not be produced in the unbelieving by speaking to them in strange tongues. The ὅτι answers in the LXX to כִּי , ‘ <em> for</em> ;’ or ‘ <em> yea verily</em> ,’ as Louth. It forms part of the citation, not of the text.

<p><strong> ἐν ἑτερ</strong> .] <strong> in</strong> (in the person of) <strong> men of other tongues</strong> : Heb. <em> with another tongue</em> ; and it is placed <em> second</em> . The Apostle personifies it and gives it the prominence.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν χ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἑτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> in</strong> (as speaking in, using as the organ of speech) <strong> lips of others</strong> (strangers, see reff.): Heb. <em> in</em> (by) <em> stammerers of lip</em> : Louth, <em> with a stammering lip</em> .

<p><strong> τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ</strong> ] in Isa., <em> the Israelites</em> : here taken generally for the unbelieving world.

<p><strong> οὐδ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> οὕτως εἰσακούσ</strong> .] This is the point of the passage for St. Paul’s argument: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:23">1 Corinthians 14:23</span> : “for them, and not for us: but <em> even for them</em> , profitless in the main:” <em> not even under such circumstances will they listen to me: even this sign</em> will be for them ineffectual.</p>
