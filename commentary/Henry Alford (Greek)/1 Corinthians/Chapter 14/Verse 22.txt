<p><strong> 22.</strong> ] <strong> ὥστε</strong> , viz. according to the words of the foregoing prophetic passage.
	</p>
<p><strong> αἱ γλ</strong> .] <strong> the tongues</strong> , in the <em> then</em> acceptation of the term. He is not interpreting the prophecy, nor alluding to the tongues <em> there</em> spoken of, but returns back to the subject in hand <em> the tongues</em> about which his argument was concerned.
	</p>
<p><strong> εἰς σημ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εἰσίν</strong> <strong> ] are for a sign</strong> : but there is no emphasis on the words, the meaning being much the same as if εἰς σημεῖον were omitted, and it stood ὥστε αἱ γλ . εἰσὶν οὐ τοῖς π . Not seeing this, Commentators have differed widely about the meaning of σημεῖον . So Chrys. (Hom. xxxvi. p. 335): εἰς σημεῖον , τουτέστιν , εἰς ἔκπληξιν : Bengel: ‘quo allecti auscultare debebant:’ Calvin: ‘linguæ, quatenus in signum datæ sunt:’ &amp;c. &amp;c. All dwelling on the word σημεῖου would introduce an element foreign to the argument, which is, <em> that tongues are</em> (a sign) <em> for the unbelieving, not for the believing</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> οὐ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πιστ</strong> .] <strong> not to men who believe, but to unbelievers</strong> , i.e. ‘men who do not believe:’ not, as Neander, Billroth, Rückert, and in substance De Wette, ‘men who <em> will</em> not believe:’ ἄπιστος must be kept to the same sense through this whole passage, and plainly by 1Co 14:23 it is <em> not one who</em> will <em> not believe</em> , but <em> an unbeliever open to conviction</em> . The mistake has been occasioned by regarding <em> those to whom the prophecy was directed</em> , and interpreting Paul by Isaiah, instead of by himself.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἡ δὲ προφ</strong> .] scil. ἐστίν , as Meyer, or εἰς σημ . ἐστίν , as De Wette: it seems to me to import little which we supply, seeing that εἰς σημ . is of so very slight weight in the preceding clause. If emphatic meaning had been attached to σημεῖον <em> as belonging to</em> αἱ γλ ., we must not have supplied it here: but if it be a mere indifferent word, to be interpreted according to the sense in which αἱ γλ . and ἡ προφ . were σημεῖα , there can be no objection to it here: and the uniformity of construction seems to require it.
	</p>
<p>Both here and above, <strong> τοῖς ἀπίστ</strong> . and the other are datives <em> commodi</em> <strong> for</strong> , not ‘ <em> to</em> ,’ <strong> the unbelieving</strong> . ἡ προφητεία <em> was</em> a sign <em> to</em> the unbelieving, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:24-25">1 Corinthians 14:24-25</span> .
	</p>
<p>Prophecy, i.e. <em> inspired and intelligent exposition of the word and doctrine</em> , was eminently <em> for</em> believers, but, as below, would be also profitable <em> to</em> unbelievers, furnishing a token that God was truly among his assembled servants.</p>
