<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] <strong> οὖν</strong> , following up the axiom just laid down, by supposing a case = <strong> if then</strong> .… The first case put answers to the former half of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:22">1 Corinthians 14:22</span> ; the second, to the latter.

<p>The supposition is this: that all the (Corinthian) church is assembled, and all its members speak with tongues (not in a <em> tumultuary</em> manner that is not part of the present hypothesis, for if it were, it must apply equally to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:24">1 Corinthians 14:24</span> , which it clearly cannot: but that all have the gift, and are <em> in turn</em> exercising it): then ἰδιῶται , ‘ <em> plain</em> believers,’ persons unacquainted with the gift and its exercise, come in. It is obvious that the hypothesis of <em> all</em> being assembled, and <em> all</em> having the gift, must not be pressed to infer that no such ἰδιώτης could be found: no one hypothesizes thus rigidly. If any will have it so, then, as Meyer, we may suppose the ἰδιῶται to come <em> from another congregation</em> : but the whole difficulty seems to me mere trifling. The ἰδ . plainly cannot be, as De W. maintains, an <em> unbeliever</em> , for <em> his</em> case is separately mentioned. Such <strong> plain men</strong> , or perhaps a company of unbelievers, have come in: they have no understanding of what is going on: the γλῶσσαι sound to them an unmeaning jargon; and they come to the conclusion, ‘These men are mad;’ just as men <em> did infer</em> , on the day of Pentecost, that the speakers were <em> drunken</em> .</p>
