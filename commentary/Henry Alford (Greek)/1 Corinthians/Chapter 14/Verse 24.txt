<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] <strong> But if all</strong> (see above) <strong> prophesy</strong> (i.e. intelligibly lay forth, in the power of the Spirit, the Christian word and doctrine) <strong> and there enter any</strong> (singular <em> now</em> , setting forth that this would be the effect <em> in any case</em> : plural <em> before</em> , to shew that however many there might be, <em> not one could appreciate the gift)</em> <strong> unbeliever or plain man</strong> ( ἄπιστος <em> first now</em> , because the great stress is on the power of prophecy in its greatest achievement, the <em> conversion of the unbeliever</em> ; but ἰδιῶται was first <em> before</em> , because the stress there was on the unprofitableness of tongues, <em> not only to the </em> <em> ἄπιστοι</em> <em> , but to the</em> ἰδιῶται ), <strong> he is convicted by all</strong> (the inspired discourse penetrating, as below, into the depths of his heart, by <em> all</em> , i.e. by each in turn), <strong> he is searched into by all</strong> (each inspired speaker opening to him his character), <strong> the hidden things of his heart become manifest</strong> (those things which he had never before seen are revealed, his whole hitherto unrecognized personal character laid out. Instances of such revelations of a man to himself by powerful preaching have often occurred, even since the cessation of the prophetic gift): <strong> and thus</strong> (thus convicted, searched, revealed to himself: in such a state of mind) <strong> having fallen on his face, he will worship God, announcing</strong> ( <em> by that his act</em> , which is a public submission to the divine Power manifest among you: or, but not so well, <em> aloud</em> , by declaration of it in words) <strong> that of a truth</strong> (implying that previously he had regarded the presence of God among them as an idle tale; or, if a plain Christian, had not sufficiently realized it) <strong> God is among you</strong> (or in each of you: by His Spirit). In this last description the ἰδιώτης is thrown into the background, and (see above) the greater achievement of prophecy, the conviction and conversion of the ἄπιστος , is chiefly in view. “For a similar effect of the disclosure of a man’s secret self to himself, compare the fascination described as exercised by Socrates over his hearers by the ‘conviction’ and ‘judgment’ of his questions in the Athenian market-place. Grote’s Hist. of Greece, viii. 609 611.” Stanley.</p>
