<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] <em> Example of the unprofitableness of speaking with tongues without interpreting</em> , expressed in the first person as of himself.
	</p>
<p><strong> νῦν δέ</strong> ] ‘ <em> quod cum ita sit</em> ’ viz. that there is no edification without interpretation.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐὰν ἔλθω</strong> ] Chrys. understands the first person to imply ‘not even <em> I myself</em> should profit you,’ &amp;c. But then αὐτὸς ἐγώ or some expression similarly emphatic would have been used.
	</p>
<p>The second ἐάν is parallel to the first, not dependent on ὠφελήσω . It is the negative side of the supposition, as ἐὰν ἔλθω κ . τ . λ . was the affirmative. On this double apodosis Hermann remarks, Soph. Aj. 827, ‘Est enim hæc verborum complexio ex eo genere, cujus jam apud Homerum exempla inveniuntur, quod duplicem habet apodosin, alteram præmissam, sequentem alteram: quæ ratio ibi maxime apta est, ubi in magno animi motu, quasi non satis sit id quod præmissum est, aliud infertur secunda apodosi, quod gravius sit et fortius.’

<p><strong> ἢ ἐν ἀποκ</strong> …] It seems best here, with Estius, to understand ‘duo juga, ut conjugata sint revelatio et prophetia, ac rursus conjugata scientia et doctrina.’ So also Meyer, who observes that the ground of προφητεία is ἀποκάλυψις , and that of διδαχή , γνῶσις : the former being a <em> direct speaking in the Spirit,</em> and the latter a <em> laying forth by the aid of the Spirit</em> of knowledge acquired. Thus ἐν , as referred to ἀποκ . and γνώς ., denotes the <em> internal element</em> : as referred to προφ . and διδ ., the <em> external element,</em> of the spiritual activity.</p>
