<p><strong> 34, 35.</strong> ] <em> Regulatian prohibiting women to speak publicly in the church, and its grounds</em> . If <strong> ὡς</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> ἁγίων</strong> be placed at the beginning of this sentence, we must not, as Lachm. absurdly does, put a comma before τῶν ἁγίων , which would throw the emphasis on it and disturb the sense: and which besides would then be expressed ἁγίων γυναῖκες , or even ἁγίων αἱ γυναῖκες , but certainly not τῶν ἁγίων αἱ γυναῖκες .</p>
