<p><strong> 19</strong> .] Assuming this ἀπώλεια of the dead in Christ, the state of Christians is indeed miserable. It has perhaps not been enough seen that there are here <em> two emphases</em> , and that μόνον belongs to the aggregate of both. According to the ordinary interpretation, ‘If <em> in this life only</em> we have hope in Christ …,’ it would be implied that in reality we <em> shall have</em> hope in Christ in another state also, which would not agree with the perfect ἠλπικότες ἐσμέν . The right arrangement of the Greek gives the key to the sentence: εἰ ( ἐν τῇ ζωῇ ταύτῃ ἐν χριστῷ ἠλπικότες ἐσμὲν ) μόνον , ‘if all we have done is merely <em> having hoped in Christ in this life</em> ,’ ‘if it is there to end, and that hope have no result …’

<p>The perf. <strong> ἠλπικότες ἐσμ</strong> . implies the endurance of the hope through our lives.
