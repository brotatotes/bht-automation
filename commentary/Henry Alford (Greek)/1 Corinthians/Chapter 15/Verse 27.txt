<p><strong> 27</strong> .] <em> Scriptural proof of the above declaration</em> .

<p><strong> ὑπέταξ</strong> . viz., from the Psalm, GOD, <em> the Father</em> .

<p>See on the Psalm itself, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:6">Hebrews 2:6</span> ff. notes.

<p><strong> εἴπῃ</strong> , scil. ὁ θεός , the same subject as ὑπέταξεν . Meyer alone, as it seems to me, gives the right construction of ὅταν … ὑποτέτακται . “The aor. εἴπῃ must be rendered regularly, not in the <em> present</em> sense, but as a <em> futurum exactum</em> : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:26">Luke 6:26</span> ; Plato, Parm. p. 143, c ( τί δ ʼ ὅταν εἴπω οὐσία τε καὶ ἕν , ἆρα οὐκ ἀμφοτέρω ;), Ion, p. 535, B ( ὅταν εὖ εἴπῃς ἔπη καὶ ἐκπλήξῃς μάλιστα τοὺς θεωμένους ). The time referred to, is that when the as yet unfulfilled πάντα ὑπέταξεν shall be fulfilled and completed: hence it is no longer the aor., but the perf. ὑποτέτακται . The meaning then is: ‘when God, who in Psa 8:6 has announced the ὑπόταξις , shall hereafter have declared that this ὑπόταξις is <em> come to pass</em> ,’ … This <em> form</em> of expression was suggested to the Apostle by his having already expressed himself in the words of a <em> saying of God</em> .” I render then, <strong> But when God shall have declared that all things have been subjected to Him, it is evident that they have been subjected</strong> (ellipsis of the predicate of the foregoing sentence after δῆλον ὅτι and οἶδ ʼ ὅτι is common; so Plato, Gorg. p. 475, c, ‘ οὐκοῦν κακῷ ὑπερβάλλον τὸ ἀδικεῖν κάκιον ἂν εἴη τοῦ ἀδικεῖσθαι ,’ ‘ δῆλον δὴ ὅτι ,’ scil. κάκιον ἂν εἴη . Kühner, § 852, d) <strong> with the exception of Him who subjected all things to Him.</strong></p>
