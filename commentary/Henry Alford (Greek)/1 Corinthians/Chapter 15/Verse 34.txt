<p><strong> 34.</strong> <strong> ἐκνήψ</strong> <strong> .] Awake out of</strong> (your moral) <strong> intoxication</strong> , already possessing you by the influence of these men.
	</p>
<p><strong> δικαίως</strong> ] either, <strong> as is just, as you ought</strong> (Wahl, al.), or, <strong> in a proper manner</strong> (Olsh., al.), or, ἐπὶ συμωέροντι καὶ χρησίμῳ (Chrys. p. 382, al.), or <em> so as to be</em> <strong> δίκαιοι</strong> [i.e. so as to recover your righteousness, which you are in danger of losing], as E. V., <strong> Awake to righteousness</strong> . The last meaning is well defended by Dr. Peile from Thuc. i. 21: ἀπίστως ἐπὶ τὸ μυθῶδες ἐκνενικηκότα , ‘so as to become incredible;’ and seems to be the best. The aor. imper. ἐκνήψατε marks the quick momentary awaking; the pres. imper. μὴ ἁμαρτάνετε , on the other hand, the enduring practice of abstinence from sin (Meyer). But that this must not always be rigidly pressed, see Kühner, § 445. 2. Anm. 1.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀγνωσίαν</strong> ] The stress is on this word: <strong> for some</strong> (the τινές of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:12">1 Corinthians 15:12</span> , most probably, are hinted at, and the source of their error pointed out) <strong> have</strong> (are affected with) <strong> ignorance</strong> (an absence of all true knowledge) <strong> of God</strong> . See ref. to Wisd.
	</p>
<p><strong> πρὸς ἐντ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὑμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λ</strong> <strong> .</strong> shews that these τινές were ἐν ὑμῖν , not the heathen without: the existence of such in the Corinthian church was a disgrace to the whole.
	</p>
<p><strong> λαλᾶ</strong> <strong> ] I am speaking</strong> ; not merely <strong> I say this</strong> ; it refers to the spirit of the whole passage.</p>
