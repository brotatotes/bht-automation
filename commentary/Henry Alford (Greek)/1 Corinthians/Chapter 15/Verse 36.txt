<p><strong> 36</strong> .] Meyer would point this, ἄφρων σύ , ὃ σπείρεις …, because according to the common punctuation there is necessarily an emphasis on σύ , which the context does not allow. But on the other hand, it seems to me, there is an objection to the introduction of a new matter so lamely as by ὃ σπείρεις . Besides which, the emphatic σύ does not necessarily require any <em> other agency</em> to be emphatically set against it, but may imply an appeal to the objector’s <em> own</em> experience (as Billr. in Dr. Peile): ‘ <em> thou</em> say this, who art continually witness of the process, &amp;c.?’ And let it be remembered that we <em> have</em> another σπείρειν below, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:42-44">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</span> , which may be set against <em> thy sowing</em> . I retain therefore the stop at ἄφρων (nom. for voc. as freq. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:20">Luke 12:20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:25">Mark 9:25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:54">Luke 8:54</span> , al., and Winer, edn. 6, § 29. 2), and the emphasis on σύ . The similitude was used by our Lord of His own Resurrection, ref. John.

The same analogy was used by the Rabbis, but to prove that the dead would rise <em> clothed</em> : ‘ut triticum nudum sepelitur et multis vestibus ornaturm prodit, ita multo magis justi,’ &amp;c.</p>
