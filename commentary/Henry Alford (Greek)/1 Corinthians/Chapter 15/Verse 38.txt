<p><strong> 38.</strong> ] <strong> ἠθέλησεν</strong> , <em> willed</em> , viz. at the creation: the aor. setting forth the <em> one act</em> of the divine Will giving to the particular seed the particular development at first, which the species retains: whereas θέλει would imply a fresh act of the divine Will giving to every individual seed (not ἑκάστῳ τῶν σπερμάτων , but ἐκάστῳ σπέρματι , or rather ἑκάστῳ κόκκῳ ) his own body. But the <em> whole gift to the species</em> being God’s, to continue or withhold, the pres. δίδωσιν still holds good.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἑκάστ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τῶν σπερμ</strong> <strong> .] to each of the (kinds of) seed</strong> ; see above: τῶν is generic.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἵδιον σῶμα</strong> <strong> ] a body of its own</strong> . Such then being the case with all seeds, why should it be thought necessary that the <em> same body</em> should rise <em> as was sown</em> , or that God cannot give to each a resurrection-body, as in nature?</p>
