<p><strong> 43.</strong> <strong> ἐν ἀτιμίᾳ</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> ἐν δόξῃ</strong> <strong> ] in dishonour</strong> ( τί γὰρ εἰδεχθέστερον νεκροῦ διαῤῥυέντος ; Chrys. Hom. xli. p. 390. Cf. Xen. Mem. i. 2. 53, τῆς ψυχῆς ἐξελθούσης ,.… τὸ σῶμα τοῦ οἰκειοτάτου ἀνθρώπου τὴν ταχίστην ἐξενέγκαντες ἀφανίζουσιν , <strong> in glory</strong> : regarding, as throughout this argument (see on 1Co 15:23 ), only the <em> resurrection of the just</em> : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span> .

<p><strong> ἐν ἀσθενείᾳ</strong> <strong> ] in weakness</strong> , the characteristic of the lifeless body, which is relaxed and powerless. Chrys. understands ἀσθ . of its <em> inability to resist corruption</em> : De Wette would refer it to the previous state of pain and disease: but it seems better to understand it of the <em> powerlessness</em> of the corpse, contrasted with <strong> ἐν δυν</strong> <strong> ., in vigour,</strong> viz. the fresh and eternal energy of the new body free from disease and pain. “That which Grot. adds: ‘cum sensibus multis, quos nunc non intelligimus,’ is very likely in itself <em> true</em> , but is not implied in ἐν δυνάμει .” Meyer.</p>
