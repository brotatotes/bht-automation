<p>Meyer maintains that the only rendering of the words which is philologically allowable (the ordinary one, regarding πάντες ( μὲν ) οὐ as = οὐ πάντες ( μέν ), we shall not all sleep, being inadmissible, here and in other instances where it has been attempted, see Winer, edn. 6, § 26. 1), is this, ‘ <em> we all</em> (viz. as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span> , ἡμεῖς οἱ ζῶντες οἱ περιλειπόμενοι εἰς τὴν παρουσίαν τοῦ κυρίου , in which number the Apostle firmly believed that he himself should be, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span> ff. and notes) <em> shall not sleep, but shall all be changed</em> .’ But we may observe that this would commit the Apostle to the extent of believing that <em> not one Christian</em> would die before the παρουσία ; and that it is besides not necessary, for the emphasis is both times on πάντες ‘( <em> All of us</em> ) <em> shall not sleep, but</em> ( <em> all of us</em> ) <em> shall be changed</em> :’ i.e. ‘the sleep of death cannot be predicated of (all of us), but the resurrection-change <em> can</em> .’ See also Winer, § 61. 5 f, and Moulton’s note, p. 695.</p>
