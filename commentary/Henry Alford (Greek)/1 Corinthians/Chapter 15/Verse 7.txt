<p><strong> 7.</strong> <strong> Ἰακώβῳ</strong> ] Probably, from no distinguishing epithet being added, <em> the celebrated</em> James, <em> the brother of the Lord</em> : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:19">Galatians 1:19</span> . So Chrys.: ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ , τῷ ἀδελφῷ τῷ ἑαυτοῦ , p. 355. See notes on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:5">1 Corinthians 9:5</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:55">Matthew 13:55</span> , and the Prolegg. to the Epistle of James. On Wieseler’s view that this is the appearance on the road to Emmaus, see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:13">Luke 24:13</span> . This appearance cannot however be identical with that traditional one quoted by Jerome (from the Gospel according to the Hebrews), Catal. Script. Eccles. ii. vol. ii. p. 831 f.: “Juraverat enim Jacobus, se non comesturum panem ab illa hora qua biberat calicem Domini, donec videret eum resurgentem a mortuis.” This would imply that the appearance was very soon after the Resurrection, and before any of those to large collections of believers, in which James would naturally be present.

<p><strong> ἀποστ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πᾶσιν</strong> ] This is decisive for the much wider use of the term ἀπόστολος than as applying to the Twelve only: and a strong presumption that James, just mentioned, and evidently here and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:19">Galatians 1:19</span> , included among the ἀπόστολοι , was not one of the Twelve. Chrys. (ubi supra) extends the term to the Seventy of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:0">Luke 10:0</span> and others: ἦσαν γὰρ καὶ ἄλλοι ἀπόστολοι , ὡς οἱ ἑβδομήκοντα .</p>
