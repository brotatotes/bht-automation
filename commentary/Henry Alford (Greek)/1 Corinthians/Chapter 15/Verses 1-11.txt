<p><strong> 1 11</strong> .] The Apostle lays the foundation of his intended polemical argument in the historical fact of the RESURRECTION OF CHRIST. But he does not altogether <em> assume</em> this fact. He deals with its <em> evidence</em> , in relating minutely the various appearances of the Lord after His Resurrection, to <em> others</em> , and to <em> himself</em> . Then, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:12">1 Corinthians 15:12</span> , the <em> proclamation</em> of Christ’s Resurrection as the great fact attending the preaching of the gospel, is set against the denial of the Resurrection by some of them, and it is subsequently shewn that the two hang together, so that they who denied the one must be prepared to deny the other; and the consequences of this latter denial are pointed out. But it by no means follows, as De W. (in part) and Meyer have assumed, that the impugners were <em> not prepared</em> to deny the Resurrection of Christ.
	</p>
<p>The Apostle writes not only for <em> them</em> , but for the rest of the Corinthian believers, shewing them the historical certainty, and vital importance of Christ’s Resurrection, and its inseparable connexion with the doctrine which they were now tempted to deny.</p>
