<p><strong> 10.</strong> <strong> βλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἵνα ἀφόβ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] There must have been some special reason for this caution respecting Timothy, besides that assigned by Meyer, al., that he would naturally be depreciated as only a subordinate of Paul, whom so many of them opposed. His <em> youth</em> occurs to us, mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span> ; but even that is not enough, and would hardly be intended here, without some reference to it. De Wette’s conjecture may not be without foundation, that he was perhaps of a <em> timid disposition</em> . Meyer objects that we have no historical trace of this: but I think some are to be found in 1 Tim.: e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:22-23">1 Timothy 5:22-23</span> .
