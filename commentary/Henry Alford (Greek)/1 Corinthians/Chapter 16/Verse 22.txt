<p><strong> μαραναθά</strong> ] An Aramaic expression, מָרַן אֲתָא or מָרָנָא אֲתָא the (or <strong> our</strong> ) <strong> Lord cometh</strong> (or, <strong> is come</strong> , as Chrys., al., ὁ κυρ . ἡμ . <strong> ἦλθε</strong> : in 1Jn 4:2 the same Syriac form is used to express ἐληλυθότα ): probably unconnected with ἀνάθεμα : and added perhaps (Mey.) as recalling some remembrance of the time when Paul was among them: at all events, as a weighty watchword tending to recall to them the nearness of His coming, and the duty of being found ready for it: not added, as Rückert, to stamp genuineness on the letter, for why here rather than in other Epistles, especially as those who were to bear it were so well known?
