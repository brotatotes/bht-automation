<p><strong> τὰ βάθη</strong> ] see reff. There is a comparison here between the <em> Spirit of God</em> and the <em> spirit of a man</em> , which is further carried out in the next verse. And thus as the <em> spirit of a man</em> knows the βάθος of a man, all that is in him, so the <em> Spirit of God</em> searches and knows τὰ βάθη , the manifold and infinite depths, of God His Essence, His Attributes, His Counsels: and being τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἐν ἡμῖν , besides being τὸ πν . τοῦ θεοῦ (De Wette well observes that the Apostle purposely avoids using the expression τὸ πνεῦμα <strong> τὸ ἐν αὐτῷ</strong> of the <em> Spirit of God</em> , keeping the way open for the expression in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:12">1 Corinthians 2:12</span> , τὸ πν . τὸ <strong> ἐκ</strong> τοῦ θεοῦ ), <em> teaches us</em> according to our capacity, <em> those depths of God</em> .</p>
