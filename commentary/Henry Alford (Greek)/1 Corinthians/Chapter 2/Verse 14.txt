<p><strong> 14.</strong> ] He now prepares the way for shewing them that he could not give out the depths of this spiritual wisdom and eloquence to <em> them</em> , because they were <em> not fitted for it</em> , being carnal (ch. 1Co 3:1-4 ).

<p><strong> ψυχ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> δὲ ἄνθ</strong> .] The <em> animal</em> man, as distinguished from the <em> spiritual</em> man, is he, whose governing principle and highest reference of all things is the ψυχή , the <em> animal soul</em> , αἰτία κινήσεως ζωικῆς ζώων , Plato, Definit. p. 411. In him, the πνεῦμα , or <em> spirit</em> , being unvivified and uninformed by the Spirit of God, is <em> overborne</em> by the animal soul, with its desires and its judgments, and is <em> in abeyance</em> , so that he may be said to have it not; ψυχικοὶ πνεῦμα μὴ ἔχοντες , ref. Jude. The ψυχή is <em> that side</em> of the human soul, so to speak, which is <em> turned towards the flesh, the world, the devil</em> : so that the ψυχικός is necessarily in a measure σαρκικός (ch. 1Co 3:3 ), also ἐπίγειος , and δαιμονιώδης , as in ref. James.

<p>This general interpretation of ψυχικός must be adhered to, and we must not make it merely <em> intellectual</em> , as Theodoret, ὁ μόνοις τοῖς οἰκείοις ἀρκούμενος λογισμοῖς , Grot. “qui humanæ tantum rationis luce ducitur:” Chrys.: ὁ τὸ πᾶν τοῖς λογισμοῖς τῆς ψυχῆς διδούς , καὶ μὴ νομίζων ἄνωθέν τινος δεῖσθαι βοηθείας , nor merely <em> ethical</em> , as Erasm., Rosenmüller (‘qui cupiditatum sub imperio omnem vitam transigunt’), al., but embracing both these.

<p><strong> οὐ δέχεται</strong> , <strong> receives not</strong> , i.e. <em> rejects</em> , see reff., not, <em> cannot receive, ‘non capax est,’ understands not</em> , which is against the context, for we may well <em> understand</em> that which seems folly to us, but we <em> reject</em> it, as unworthy of our consideration: and it besides would involve a tautology, this point, of <em> inability to comprehend</em> , following by and by: <strong> and he cannot know them</strong> ( τὰ τοῦ πνεύματος , the matter of our spiritual teaching, itself furnished by the Spirit) <strong> because they are spiritually</strong> (by the πνεῦμα of a man exalted by the Spirit of God into its proper paramount office of judging and ruling, and inspired and enabled for that office) <strong> judged of</strong> .</p>
