<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] PROOF OF <strong> αὐτὸς δὲ ὑπ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> οὐδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀνακρίνεται</strong> . In order for an <em> unassisted man</em> , not <em> gifted from Christ</em> , to judge the πνευματικός , he must <em> know the</em> <strong> νοῦς κυρίου</strong> , the intent and disposition of Christ; <em> yea more</em> , must be <em> able to teach, to instruct, Christ</em> being not, as the πνευματικός , <em> taught by Him</em> , he must have an <em> independent wisdom of his own</em> , which Christ <em> has not</em> : and <em> who is there, of whom this can be said</em> ? <strong> But we</strong> ( πνευματικοί , among whom he includes himself and the other Apostles) <strong> have</strong> (not a wisdom independent of Christ, nor do we know His mind, nor can we teach Him, but) <strong> the mind of Christ</strong> : the same mind, in our degree of apprehensiveness of it, by the imparting of His Spirit, which is in Him, and so can judge all things. The νοῦς κυρίου is <em> the spiritual intent</em> and designs of Christ.
	</p>
<p>κυρίου in the prophecy is spoken of JEHOVAH; but in the whole of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:0">Isaiah 40:0</span> , the <em> incarnate Jehovah</em> is the subject. The meaning of συμβιβάζω , <em> to teach</em> , belongs to the LXX: in the N. T. it is <em> to conclude, to prove, to confirm</em> , see reff.</p>
