<p><strong> 8.</strong> ] <strong> ἥν</strong> is in apposition with the former ἥν , and does not refer to δόξαν , as Tert [1] contra Marc [2] <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span> , vol. ii. p. 483, “subjicit de gloria nostra, quod eam nemo ex principibus hujus ævi scierit …,” for this would be departing from the whole sense of the context, which is, that the <em> wisdom of God</em> was <em> hidden</em> from men.

<p><strong> εἰ γὰρ ἔγν</strong> . κ . τ . λ ., is a <em> proof from experience</em> , that the rulers of this world, of whom the Jewish rulers were a representative sample, were ignorant of the wisdom of God. Had they known it, they would not have put to a disgraceful death ( ὁ σταυρὸς ἀδοξίας εἶναι δοκεῖ , Chrys.) Him who was the Lord of glory (reff.), i.e. who possesses in his own right glory eternal, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span> .

<p>These words are not a parenthesis, but continue the sense of the foregoing, completing the proof of man’s ignorance of God’s wisdom; even this world’s <em> rulers</em> know it not, as they have shewn: how much less then the rest.</p>
