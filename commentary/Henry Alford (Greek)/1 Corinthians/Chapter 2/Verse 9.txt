<p><strong> 9</strong> f.] <strong> But</strong> (opposition to 1Co 2:8 ) <strong> as it is written, The things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, and which came not up</strong> (reff.) <strong> upon heart of man, how many things God prepared for them that love Him, to us God revealed through His Spirit</strong> . There is no anacoluthon (as De W.) nor irregularity of construction, as some suppose, supplying after ἀλλά , λαλοῦμεν (Estius, &amp;c.) or γέγονεν (Theophyl., Grot., al.); the δέ in the consequent clause after ὅς in the antecedent, which has occasioned these suppositions, is by no means unexampled; so Herod. iii. 37, ὃς δὲ τούτους μὴ ὀπώπεε , ἐγὼ δέ οἱ σημανέω , and Soph. Philoct. 86, ἐγὼ μὲν οὓς ἂν τῶν λόγων ἀλγῶ κλύειν , Λαερτίου παῖ , τοὺς δὲ καὶ πράσσειν στυγῶ . See Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 184 f.

<p><em> Whence is the citation made?</em> Origen says, ‘In nullo regular libro invenitur, nisi in secretis Eliæ prophetæ,’ a lost apocryphal book: Chrys., Theophyl., give the alternative, either that the words are a paraphrase of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:15">Isaiah 52:15</span> , οἷς οὐκ ἀνηγγέλη περὶ αὐτοῦ ὄψονται , κ . οἳ οὐκ ἀκηκόασι συνήσουσι , or that they were contained in some lost book, of which Chrys. argues that there were very many, καὶ γὰρ πολλὰ διεφθάρη βιβλία , καὶ ὀλίγα διεσώθη . Jerome, Ep. lvii. (ci.), ad Pammachium, de optimo genere interpretandi, 9, vol. i. p. 314, says, “Solent in hoc loco apocryphorum quidam deliramenta sectari, et dicere quod de Apocalypsi Heliæ testimonium sumptum sit: cum in Esaia juxta Hebraicum ita legatur: A seculo non audierunt, nec auribus perceperunt, oculus non vidit, Deus, absque te, quæ præparas tu expectantibus te. Hoc LXX multo aliter transtulerunt: A seculo non audivimus, neque oculi nostri viderunt Deum absque te: et opera tua vera, et facies expectantibus te misericordiam. Intelligimus, unde sumptum sit testimonium: et tamen Apostolus non verbum expressit e verbo, sed παραφραστικῶς eundem sensum aliis sermonibus indicavit.” I own that probability seems to me to incline to Jerome’s view, especially when we remember, how freely St. Paul is in the habit of citing. The words of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+64:4">Isaiah 64:4</span> , are quite as near to the general sense of the citation as is the case in many other instances, and the words ἐπὶ καρδίαν οὐκ ἀνέβη may well be a reminiscence from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:17">Isaiah 65:17</span> , not far from the other place, οὐ μὴ ἐπέλθῃ αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν . Such minglings together of clauses from various parts are not unexampled with the Apostle, especially when, as here, he is not citing <em> as authority</em> , but merely <em> illustrating</em> <em> his argument by O. T. expressions</em> .</p>
