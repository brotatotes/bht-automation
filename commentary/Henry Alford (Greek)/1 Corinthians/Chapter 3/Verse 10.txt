<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] <strong> κατὰ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> χάρ</strong> . &amp;c., as an expression of humility (reff.), fitly introduces the σοφός which follows. So Chrys.: ὅρα γοῦν πῶς μετριάζει . εἰπὼν γὰρ σοφὸν ἑαυτόν , οὐκ ἀφῆκεν αὐτοῦ τοῦτο εἶναι , ἀλλ ʼ ὅλον ἑαυτὸν πρότερον ἀναθεὶς τῷ θεῷ τότε ἑαυτὸν οὕτως ἐκάλεσε . Hom. viii. p. 69. The <strong> χάρις</strong> is not <em> the peculiar grace of his apostleship</em> for an apostle was not always required to lay the foundation, e.g. in Rome: but that given to him in common with all Christians ( 1Co 3:5 ), only in a degree proportioned to the work which God had for him to do.

<p><strong> σοφός</strong> <strong> , skilful</strong> , see reff., and many examples in Wetstein. The proof of this skill is given, in his <em> laying a foundation</em> : the unskilful master-builder <em> lays none</em> , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:49">Luke 6:49</span> . The foundation ( 1Co 3:11 ) was and must be, JESUS CHRIST: the facts of redemption by Him (obj.), and the reception of Him and His work by faith (subj.).

<p>The mascul. form ὁ θεμέλιος (sc. λίθος ) is said by Thomas Mag. (in Wetst.) to belong to the κοινὴ διάλεκτος the Attic form is θεμέλιον , or, if in the plur., οἱ θεμέλιοι : οἱ γὰρ θεμέλιοι παντοίων λίθων ὑπόκεινται , Thucyd. i. 93.

<p><strong> ἄλλος</strong> , ‘ <em> whoever comes after me</em> ,’ <strong> another</strong> : not only Apollos.

<p><strong> ἐποικοδομεῖ</strong> , <em> pres.</em> , as the necessary state and condition of the subsequent teacher, be he who he may. The <em> building on, over the foundation</em> , imports the carrying them onward in knowledge and intelligent faith.
	</p>
<p><strong> πῶς</strong> , emphatic, = here, <em> with what material</em> . De Wette imagines that it also conveys a caution not to <em> alter the foundations</em> , and that the <strong> γάρ</strong> in 1Co 3:11 refers to this. But the identity of the foundation is surely implied in ἐποικοδομεῖ . On the γάρ , see below.</p>
