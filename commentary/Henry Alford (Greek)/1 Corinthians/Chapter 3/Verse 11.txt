<p><strong> 11.</strong> <strong> θ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γάρ</strong> ] q. d. ‘I speak of superimposing merely, for it is unnecessary to caution them respecting the foundation itself: there <em> can be but one</em> , and that one HAS ALREADY BEEN (objectively, for all, see below) LAID BY GOD.’ At the same time, in taking this for granted, he implies the strongest possible caution against attempting to lay any other.

<p><strong> δύναται</strong> , strictly <strong> can</strong> , not ‘ <em> nemini licet</em> ,’ as Grot., al., nor as Theophyl., οὐ δύναται θεῖναι , ἕως ἂν μένῃ σοφὸς ἀρχιτέκτων , ἐπεὶ ὅταν μὴ ᾖ τις σοφ . ἀρχ ., δύναται θεῖναι , κ . ἐκ τούτου αἱ αἱρέσεις : for it is <em> assumed</em> , that <strong> θεοῦ</strong> οἰκοδομή is to be raised and it <em> can</em> only be raised on this one foundation. All who build on other foundations are not συνεργοὶ θεοῦ , nor is their building θεοῦ οἰκοδομή at all.

<p><strong> κείμενον</strong> ] not, ‘ <em> by me</em> ,’ but ‘ <em> by God</em> ,’ for universal Christendom; but <em> actually laid in each place</em> , as regards <em> that church</em> , by the minister who founds it. De Wette denies this universal reference, as introducing a new element into the context. But surely the reference in ὁ θεμέλιος ὁ κείμενος is too direct to the well-known prophecy of the divinely-placed foundation or cornerstone, to surprise any reader or divert his mind from the train of thought by a new element.

<p><strong> Ἰησοῦς χριστός</strong> , THE PERSONAL, HISTORICAL CHRIST, as the object of all Christian faith. If it be read as in rec., Ἰησοῦς ὁ χριστός , it need not <em> necessarily</em> be, <em> that Jesus is the Christ</em> , but may be in this case also, JESUS THE CHRIST; not any <em> doctrine</em> , even that of the Messiahship of Jesus, is the foundation, but JESUS HIMSELF (see var. readd.).</p>
