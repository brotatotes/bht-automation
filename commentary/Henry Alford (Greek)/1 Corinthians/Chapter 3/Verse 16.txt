<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] The foregoing figures, with the occasion to which they referred, are now dropped, and the οἰκοδομὴ θεοῦ recalled, to do further service. This <em> building</em> is now, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:1">Malachi 3:1</span> , and as indeed by implication in the foregoing verses, the <em> temple</em> of God ( ναὸς θεοῦ , with emphasis on ναός , not θεοῦ ναός ), the <em> habitation of His Spirit</em> .

<p><strong> οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι</strong> <strong> Are ye ignorant that</strong> … an expression of surprise arising out of their conduct.

<p><strong> καὶ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> ἐν ὑμῖν</strong> = ἐν ᾧ , τουτέστιν , ἐν ὑμῖν .

<p>Meyer rightly remarks, that “ ναὸς θεοῦ is <em> the temple</em> of God, not <em> a</em> temple of God: for Paul does not conceive (as Theodoret, al.) of the various churches as <em> various temples</em> of God, which would be inconsistent with a Jew’s conception of God’s temple, but of each Christian church as, sensu mystico, <em> the temple of Jehovah</em> . So there would be, not many temples, but many churches, each of which is, ideally, the same temple of God.” And, we may add, if the figure is to be strictly justified in its widest acceptation, that all the churches are built together into one vast temple: cf. ἐν <strong> ᾧ καὶ ὑμεῖς συνοικοδομεῖσθε</strong> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:22">Ephesians 2:22</span> .</p>
