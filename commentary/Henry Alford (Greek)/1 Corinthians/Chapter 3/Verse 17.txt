<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] <strong> φθείρει</strong> , [ <strong> destroys</strong> , or] <strong> mars</strong> , whether as regards its <em> unity and beauty</em> , or its <em> purity and sanctity</em> : here, the meaning is left indefinite, but the latter particulars are certainly hinted at, by ἅγιος below.
	</p>
<p><strong> φθερεῖ</strong> , either by <em> temporal death</em> (Mey.), as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:30">1 Corinthians 11:30</span> ; or by <em> spiritual death</em> , which is more probable, seeing that the <em> figurative</em> temple is spoken of, not (as Mey.) the material temple: and as <em> temporal death</em> was the punishment for defiling the material temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:43">Exodus 28:43</span> . Lev 16:2 al. fr.), so <em> spiritual death</em> for marring or defiling of God’s spiritual temple.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἅγιος</strong> , the constant epithet of ναός in the O. T., see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+5:7">Psalms 5:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+10:5">Psalms 10:5</span> (LXX). <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:20">Habakkuk 2:20</span> , and passim.
	</p>
<p><strong> οἵτινες</strong> , i.e. ἅγιοι , not, ‘ <em> which temple are ye</em> ,’ which would be tautological after <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span> , and would hardly be expressed by οἵτινες , ‘ <em> ut qui</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> quales</em> .’ Meyer well remarks, that οἵτινές ἐστε ὑμεῖς is the minor proposition of a syllogism: ‘Whoever mars the temple of God, him will God destroy, because His temple is <em> holy</em> ; but ye also, as His ideal temple, are holy: therefore, whoever mars you, shall be destroyed by God.’</p>
