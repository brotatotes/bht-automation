<p><strong> ὁ δρασσ</strong> .] The sense of the Heb. is equally expressed by the Apostle and the LXX. The words are taken out of the context as they stand, which accounts for the participle, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:7">Hebrews 1:7</span> . The sense is, ‘If God uses the craft of the wise as a net to catch them in, such wisdom is in His sight folly, since He turns it to their confusion.’ “ <strong> δρασσόμενος</strong> (possibly a provincialism) is substituted for καταλαμβάνων , as a stronger and livelier expression for ‘grasping,’ or ‘catching with the hand.’ ” Stanley. Cf. Jdt 13:7 .</p>
