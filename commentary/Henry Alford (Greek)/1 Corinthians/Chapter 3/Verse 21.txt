This <em> boasting in men</em> is explained in ch. 1Co 4:6 to mean μὴ εἷς ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἑνὸς φυσιοῦσθαι κατὰ τοῦ ἑτέρου .

<p><strong> καυχάσθω</strong> after ὥστε is a change of construction. A somewhat similar change occurred in the parallel ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:31">1 Corinthians 1:31</span> , ἵνα … καυχάσθω : but there, by the citation being adduced in its existing form.
