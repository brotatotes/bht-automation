<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] On the change of the possessives, see above: <em> Christ</em> is not <em> yours</em> , in the sense in which πάντα are, not <em> made for and subserving you but</em> ( δέ ) <em> you are His</em> , and even that does not reach the Highest possession: He possesses not you <em> for Himself</em> ; but ( δέ again) κεφαλὴ χριστοῦ ὁ θεός , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:3">1 Corinthians 11:3</span> .

<p>CHRIST HIMSELF, the Incarnate God the Mediator, <em> belongs to</em> God, is subordinate to the Father, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:28">John 14:28</span> ; John , 17 passim. But this mediatorial subordination is in no way inconsistent with His eternal and co-equal Godhead: see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6-9">Philippians 2:6-9</span> ; and on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:28">1 Corinthians 15:28</span> , where the subjection of all things to Christ, and His subjection to the Father, are similarly set forth.

<p>There is a striking similarity in the argument in this last verse to that in our Lord’s prohibition, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:8-10">Matthew 23:8-10</span> .
