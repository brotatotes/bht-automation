<p><strong> ἄνθρωπος</strong> , as <strong> E. V., a man</strong> , in the most general and indefinite sense, as ‘ <em> man</em> ’ in German: not a Hebraism, nor = ἕκαστος . The whole is opposed to καύχησις ἐν ἀνθρώποις : the ministers of Christ are but subordinates to Him, and accountable to God.

<p><strong> ἡμᾶς</strong> , <em> here</em> , not, ‘ <em> us ministers generally</em> ,’ see below, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:6">1 Corinthians 4:6</span> , but ‘ <em> myself and Apollos</em> ,’ as a sample of such.

<p><strong> ὑπηρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> χριστοῦ</strong> , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5">1 Corinthians 3:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:22-23">1 Corinthians 3:22-23</span> . But in <strong> οἰκον</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> μυστ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θεοῦ</strong> we have a new figure introduced. The Church, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span> , is the οἶκος θεοῦ and those appointed to minister in it are οἰκονόμοι , <em> stewards</em> and <em> dispensers</em> of the property and stores of the οἰκοδεσπότης . These last are the μυστήρια , hidden treasures, of God, i.e. the riches of his grace, <em> now manifested</em> in Christ, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25-26">Romans 16:25-26</span> , which <em> they</em> announce and distribute to all, having received them from the Spirit for that purpose. “Ea mysteria sunt incarnationis, passionis et resurrectionis Christi, redemptionis nostræ, vocationis gentium, et cætera quæ complectitur evangelica doctrina.” Estius, who also, as a Romanist, attempts to include the <em> sacraments</em> among the μυστήρια in this sense. The best refutation of this is given by himself: “sed cum ipse Paulus dixerit primo capite, <em> Non misit me Christus baptizare, sed evangelizare</em> , rectius est ut mysteria Dei intelligantur fidei nostræ dogmata.” It may be doubted, whether, <em> in the N. T. sense</em> of μυστήρια , the sacraments can be in any way reckoned as such: for μυστ . is a (usually <em> divine</em> ) proceeding, <em> once hidden, but now revealed</em> , or <em> now hidden, and to be revealed</em> ; under neither of which categories can the sacraments be classed.</p>
