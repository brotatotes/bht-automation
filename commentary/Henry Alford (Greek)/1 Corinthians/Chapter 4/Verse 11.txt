<p><strong> 11</strong> .] <strong> ἄχρι τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἄρτι ὥρας</strong> is evidently not to be taken strictly as indicative of the situation of Paul <em> at the time of writing</em> the Epistle, but as generally describing the kind of life to which, then and always, he and the other Apostles were exposed: οὐ παλαιὰ διηγοῦμαι πράγματα , <strong> ἀλλ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἅπερ</strong> καὶ ὁ παρών μοι καιρὸς μαρτυρεῖ . Chrys See, on the subject-matter, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23-27">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</span> .

<p><strong> γυμνιτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> are in want of sufficient clothing</strong> : cf. ἐν ψύχει κ . γυμνότητι , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:27">2 Corinthians 11:27</span> . Meyer (after Fritzsche) believes γυμνιτεύομεν to be a mistake in writing the word, of very ancient date: but surely we are not justified, in such a conventional matter as the form of writing a word, to desert the unanimous testimony of the oldest MSS. And we have the forms γυμνίτης , and γυμνῖτις : why not then γυμνιτεύω ?
