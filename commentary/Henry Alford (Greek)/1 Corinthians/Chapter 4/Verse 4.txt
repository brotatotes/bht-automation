<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] <strong> for I</strong> [ <strong> know nothing against myself</strong> (i.e.)] <strong> am conscious to myself of no</strong> (official) <strong> delinquency</strong> ; so Plato, Apol. p. 21, οὔτε μέγα οὔτε σμικρὸν ξύνοιδα ἐμαυτῷ σοφὸς ὤν , ib., Rep. i. (Wetst.), τῷ δὲ μηδὲν ἑαυτῷ ἀδίκων ξυνειδότι ἡδεῖα ἐλπὶς ἀεὶ πάρεστι , and Hor., Epist. i. 1. 61, ‘Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.’

<p>The E. V., ‘I know nothing by myself,’ was a phrase commonly used in this acceptation at the time; cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+15:4">Psalms 15:4</span> , Com. Prayer Book version, ‘He that <em> setteth not by himself</em> ,’ i.e. is not wise in his own conceit. ‘I know no harm by him’ is still a current expression in the midland counties. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+27:16">Deuteronomy 27:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+22:7">Ezekiel 22:7</span> , in E. V. So Donne, Serm. lvii., “If thine own spirit, thine own conscience, accuse thee of nothing, is all well? why, <em> I know nothing by myself, yet am I not thereby justified</em> .” This meaning of ‘by’ does not appear in our ordinary dictionaries), <strong> but I am not hereby justified</strong> (i.e. it is not <em> this circumstance</em> which clears me of blame <em> this</em> does not decide the matter. There can be no reference (as Meyer) to <em> forensic justification</em> here, by the very conditions of the context: for he is speaking of that μισθός of the teacher, which may be lost, and yet personal salvation be attained, see ch. 1Co 3:15 ); <strong> but he that judges</strong> (holds an enquiry on) <strong> me is the Lord</strong> (Christ, the judge).</p>
