<p><strong> ἀκούεται ἐν ὑμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πορνεία</strong> ] another way of saying ἀκούουσί τινες ἐν ὑμ . πόρνοι , <strong> the character of </strong> <strong> πόρνος</strong> <strong> is borne (by some) among you, fornication is borne as a character among you</strong> . From missing this sense of ἀκούομαι , Commentators have gone wrong (1) as to ὅλως , rendering it ‘ <em> commonly</em> ,’ to suit ἀκούεται , ‘ <em> is reported</em> ,’ (2) as to ἐν ὑμῖν , joining it with πορνεία , whereas it belongs to ἀκούεται , (3) as to ἥτις οὐδὲ ἐν τ . ἔθν ., see below.

<p><strong> καὶ τοιαύτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> π</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> And fornication of such a sort</strong> (the καί rises in a climax, there being an ellipsis of οὐ μόνον …‚ ἀλλὰ … before it; so Aristoph. Ran. 116, ὦ σχέτλιε , τολμήσεις γὰρ ἰέναι καὶ σύ γε ; see Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 134), <strong> as (is) not</strong> (borne as a character) <strong> even among the heathen</strong> . The ὀνομάξεται of the rec. is a clumsy gloss, probably from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3">Ephesians 5:3</span> ; the meaning being, that not even among the heathen does any one ἀκούει πόρνος in this sense, that it was a crime that they would not tolerate as a matter of public notoriety. <strong> So that one among yon has</strong> ( <em> as wife</em> most probably, not merely <em> as concubine</em> : the word ἔχω in such cases universally in the N. T. signifying <em> to possess in marriage</em> : and Meyer remarks that ὁ τὸ ἔργον τοῦτο ποιήσας ( 1Co 5:2 ), and τὸν οὕτως τοῦτο κατεργασάμενον ( 1Co 5:3 ) seem to point to a consummation of marriage, not to mere concubinage) <strong> his father’s wife</strong> (i.e. his step-mother, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+18:8">Leviticus 18:8</span> ; οὐκ εἶπε μητρυιὰν ἀλλὰ γυναῖκα πατρός , ὥστε πολλῷ χαλεπώτερον πλῆξαι , Chrys. Hom. xv. p. 125).

<p>The Commentators generally refer to Cicero, Pro Cluentio, 5, 6, “Nubit genero socrus, nullis auspicibus, nullis auctoribus, funestis ominibus omnium omnibus. O mulieris scelus incredibile, et præter hanc unam, in omni vita inauditum,” &amp;c.

<p>It may seem astonishing that the authorities in the Corinthian church should have allowed such a case to escape them, or if known, should have tolerated it. Perhaps the universal laxity of morals at Corinth may have weakened the severity even of the Christian elders: perhaps, as has often been suggested, the offender, if a Jewish convert, might defend his conduct by the Rabbinical maxim that in the case of a proselyte, the forbidden degrees were annulled, a <em> new birth</em> having been undergone by him (see Maimon. in Wetst.). This latter however is rendered improbable by the fact that the Apostle says nothing of the <em> woman</em> , which he would have done had she been a Christian: and that Jewish maxim was taxed with the condition, that a proselyte might marry any of his or her former relatives, ‘ <em> modo ad Judaicam religionem transierint</em> .’ The father was living, and is described in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:12">2 Corinthians 7:12</span> , as ὁ ἀδικηθείς ; and from the Apostle saying there that he did not write <em> on his account</em> , he was probably a Christian.</p>
