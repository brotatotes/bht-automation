<p><strong> τί γάρ μοι</strong> <strong> .…</strong> ] <strong> for what concern of mine is it …?</strong> So Ælian, Var. H. vi. 11, τοὺς δὲ ἄλλους ἐῶ . τί γάρ μοι κωφοῖς κ . ἀνοήτοις συμβουλεύειν τὰ λυσιτελέστατα ; see other examples in. Wetst.

<p><strong> τοὺς ἔξω</strong> ] reff. It was among the Jews the usual term for the Gentiles. Cf. Schöttgen in loc.

<p>He means, ‘this might have been easily understood to be my meaning: for what concern have I with pronouncing sentence on the world without, or with giving rules of discipline for <em> them?</em> I could only have referred to persons <em> among yourselves</em> .’

<p><strong> οὐχὶ τοὺς ἔσω</strong> ] “Ex eo, quod in ecclesia fieri solet, interpretari debuistis monitum meum, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:9">1 Corinthians 5:9</span> . Cives judicatis, non alienos: quanto magis ego.” Bengel. But I am not quite certain of this interpretation, which is also that of De Wette and Meyer, because it would more naturally correspond to οὐχὶ τοὺς ἔσω καὶ ὑμεῖς κρίνετε ; A preferable way seems to be this; ‘My judgment was meant to <em> lead your judgment.</em> This being the case, what concern had I with <em> those without?</em> Is it not on <em> those within,</em> that your judgments are passed?’ The arrangement mentioned by Theophylact, and adopted by Knatchbull, Hammond, Michaelis, Rosenm., al., οὐχί · τοὺς ἔσω ὑμεῖς κρίνετε , ‘ <em> No: those within do ye</em> (imper.) <em> judge,’</em> is clearly wrong, for οὐχί is no answer to τί , and would require ἀλλά after it, even supposing μοι τοὺς ἔξω κρίνειν and τοὺς ἔσω ὑμεῖς κρίνετε formed any intelligible logical contrast, which they do not.</p>
