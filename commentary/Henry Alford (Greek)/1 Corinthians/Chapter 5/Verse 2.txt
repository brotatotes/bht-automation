<p><strong> πεφυς</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐστέ</strong> ] Not, which would be absurd, <em> at the occurrence of this crime</em> , οὐκ ἐπὶ τῷ ἁμαρτήματι · τοῦτο γὰρ ἀλογίας . Chrys.: neither, as he proceeds, ἀλλ ʼ ἐπὶ τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ τῇ ἐκείνου , imagining the offender to have been some party teacher: so also Theophyl.: but as before, with a notion of their own wisdom and spiritual perfection: the being puffed up is only <em> cum hoc</em> , not <em> propter hoc</em> .

<p><strong> ἐπενθήσατε</strong> <strong> ] And did ye not rather mourn</strong> (viz. when the crime became first known to you), <strong> in order that</strong> (your mourning would be <em> because of the existence</em> of the evil, i.e. with <em> a view to its removal</em> ) <strong> he who did this deed (the</strong> past part. ποιήσας is <em> itself used from the past point of time</em> indicated by ἐπενθήσατε , and must therefore be expressed by the past) <strong> might</strong> (may) <strong> be removed from among you</strong> (viz. by your casting him out from your society)?</p>
