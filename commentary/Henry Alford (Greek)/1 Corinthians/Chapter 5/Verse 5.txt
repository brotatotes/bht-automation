<p><strong> 5. </strong> <strong> ἵνα τὸ πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σωθῇ</strong> ] The aim of the ὄλεθρ . τ . σαρ ., which he said ἤδη τῷ διαβόλῳ νόμους τιθείς , καὶ οὐκ ἀφιεὶς αὐτὸν περαιτέρω προβῆναι , as Chrys. p. 128. Thus the proposed punishment, severe as it might seem, would be in reality a merciful one, tending to the eternal happiness of the offender. A greater contrast to this can hardly be conceived, than the terrible forms of excommunication subsequently devised, and even now in use in the Romish church, under the fiction of delegated apostolic power. The delivering to Satan <em> for the destruction of the spirit,</em> can belong only to those who <em> do the work of Satan.</em> Stanley remarks, “For the popular constitution of the early Corinthian church, see Clem. Rom [10] i. 44 (p. 297): where the rulers of that society are described as having been appointed συνευδοκησάσης τῆς ἐκκλησίας πάσης .”
