<p><strong> 9.</strong> ] <strong> I wrote to you in my letter</strong> (not <em> this present epistle</em> , which <strong> τῇ</strong> ἐπιστολῇ <em> might</em> mean, see reff., for there is nothing in the preceding part of this Epistle which can by any possibility be so interpreted, certainly not either 1Co 5:2 or <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:6">1 Corinthians 5:6</span> , which are commonly alleged by those who thus explain it and ἐν τῇ ἐπιστολῇ would be a superfluous and irrelevant addition, if he meant the letter on which he was now engaged: but, a <em> former epistle</em> , which has not come down to us: cf. the similar expression, ref. 2 Cor. used with reference to <em> this Epistle,</em> and see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:15-16">2 Corinthians 1:15-16</span> . So Ambrose, Calvin, Beza, Estius, Grot., Calov., Bengel, Wetst., Mosh., De Wette, Meyer: so also Lightfoot, understanding however an Epistle <em> committed to Timothy</em> , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:17">1 Corinthians 4:17</span> ; which could not be, as Timothy was not coming to them till after they had received this Epistle, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:10">1 Corinthians 16:10</span> , and thus the words would be unintelligible to them: on the other side are Chrys., Theodoret, Theophyl., Erasm., Corn.-a-lapide, Wolf, al. It has been suggested (see Stanley, in loc.) that the whole passage, ch. 1Co 5:9 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:8">1 Corinthians 6:8</span> , may have been a postscript or note inserted subsequently to the rest of the Epistle, and referring especially to ch. 1Co 6:9-20 ) <strong> not to keep company with fornicators.</strong></p>
