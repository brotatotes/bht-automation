<p><strong> πᾶν ἁμάρτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The assertion, which has surprised many of the Commentators, is nevertheless <em> strictly true</em> . Drunkenness and gluttony, e.g. are sins done <em> in</em> and <em> by</em> the body, and are sins <em> by abuse of</em> the body, but they are still ἐκτὸς τοῦ σώματος introduced <em> from without</em> , sinful <em> not</em> in their <em> act</em> , but in their <em> effect</em> , which effect it is each man’s duty to foresee and avoid. But fornication is the <em> alienating that body which is the Lord’s, and making it a harlot’s body</em> it is sin <em> against a man’s own body</em> , in its very nature, against <em> the verity and nature</em> of his body; not an <em> effect on</em> the body from participation of things without, but a <em> contradiction of the truth</em> of the body, wrought <em> within itself</em> . When <em> man</em> and <em> wife</em> are one in the Lord, united <em> by His ordinance</em> , no such alienation of the body takes place, and consequently no sin.</p>
