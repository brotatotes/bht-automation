<p><strong> οἱ ἅγιοι τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κριν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> that the saints shall judge the world?</strong> i.e. as assessors of Christ, at His coming: so <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+7:22">Daniel 7:22</span> (Theod.), ἦλθεν ὁ παλαιὸς ἡμερῶν , καὶ <strong> τὸ κρίμα ἔδωκεν ἁγίοις ὑψίστου</strong> ; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span> . So Calv., Beza, Grot., Est., Wolf, Olsh., Billroth, Rückert, Meyer, De Wette. All attempts to elude this plain meaning of the words are futile: whether of Chrys., Theophyl., Theodor-Mops [11] , Theodoret, Erasm., κρινοῦσι δὲ οὐχὶ αὐτοὶ καθήμενοι κ . λόγον ἀπαιτοῦντες , ἀλλὰ κατακρινοῦσι ( Mat 12:41-42 ), Chrys. for this would be no parallel to the case in hand; or of Lightf., Vitringa, Bengel (but only as a <em> præludium futurorum</em> ), al., ‘ <em> quod Christiani futuri sint magistratus et judices in mundo</em> ,’ Lightf., which does not satisfy <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:3">1 Corinthians 6:3</span> , nor agree with the Apostle’s earnest persuasion (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:0">2 Corinthians 5:0</span> . al., and note on 2Th 2:2 ) that the coming of Christ was near at hand: or of Mosheim, Ernesti, Rosenm., ‘ <em> quod Christiani profanos judicare possint</em> ,’ Rosenm., in the sense of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:15-16">1 Corinthians 2:15-16</span> , for no such meaning can be conveyed by the <em> future</em> , which is fixed here by the following κρινοῦμεν .

<p><strong> καί</strong> brings out an inconsequence or a contradiction between the members of the sentence, which it is the object of the question to remove: so Xen. Cyr. 4:3. 11, ἀλλ ʼ εἴποι ἄν τις , ὅτι παῖδες ὄντες ἐμάνθανον . καὶ πότερα παῖδές εἰσι φρονιμώτεροι ὥστε μαθεῖν τὰ φραζόμενα κ . δεικνύμενα ἢ ἄνδρες ; see Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 147.

<p><strong> ἐν ὑμῖν</strong> ] Chrys. attempts by this prepos. to defend his view (see above), οὐ γὰρ εἶπεν , ὑφ ʼ ὑμῶν , ἀλλ ʼ <strong> ἐν ὑμῖν</strong> (‘exemplo vestro’). But in vain: nor as Grot., al., ἐν , <em> by:</em> for κρίνεσθαι ἐν is the expression for <em> to be judged before</em> , as judges: the judges being the <em> vehicle</em> of judgment, its conditioning element, as in ref. Acts. So Aristides, Platon. ii. p. 214 (Wetst.), τινὲς ἤδη λέγονται τῶν ἡρώων ἐν θεοῖς δικασταῖς κριθῆναι and Polyb. v. 29. 6, Πτολεμαῖον … κρίνας ἐν τοῖς Μακεδόσιν ἀπέκτεινε . See other examples in Wetst. Hence (Meyer) by this ‘ <em> coram vobis</em> ’ it appears plainly, though it might be otherwise inferred from the context, that the Saints <em> are to be the judges</em> , sitting in judgment.

<p><strong> ἀνάξιοί ἐστε κριτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐλαχ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> are ye unworthy of</strong> (i.e. to hold or pronounce) <strong> the smallest judgments?</strong> κριτήρια cannot be, as usually rendered, ‘ <em> matters to be judged</em> :’ it signifies either (1) <em> criteria</em> , lit. or metaphor., which sense is irrelevant here: (2) <em> tribunals, courts of justice</em> : so Glossar. κριτήριον , δικαστήριον , and Polyb. ix. 33. 12, κοινὸν ἐκ πάντων τῶν Ἑλλήνων καθίσας κριτήριον or (3) <em> judgments held</em> in such courts, <em> judicia</em> , as Lucian. bis accus. (§ 25, p. 253, ed. Hagan. 1526); Hermes describes Pyrrhon as being not in court, ὅτι οὐδὲν ἡγεῖται κριτήριον ἀληθὲς εἶναι : to which Δίκη replies, τοιγαροῦν ἐρήμην αὐτοῦ καταδικάτωσαν . The last meaning suits both this place and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:4">1 Corinthians 6:4</span> . So Cicero speaks of ‘in privatis minimarum rerum judiciis.’ Here, they are ἐλάχιστα in comparison with the weighty judgments which shall be held hereafter; = βιωτικά , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:4">1 Corinthians 6:4</span> .</p>
