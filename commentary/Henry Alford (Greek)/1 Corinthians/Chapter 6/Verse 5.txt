This last is a harsh method of expression, and apparently only to be accounted for by the singular form of οὐδεὶς σοφός having attracted the other into the singular likewise, so that instead of σοφοὶ οἳ δυνήσονται διακρ . ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν , we have σαφὸς ὃς δυνήσεται διακρ . ἀνὰ μ . τοῦ ἀδ . αὐτοῦ . But it is not without use: it prevents the apparent inference, which might be made if τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ were used, that <em> one wise man was to be appointed universal arbitrator,</em> and confines the appointment of the arbitrator to each possibly arising case respectively.</p>
