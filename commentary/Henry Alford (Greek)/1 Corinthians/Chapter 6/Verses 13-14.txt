<p><strong> 13, 14</strong> .] “a cibis ad venerem non valet consequentia.” Bengel. The argument is, meats (of which he doubtless had often impressed on them that <em> they were</em> ἀδιάφορα , whence the abuse) are expressly created for the belly, and the belly for them, by its organization being fitted to assimilate them; and both these are of a transitory nature: in the change to the more perfect state, God will do away with both. Therefore meats <em> are</em> ἀδιάφορα . But neither is the body <em> created for</em> fornication, nor can this transitoriness be predicated <em> of it</em> : the body is <em> for the Lord</em> , and the Lord (in his mediatorial work) for the body: and God raised up the Lord, and will raise up us (i.e. our bodies): so that the body is not perishable, and (resumed 1Co 6:18 ) he that fornicates, sins <em> against his own body</em> . THEREFORE, fornication <em> is not</em> an ἀδιάφορον .

<p>It is very remarkable how these verses contain the germ of three weighty sections of the Epistle about to follow, and doubtless in the Apostle’s mind when he wrote them, (1) the relation between the sexes: (2) the question of meats offered to idols: (3) the doctrine of the Resurrection of the Body.
