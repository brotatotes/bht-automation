<p><strong> 10. </strong> <strong> οὐκ ἐγώ</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> ἀλλὰ ὁ κύριος</strong> ] <em> Ordinarily</em> , the Apostle ( ἐγώ ) writes, commands, gives his advice, <em> under conscious inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God</em> . See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:40">1 Corinthians 7:40</span> . He claims expressly. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:37">1 Corinthians 14:37</span> , that the things ἃ γράφω ὑμῖν should be recognized as κυρίου ( ἐντολή ). But here he is about to give them a command resting, not merely on <em> inspired apostolic authority</em> , great and undoubted as that was, but on that of THE LORD HIMSELF. So that all supposed distinction between the Apostle’s own writing <em> of himself</em> and <em> of the Lord</em> , is quite irrelevant. He <em> never</em> wrote <em> of himself</em> , being a vessel of the Holy Ghost, who ever spoke by him to the church. The distinction between that which is imperative, and that which is optional, that which is more and that which is less weighty in his writings, is to be made by the cautious and believing Christian, from a wise appreciation of the <em> subject-matter</em> , and of the <em> circumstances under which</em> it was written. ALL <em> is the outpouring of the Spirit</em> , but <em> not all for all time,</em> nor <em> all on the primary truths</em> of the faith.

<p><strong> Not I, but the Lord</strong> , viz. in ref. Matt. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:12">Mark 10:12</span> , where the <em> woman’s</em> part is brought out. That <em> it</em> occupies the <em> principal place</em> here, is perhaps because the <em> Christian women</em> at Corinth may have been the most ready to make the separation: or perhaps, because the woman, from her place in the matrimonial union, may be more properly said ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς χωρισθῆναι than the man ἀπὸ γυναικὸς χωρισθῆναι .
	</p>
<p><strong> χωρισθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , <strong> be separated</strong> , whether by <em> formal divorce</em> or <em> otherwise</em> ; the καταλλαγήτω below, is like this, an <em> absolutepassive</em> ; undefined whether by her own or her husband’s doing.</p>
