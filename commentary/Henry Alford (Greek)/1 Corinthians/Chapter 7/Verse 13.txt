<p>Meyer remarks, that the Apostle uses the <em> vox media</em> ἀφιέναι here, of <em> both parties</em> , the husband and wife, not ἀπολύειν (as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:31">Matthew 5:31</span> , &amp;c.), which would apply only to the husband.

<p>By the Greek as well as Roman customs the <em> wife had the power of effecting a divorce</em> . At Athens, when the divorce originated with the wife, she was said ἀπολείπειν the house of her husband: when with the husband, ἀποπεμπέσθαι . At Rome, the only exception to the wife’s liberty of effecting a divorce appears to have been in the case of a freedwoman who had married her patronus. See Smith’s Dict, of Gr. and Rom. Antt. artt. Divortium, and ἀπολείψεως δίκη . Olsh. thinks that Paul puts both alternatives, because he regards the <em> Christian party</em> as the <em> superior one</em> in the marriage.
