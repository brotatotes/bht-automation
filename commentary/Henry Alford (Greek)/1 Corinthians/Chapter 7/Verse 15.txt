<p><strong> 15</strong> .] <em> But if the wish for separation</em> (implied by the <em> present</em> χωρίζεται , <strong> is for being separated,</strong> see Winer, edn. 6, § 40. 2. a, and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:32">John 10:32</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:6">John 13:6</span> ; Joh 13:27 ) <em> proceed from the side of the</em> UNBELIEVER (emphasis on <strong> ὁ ἄπιστος</strong> ), <em> let him</em> (or her) <em> depart</em> (be separated off).

<p><strong> ἐν τοῖς τοιούτοις</strong> may be taken as masc., <em> in the case of such persons</em> , as above by Phot [18] : but the ἐν seems harsh; it is better therefore to render it, <strong> in such cases.

<p><strong> ἐν δὲ εἰρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Not = εἰς εἰρήνην [E. V.], but signifying the moral element <em> in which</em> we are called to be: see reff. and 1Co 7:22 below.

<p>The meaning is, ‘let the unbeliever depart, rather than by attempting to retain the union, endanger that peace of household and peace of spirit, which is part of the calling of a Christian.’
	</p>
<p>Observe, (1) that there is no contradiction, in this licence of breaking off such a marriage, to the command of our Lord in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span> , because the Apostle expressly asserts, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:12">1 Corinthians 7:12</span> , that <em> our Lord’s words do not apply</em> to such marriages as are here contemplated. They were spoken to those <em> within the covenant</em> , and as such apply immediately to the wedlock of <em> Christians</em> ( 1Co 7:10 ), but <em> not to mixed marriages</em> .
	</p>
<p>De Wette denies this, and holds that Paul is speaking only of the Christian’s duty in cases where the marriage is <em> already virtually broken off</em> , and by his remarks on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span> , seems to take πορνεία in a wide sense, and to regard it as a justifiable cause of divorce <em> because it is such a breaking off</em> . This however appears hardly consistent with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:12">1 Corinthians 7:12</span> ; for, if it were so, there <em> would be</em> a command of the Lord regarding this case. At all events, we may safely assume that where the Apostle is <em> distinctly referring</em> to our Lord’s command, and supplying what it did not contain, there can be <em> no real inconsistency</em> : if such appear to be, it must be in our apprehension, not in his words. (2) That the question of re-marrying after such a separation, is here <em> left open</em> : ou this, see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span> . (3) That not a word here said can be so strained as to imply any licence to <em> contract</em> marriages with unbelievers. Only those <em> already contracted</em> are dealt with: the ἑτεροζυγεῖν ἀπίστοις is expressly forbidden, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:14">2 Corinthians 6:14</span> , and by implication below, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:39">1 Corinthians 7:39</span> .</p>
