<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] <strong> εἰ μή</strong> takes an exception, by way of caution, to the foregoing motive for not remaining together ( 1Co 7:16 ). The Christian partner might carry that motive <em> too far</em> , and be tempted by it to <em> break</em> the connexion <em> on his own part</em> ; a course already prohibited ( 1Co 7:12-14 ). Therefore the Apostle adds, <strong> But</strong> (q. d. only be careful not to make this a ground for <em> yourselves</em> causing the separation) <strong> as to each</strong> ( ἑκάστ . ὡς = ὡς ἑκάστ ., reff.) <strong> the Lord distributed (his lot), as</strong> (i.e. <strong> ᾖ</strong> κλήσει , 1Co 7:20 ) <strong> God has called each, so</strong> (in that state, without change) <strong> let him walk</strong> (reff.). The <strong> εἰ μή</strong> has raised considerable difficulties. (1) some cursives, with syr-marg and Sevrn., read εἰ τὴν γυναῖκα σώσεις , <strong> ἢ</strong> μή ; and Knatchbull, al., join <strong> εἰ</strong> μή similarly to the foregoing; εἰ .… σώσεις , εἰ μή . But as De W. remarks, this would be, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:17">Matthew 22:17</span> , ἢ οὐ : and then we should have the strictly parallel clauses of 1Co 7:16 rendered unequal, by an appendage being attached to the second, which the first has not: besides that 1Co 7:17 would be disjoined altogether. (2) Pott would supply χωρίζεται , Mosheim, Vater, and Rückert, σώσεις , after εἰ μή . But so, to say nothing of the irrelevancy of the idea thus introduced, εἰ δὲ μή , or εἰ δὲ καὶ μή (as Meyer), would be required. (3) Theodoret, al., join all as far as κύριος to the foregoing: ‘ <em> What knowest thou, &amp;c., except in so far as the Lord has apportioned to each</em> ?’ But thus the evidently parallel members, ἑκάστ . ὡς ἐμ . ὁ κύρ ., and ἑκάστ . ὡς κέκλ . ὁ θ ., would be separated, and a repetition occasioned which, except in the case of intended parallelism, would be alien from St. Paul’s habit of writing.
