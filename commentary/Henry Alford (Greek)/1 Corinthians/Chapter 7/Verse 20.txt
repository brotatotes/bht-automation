<p><strong> κλῆσις</strong> is not the <em> calling in life</em> , for it never has that meaning either in classical or Hellenistic Greek (in the example which Wetst. gives from Dion. Hal. Antt. iv. 20, κλήσεις is used to express the Latin <em> ‘classes</em> ,’ <strong> ἃς καλοῦσιν Ῥωμαῖοι</strong> κλήσεις , and so is not a Greek word at all); but strictly <strong> calling</strong> (‘vocatio’) <strong> by God</strong> , as in ref. The κλῆσις of a circumcised person would be <em> a calling in circumcision</em> , and by this he was to abide.
