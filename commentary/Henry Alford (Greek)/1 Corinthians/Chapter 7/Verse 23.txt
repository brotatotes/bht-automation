But it is better to restrict it (however it may legitimately <em> be applied</em> generally) to the case in hand. Hammond, Knatchbull, Michaelis, al., understand it as addressed to the <em> free</em> , and meaning that <em> they</em> are not to <em> sell themselves into slavery</em> : but this is evidently wrong: as may be seen by the change to the <em> second person plur</em> . as addressing <em> all his readers</em> : besides that a new example would have been marked as in 1Co 7:18 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:21">1 Corinthians 7:21</span> .
