<p><strong> 25</strong> .] <strong> παρθένων</strong> is not, as Theodor-mops [29] , Bengel, Olsh., al., <em> unmarried persons of both sexes</em> , a meaning which, though apparently found in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+14:4">Revelation 14:4</span> (see note there), is perfectly unnecessary here, and appears to have been introduced from a mistaken view of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:26-28">1 Corinthians 7:26-28</span> .

	</p>
<p>The emphasis is on ἐπιταγήν <strong> command of the Lord have I none</strong> , i.e. no <em> expressed precept</em> : so that, as before, there is no marked comparison between ὁ κύριος and ἐγώ .
	</p>
<p><strong> πιστὸς εἶναι</strong> ] <strong> to be faithful</strong> , as in ref., as a steward and dispenser of the hidden things of God, and, among them, of such directions as you cannot make for yourselves, but require one so entrusted to impart to you. This sense, which has occurred in the estimate given of himself in this very Epistle, is better than the more general ones of <em> true</em> (Billroth, Rückert) or <em> believing</em> (Olsh., Meyer, De Wette).</p>
