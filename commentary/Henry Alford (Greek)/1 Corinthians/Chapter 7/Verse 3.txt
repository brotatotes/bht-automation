<p><strong> 3. </strong> <strong> τὴν ὀφειλήν</strong> ] ‘ <em> debitum tori</em> ’. The rec. was perhaps an euphemism (we have also the varieties, ὀφειλομένην τιμὴν , Chrysostom once: ὀφ . τιμὴν καὶ εὔνοιαν in the ms. 40) for the same thing. Meyer will not concede this, but thinks it arose from a mistaken interpretation of ὀφειλή as meaning <em> merely</em> ‘ <em> benevolentia</em> :’ thinking that not εὔνοια , but φιλότης would be the word in the other case. But some of the later examples in Wetst. seem to bear out this meaning of εὔνοια .</p>
