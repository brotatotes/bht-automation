<p><strong> 31. </strong> <strong> χρώμενοι</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> καταχρώμενοι</strong> ] The κατά , as in κατέχοντες , appears here to imply that intense and greedy use which turns the legitimate use into a fault. This meaning is better than ‘ <em> abuse</em> ,’ which is allowable philologically, and is adopted by Theodoret, Theophyl., Œc [32] , Luther, Olsh., al., but destroys the parallel. I would render them, <strong> and they who use the world, as not using it in full</strong> . So, or merely ‘as not using it,’ regarding καταχρ . = χρ ., Vulg., Calv., Grot., Estius, al., and Meyar and de Wette. χρῆσθαι with an acc. is found only here: never in classical Greek, and very rarely in Hellenistic. Almost the only undoubted instance (in ref. Wisd., A reads κτησάμενοι , and is supported by [33] 3a . In Xen. Ages. xii. 11, we have τὸ μεγαλόφρον … ἐχρῆτο , but most edd. read τῷ μεγαλόφρονι ) seems to be in a Cretan inscription, Boeckh, Corp. Inscr. ii. 400, καὶ τὰ ἄλλα πάντα χρήμενοι , ἐν δὲ τᾷ ὁδῷ τὰς ξενικὰς θοίνας . See Bornemann, note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:17">Acts 27:17</span> , where βοηθείας is a var. read. in some mss.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [33] The CODEX SINAITICUS. Procured by Tischendorf, in 1859, from the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai. The Codex Frederico-Augustanus (now at Leipsic), obtained in 1844 from the same monastery, is a portion of the same copy of the Greek Bible, the 148 leaves of which, containing the entire New Testament, the Ep. of Barnabas, parts of Hermas, and 199 more leaves of the Septuagint, have now been edited by the discoverer. A magnificent edition prepared at the expense of the Emperor of Russia appeared in January, 1863, and a smaller edition containing the N.T. &amp;c., has been published by Dr. Tischendorf. The MS. has four columns on a page, and has been altered by several different correctors, one or more of whom Tischendorf considers to have lived in the sixth century. The work of the original scribe has been examined, not only by Tischendorf, but by Tregelles and other competent judges, and is by them assigned to the <em> fourth</em> <em> century</em> . The internal character of the text agrees with the external, as the student may judge for himself from the readings given in the digest. The principal correctors as distinguished by Tischendorf are: A, of the same age with the MS. itself, probably the corrector who revised the book, before it left the hands of the scribe, denoted therefore by us א -corr 1 ; B (cited as א 2 ), who in the first page of Matt. began inserting breathings, accents, &amp;c., but did not carry out his design, and touched only a few later passages; C a (cited as א 3a ) has corrected very largely throughout the book. Wherever in our digest a reading is cited as found in א 1 , it is to be understood, if no further statement is given, that C a altered it to that which is found in our text; C b (cited as א 3b ) lived about the same time as C a , i.e. some centuries later than the original scribe. These are all that we need notice here.

<p><strong> παράγει γὰρ</strong> <strong> …</strong> ] <em> gives a reason for</em> ὁ καιρ . συνεσταλμ . ἐστ . τὸ λοιπ ., the clauses which have intervened being subordinate to those words: see above. Emphasis on <strong> παράγει</strong> <strong> :</strong> <strong> for the fashion</strong> (present external from, cf. Herodian i. 9 ἀνὴρ φιλοσόφον φέρων σχῆμα , and other examples in Wetst.) <strong> of this world is passing away</strong> (is in the act being changed, as a passing scence ina play: cf. πάραγε πτέρυγας , Eur. Ion, 165). This shews that the time is short: the form of this world is already beginning to pass away.

<p>Grot., al., according to the mistaken view of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:20">1 Corinthians 7:20</span> , ‘non manebunt, quæ nunc sunt, res tranquillæ, sed mutabuntur in turbidas.’ Theophyl. and many Commentators understand the saying of <em> worldly affairs in general</em> ἄχρις ὄψεώς εἰσι τὰ τοῦ παρόντος κόσμου , καὶ ἐπιπόλαια : but this is inconsistent with the right interpretation of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:29">1 Corinthians 7:29</span> ; see there. Stanley compares a remarkable parallel, 2Es 16:40-44 , probably copied from this passage.</p>
