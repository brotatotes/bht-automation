<p><strong> Divided also is the</strong> (married) <strong> woman and the virgin</strong> (i.e. <em> divided in interest</em> (i.e. in cares and pursuits) from one another: οὐ τὴν αὐτὴν ἔχουσι φροντίδα , ἀλλὰ μεμερισμέναι εἰσὶ ταῖς σπουδαῖς , Theophyl.: not merely, <em> different from one another</em> , as E. V., Chrys., Luth., Grot., al. <em> Divisa est mulier et virgo</em> D-lat G-lat Tert). It may be well to remark as to the reading, on which see Digest, that Jerome testifies to this having been the reading of the old Latin copies, and himself sometimes quotes the passage in this form; but, when speaking of it critically, he states that it is not in the “apostohca veritas,” i.e., it would seem, the Greek as understood by him. “ <em> Nunc illud breviter admoneo in Latinis codicibus hunc locum ita legi</em> : ‘Divisa est virgo et mulier;’ <em> quod quamquam habent suum sensum, et a me quoque pro qualitate loci sic edissertum sit, tamen, non est apostolicæ veritatis. Siquidem Apostolus ita scripsit, ut supra transtulimus</em> : ‘Sollicitns est quæ sunt mundi, quomodo placeat uxori, et divisus est.’ <em> Et hac sententia definita transgreditur ad virgines et continentes et ait</em> : ‘Mulier innupta et virgo cogitat quæ sunt Domini ut sit sancta corpore et spiritu.’ <em> Non omnis innupta, et virgo est. Quæ autem virgo utique et innupta est. Quamquam ob elegantiam dictionis potuerit id ipsum altera verbo repetere</em> , ‘mulier innupta et virgo:’ <em> vel certe definire voluisse quid esset innupta, id est virgo: ne meretrices putemus innuptas, nulli certo matrimonio copulatas</em> ” (Jer [34] contra Jovin. i. 13, vol. ii. p. 260). The sing. verb seems to be used, as standing first in this sentence, and because ἡ γυνὴ κ . ἡ παρθ . embraces the female sex as one idea: so e.g. Plato, Lys. p. 207, φιλεῖ σε ὁ πατὴρ καὶ ἡ μήτηρ : Herod. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:21">1 Corinthians 7:21</span> , εἵπετο γὰρ δή σφι κ . ὀχήματα κ . θεράποντες καὶ ἡ πᾶσα πολλὴ παρασκευή : q. d. ‘There loves thee father and mother,’ ‘there followed them,’ &amp;c. See more examples in Kühner, ii. p. 58 (§ 433, exception 1): Reiche thinks that one and the same woman is intended at different periods: but ἡ δὲ γαμήσασα is against this: it would be γαμήσασα δέ (Meyer).

<p>The judgment of marriage here pronounced by the Apostle must be taken, as the rest of the chapter, <em> with its accompanying conditions</em> . He is speaking of a pressing and quickly shortening period which he regards as yet remaining before that day and hour of which neither he, nor any man, knew. He wishes his Corinthians, during that short time, to be as far as possible <em> totally undistracted</em> . He mentions as an objection to marriage, that which is an <em> undoubted fact of human experience</em> : which is necessarily bound up with that relation: and <em> without which the duties of the relation could not be fulfilled</em> . Since he wrote, the unfolding of God’s providence has taught us more of the interval before the coming of the Lord than it was given even to an inspired Apostle to see. And as it would be perfectly reasonable and proper to urge on an apparently dying man the duty of abstaining from contracting new worldly obligations, but both unreasonable and improper, should the same person recover his health, to insist on this abstinence any longer: so now, when God has manifested His will that nations should rise up and live and decay, and long centuries elapse before the day of the coming of Christ, it would be manifestly unreasonable to urge, except in so far as every man’s καιρός is συνεσταλμένος , and similar arguments are applicable, the considerations here enforced. Meanwhile they stand here on the sacred page as a lesson to us how to regard, though in circumstances somewhat changed, our worldly relations; and to teach us, as the coming of the Lord may be as near now, as the Apostle then believed it to be, to act at least in the spirit of his advice, and be, as far as God’s manifest will that we should enter into the relations and affairs of life allows, ἀμέριμνοι . The duty of 1Co 7:35 fin. is incumbent on all Christians, at all periods.</p>
