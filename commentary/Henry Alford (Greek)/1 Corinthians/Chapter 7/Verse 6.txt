<p><strong> τοῦτο</strong> refers, not to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:2">1 Corinthians 7:2</span> , as Beza, Grot., and De Wette, because the precept there given depends on a <em> reason</em> also given, διὰ τὰς πορνείας , from the nature of which reason it <em> must be</em> κατ ʼ ἐπιταγήν : nor to the whole since <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:2">1 Corinthians 7:2</span> , as Billroth, Rückert, al., because the precept in 1Co 7:3 depends on the general truth in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:4">1 Corinthians 7:4</span> , and is also a command: nor to πρὸς καιρόν , as Theophyl.: nor as the ascetics, Orig [14] , Tert [15] , Jerome, Estius (also Calvin), to ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἦτε , because both these are but subordinate members of the preceding sentence: still less to <em> what follows</em> , as Rosenm., al.: but, as the context ( 1Co 7:7 ) shews, to the whole recommendation given in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:5">1 Corinthians 7:5</span> . This recommendation all depended on the possibility of their being tempted by incontinence: he gives it not then <em> as a command</em> in all cases, but <em> as an allowance</em> for those to whom he was writing, whom he knew, and assumes, to <em> be thus tempted</em> . The meaning ‘ <em> by permission,</em> ’ E. V., is ambiguous, appearing as if it meant <em> by permission of the Lord</em> ( <em> to say it</em> ): that given by Hammond, al., κατὰ τὴν ἐμὴν γνώμην , is philologically inadmissible.
