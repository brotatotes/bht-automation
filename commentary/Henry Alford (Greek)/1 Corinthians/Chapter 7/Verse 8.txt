<p><strong> 8. </strong> <strong> λέγε δέ</strong> ] taking up the former λέγω , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:6">1 Corinthians 7:6</span> , and bringing this advice under the same category as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:7">1 Corinthians 7:7</span> , viz. his own wish that all were as himself. The stress is on λέγω , not on τοῖς ἀγ . κ . ταῖς χ ., which would in that case be placed first, as τοῖς γεγαμηκόσιν below.

<p><strong> τοῖς ἀγάμοις</strong> <strong> , the unmarried</strong> , of both sexes: not as usually interpreted, <em> widowers</em> , or <em> unmarried males alone</em> : this is shewn by the contrasted term γεγαμηκόσιν , which embraces (see 1Co 7:10-11 ) <em> both sexes</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> καὶ ταῖς χήραις</strong> may be added as singling out widows <em> especially</em> ; or more probably, because τοῖς ἀγάμοις would naturally be taken as those who <em> never were married</em> , and thus widows would not be understood to be included.

<p><strong> καλόν</strong> , see on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span> , <strong> it is good for them</strong> , i.e. ‘their best way.’

<p><strong> ὡς κἀγώ</strong> ] i.e. ἄγαμος . This brings the Apostle’s own circumstances more clearly before us than <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:7">1 Corinthians 7:7</span> , which might be misunderstood: and there can be little doubt from this, that he <em> never was married</em> . Grot. says, “ex h. l. non improbabiliter colligitur, Paulo fuisse uxorem, quod et Clemens Alex. putat, sed cum hæc scriberentur, mortuam.” But this rests on the mistaken interpretation of ἀγάμοις noticed above. The passage of Clem [16] Alex. (Strom. iii. [6.] 53, p. 535 P., alluded to in Euseb. iii. 30) is grounded on Paul’s having in a certain epistle addressed τὴν αὐτοῦ σύζυγον , ἣν οὐ περιεκόμιζε , διὰ τὸ τῆς ὑπηρεσίας εὐσταλές . But the words σύνζυγε γνήσιε , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+4:3">Philippians 4:3</span> , certainly have no reference to a wife: see note there.
