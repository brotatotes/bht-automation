<p><strong> οὖν</strong> resumes a broken thread of discourse: so Plato, Apol. p. 29, ὥστε οὐδ ʼ εἴ με ἀφίετε … εἴ μοι πρὸς ταῦτα εἴποιτε , &amp;c.… εἰ <strong> οὖν</strong> με , ὅπερ εἶπον , ἐπὶ τούτοις ἀφίοιτε … See Hartung, Partikellehre, ii. 22.

<p><strong> We know that there is no idol in the world,</strong> i.e. that the εἴδωλα of the heathen (meaning not strictly the <em> images</em> , but the <em> persons represented by them</em> ) <em> have no existence</em> in the world. That they who worship idols, worship devils, the Apostle himself asserts ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:20">1 Corinthians 10:20</span> ; but that is no contradiction to the present sentence, which asserts that the deities imagined by them, Jupiter, Apollo, &amp;c., have <em> absolutely no existence</em> . Of that subtle Power which, under the guise of these, deluded the nations, he here says nothing. The rendering of Chrys., Theodoret, Theophyl. Œcum., Vulg., E. V., Luther, Beza, Grot., Est., al. (‘an idol is nothing in the world,’ ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:19">1 Corinthians 10:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+10:3">Jeremiah 10:3</span> . Sanhedr. 63. 2 (Wetst.), “noverant utique Israelitæ idolum nihil esse”), is certainly wrong here, on account of the parallel οὐδεὶς θεὸς εἰ μὴ εἷς which follows.

<p><strong> And that there is no god, but One</strong> : the insertion of ἕτερος has probably been occasioned by the first commandment, οὐκ ἔσονταί σοι θεοὶ ἕτεροι πλὴν ἐμοῦ .</p>
