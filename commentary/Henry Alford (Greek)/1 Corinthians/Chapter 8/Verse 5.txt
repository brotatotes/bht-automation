<p><strong> καὶ γὰρ εἰ</strong> , as Eur. Med. 450, καὶ γὰρ εἰ σύ με στυγεῖς , οὐκ ἂν δυναίμην σοὶ κακῶς φρονεῖν ποτε ; see Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 140 f.) <strong> beings named gods</strong> (not <em> those who are named gods</em> , <strong> οἱ</strong> λεγ . θ ., i. esset, <em> all</em> who are so named) EXIST ( <em> the chief emphasis is on</em> <strong> εἰσίν</strong> , <em> on which the hypothesis turns</em> ), <strong> whether in heaven, whether upon earth, as (we know that) there are</strong> (viz. as being spoken of, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+10:17">Deuteronomy 10:17</span> , ὁ γὰρ κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὑμῶν , οὗτος θεὸς <strong> τῶν θεῶν</strong> καὶ κύριος <strong> τῶν κυρίων</strong> , see also Psa 135:2-3 ) <strong> gods many, and lords many</strong> (the <strong> ὥσπερ</strong> brings in an acknowledged fact, on which the possibility of the hypothesis rests ‘ <em> Even if some of the many gods and many lords whom we know to exist, be actually identical with the heathen idols</em> …’ The Apostle does not <em> concede this</em> , but only <em> puts</em> it). This exegesis, which is Meyer’s, is denied by De Wette, who takes εἴπερ as concessive, ‘ <em> even though</em> ,’ and understands εἰσίν both times as only ‘ <em> are</em> ,’ <em> in the meaning of the heathen</em> , imagining it impossible that Paul should have seriously said in an objective sense, ‘ <em> there are gods many</em> .’ But in the sense in which he uses θεοί (see above) there is no unlikelihood that he should assert this.

<p>Chrys. gives the following explanation: καὶ γὰρ εἴπερ εἰσὶ λεγόμενοι θεοί , ὥσπερ οὖν καὶ εἰσίν , οὐχ ἁπλῶς εἰσίν , ἀλλά , λεγόμενοι , οὐκ ἐν πράγματι , ἀλλ ʼ ἐν ῥήματι τοῦτο ἔχοντες · εἴτε ἐν οὐρανῷ , εἴτε ἐπὶ γῆς · ἐν οὐρανῷ τὸν ἥλιον λέγων κ . τὴν σελήνην κ . τὸν λοιπὸν τῶν ἄστρων χορόν · καὶ γὰρ καὶ ταῦτα προσεκύνησαν Ἕλληνες · ἐπὶ γῆς δὲ δαίμονας , καὶ τοὺς ἐξ ἀνθρώπων θεοποιηθέντας ἅπαντας . Hom. xx. p. 172. And similarly Theodoret, Theophyl., Œcum., Calv., Beza, Calov., Estius, Schrader, al. See the various minor differences of interpretation, in Pool’s Synopsis and De Wette: and a beautiful note in Stanley.
