<p><strong> 2, 3.</strong> ] The general deductions, (1) from a <em> profession of knowledge</em> , and (2) from the <em> presence of love</em> , in a man: expressed sententiously and without connecting particles, more, as Meyer observes, after the manner of St. John in his Epistles.

<p>On the text, see var. readd.

<p>The case supposed is the only one which can occur where love is absent and conceit present: a man can then <em> only think he knows</em> , no <em> real knowledge</em> being accessible without humility and love. Such a man <strong> knows not yet, as he ought to know</strong> : has had no real practice in the art of knowing.
	</p>
<p><strong> But if a man loves God</strong> (which is the highest and noblest kind of love, the <em> source</em> of brotherly love, 1Jn 5:2 ), <strong> this man</strong> (and not the wise in his own conceit) <strong> is known by Him</strong> . The explanation of this latter somewhat difficult expression is to be found in ref. Gal., νῦν δὲ γνόντες θεόν , <strong> μᾶλλον δὲ γνωσθέντες ὑπὸ θεοῦ</strong> <strong> .</strong> So that <em> here</em> we may fairly assume that he chooses the expression ἔγνωσται ὑπ ʼ αὐτοῦ <em> in preference</em> to that which <em> would have been</em> , had any object of knowledge but the Supreme been treated of, <em> the natural one</em> , viz. οὗτος ἔγνω αὐτόν . We cannot be said to <em> know</em> God, in any full sense (as here) of the word <em> to know</em> . But those who become acquainted with God by love, are <strong> known by Him</strong> : are the <em> especial objects of the divine Knowledge</em> , their being is pervaded by the Spirit of God, and the wisdom of God is shed abroad in them. So in ref. 2 Tim., ἔγνω κύριος τοὺς ὄντας αὐτοῦ . See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+1:6">Psalms 1:6</span> . “Cognitionem passivam sequitur cognitio activa c. xiii. 12. Egregia metalepsis: cognitus est, adeoque cognovit.” Bengel. γινώσκω does not seem, any more than יָדַע in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+1:6">Psalms 1:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+37:18">Psalms 37:18</span> , for which the LXX have γινώσκω , to signify <em> to approve</em> , any further than personal knowledge of an intimate kind necessarily involves approval.</p>
