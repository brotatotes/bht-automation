<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] <strong> Or</strong> (the other alternative being rejected) <strong> on</strong> OUR <strong> account</strong> ( δι ʼ ἡμᾶς , emphatic not on account of <em> men</em> generally, but as Estius, “propter nos evangelii ministros:” cf. the ἡμεῖς of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:11-12">1 Corinthians 9:11-12</span> , with which this ἡμᾶς is inseparably allied) <strong> altogether</strong> ( τὸ πάντως προσθείς ,.… ἵνα μὴ συγχωρήσῃ μηδ ʼ ὁτιοῦν ἀντειπεῖν τῷ ἀκροατῇ . Chrys. p. 183) <strong> does it</strong> ( ὁ νόμος : or perhaps ὁ θεός , but better the former, as above, τῷ θεῷ being only incidentally introduced as the confessed Author of the law, and ὁ νόμος remaining the subject of the sentence) <strong> say (this)?</strong> (on our account): <strong> for on our account it</strong> (viz. οὐ κημώσεις κ . τ . λ ., not, that which follows, q. esset γέγραπται ) <strong> was written: because</strong> (argumentative, as the <em> ground</em> of ἐγράφη , not, as in some of my earlier editions, containing the <em> purpose</em> of ἐγράφη , <em> expressed in its practical result</em> ) <strong> the plougher</strong> (not literal but spiritual, see below) <strong> ought to plough in hope, and the thresher</strong> ( <em> to thresh</em> , see var. readd.) <strong> in hope of partaking</strong> (of the crop). The words used in this sentence are evidently <em> spiritual</em> , and <em> not literal</em> . They are inseparably connected with δι ʼ ἡμᾶς which precedes them: and according to the common explanation of them as referring to a mere maxim of agricultural life, would have no force whatever. But spiritually taken, all coheres. “The command (not to muzzle, &amp;c.) was written on account of <em> us</em> (Christian teachers) because we ploughers (in the γεώργιον θεοῦ , ch. 1Co 3:9 ) ought to plough in hope, and we threshers (answering to the βοῦς ἀλοῶν ) ought to work in hope of (as the ox) having a share.” So Chrys. and Theophyl.: τουτέστιν , ὁ διδάσκαλος ὀφείλει ἀροτριᾷν , καὶ κοπιᾷν ἐπ ʼ ἐλπίδι ἀμοιβῆς κ . ἀντιμισθίας . So also Meyer and De Wette: but by far the greater part of interpreters (also Stanley) take it literally; understanding ἡμᾶς of mankind in general, and ὁ ἀροτριῶν and ὁ ἀλοῶν of <em> labourers in agriculture</em> . No minute distinction must be sought between the ἀροτριῶν and the ἀλοῶν . The former is perhaps mentioned on account of the process answering to the breaking up the fallow ground of Heathenism: the latter on account of its occurrence in the precept.</p>
