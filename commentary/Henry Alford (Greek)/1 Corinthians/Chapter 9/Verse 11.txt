<p><strong> 11</strong> .] The <strong> ἡμεῖς</strong> (both times <em> strongly emphatic</em> : we need sorely some means of marking in our English Bibles, for ordinary readers, <em> which words have the emphasis</em> ) is categoric, but <em> in fact</em> applies to Paul alone. The secondary emphasis is on ὑμῖν … ὑμῶν . It is one of those elaborately antithetical sentences which the great Apostle wields so powerfully in argument. The ἡμεῖς ἡμεῖς , being identical, stand out in so much the stronger relief against the triple antithesis, ὑμ <strong> ῖν</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> πνευματικά</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> ἐσπείραμεν</strong> , and <strong> ὑμων</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> σαρκικά</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> θερίσωμεν</strong> .

<p>If we read the subjunctive, for the usage after εἰ , see Winer, edn. 6, § 41. b. 2, end; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:5">1 Corinthians 14:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:10">1 Thessalonians 5:10</span> ; Kühner, § 818 A. 1. The usage is common in Homer, Od. α . 204, al. fr., doubtful in Her od. 2:13; 8:49, 118 , and hardly ever found in Attic writers. See Soph. Œd. Tyr. 198, εἴ τι νὺξ ἀφῇ , and Œd. Col. 1442, εἴ σου στερηθῶ .

<p><strong> πνευμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> and <strong> σαρκ</strong> <strong> .</strong> (see Rom 15:27 ) need no explanation. The first are so called as belonging to the <em> spirit</em> of man (De W. and Meyer, as <em> coming from the Spirit of God</em> ; but it is better to keep the antithesis exact and perspicuous), the second as serving for the nourishment of the flesh.</p>
