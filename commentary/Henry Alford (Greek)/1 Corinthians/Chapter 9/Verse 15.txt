<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] <strong> οὐδενὶ τούτων</strong> is best explained of the different forms of ἐξουσία , not, with Chrys. al., τῶν πολλῶν παραδειγμάτων πολλῶν γάρ μοι παρεχόντων ἐξουσίαν , τοῦ στρατιώτου , τοῦ γεωργοῦ , τοῦ ποιμένος , τῶν ἀποστόλων , τοῦ νόμου , τῶν παρ ʼ ἡμῶν εἰς ὑμᾶς γενομένων , τῶν παρ ʼ ὑμῶν εἰς τοὺς ἄλλους , τῶν ἱερέων , τοῦ προστάγματος τοῦ χριστοῦ , οὐδενὶ τούτων ἐπείσθην εἰς τὸ καταλῦσαι τὸν ἐμαυτοῦ νόμον , καὶ λαβεῖν . Hom. xxii. p. 193. True, that each of these examples pointed to a form of ἐξουσία , and none of <em> these forms</em> had he <em> made use of</em> . See ref. on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:21">1 Corinthians 7:21</span> .

<p><strong> ἔγραψα</strong> is the epistolary aorist <strong> I wrote</strong> (write) <strong> not these things however, that it may be thus</strong> (viz. after the examples which I have alleged) <strong> done to me</strong> (in my case, see reff.): <strong> for it were good</strong> (reff.) <strong> for me rather to die</strong> (or, <em> better for me to die</em> , see ref. Mark) <strong> than that any one should make void</strong> (the remarkable reading of the great MSS. appears to have arisen from the unnatural look of the future with ἵνα . It can only be explained by supposing an aposiopesis; the Apostle breaking off at ἤ , and exclaiming with fervour, τὸ καύχημά μου οὐδεὶς κενώσει ) <strong> my (matter of) boasting</strong> . To understand ἀποθανεῖν as Chrys., Theophyl., Œc [41] , Estius, Billroth, al., ἀποθ . <strong> λιμῷ</strong> , seems quite unnecessary. Further on, Chrys. himself expresses the true sense: οὕτω καὶ ζωῆς αὐτῷ γλυκύτερον ἦν τὸ γινόμενον : and Calvin, “tantum Evangelii promovendi facultatem nimirum propriæ vitæ præferebat.”
