<p><strong> εἰ</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> οὐκ εἰμί</strong> ] <strong> οὐκ</strong> , because it belongs closely to the hypothesis: ‘if I am <em> no-Apostle</em> ,’ see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:9">1 Corinthians 7:9</span> .

Their <em> conversion</em> was the great proof: so Theodoret, ἀπόδειξιν γὰρ τῶν ἀποστολικῶν κατορθωμάτων τὴν ὑμετέραν ἔχω μεταβολήν .

<p><strong> ἐν κυρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] belongs to the whole sentence, see above, on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span> .</p>
