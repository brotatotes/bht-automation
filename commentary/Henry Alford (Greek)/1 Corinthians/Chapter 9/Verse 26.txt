<p><strong> 26.</strong> ] <strong> I then</strong> ( ἐγώ emphatic recalls the attention from the incidental exhortation, and reminiscence of the Christian state, to the main subject, his own abstinence from receiving, and its grounds.

<p><strong> τοίνυν</strong> , as distinguished from other particles which imply restriction of what has been generally said to some particular object, indicates the <em> dropping of minute or collateral points, and returning to the great necessary features of the subject</em> , and this, as introducing some short and pithy determination or conclusion: see Hartung, Partikellehre, ii. 348. E.g., Xen. Cyr. vi. 3. 17, τούτων μὲν τοίνυν ἅλις εἴη , ἃ δὲ καιρὸς ἡμῖν εἰδέναι , ταῦτα , ἔφη , διηγοῦ ) <strong> so run as</strong> ( οὕτως ὡς , see reff.) <strong> not uncertainly</strong> (reff.: cf. also Polyb. iii. 54. 5, τῆς χιόνος ἄδηλον ποιούσης ἑκάστοις τὴν ἐπίβασιν : ‘ <em> uncertainly</em> ,’ i.e. without any sure grounds of contending or any fixed object for which to contend; both these are included. Chrysostom rightly brings it into subordination to the main subject, the participation with idolaters: τί δέ ἐστιν , οὐκ ἀδήλως ; πρὸς σκοπόν τινα βλέπων , φησίν , οὐκ εἰκῆ καὶ μάτην , καθάπερ ὑμεῖς , τί γὰρ ὑμῖν γίνεται πλέον ἀπὸ τοῦ εἰς εἰδωλεῖα εἰσιέναι , καὶ τὴν τελειότητα δῆθεν ἐκείνην ἐπιδείκνυσθαι ; οὐδέν . ἀλλ ʼ οὐκ ἐγὼ τοιοῦτος , ἀλλὰ πάντα ἅπερ ποιῶ , ὑπὲρ τῆς τῶν πλησίον σωτηρίας ποιῶ . κἂν τελειότητα ἐπιδείξωμαι , δι ʼ αὐτούς · κἂν συγκατάβασιν , δι ʼ αὐτούς · κἂν ὑπερβῶ Πέτρον ἐν τῷ μὴ λαμβάνειν , ἵνα μὴ σκανδαλισθῶσι · κἂν καταβῶ πλέον πάντων , περιτεμνόμενος καὶ ξυρώμενος , ἵνα μὴ ὑποσκελισθῶσι . Hom. xxiii. p. 201); so fight <strong> I, as not striking the air</strong> (and not my adversary). The allusion is not to a σκιαμαχία or rehearsal of a fight with an <em> imaginary</em> adversary, as Chrys. ( ἔχω γὰρ ὃν πλήξω ), Theophyl. al. m., but to a fight with a <em> real</em> adversary (viz. here, <em> the body)</em> in which the boxer vainly hits into the air, instead of striking his antagonist. So Entellus in the pugilistic combat, Æn. v. 446, ‘vires in ventum effudit,’ when Dares ‘ictum venientem a vertice velox Prævidit, celerique elapsus corpore cessit.’ See examples both of what is really meant, and of the σκιαμαχία , in Wetst.

<p>Obs., in both places οὐκ is used and not μή , as importing the matter of fact, and joined closely with the adverb in one case and the verb in the other.</p>
