<p><strong> 13, 14</strong> .] <em> Analogy of the maintenance of the Jewish priesthood from the sacred offerings, with this right of the Christian teacher, as ordained by Christ</em> .
	</p>
<p>Meyer rightly remarks, that <strong> οἱ τὰ ἱερὰ ἐργαζόμενοι</strong> can only mean the <em> priests, not including the Levites</em> : and therefore that both clauses apply to the same persons.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐργάζεσθαι</strong> , ἔρδειν , ῥέζειν , are technical words for the <em> offering of sacrifice</em> . See reff. to LXX.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἱεροῦ</strong> here, as θυσιαστηρίου is parallel with it below, is probably not ‘ <em> the sacrifice</em> ,’ ‘ <em> the holy thing</em> ,’ but <strong> the temple</strong> ‘ <em> the holy building</em> .’ Similarly Jos. B. J. v. 13. 6, makes the Zealots say, δεῖ … τοὺς τῷ ναῷ στρατευομένους <strong> ἐκ τοῦ ναοῦ τρέφεσθαι</strong> <strong> .
	</strong></p>
<p><strong> παρεδρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] So Jos. contra Apion. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span> , speaks of the priests as τῇ θεραπείᾳ τοῦ θεοῦ προσεδρεύοντας .
	</p>
<p>On the practice referred to, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:8">Numbers 18:8</span> ff.; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+18:1">Deuteronomy 18:1</span> ff.

<p><em> No other priesthood but the Jewish</em> can have been in the mind of the Apostle. The Jew knew of no θυσιαστήριον but <em> one</em> : and he certainly would not have proposed heathen sacrificial customs, even <em> in connexion with</em> those appointed by God, as a precedent for Christian usage: besides that the idea is inconsistent with οὕτως καί : see below.</p>
