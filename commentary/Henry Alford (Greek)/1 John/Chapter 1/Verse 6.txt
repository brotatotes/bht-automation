The 1st pers. plur. gives to the sayings a more general form, precluding any from escaping from the inference: at the same time that by including himself in the hypothesis, the Apostle descends to the level of his readers, thus giving to his exhortations the “come,” and not “go,” which ever wins men’s hearts the most) <strong> that we have communion with Him</strong> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span> . “Communion with God is the very innermost essence of all true Christian life.” Huther), <strong> and walk in the darkness</strong> ( <strong> περιπατῶμεν</strong> , as so often in N.

Episcopius, “hoc dicentes non facimus quod rectum est:” but is an independent proposition, answering to ἐν τῷ σκότει περιπατῶμεν , and asserting that all such walking in darkness is a not-doing of the truth. Christ is “the Truth:” and all doing the Truth is of Him, and of those who are in union with Him.
