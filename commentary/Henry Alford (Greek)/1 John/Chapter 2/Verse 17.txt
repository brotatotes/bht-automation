<p><strong> 17</strong> .] <strong> And the world is passing away, and the lust of it</strong> ( <strong> αὐτοῦ</strong> is subjective again: not as Lücke, Neander, Sander, objective, “ <em> the lust after it</em> ,” but as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:16">1 John 2:16</span> , which see on the construction: <strong> ἡ ἐπιθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτοῦ</strong> summing up in one the three which are there mentioned. <strong> παράγεται</strong> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:8">1 John 2:8</span> ; not declaring merely an attribute, that it is the quality of the world and its lust to pass away, but a matter of fact, that it is even now in act so to pass. See Meyer on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:31">1 Corinthians 7:31</span> . It is no objection to this, that the <strong> μένει</strong> , which is opposed to παράγεται , contains, not a matter of fact, but a qualitative predication. This is made necessary by the words εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα which that clause contains): <strong> but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever</strong> (in this latter member of the contrast, we have a clearly personal agent introduced: and therefore, as above remarked, we may expect that the former member also will have a like personal reference. But this expectation must not be pushed <em> too far</em> : seeing that in the κόσμος , the ungodly men, who are in all their desires and thoughts ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου , are included. They and their lusts belong to, are part of, depend on, a world which is passing away. On the other hand, eternal fixity and duration belongs only to that order of things, and to those men, who are in entire accordance with the will of God. And among these is <em> he that doeth that will</em> , which is (see 1Jn 2:3-6 ) the true proof and following out of love towards Him. As God Himself is eternal, so is all that is in communion with Him: and this are they who believe in Him and love Him, and do His will).</p>
