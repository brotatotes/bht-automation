<p><strong> 18</strong> .] <strong> Children</strong> ( <strong> παιδία</strong> , as before, is addressed not to any one class, but to all the readers), <strong> it is the last time</strong> (what is exactly the Apostle’s meaning by these words? Clearly, <em> in some sense or other</em> , that it is the last period of the world. For we must at once repudiate such views as that of Bengel, who, strange to say, seems to understand it as “ <em> extrema Johannis ætas</em> ,” and that of Steinhofer, who explains it to be John’s own time as the <em> close of the Apostolic age</em> : and even more decidedly that of Œc. ( ἔστι δὲ τὸ ἔσχατον καὶ κατὰ τὸ χείριστον ἐκλαθεῖν , ὡς ὅταν φαμέν , εἰς ἔσχατον ἀφῖγμαι κακοῦ ), Schöttgen, Carpzov., Rosenm., for all other reasons, and on account of the saying <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:1">2 Timothy 3:1</span> , ἐν <strong> ἐσχάταις</strong> ἡμέραις ἐνστήσονται καιροὶ <strong> χαλεποί</strong> .
	</p>
<p>These then being cleared away, we come to the view of Grot.: “ultimum tempus, ubi ad Judæos sermo est, significat tempus proximum excidio urbis ac templi et reipublicæ Judæorum,” proceeding to interpret the ἀντίχριστοι to be the many false Christs who arose in that period, and ἀντίχριστος to be the chief of them, Barchochebas. So Hammond, Mede, Lightfoot, Socinus: and similarly, but not so decidedly, Episcopius. But two sufficient replies may be given to this view. First, that thus these false Messiahs of the Jews must have gone forth ἐξ ἡμῶν , i. e. from the Christian Church, which they did not. Secondly, what would the approximation of the destruction of Jerusalem, viewed merely as a Jewish event (which it must be, on the hypothesis here, as <strong> ἐσχάτη</strong> would only be true as addressed to Jews), have to do with the subject of our Epistle?
	</p>
<p>And thus we have arrived at the views of those who recognize here the last age of the world, but are anxious to get rid of the idea that the Apostle, in thus speaking, regarded the coming of the Lord as near at hand, and endeavour to give some meaning to the expression which shall preclude this (to them) objectionable notion. Among these may be mentioned Calvin, and many of the elder Commentators (e. g. Aug [23] , Bed [24] , Schol. I., Œc., Thl.), who understand the <em> latter dispensation</em> : the time from Christ’s advent in the flesh to His coming to judgment. This is (Calv.) “ultimum tempus, in quo sic complentur omnia, ut nihil supersit præter ultimam Christi revelationem.” With this in the main, Beza, Wolf, Lücke, De Wette, Neander, Sander, also agree. But, apart from considerations of the unfitness of such an idea in the context, in which παράγεται , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:8">1 John 2:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:17">1 John 2:17</span> , and our <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:28">1 John 2:28</span> , shew that it is the coming of the Lord which is before the mind of the Apostle, this objection is fatal to it: that manifestly not this whole period itself, but some time within its limits is meant, from the nature of the sign given below, ὅθεν γινώσκομεν κ . τ . λ . If the whole Christian dispensation were intended by ἐσχάτη ὥρα , it would not be stated as a sign of its presence, that already there were many antichrists, but rather that already He was come who is to be the final revelation of the Father. The circumstance of there being already many antichrists, corresponds with a prophecy delivered by our Lord, not of the general character of the whole of the last dispensation, but of the particular character of the time preceding τὸ τέλος , to which prophecy and to which time the Apostle here beyond question alludes.

<p>Düsterdieck’s interpretation is founded in some respects on those of Socinus and Grotius, impugned above, but with this difference, that he believes the expression to refer to the destruction of Jerusalem considered not as a Jewish, but as a Christian event: as opening that period of judgment, which shall precede the end, and the length of which was no where laid down in our Lord’s prophecies, nor revealed to the Apostles. But thus, with all his anxiety to escape the ascribing to the Apostles a mistaken view as to the nearness of the Lord’s second coming, he does in fact fall unavoidably into that class of interpreters, by regarding that as left uncertain, of which the apostolic prophecies seem to speak with some certainty. And I believe that if we are to deal ingenuously both with words and with facts, we must recognize this difficulty here, as well as in such passages as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:52">1 Corinthians 15:52</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span> ff.; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span> ff.; and understand the Apostle to be speaking, as any one in any subsequent age of the Church might have spoken, and as we may speak now, of his time as being the last time, seeing that the signs of the last time were rife in it. How long it may please God to prolong this ἐσχάτη ὥρα , how long to permit the signs to continue which demonstrate each age of the church to have this character, is a question to which it was not given to him, and is not given to us, to reply. To him indeed many prophetic visions were given, and have been recorded for us; but what is their plain and unmistakable import, will only then be known, when it becomes necessary for the churches to see clearly the signs of His coming): <strong> and even as ye heard</strong> (in our preaching, when ye received the Gospel) <strong> that antichrist cometh</strong> ( <strong> ἔρχεται</strong> , the present of ordained fixity: “ <em> is to come</em> .” But who, and what, is <strong> ἀντίχριστος</strong> ? As far as the meaning of the word is concerned, it may mean, either 1) one who stands <em> against</em> Christ, or 2) one who stands <em> instead of</em> Christ. The latter meaning is strenuously maintained here by Grotius, who holds that our ἀντίχριστος here has nothing to do with the ἀντικείμενος of St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</span> ; that being “qui Deo summo se hostem profitetur,” whereas this is “qui se Christum facit:” understanding this and what follows (see above) of the ψευδόχριστοι prophesied of by our Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:5">Matthew 24:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span> . This he defends by ἀντιβασιλεύς , meaning a <em> viceroy</em> , not an adversary of the king. And as Düsterd. suggests, he might have cited more instances on his side: ἀντίψυχος , in Ignat. Smyrn. 10, p. 716; Eph. 21, p. 661; Polyc. 2, 6, pp. 721, 725, in the sense of ἀντίλυτρον : the Homeric ἀντίθεος , “equal to the gods:” ἀνθύπατος , a proconsul, &amp;c. But seeing that the other meaning, “adversarius Christi,” is also upheld by precedent, e. g. τύπος ἀντίτυπος , ἀντιφιλόσοφος , ἀντιφάρμακον , ἀντίθεος in Homer also = enemy to the gods (so Chrys. on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:4">2 Thessalonians 2:4</span> , ἀντίθεός τις ἔσται , κ . πάντας καταλύσει τοὺς θεούς , κ . κελεύσει προσκυνεῖν αὐτὸν ἀντὶ τοῦ θεοῦ ), ἀντιφύλαξ , ἀντιμαχητής , ἀντικάτων (the book written by Cæsar against Cato), &amp;c., it is clear that we cannot solve the doubt by philology alone, but must take into account other considerations. And first among these comes the fact, that St. John, who was acquainted with the form ψευδόχριστος , using as he does ψευδοπροφήτης , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span> , never uses it, but always (see reff.) this word ἀντίχριστος . Is it not hence probable that he intended to signify, not a false Christ, but an antichrist? Next, we may fairly allege the ancient interpretations, as shewing how Greeks themselves understood the word. In these we do not find a vestige of the meaning ψευδόχριστος being attached to the term ἀντίχριστος (Hippolyt. de Antichristo, § 6, p. 734, Migne, κατὰ πάντα ἐξομοιοῦσθαι βούλεται ὁ πλάνος τῷ υἱῷ τοῦ θεοῦ , is not really to the point; it does not give a meaning to ἀντίχριστος , but only alleges an undeniable feature in his character. The same may be said of Iren. Hær. v. 28. 2, p. 326, “ut sicut Christum adorent illum qui seducentur ab illo:” and of that of Hippolytus, de Christo et Antichristo, c. 49, p. 768, ἐξομοιοῦσθαι μέλλει τῷ υἱῷ τοῦ θεοῦ , and indeed of all the passages where the Greek Fathers, as Cyril, Theodoret, &amp;c., speak of the likeness of antichrist to Christ), but every where (see e. g. the quotations in Suicer) they interpret ἀντίχριστος by ἐναντίος τῷ χριστῷ . The most decided is Thl., πάντως ὁ ψεύστης ἐναντίος ὢν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ ἤτοι τῷ χριστῷ ἀντίχριστός ἐστι . So also the Latins: Tert [25] de præscr. hær. 4, vol. ii. p. 16, “qui antichristi, interim et semper, nisi Christi rebelles?” Aug [26] in loc., “Latine Antichristus est, contrarius Christo:” and so Bede [27] And lastly our 1Jn 2:22 is quite against Grot.’s view, where ἀντίχριστος is interpreted, not ὁ προσποιούμενος χριστὸν εἶναι , but ὁ ἀρνούμενος τὸν πατέρα κ . τὸν υἱόν , which is explained, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:23">1 John 2:23</span> , to be involved in ἀρνεῖσθαι τὸν υἱόν .

<p>Taking then ( ὁ ) ἀντίχριστος for Christ’s adversary, I would refer to the disquisition and summary of opinions in the Prolegomena to Vol. III. on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1">2 Thessalonians 2:1</span> ff., where the reasons which have induced me to expect a personal Antichrist are given in full: as are also the indications furnished by prophecy, and by the history of the church and the world, as to his probable character and work), <strong> even now there have arisen many antichrists</strong> (not, “even now many have become antichrists:” this would rather be ἀντίχριστοι γεγόνασιν πολλοί , or πολλοὶ ἀντίχ . γεγ . By the πολλοί being thrown between the subst. and the verb, it is shewn to be only an epithet, not the subject of the proposition. But what are we to understand the Apostle as saying? Is this fact alleged as a presumption that ὁ ἀντίχριστος is <em> near</em> , these πολλοὶ ἀντίχριστοι prefiguring and heralding him, or as a proof that he is come, being in fact the aggregate of these? The question is an important one, as affecting that of a personal or collective antichrist. And the first thing to be noticed in answering it is, that these ἀντίχριστοι πολλοί are explained by the Apostle himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:22">1 John 2:22</span> f., to be deniers of the Father and the Son: i. e. of the Son: and even more explicitly, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:3">1 John 4:3</span> , deniers that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. Here, however, this latter point is not yet brought out: here it is as ψεῦσται that we hear of them: as <em> deniers</em> of the truth, which Truth is Jesus Christ, the Son of God: as not having the Spirit, which is truth and no lie, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:27">1 John 2:27</span> . They are said to have gone forth from the Christian church, but not to have been ἐξ ἡμῶν , as their spirit ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ οὐκ ἔστιν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:3">1 John 4:3</span> . They are ἀντίχριστοι ; their spirit is τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ ἀντιχρίστου , ibid., of which the readers had heard that it should come, and it was in the world already. From much of this it might at first sight appear as if these ἀντίχριστοι in their aggregate formed ὁ ἀντίχριστος . But a nearer inspection will convince us that this cannot be so. ( ὁ ) χριστός and ( ὁ ) ἀντίχριστος stand over against one another, and analogy requires that if the one be personal, the other should be also. And in ch. 1Jn 4:3 we are not told that merely the spirit is ἀντιχρίστου , but that it is τοῦ ἀντιχρίστου , the personal reference being still kept. Again, we have ἔρχεται , the present future of prophetic fixity, in both places, here and in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:3">1 John 4:3</span> , set against γεγόνασιν and ἐστίν : and the verb itself, in its prophetic sense, one regularly used of Christ, as here of antichrist. So that our only refuge in order to consistent interpretation here, is to regard these ἀντίχριστοι πολλοί clothed with the attributes and having the spirit of ὁ ἀντίχριστος , as being his forerunners, in the sense of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</span> , τὸ γὰρ μυστήριον ἤδη ἐνεργεῖται τῆς ἀνομίας : meaning, as I have explained at length in the summary referred to above, that the antichristian principle was then, as it is now, and will be in every age, working, realizing, and concentrating itself from time to time, in evil men and evil books and evil days, but awaiting its final development and consummation in ( ὁ ) ἀντίχριστος , who shall personally appear before the coming of the Lord. In St. John’s time these ἀντίχριστοι πολλοί were to be seen in the early heretical teachers whose false and corrupting doctrine and practice was beginning to trouble the church. See again, Düsterdieck’s long and elaborate note, in which he has discussed all the difficulties of the subject. He in the main agrees with the conclusion given above; as do also De Wette, Lücke, Erdmann): <strong> from whence we know that it is the last time</strong> (these words are a formal statement of the connexion between the first and second members of the foregoing sentence, which without them it would be left for the reader to supply in his mind).</p>
