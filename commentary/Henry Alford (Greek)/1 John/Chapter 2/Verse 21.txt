<p><strong> 21</strong> .] <strong> I did not write to you</strong> (see on ἔγραψα above, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13-14">1 John 2:13-14</span> . It may refer either to what has immediately preceded, or to the whole Epistle: here probably to the immediately preceding) <strong> because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and because no lie is of the truth</strong> (i. e. coupling the fact of your knowledge of the truth with the fact that no lie is of the truth, I wrote to supply the link between these two, to point out to you the lie and the liar, that you might at once act on that your knowledge of the truth, and not listen to them that deceive you. Thus we keep <strong> ὅτι</strong> and <strong> καὶ ὅτι</strong> correlative. So Justiniani, Schlichting, and Neander: but almost all the expositors take the second ὅτι as dependent on οἴδατε , “because ye know the truth, and (also know) that no lie, &amp;c.” So Aug [34] , Bed [35] , Erasmus, Grot., Calvin, Luther, Estius, Corn.-a-lap., Socinus, Episcopius, Wolf, Whitby, Hammond, Lücke, Baumg.-Crus., De Wette, Sander, Düsterd., Huther, and many others. But this surely does violence to the construction: <strong> ὅτι</strong> οἴδατε αὐτήν , <strong> καὶ ὅτι</strong> … οὐκ ἔστιν . ὅτι twice repeated, and each time with an indicative verb, surely must be kept to one and the same meaning in both clauses. Nor does the sense gain any thing, as Düsterd. maintains. For their knowing the truth and their knowing that no lie is of the truth, the one a cognition of God and His Son, the other a mere apprehension of a truism, are no logical correlatives, nor can be concurrent reasons for the Apostle’s writing: whereas the two facts, the one, their knowing the truth, the other, that no lie belongs to that truth, are concurrent reasons for the Apostle’s writing: viz. that he may set plainly before them what the lie is, that they may at once discern their entire alienation from it. And this accordingly he proceeds to do in the next verse. As regards the construction of πᾶν ψεῦδος .… οὐκ ἔστιν , it is not, as so many of the Commentators, a Hebraism, but merely that common one of attaching the negative to the predicate, instead of to the subject. πᾶν ψεῦδος (every lie) ἐκ τῆς ἀληθείας οὐκ ἔστιν (is excluded from being of the truth)).
