<p><strong> 15 17</strong> .] <em> Dehortation from the love of the world</em> . The preceding designation of the different classes has been, as so frequently in St. John, their ideal designation, in the perfection of their several states of Christian life: and now, as so often, he brings that ideal state to bear on real temptations and duties. The love of the Father, the abiding in Him by His word abiding in them, the victory over him in whom ὅλος ὁ κόσμος κεῖται , these particulars have been enounced: and though there may be a more apparent reason why the young should have this dehortation addressed to them, and more apparent allusion to the νενικήκατε τὸν πονηρόν in the bringing out of the κόσμος , yet there can be no doubt that it is to <em> all</em> that this address is made. All are in the world, and as long as they are, are in danger of being betrayed by the senses to cleave to the things present and seen, to the forgetfulness of those which are absent and unseen. This general reference is shewn by the ἐάν τις which follows. <strong> Love not the world</strong> (what is <strong> ὁ κόσμος</strong> , in the diction of St. John? And what does he import by <strong> ἀγαπᾷν τὸν κόσμον</strong> ? When we read <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span> , οὕτως <strong> ἠγάπησεν</strong> ὁ θεὸς τὸν <strong> κόσμον</strong> , ὥστε τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν μονογενῆ ἔδωκεν , κ . τ . λ ., are we to understand the same thing by the words as here? and if not, are <em> both</em> κόσμος and ἀγαπᾷν taken in a different sense, or if one only, <em> which?</em> Beza replies, “Mundum considerat quatenus cum Dei voluntate non consentit, et enim amorem damnat qui nos a Deo abducit: alioquin dicitur Deus ipse suum mundum infinito quodam amore dilexisse, id est, eos quos ex mundo elegit,” The palpable error of this last “id est,” directs us to the right solution of both questions. The κόσμος in both cases is the same, the ἀγαπᾷν is different. In Joh 3:16 it is the love of divine compassion and creative and redeeming mercy: here, it is the love of selfish desire, cherishing avarice or pride. But then recurs our question, What is ὁ κόσμος ? And it is no easy one to answer. If we reply so as to make it <em> personal</em> , we are met at once by the difficulty of τὰ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ : from which we cannot escape by saying that these are as below ἡ ἐπιθυμία κ . τ . λ ., for none can be said ἀγαπᾷν τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν , but the ἐπιθυμία <em> is</em> the ἀγάπη . Hence some have been led to take these three, ἡ ἐπιθ . τῆς σαρκός , ἡ ἐπιθ . τῶν ὀφθ ., ἡ ἀλαζονεία τοῦ βίου , as put for the things desired, and the material of the ἀλαζονεία . So Calvin, Episcopius, Bengel: but this manifestly will not hold, owing to the opposition in 1Jn 2:17 between ὁ κόσμος κ . ἡ ἐπιθυμία αὐτοῦ on the one hand, and ὁ ποιῶν τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ on the other, which evidently requires that its first member should be personal as well as its second. And this last will be a weighty reason also against 2) taking ὁ κόσμος as merely material, the present order of things, in so far as it is alien from God. We are thus brought to a point, for our understanding of ὁ κόσμος , intermediate between personal and material. But then our question is, which of the two is to take the first place? Is ὁ κόσμος the world of matter, including the men who dwell in it, or is it the world of man, including matter as subordinate to man? If the former, we seem in danger of falling into a dualism, in which God and the world of matter should be set over against one another as independent existences: for thus the evil one, the ἄρχων τοῦ κόσμου , and his agents the κοσμοκράτορες , would themselves be included in the κόσμος , and adjuncts to the world of matter: a mode of thought which no where appears in the apostolic writings. We are thus narrowed to our other alternative, that of understanding ὁ κόσμος as of human persons, including the inferior ranks of created being, and the mass of inanimate matter which they inhabit. Let us see whether this view will meet the necessities of our text and of similar passages. Thus understood, the κόσμος was constituted at first in Adam, well-pleasing to God and obedient to Him: it was man’s world, and in man it is summed up: and in man it fell from God’s light into the darkness of selfish pursuits and ἐπιθυμίαι κοσμικαί , in and by which man, who should be rising through his cosmic corporeal nature to God, has become materialized in spirit and dragged down so as to be worldly and sensual and like him who has led him astray, and who now, having thus subjected man’s nature by temptation, has become the ἄρχων τοῦ κόσμου . And thus the κόσμος is “ <em> man and man’s world</em> ,” in his and its fall from God. It was this world which God loved, in its enmity to Him, with the holy love of Redemption: it is this world which we are not to love, in its alienation from Him, with the selfish love of participation. And this κόσμος is spoken of sometimes as personal, sometimes as material, according to the context in which it occurs. To give but a few decisive examples; of the purely personal sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:18">John 15:18</span> , εἰ ὁ κόσμος ὑμᾶς μισεῖ κ . τ . λ ., followed by εἰ ἐμὲ <strong> ἐδίωξαν</strong> , καὶ ὑμᾶς <strong> διώξουσιν</strong> , where the singular is broken up into the individual persons: of the purely material, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:9">John 11:9</span> , ἐάν τις περιπατῇ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ , οὐ προσκόπτει , ὅτι τὸ φῶς τοῦ κόσμου τούτου βλέπει . And in passages like the present, these two senses alternate with and interpenetrate one another: e. g. in τὰ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ , the κόσμος is apparently material and local: in the opposition which follows, between the love of the world and the love of the Father, the personal meaning begins to be evident: in what follows, πᾶν τὸ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ , which at first sight seems material, is explained by ἡ ἐπιθυμία τῆς σαρκός , κ . τ . λ ., which are the subjective desires of the τὰ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ , not the things themselves: then, finally, in 1Jn 2:17 where ὁ κόσμος καὶ ἡ ἐπιθυμία αὐτοῦ is opposed to ὁ ποιῶν τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ , it is plain that we have passed, by the transition in the last verse, from the material to the personal sense altogether. This account may serve to explain that which has given so much trouble to Commentators here, the question whether ἐπιθυμία is not put for the thing itself which is desired: the fact being that, the κόσμος including the material world <em> in</em> the men, the ἐπιθυμίαι , which are in the men, are in the κόσμος , as well as the things of which they are the desires, and which are in their turn included in them. See on the whole, the long and elaborate note in Düsterdieck, the results of which are nearly the same as those arrived at above. To detail all the shades of opinion, would be hopeless: they will mostly be found, classified and discussed, in the note referred to), <strong> nor yet</strong> (not = μήτε , but carrying with it an exclusive and disjunctive force, implying that what follows is not identical with what went before. That was spoken of the world itself, the totality: “have no love for this present world as such.” But an escape from this prohibition might be sought by men who would deny in the abstract the charge of worldly-mindedness, but devoted themselves to some one object of those followed by worldly men: so that it is necessary to add, after “Love not the world,” “no, nor any thing in it”) <strong> the things in the world</strong> (explained above: here, the objects after which the ungodly world’s ἐπιθυμία reaches out, and on which its ἀλαζονεία is founded). <strong> If any man</strong> (see on the same expression above, 1Jn 2:1 ) <strong> love the world, the love of the Father is not in him</strong> ( <strong> ἡ ἀγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τοῦ πατρός</strong> , love <em> to</em> the Father, as opposed to his love to the world: not as Luther (2), Seb.-Schmidt, and Calov., the love <em> which the Father hath shewed to us</em> : nor as Bengel, “amor Patris erga suos et filialis erga Patrem.” As Bed [22] , “unum cor duos sibi tam adversarios amores non capit.” Philo says, fragm. ex Joh. Damasceni sacris parallelis, p. 370 B (vol. ii. p. 649), ἀμήχανον συνυπάρχειν τὴν πρὸς κόσμον ἀγάπην τῇ πρὸς τὸν θεὸν ἀγάπῃ , ὡς ἀμήχανον συνυπάρχειν ἀλλήλοις φῶς καὶ σκότος ).
