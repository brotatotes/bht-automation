<p><strong> 26, 27</strong> .] <em> Conclusion of the section concerning antichrist</em> . <strong> These things I wrote to you concerning them that deceive you</strong> ( <strong> ταῦτα</strong> , the whole since <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span> . The pres. part. <strong> πλανώντων</strong> describes the occupation, the endeavour of the antichrists: what result it had had, is not expressed: some result seems implied by 1Jn 2:19 ). <strong> And you</strong> (the same anacoluthon rhetoricum as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:24">1 John 2:24</span> ; again setting his believing readers in marked contrast to the deceivers just mentioned), <strong> the anointing which ye received from Him</strong> (Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:25">1 John 2:25</span> ; see above, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:20">1 John 2:20</span> ; as also on χρῖσμα ) <strong> abideth in you</strong> (“habet hic indicativus perquam subtilem exhortationem, conferendam ad <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:14">2 Timothy 3:14</span> .” Bengel), <strong> and</strong> (“et ideo,” Beng.) <strong> ye have no need that any one teach you</strong> (the construction = χρείαν ἔχετε τοῦ διδάσκειν ὑμᾶς , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span> , or that with the simple infin., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:14">Matthew 3:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:16">Matthew 14:16</span> , al. See reff. The ἵνα in such cases cannot be pressed to its telic meaning; rather we should say that the clause beginning with ἵνα is epexegetical of the verb preceding. Some Commentators have understood the διδάσκειν of the teaching of the antichrists: so Corn.-a-lap., “non est necesse ut pseudo-apostoli et hæretici vos doceant veram fidem et doctrinam:” so Semler, Sander, al.: but manifestly from want of apprehension of the Apostle’s meaning. His assertions here are so many delicate exhortations, veiled under the declaration of their true ideal state of unction with the Holy Spirit who guides into all truth. If that unction were abiding in them in all its fulness, they would have no need for his or any other teaching. And in what is said, he does not indeed say that it is not abiding in them; but the contrary, thus reminding them what their real state is): <strong> but</strong> (contrast to the οὐ χρείαν ἔχετε ) <strong> as his anointing teacheth you concerning all things</strong> (if we read τὸ αὐτό , it is not, as Bengel, “semper idem, sibi constans:” but marks merely the identity of the anointing which they once received with that which was now abiding in them. On the reading, see the digest. Our διδάσκει ὑμᾶς περὶ πάντων is parallel to ὁδηγήσει ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν ἀλήθειαν πᾶσαν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:13">John 16:13</span> .
	</p>
<p>Two ways are open to us of taking what follows. Either 1) καὶ ἀληθές ἐστιν καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ψ ., καὶ καθὼς ἐδίδαξεν ὑμᾶς is all part of the protasis, which begins with ὡς above, and the apodosis begins with μένετε , or 2) the apodosis to ὡς κ . τ . λ . is καὶ ἀληθές ἐστιν κ . οὐκ ἔ . ψ ., and then comes a new protasis, κ . καθὼς ἐδ . ὑμ ., with its apodosis μένετε κ . τ . λ . The former view is taken by Œc. and Thl., by Lücke, De Wette, Neander, Düsterdieck, al.: the latter by Luther, Calv., Baumg.-Crus., Sander, Brückner, Huther, and indeed most Commentators. If we take the former, we must regard καὶ ἀλ . ἐ . κ . οὐκ ἔ . ψ . as a parenthetical insertion, stamping the character of the διδαχὴ περὶ πάντων just mentioned, and then καὶ καθὼς ἐδ . ὑμ . as a resumption, slightly varied, of ὡς … διδάσκει ὑμ . before. To this it is objected, that it is harsh, and not so like St. John’s style as the other: that καθώς does not naturally resume ὡς , nor καί , ἀλλά , nor the aor. ἐδίδαξεν the pres. διδάσκει : that περὶ πάντων in the former clause has no correspondent in μένετε ἐν αὐτῷ in the latter. But it is answered on the other side, that these divergences from the former expression are entirely in accordance with the vivid and rapid movement of the thought in the Apostle’s style, and cannot in any way tend to obscure the connexion. The ἀλλά above was occasioned by the preceding οὐ χρείαν ἔχετε ἵνα , whereas the καί before καθώς seems to take up again the construction broken by the parenthesis κ . ἀλ .… ψ . Again καθώς , the fuller and more precise conjunction, not only repeats but enforces the ὡς above. And the change of the pres. διδάσκει into the aor. ἐδίδαξεν is no objection, but a recommendation, to this view. For by it we have, as so often in St. John’s repetitions, a new side of the subject brought out: viz. the absolute historical fact, that at a certain time this teaching came to them from Christ, viz. when they heard the apostolic preaching: so that the ὡς διδάσκει , its enduring teaching, is not only taken up again but placed in a new light, by its commencement being referred to. And as to the last objection, which is Huther’s, of there being in the resumption no member corresponding to περὶ πάντων , it seems to me to amount to nothing. The correspondent member would be found not in the apodosis, μενεῖτε or μένετε , but in the resumption of the protasis: and there it may be well understood to be implied in ἐδίδαξεν , there being no reason why it should be again expressed. But against the second view there are weightier objections. First, the καί before ἀληθές is in this case no natural introduction to an apodosis. Huther compares it with the καί before ὑμεῖς in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:24">1 John 2:24</span> ; but that, giving (see there) the sense of “ye too,” is quite another thing. Here, there is no mutual correspondence, and the καί merely drags on the ear. Then, the apodosis thus introduced is no logical apodosis: “as it teaches you concerning all things, (so) it is true and is not a lie,” is not a connected judgment: its being true and not a lie may be an authoritative assertion inserted by way of reminding, but cannot be a logical inference from its teaching being universal; for universal teaching may be false, as well as true. For these reasons I prefer, and adopt the former rendering), <strong> and is true, and is not a lie</strong> ( <em> what</em> is true, and not a lie? the anointing itself, or that which it teaches about all things? Œc. and Thl. understand the latter: ἀληθές γάρ ἐστι κ . οὐκ ἔστι ψεῦδος ὃ δηλονότι ἐδίδαξεν ὑμᾶς . But the construction seems to require the other view: ἁληθές is in strict concord with τὸ χρῖσμα , and to supply τὸ διδασκόμενον would be very harsh. And this is quite correspondent to the fact that the Spirit who is this anointing, is the Spirit of Truth ( Joh 14:17 ) and therefore leads into all truth (ib. Joh 16:13 ). As Düsterd. remarks, “the chrisma which abides in and teaches believers, is essentially true, is not a lie, and hence nothing can come from it which is a lie”) <strong> and even as He</strong> (or, <em> it?</em> so Erasmus, paraphrasing χρῖσμα by ‘Spiritus’ and adding “perseveretis in eo quod Ille vos semel docuit;” and so Düsterd.: but the change to the aor. seems necessarily to refer to Christ as the subject, the ἅγιος from whom the χρῖσμα came, and who is ever in the Writer’s mind, a subject ever ready to be supplied) <strong> taught you, abide in Him</strong> (or, “in <em> it</em> ,” as Erasmus? or, in that which it teaches, as Baumg.-Crus.? Neither of these: for the <strong> μένετε ἐν αὐτῷ</strong> is immediately after repeated, and the reference of αὐτῷ fixed, by what follows, to be to Christ. (But I see that Estius, holding it improbable that this αὐτῷ refers to Christ, makes that also to mean “in eo quod doctum fuerat:” supplying “Christ” as a subject before φανερωθῇ .)
	</p>
<p>As regards <strong> μένετε</strong> , Huther, who upholds this reading, takes it as indicative here, and imperative in the next verse. But, apart from the arbitrariness of such a distinction, would it be quite true or according to the Apostle’s way of asserting as existent the ideal Christian state of his readers? True, he does assert that the chrisma μένει in them, and from that abiding, important consequences are hortatively deduced: one of the most important of which is, the enduring and ultimate abiding in Christ. Therefore I much prefer taking μένετε imperative. The reading μενεῖτε is variously understood: by Socinus, Corn.-a-lap., Estius, Lorinus, Semler, al., as an imperative: by others as a pure future: so Beza, “mihi videtur omnino servanda futuri propria significatio ut est optime sperantis:” and Bengel, “vim consolandi et hortandi habet hoc futurum.” But see Digest).</p>
