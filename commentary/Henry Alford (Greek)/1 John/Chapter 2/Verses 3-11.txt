<p><strong> 3 11</strong> .] <em> This communion with God consists, secondly, in keeping His commandments, and especially the commandment to love one another</em> . No new division of the Epistle begins, as in Sander: 1Jn 2:3 is closely joined to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5-6">1 John 1:5-6</span> , which introduced the first conditional passage 1Jn 1:7 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span> . The great test of communion with God, walking in the light, first requires that we confess our sins: next requires that we keep His commandments. So in the main Œc.: εἰρηκὼς ἄνω τοὺς εἰς τὸν κύριον πεπιστευκότας κοινωνίαν ἔχειν πρὸς αὐτόν , πιστωτικὰ τῆς κοινωνίας τῆς πρὸς αὐτὸν παρατίθεται . <strong> And in this</strong> ( <strong> ἐν</strong> , of the conditional element: in this is placed, on this depends, our knowledge. In ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24">1 John 3:24</span> (see below), the ἐν τούτῳ is resumed by ἐκ τοῦ πνεύματος οὗ ἡμῖν ἔδωκεν ) <strong> we know</strong> (pres.: from time to time, from day to day) <strong> that we have the knowledge of him</strong> (perf.: have acquired and retain that knowledge: and this ἐγνωκέναι is not, as some (Lange, Carpzov., Wahl) make it, the <em> love</em> of God, as neither of course is it mere theoretical knowledge: but is that inner and living acquaintance which springs out of unity of heart and affection), <strong> if</strong> (“St. John uses the formula ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν first as referring the demonstrative pronoun back to what has gone before, as e. g. in our <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:5">1 John 2:5</span> , and in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:10">1 John 3:10</span> . If however the demonstrative pronoun in this or a like formula looks onward, and the token itself, with the circumstance of which it is a token, follows, he expresses this token variously and significantly, according to the various shades of meaning to be conveyed. Sometimes the token implied in the demonstrative follows in a separate sentence, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:2">1 John 4:2</span> ; sometimes the construction is slightly changed, and the sentence begun with ἐν τούτῳ is not regularly brought to a close, but continued in a new and correlative form: e. g. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24">1 John 3:24</span> , where ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκ . is taken up by ἐκ τοῦ πν . And this way of expression is closely parallel to that where ὅτι completes the construction begun with ἐν τούτῳ . So ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:16">1 John 3:16</span> ; 1Jn 3:19 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9-10">1 John 4:9-10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:13">1 John 4:13</span> . In these cases, the full objective reality of the token as a fact, is set forth. It is an undoubted fact that He has given us of His Spirit, that He has sent His Son: and from these facts our inference is secure to the other facts in question, that He abideth in us, &amp;c. But in other passages, we find instead of this ὅτι , an ἵνα , as ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:17">1 John 4:17</span> (but see not there: the case surely is not quite parallel, H. A.), or an ἐάν , as here, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:35">John 13:35</span> , or ὅταν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:2">1 John 5:2</span> . This ἐάν , ὅταν , mark the token implied in ἐν τούτῳ as one not actually existent, an historical or objectively certain fact; but as a possible contingency, something hypothetically, and conditionally assumed: in other words as ideal.” Düsterdieck, pp. 172 f. And so here: the token, that we have the knowledge of Him, is present, <em> if</em> , posito that) <strong> we keep</strong> (pres., as a habit, from time to time, <strong> ἐντολαί</strong> being necessarily prescriptions regarding circumstances as they arise) <strong> His commandments</strong> (first as to the expression. St. John never uses the word νόμος for the rule of Christian obedience: this word is reserved for the Mosaic law, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:46">John 1:46</span> , and in all, fifteen times in the Gospel: but almost always ἐντολαί , sometimes λόγος θεοῦ or χριστοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:51">John 8:51</span> f., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:23">John 14:23</span> f., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:6">John 17:6</span> , our <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:5">1 John 2:5</span> . And as a verb he always uses τηρεῖν , very seldom ποιεῖν (only in the two controverted places, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span> , Rev 22:14 v. r.: ch. 1Jn 1:6 , 1Jn 2:17 are not cases in point). τηρεῖν keeps its peculiar meaning of <em> watching</em> , guarding as some precious thing, “observing to keep.” Next, <em> whose</em> commandments? The older expositors for the most part refer αὐτόν , αὐτοῦ , αὐτῷ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:3-6">1 John 2:3-6</span> , to Christ: so Aug [15] , Episcop., Grot., Luther, Seb.-Schmidt, Calov., Wolf, Lange, Bengel, Sander, Neander. Socinus inclines to this view, but doubtfully; Erasmus understands αὐτός <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:3-4">1 John 2:3-4</span> , of God, αὐτός and ἐκεῖνος <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:5-6">1 John 2:5-6</span> , of Christ. Most modern Commentators understand αὐτόν , αὐτοῦ , αὐτῷ throughout of God, and ἐκεῖνος of Christ. So Lücke, Baumg.-Crus., De Wette, Huther, Brückner, and in old times Bed [16] and Œc. That this latter is the right understanding of the terms, is supposed to be shewn by the substitution (?) in 1Jn 2:5 of τοῦ θεοῦ for αὐτοῦ , and its taking up again by ἐν αὐτῷ in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:6">1 John 2:6</span> , followed by καθὼς ἐκεῖνος περιεπάτησεν . But of this I am by no means thoroughly persuaded: see note, 1Jn 2:6 ).
