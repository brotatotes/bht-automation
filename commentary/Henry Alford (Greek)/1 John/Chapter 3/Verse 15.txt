<p><strong> 15</strong> .] <strong> Every one that hateth his brother is a manslayer</strong> (in these words, (1) the ὁ μὴ ἀγαπῶν which preceded is token up by πᾶς ὁ μισῶν : shewing, as most Commentators have remarked, that the two are identical: the living spirit of man being incapable of a state of indifference: that he who has banished brotherly love has in fact abandoned himself to the rule of the opposite state. In the ethical depth of the Apostle’s view, love and hate, like light and darkness, life and death, necessarily replace, as well as necessarily exclude, one another. He who has not the one, of necessity has the other in each case. (2) He who hates his brother is stated to be an ἀνθρωποκτόνος . The example given, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:12">1 John 3:12</span> , shewed the true and normal result of hate: and again in the Apostle’s ethical depth of view, as in our Lord’s own (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:21">Matthew 5:21</span> ff., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:27">Matthew 5:27</span> ff.), he who falls under a state, falls under the normal results of that state carried out to its issue. If a hater be not a murderer, the reason does not lie in his hate, but in his lack of hate. “Quem odimus, vellemus periisse,” says Calvin. Some would make ἀνθρωποκτόνος mean, a destroyer of <em> his own</em> soul: so Ambrose (partly), precat. ad Missam: Lyra (not Corn.-a-lap., as Düsterd. implies), Tirinus. But this, as well as the view (Corn.-a-lap., al.) that it is the murder of his brother’s <em> soul</em> which is intended, “provocando eum ad iram et discordiam,” errs by pressing the reference to the example of Cain above. Some again, as Sander, would interpret it by a reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span> , understood as pointing to the ruin of Adam by the Tempter. But as Düsterd. remarks (referring to a paper on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span> , by Nitzsch, in the Theolog. Zeitschrift, Berlin, 1822, Heft. 3, p. 52), far rather should we say that this passage throws back a light on that passage, and makes it likely that the case of Cain, and not that of Adam, is there referred to); <strong> and ye know that every manslayer hath not</strong> (is without the possession of) <strong> eternal life abiding in him</strong> ( <strong> οἴδατε</strong> , viz. by your own knowledge of what is patent, and axiomatic in itself. We must not fall into the error of referring the saying to the future lot of the murderer, as Bed [61] , “Etsi hic per fidem inter sanctos vivere cernitur, non habet in se perpetuo vitam manentem; nam ubi retributionis dies advenerit, cum Cain …, damnabitur:” it regards his present state, and is another way of saying that he μένει ἐν τῷ θανάτῳ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:14">1 John 3:14</span> . Eternal life, which abides in God’s children, which is the living growth of the seed of God in them, is evidenced by love: if the very crown and issue of hate, homicide, be present, it is utterly impossible that this germ of life can be coexistent with it; can be firmly implanted and abiding (cf. Joh 5:38 ) in the man.

<p>Socinus (and Corn.-a-lap.) gives the syllogism contained in these verses thus: “nullus homicida habet vitam æternam in se manentem: verum qui fratrem suum odit est homicida: ergo qui fratrem suum odit, non habet vitam æternam in se manentem. Hoc syllogismo probat Apostolus eum qui non diligit fratrem suum manere in morte”).</p>
