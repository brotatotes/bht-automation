<p><strong> 9, 10</strong> .] <em> The contrast taken up again</em> , and from the converse: he that is born of God cannot sin: he that does not righteousness, is not of God: i. e. is a child of the devil. Then we have the usual new particular, to give the transition note to that which is to follow, including in this last category him that loveth not his brother. <strong> Every one that is begotten of God, doeth not sin</strong> (the meaning of this declaration has been treated of above, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:6">1 John 3:6</span> . Here we meet it in its barest and plainest form the two states, being begotten of God, and sin, absolutely excluding one another), <strong> because His seed abideth in him</strong> (i. e. because that new principle of life from which his new life has unfolded, which was God’s seed deposited in him, abides growing there, and precludes the development of the old sinful nature. So the majority of the better expositors, defining somewhat differently, when they come to explain in detail this germ of spiritual life: Œc., ἤτοι (1) τὸ πνεῦμα ὃ διὰ τοῦ χαρίσματος ἐλάβομεν , … ἢ (2) καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ χριστὸς , ὃς ἐνοικῶν ἐν τοῖς πιστοὶς ποιεῖ αὐτοὺς υἱοὺς θεοῦ : Severus in Cramer’s Catena, ἡ τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος ἐπιφοίτησις δι ʼ ἧς ἀνεγεννήθημεν : so (1) Lücke, Düsterd.; “Spiritus sanctus et virtus ejus” Calvin, Beza; “gratia,” Lyra, Tirinus, Corn.-a-lap.; “nativitas spiritualis,” Estius, Luther; “vires regenerationis quæ a Spiritu sancto fit,” Seb.-Schmidt; “the power of the divine life,” De Wette (= τὸ πν . τοῦ θ .), Baumg.-Crus., Neander, Erdmann, De W.; “the spirit of man new begotten by the Spirit of God, in contrast to the flesh,” Sander. Some of the ancients understood it of the <em> word</em> of God, as in the parable of the sower, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:3">Matthew 13:3</span> ff. So Clem. Alex. (but not as exegesis on this passage: at least if the passage in Strom. i. 1. 1, p. 317 P be meant, ὁ Σαλομῶν ( Pro 2:1 ) … σπειρόμενον τὸν λόγον κρύπτεσθαι μηνύει καθάπερ ἐν γῇ τῇ τοῦ μανθάνοντος ψυχῇ , καὶ αὕτη πνευματικὴ φυτεία ), Aug [48] (Tract. v. § 7, vol. iii. p. 2016, “Semen Dei, id est, verbum Dei: unde dicit apostolus, Per evangelium ego vos genui, 1Co 4:15 ”), Bed [49] (h. l.), Luther (1), Spener, Grotius, Calov., Bengel, Benson, Whitby, Socinus, Schlichting, Rosenmüller, al. This last interpretation has been impugned by all the moderns, but I cannot see that they have made good their objection: the force of which, as stated by Huther and Düsterd., amounts to this; that the word of God is not so much the <em> Seed</em> , as <em> the means whereby the begetting to the new life takes place</em> (“ <em> das Mittel der Erzeugung des neuen Lebens</em> ,” Huth.). But whether we regard the generation of plants, or animal procreation, which latter is more in question here, what words can more accurately describe the office of the seed, than these? and what is the word of God but the continually abiding and working seed of the new life, in the child of God? Nay, it seems to be that exactly of which we are in search: not the Holy Spirit, the personal agent; not the power of the new life, the thing begotten; but just that which intervenes between the two, the word, the utterance of God dropt into the soul of man, taking it up by divine power into itself, and developing the new life continually. This is in the most precise and satisfactory sense the σπέρμα τοῦ θεοῦ : and on this all Scripture symbolism is agreed: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:23">1 Peter 1:23</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:18">James 1:18</span> . In fact the very passage which is the key to this, is <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:38">John 5:38</span> , τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔχετε ἐν ὑμῖν μένοντα . Nor should any exception have been taken by Huther and Düsterd. to the comparison with the parable of the Sower (“ <em> wie viele altere Ausleger mit ungeschickter Bergleichung von</em> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:3">Matthew 13:3</span> ff.,” Düsterd.), for though the attendant circumstances of generation are different, the analogy is the same.

<p>There is a novel and extraordinary rendering proposed by Bengel, who, after explaining σπέρμα by “verbum Dei cum sua virtute,” says, “vel potius sic: Semen Dei, i. e. is qui natus est ex Deo, manet in Deo. σπέρμα , natus. Tales sunt vere זֶרַע אֱלֹהִים , semen Dei: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mal+2:15">Malachi 2:15</span> :” and adopted by Sander, see above. This hardly needs refutation: we can only say that any one who can persuade himself that σπέρμα αὐτοῦ , anarthrous, and loco subjecti, can mean ὁ ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ γεγεννημένος , has, both philologically and exegetically, much yet to learn.

<p>The reason of this absence of the article is plain: the seed is thought of not individually, but categorically: q. d., “because seed of His abideth in him”); <strong> and he cannot sin</strong> (there is no climax in <strong> καὶ οὐ</strong> : if there is any, it rests entirely with <strong> δύναται</strong> . No explaining away of this declaration must be attempted, as is done by Corn.-a-lap., who understands it of <em> deadly</em> sin; by Aug [50] and Bed [51] , who confine the ἁμαρτάνειν to the violation of brotherly love: or as Grot. “res de qua agitur aliena est ab ejusmodi ingenio.” The Apostle is speaking not only of the ideal, but of the real state of those born of God: drawing the strongest possible contrast between the life of God and the life of sin, as excluding one another absolutely. And there is no contradiction between what is here said and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8-9">1 John 1:8-9</span> ; nay, rather that passage shews, by the strong desire to be cleansed from all sin, which it assumes, the same incompatibility as is here insisted on), <strong> because he hath been begotten of God</strong> (almost all the expositors, from the first times until now, make this ὅτι more or less represent ἐφ ʼ ὅσον , <em> in quantum, quam diu, quatenus</em> , and the like. And where τὸ ἐν αὐτῷ μένειν was the matter to be measured, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:6">1 John 3:6</span> , no doubt this might be: but τὸ ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ γεγεννῆσθαι is an absolute fact, to which an ἐφ ʼ ὅσον refuses to be applied: it either has been, or it has not been: its effect either endures, or does not endure. And in this last consideration lies the true solution of the difficulty. As before in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:6">1 John 3:6</span> , so now, the Greek perfect is especially to be held firm in our exegesis. The Apostle does not say οὐ δύναται ἁμαρτάνειν , ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ <strong> ἐγεννήθη</strong> : this would testify to a past fact, once for all occurring, without any reference to its present permanence: but he has said ὅτι ἐκ τ . θ . γεγέννηται , because he <em> has abiding in him</em> that his birth from God. So that the ἐφ ʼ ὅσον explanation, though falling far short of the real meaning, has at least a feeling after the truth of the Apostle’s assertion in it. The abiding force of this divine generation in a man, excludes sin (“qui eam indolem retinebit, non peccabit,” as Grotius, thus far right): where sin enters, that force does not abide: the γεγεννῆσθαι is in danger of becoming a γεννηθῆναι , a fact in the past instead of a fact in the present: a lost life, instead of a living life. And so all such passages as this, instead of testifying, as Calvin would have this one do (“Johannes non solum docet quam efficaciter agat semel Deus in homine, sed clare affirmat, Spiritum suum gratiam in nobis ad extremum usque persequi, ut ad vitæ novitatem inflexibilis perseverantia accedat”), to the doctrine of final perseverance of the regenerate, do in fact bear witness to the very opposite: viz., that, as the Church of England teaches, we need God’s special grace every day to keep us in the state of salvation, from which every act and thought of sin puts us in peril of falling away. Jerome, advers. Jovin. ii. 1, vol. ii, p. 321, quotes Jovinian as maintaining, from this verse, “eos qui fuerint baptizati a diabolo non posse tentari: quicunque autem tentati fuerint, eos aqua tantum et non spiritu baptizatos;” which view Lücke ascribes to his desire, in a spirit of ethical reform, to bring back men’s minds to the fundamental and ideal contrasts of Scripture itself. But surely in such a case, “a diabolo non posse tentari” was rather beyond the mark.

<p>Before leaving this important passage, I must quote Düsterdieck’s concluding remarks. “The difference between the older and more modern expositors (as Lücke, Rickli, De Wette, and Neander) lies in this, that the former are more anxious to moderate the details of the Apostle’s sentiment, and to tone down his assertion to the actual life of Christians, while the moderns recognize the full precision of the text as it stands, but then remind us that the ideal truth of the principle announced by St. John continually so to speak floats above the actual life of believers as their rule and aim, and that, in so far, the Apostle’s saying finds in such actual life only a relative fulfilment. None however of all the expositors, who in any way has recognized the ideal character of St. John’s view, has overlooked the fact, that even in the actual life of all that are born of God there is something which in full verity answers to the ideal words ‘they cannot sin.’ The children of God, in whom the divine seed of their eternal life abides, have, in reality, a holy privilege, as Steinhofer says, they sin not, and they cannot sin, just in proportion as the new divine life, unconditionally opposed to all sin, and manifesting itself in godlike righteousness, is present and abides in them. Expositors of all theological tendencies, in all times, e. g. Didymus, Œc., Est., Schlichting, Luther, Hunnius, Seb.-Schmidt, Calov., Bengel, Joachim Lange, Rosenm., Lucke, Neander, &amp;c. point to this, that the new life of believers, veritably begotten by regeneration from God, is simply incompatible with sin ( ἀνακόλουθον καὶ ἀνάρμοστον , Didymus); the life which essentially alienates the spirit from all sin ( ἀνεπίδεκτον ἁμαρτίας τὸν νοῦν ἡμῶν ποιεῖ , Œc.), fills it with an irreconcilable hate against every sin, and urges it to an unceasing conflict against all unrighteousness. Luther excellently says, that a child of God in this conflict receives indeed wounds daily, but never throws away his arms or makes peace with his deadly foe. Sin is ever active, but no longer dominant: the normal direction of life’s energies in the believer is against sin, is an absence of sin, a no-will-to-sin and a no-power-to-sin. He that is born of God has become, from being a servant of sin, a servant of righteousness: according to the divine seed remaining in him, or, as St. Paul says, according to the inner man (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:15">Romans 7:15</span> ff.), he will, and he can work only that which is like God, righteousness, though the flesh, not yet fully mortified, rebels and sins: so that even in and by the power of the new life sin must be ever confessed, forgiveness received (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8">1 John 1:8</span> ff.), the temptation of the evil one avoided and overcome (ch. 1Jn 5:18 ), and self-purification and sanctification carried on”).</p>
