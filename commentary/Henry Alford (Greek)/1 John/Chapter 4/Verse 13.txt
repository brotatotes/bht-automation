<p><strong> 13</strong> .] <strong> In this we know that we are abiding in Him and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit</strong> (nearly repeated from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24">1 John 3:24</span> . But why introduced here? In the former verse, the <em> fact</em> of His abiding in us was assured to us, if we love one another. Of this fact, when thus loving, we need a token. Him we cannot see: has He given us any testimony of His presence in us? He has given us such a testimony, in making us partakers of His Holy Spirit. This fact it is to which the Apostle here calls our attention, as proving not the external fact of the sending of the Son ( 1Jn 4:14 ), but one within ourselves the indwelling of God in us, and our abiding in Him. It is obvious that all inferences from the expression <strong> ἐκ</strong> τοῦ πν . against the personality of the Holy Ghost are quite beside the purpose: compare Act 2:17 with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:28">Joel 2:28</span> (Heb. and E. V.). We each have the indwelling of one and the same personal Spirit, but each according to our measure, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4">1 Corinthians 12:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:11">1 Corinthians 12:11</span> . One only had the Spirit without measure, in all His fulness: even Christ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:34">John 3:34</span> . And the presence of the Holy Spirit is most aptly adduced here where love is in question, His first fruit being love, and His presence being tested by His fruits).</p>
