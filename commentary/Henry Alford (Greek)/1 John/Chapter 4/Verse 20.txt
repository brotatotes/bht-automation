<p><strong> 20</strong> .] The connexion is most close: and the error great of those who, as e. g. Erdmann, have made a new section begin here. This ἀγάπη is universal, necessarily manifested in <em> both</em> of the two great departments of its exercise. Love, living and working in the heart as a principle, will fix first upon objects at hand and seen: those objects being natural objects for it to fix on. How then can a man love God, the highest object of love, who is removed from his sight, and at the same time refuse to love his brother, bearing the mark of a child of God, before his eyes from day to day? Put in a brief form, the argument, as connected with the last verse, is this: His love has begotten <em> us</em> anew in love: in this <em> us</em> are included our brethren; objects of our daily sight: if therefore we do not love them, we do not love Him. <strong> If any say</strong> (aor. “have said;” i. e. at any time: the saying once, rather than the habit, is the hypothesis) <strong> I love God, and hate</strong> (pres. of habit) <strong> his brother, he is a liar: for</strong> (here again the argument is enthymematic, and we must supply from our common sense ἐφελκυστικὸν γὰρ ὅρασις πρὸς ἀγάπην , Œc.: “oculi sunt in amore duces,” &amp;c.) <strong> he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen</strong> (perf.: and continues to feel the influence of that sight. We do not say “I have seen him” of the dead, but of the living only), <strong> cannot love God whom he hath not seen</strong> (St. John does not say that there is no love without sight; nor that we love all we see better than any thing we do not see: his argument rests on a deeper and truer position: viz. on that assumed in the word ἀδελφόν , which carries with it the consideration that he of whom it is said is begotten of God. Both ὁ ἀδελφός and ὁ θεός are used within the limits of the Christian life, of which that is true, which is unfolded ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1">1 John 5:1</span> , that this ἀδελφός as begotten of God is a necessary object of love to one that loves Him that begat him. <em> Here</em> , a lower step of the same argument is taken; but without this great truth, lying beneath the word ἀδελφός , it would carry no conviction with it).</p>
