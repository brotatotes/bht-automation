<p><strong> 3 b</strong> .] This has been already virtually explained on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span> . <strong> And this is the</strong> ( <strong> spirit</strong> ) (so nearly all the Commentators supply the ellipsis, and rightly. Episcopius, Valla, Zeger, the R.-Cath. Mayer, and Huther, render it, this is “proprium antichristi.” But this would not surely be τὸ τοῦ ἀντιχρίστου , but τοῦ ἀντιχρίστου only. None of the passages cited by Huther touch the point, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:21">Matthew 21:21</span> , τὸ τῆς συκῆς , “this of the fig-tree;” <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:24">1 Corinthians 10:24</span> , τὸ τοῦ ἑτέρου , “that which belongs to his brother;” <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:22">2 Peter 2:22</span> , τὸ τῆς παροιμίας , “that of the proverb;” <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:14">James 4:14</span> , τὸ τῆς σὔριον , “the event of to-morrow.” In every one of these the genitive belongs to the subject: but Huther would attach it to the predicate, “hoc est proprium antichristi,” in which case I cannot see how the article could be there. Besides, the ὃ ἀκηκόατε ὅτι ἔρχεται would be awkwardly said as applied merely to an abstract fact, the τὸ μὴ ὁμολογεῖν τὸν Ἰησοῦν , to which it must be referred if τοῦτο is subject, and the genitive imports <em> proprium antichristi</em> ) <strong> of antichrist (of) which ye have heard</strong> (the reference is not to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span> ( ἠκούσατε ), but to the course of their Christian instruction in which this had been taught them) <strong> that it cometh</strong> (the present used as so often of that which is a thing fixed and determined, without any reference to time: “ <em> that it should come</em> ” of the E. V. is in sense very good, but does not quite suit the perf. ἀκηκόατε , which seems grammatically in English to require “that it shall come;” “ <em> that it must come</em> ” would perhaps be better), <strong> and now it is</strong> (not, <em> now is</em> : this <strong> ἐστίν</strong> is not dependent on the preceding ὅτι , but introduces a fresh assertion) <strong> in the world already</strong> (viz., in the person of these ψευδοπροφῆται , who are its organs).</p>
