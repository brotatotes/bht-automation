<p><strong> ὁ ἐν ὑμῖν</strong> is most naturally understood of GOD, seeing that ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐστέ preceded; for he who is ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ has God dwelling in him. Though, as Düsterd. remarks, it matters not much whether we take it thus, or of the indwelling of God by His Spirit, or of the life of Christ in believers.

<p><strong> ὁ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ</strong> is the devil, the prince of this world. Having said this, he proceeds in the next verse to identify these false prophets with the κόσμος of which he has spoken.</p>
