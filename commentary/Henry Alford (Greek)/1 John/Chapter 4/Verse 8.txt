<p><strong> 8</strong> .] ( <em> Contrast</em> , but with some remarkable variations) <strong> he that loveth not</strong> (general, as before: no object: he that hath not love in him) <strong> hath never known God</strong> (aor.: hath not once known: has never had in him even the beginnings of knowledge of God: as Lücke, “ <em> noch gar nicht kennen gelernt hat</em> .” So that the aorist makes a far stronger contrast than the present οὐ γινώσκει would. That is excluded, and much more); <strong> because</strong> (reason why he who loveth not can never have known God. <strong> ὅτι</strong> cannot well be “ <em> that</em> ,” dependent on ἔγνω , as e. g. Tirinus (cited by Düsterd.) seems to make it: “non novit, saltem practice non ostendit se nosse et agnoscere, Deum esse … caritatem:” in that case it would be either οὐκ ἔγνω , ὅτι ὁ θεός … or οὐκ ἔγνω τὸν θεόν , <strong> ὅτι ἀγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐστίν</strong> ) <strong> God is love</strong> ( <strong> ἀγάπη</strong> , not ἡ ἀγάπη : love is the very essence, not merely an attribute, of God. It is co-essential with Him: He is all love, love is all of Him: he who has not love, has not God.

<p>It is not the place here to enter on the theological import of this weighty and wonderful sentence. It will be found set forth in Augustine, de Trinitate, ix. 2 ff., vol. viii. p. 961 ff.: in Sartorius, die Lehre von der heiligen Liebe, i. 1, and in the first of my Sermons on Divine Love, which are founded on Sartorius’s work. Düsterd. refers also to Nitzsch, über die wesentliche Dreieinigkeit Gottes, in the Studien u. Kritiken for 1841, 2, p. 337: and Liebner, Christologie, p. 135.

<p>But it may be necessary to put in a caution against all inadequate and shallow explanations of the saying: such as that of Grotius (after Socinus), “Deus est plenus caritate,” Benson, “God is the most benevolent of all beings: full of love to all His creatures,” Whitby, “The Apostle intends not to express what God is in his essence … but what He is demonstrativè, ἐνεργητικῶς , shewing great philanthropy to men:” Hammond, “God is made up of love and kindness to mankind:” Calvin, “hoc est quod ejus natura sit, homines diligere … de essentia Dei non loquitur, sed tantum docet qualis a nobis sentiatur:” &amp;c. &amp;c. In all these, in the two last by supplying an object, “homines,” which is not in the sacred text, the whole force of the axiom as it stands in the Apostle’s argument is lost. Unless he is speaking of the essential being of God, quorsum pertineat, to say that he that loveth not never knew God, because “God is love?” Put for these last words, “God is loving,” and we get at once a fallacy of an undistributed middle: He that loveth not never knew what love is: God is loving: but what would follow? that in as far as God is loving, he never knew Him: but he may have known Him in as far as He is just, or powerful. But take ὁ θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν of God’s essential being, as a strict definition of God, and the argumentation will be strict: He that loveth not never knew love: God is love (the terms are co-essential and co-extensive): therefore he who loveth not never knew God).</p>
