<p><strong> 11</strong> .] Wherein this testimony consists. <strong> And the testimony</strong> (just spoken of) <strong> is this, that</strong> (consists in this, namely, that …) <strong> God gave</strong> (not, “hath given.” This is of especial importance here, where not the endurance of a state, but the fact of the gift having been once made, is brought out. The present assurance of our possessing this gift follows in the next clause, and in 1Jn 5:12 ) <strong> to us</strong> (not “ <em> decrevit</em> ,” “ <em> promisit</em> ,” as Socinus, Schlichting, Episcopius, &amp;c., nor as Bed [78] , “dedit … sed adhuc in terra peregrinantibus in spe, quam daturus est in cœlis ad se pervenientibus in re”) <strong> eternal life, and</strong> ( ὅτι is not to be supplied, nor does this clause depend on αὕτη ἐστὶν κ . τ . λ ., but it is appositional and co-ordinate with it) <strong> this life is in His Son</strong> (is, as Düsterd. quotes from Joachim Lange, in Him, οὐσιωδῶς (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25">John 11:25</span> ; Joh 14:6 ), σωματικῶς ( Col 2:9 ), ἐνεργητικῶς ( 2Ti 1:10 ). Here again, as ever in this Epistle, we have to guard against the evasive and rationalistic interpretations of Socinus, Grotius, Schlichting, al., such as “vitæ æternæ a Deo consequendæ rationem totam inveniri in ipso Jesu” of Socinus: “ <em> in</em> pro <em> per</em> ,” and “ <em> est</em> pro <em> contingit</em> ,” of Grot.: “illa vita æterna ipsa est quam Jesus revelavit,” of the same).
