<p><strong> 18</strong> .] <strong> We know that every one who is born of God, sinneth not</strong> (see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:9">1 John 3:9</span> , from which place our words are almost repeated. As explained there and in our summary of these verses there is no real inconsistency with what has been just said. And that there is none the second member of the verse shews): <strong> but he that hath been born of God</strong> ( <strong> γεννηθείς</strong> , aor. this time. The perf. part. expresses more the enduring abidance of his heavenly birth, and fits better the habitual οὐχ ἁμαρτάνει : the aor. part., calling attention to the historical fact of his having been born of God, fits better the fact that the wicked one toucheth him not, that divine birth having severed his connexion with the prince of this world and of evil. So Düsterd. and Huther. See also the construction according to the true reading below. Sander, in apparent ignorance of the force of the tenses, has curiously taken them exactly vice versa: and Bengel has failed to hit the difference when he says, “Præteritum grandius quiddam sonat quam Aoristus: non modo qui magnum in regeneratione gradum assecutus, sed quilibet qui regenitus est, servat se.” The distinction is ingenious, but is not contained in the tenses) <strong> it keepeth him</strong> (“ <em> it</em> ,” viz. the divine birth, pointed at in the aor. part. γεννηθείς . So the vulg., but omitting the pendent nom., “sed generatio Dei conservat eum.” It is this, and not the fact of his own watchfulness, which preserves him from the touch of the wicked one: as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:9">1 John 3:9</span> , where the same is imported by ὅτι σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ μένει , κ . οὐ δύναται ἁμαρτάνειν , ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ γεγέννηται . The rationalistic Commentators insist on τηρεῖ <strong> ἑαυτόν</strong> , as shewing, as Socinus, “aliquid præstare eum atque efficere, qui per Christum regeneratus fuerit:” and the orthodox Commentators have but a lame apology to offer. Düsterd. compares ἁγνίζει ἑαυτόν ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span> . But the reference there is wholly different viz. to a gradual and earnest striving after an ideal model; whereas here the τηρεῖσθαι must be, by the very nature of the case, so far complete, that the wicked one cannot approach: and whose self-guarding can ensure this even for a day? Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span> , ἵνα τηρήσῃς αὐτοὺς ἐκ τοῦ πονηροῦ , which is decisive. There is a possible construction of the clause which I do not remember to have seen suggested, but which should hardly be left out of account. ὁ γεννηθεὶς ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ might be taken as meaning the Son of God: “He that was begotten of God keepeth him.” But this would hardly suit the analogy of the Epistle: see e. g. 1Jn 5:1 and note), <strong> and the wicked one</strong> (Satan: see reff. and notes) <strong> doth not touch him</strong> (Düsterd. approves of Calvin’s paraphrase, which is self-condemnatory “continet se in Dei timore, nec se <em> ita abripi patitur</em> , ut <em> exstincto pietatis sensu</em> diabolo et carni <em> totum se permittat</em> ” as the meaning of ὁ πον . οὐχ ἅπτεται αὐτοῦ . Of course the words must not be understood as saying that he is not tried with <em> temptation</em> by the evil one: but imply that as the Prince of this world had nothing in our blessed Lord, even so on His faithful ones who live by His life, the Tempter has no point d’appui, by virtue of that their γέννησις by which they are as He is. “Malignus appropinquat,” says Bengel, “ut musca lychnum, sed non nocet, ne tangit quidem”).</p>
