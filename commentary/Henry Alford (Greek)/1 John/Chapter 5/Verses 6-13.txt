<p><strong> 6 13</strong> .] As in the former portions, our communion with God who is light (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span> ff.) was treated, and our birth in righteousness from God who is righteous (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:29">1 John 2:29</span> ff.), by faith in Jesus the Son of God, so now we have another most important element of the Christian life set before us: the testimony to it arising from that life itself: <em> the witness of the spiritual life to its own reality</em> . This witness rests not on apostolic testimony alone, but on the Holy Spirit, which the believer has in himself ( 1Jn 5:10 ), and which is God’s testimony respecting His Son ( 1Jn 5:9-10 ), and our assurance that we have eternal life ( 1Jn 5:13 ).

<p>There is hardly a passage in the N. T. which has given rise to more variety of interpretation: certainly none which (on account of the apparent importance of the words interpolated after 1Jn 5:7 ) has been the field of so much critical controversy. Complete accounts of both the exegesis and the criticism will be found in the recent monographs on the Epistle: more especially in that of Düsterdieck. I shall indicate the more salient points of the divergent interpretations as I proceed.</p>
