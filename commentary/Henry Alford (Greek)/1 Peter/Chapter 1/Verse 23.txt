And the begetting cause of this new birth being God’s living and imperishable word, from that fact come in new considerations, enforcing that pure love which belongs not to a transitory and shifting but to an eternal and abiding state. <strong> Being born again, not of</strong> (out of, as origin) <strong> corruptible seed</strong> ( <strong> σπορά</strong> , not in its strict and proper sense, ‘ <em> sowing</em> ’ (ref. 4 Kings), but in its looser one of <em> seed</em> . And the seed spoken of is not, as Huther, that of plants; but the <em> semen humanum</em> , as the sequel shews), <strong> but incorruptible, by means of</strong> (not ἐκ this time. The word of God is not the begetting principle itself, but only that by which the principle works: as it were the coccus or grain which is the involucrum and vehicle of the mysterious germinating power. We are not regenerated ἐκ but διὰ λόγου . But on the other hand, the word itself is no mere perishing vehicle; no mere sacramental symbol, lost in the using: but it lives by and with the divine principle of life which it conveys and expands, and abides for ever. The <strong> ἐκ</strong> of origination rests in God Himself, the Father, who begat us of his own will: the <strong> διὰ</strong> of instrumentality moves on and abides for ever) <strong> the</strong> (the definite art. is necessary in English, for the very reason for which it is omitted in Greek: viz. to prevent the <strong> λόγου</strong> from becoming concrete, and keep it to its widest general and abstract reference) <strong> word of God, living and abiding</strong> ( <strong> ζῶντος</strong> is thrown forward, as an emphatic predicate, before θεοῦ . That the two participles belong to λόγου , not to θεοῦ , is decisively shewn by the sequel, where the abiding nature, not of God, but of the word of God, is set forth. Many, however, have taken them with θεοῦ ; so vulg. (“per verbum Dei vivi”), (not Œc. as commonly cited, for he says, <em> on this verse</em> , εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα δὲ μένειν αὐτὸ διαβεβαιοῦται ), Beza (who however prints “per verbum Dei vivum et permanentis,” <em> sic</em> ), Calv.
