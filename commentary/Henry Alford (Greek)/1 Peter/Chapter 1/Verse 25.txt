Yet it is not easy to see why it would have been more difficult to change ῥῆμα to λόγος than τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν to κυρίου . <strong> ῥῆμα</strong> is rather the word uttered, the ‘ <em> dictum</em> :’ λόγος , the word, uttered or unuttered, single or manifold, concrete or abstract) <strong> of the Lord</strong> (LXX, τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν : changed here probably on account of the application which follows, as De W.) <strong> remaineth for ever. And</strong> (the <strong> δέ</strong> applies what has gone before: the contrast being between the general truth and the particular identification) <strong> this</strong> ( <em> predicate</em> , logically considered, <em> not subject</em> , as Wies., al.: “The word which was &amp;c. is this very ῥῆμα here spoken of”) <strong> is the word which was</strong> (Angl. has been) <strong> preached to you</strong> (in the declaration of the gospel. <strong> εἰς ὑμᾶς</strong> , not merely the dative commodi ὑμῖν , but as addressed to you and diffused among you: see reff. The logical inference to be drawn is, ‘and consequently the word preached to you is imperishable and eternal, and demands of you that you earnestly and intently follow up that new life which by it has been implanted in you.’ Hence the connexion of ch. 1Pe 2:1-3 ).</p>
