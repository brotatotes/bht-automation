<p><strong> 11</strong> .] <strong> Beloved</strong> (as this word is only found once again in this Epistle, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:12">1 Peter 4:12</span> , we may apply to it Wiesinger’s remark, “The seldomer our Apostle uses this endearing term, the weightier it is where it does occur as the opening of a hortatory discourse”), <strong> I exhort you as sojourners</strong> (see ref. Eph. and note) <strong> and strangers</strong> (see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span> . This primary and literal meaning of the word is probably the uppermost one here, seeing that the Apostle is speaking of behaviour among the Gentiles. Still, from the more general reference of this first exhortation, the other and wider reference, “quia filii Dei, ubicunque terrarum agant, mundi sunt hospites” (Calv.), must not be left out of sight. These words, <strong> παροίκ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> παρεπιδ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , belong, not to παρακαλῶ , as Huther, al., but to ἀπέχεσθαι .

Here, it is, from the context, the walking and acting in the indulgence of these lusts which the Apostle is forbidding.
