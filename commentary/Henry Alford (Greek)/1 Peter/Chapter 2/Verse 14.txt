<p><strong> 14</strong> .] <strong> or to governors</strong> (“ <strong> ἡγεμόνες</strong> præsides provinciarum, qui a Cæsare mittebantur in provincias,” Gerh.) <strong> as to men sent</strong> ( <em> in the habit of being sent</em> , sent from time to time: the pres. part. describes the genus: the particular ἡγεμόνες would be described as πεμφθέντες ) <strong> through him</strong> ( <em> the king</em> , not κυρίου , as some, and Calvin very positively, “qui pronomen ad regem referunt multum falluntur.” But there can be little doubt that he is wrong. For first the analogy of the clauses, ὡς ὑπερέχοντι … ὡς δι ʼ αὐτοῦ πεμπομένοις , shews that the grounds of obedience in each case, all being alike διὰ κύριον , belong to the actually existing rights of power in that case. The king is supreme, in his own right: governors rule by delegation from the king, ‘ <em> mittuntur</em> ’ δι ʼ αὐτοῦ . Then, the right understanding of διὰ κύριον , as applying to all, forbids this view. For thus we should obey the king as ὑπερέχων , no mention of the Lord being made, whereas rulers are to be obeyed as sent by the Lord. Finally, the prep. <strong> διὰ</strong> , as distinguished from ὑπό , designates rather the subordinate than the original sender. A governor could surely not be said to be sent <strong> διὰ</strong> κυρίου ) <strong> for</strong> (to bring about) <strong> vengeance on</strong> (as in ref.: <strong> ἐκδίκησις</strong> , being a ‘vox media,’ has another meaning, that of “avenging of,” in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:7-8">Luke 18:7-8</span> . Œc., taking it in this latter meaning, gives a convenient limitation to the duty, which was the furthest possible from the mind of the Apostle: ἔδειξε καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ Πέτρος τίσι καὶ ποίοις ἄρχουσιν ὑποτάσσεσθαι δεῖ , ὅτι τοῖς τὸ δίκαιον ἐκδικοῦσιν ) <strong> evil-doers, and praise of well-doers</strong> .</p>
