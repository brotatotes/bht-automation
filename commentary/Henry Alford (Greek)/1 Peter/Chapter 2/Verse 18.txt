<p><strong> 18</strong> .] <strong> Ye servants</strong> ( <strong> οἰκέτης</strong> , a domestic servant: a milder designation than δοῦλος . Possibly, as Steiger supposes, it may be here used to include the ‘liberti’ who still remained in their master’s house), [ <strong> by being</strong> ] <strong> in subjection</strong> (the part. carries on, immediately, the πάντας τιμήσατε above; but also belongs, at a greater distance, to the whole of the last paragraph, as a general designation of the habitual conduct, in and by which they were to shew forth an honest conversation among the Gentiles) <strong> in all fear</strong> ( <strong> ἐν παντὶ φόβῳ</strong> provides, by its wide generality, for the case by and by to be specially commented on. <strong> φόβος</strong> , not merely the reverence of an inferior, but the awe of one in subjection) <strong> to your masters; not only to the good</strong> (kind) <strong> and considerate</strong> (see note, ref. Phil.: those who make reasonable allowances, and exact no more), <strong> but also to the perverse</strong> ( <strong> σκολιός</strong> = עִקֵּשׁ , ref. Deut.: crooked, in deviating from right and justice, see note on ref. Phil. These masters are, as Gerh., “sævi et intractabiles, duri ac morosi”).</p>
