Isa., πάντες ὡς πρόβατα ἐπλανήθημεν ): <strong> but ye have returned</strong> (not, “have been converted:” the 2 aor. pass. ἐπεστράφην occurs often in a middle sense, and it is impossible to press the passive: cf. Matt. ( Mat 9:22 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:13">Matthew 10:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:30">Mark 5:30</span> .

Job, as some): but the most likely account of the expression is, that the Apostle transfers the well-known name of the elders of the churches, <strong> ἐπίσκοποι</strong> , to the great Head of the Church, of whom they were all the servants and representatives.
