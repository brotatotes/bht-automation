This is decisively shewn by ὑμῶν below, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:7">1 Peter 3:7</span> . By the context <strong> γυναῖκες</strong> is shewn to be <em> wives</em> ) [ <strong> by being</strong> ] <strong> in subjection to</strong> (the participle, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18">1 Peter 2:18</span> ; carrying on the general πάντας τιμήσατε ) <strong> your own husbands</strong> ( <strong> ἰδίοις</strong> gives point to the obligation, but is without any distinctive emphasis: see the parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:22">Ephesians 5:22</span> , and note), <strong> that even if</strong> ( <strong> καὶ εἰ</strong> puts into climax the hypothesis: εἰ καί , only that which follows the καί , i. e. the fact assumed: see for the full elucidation of this, 1Co 7:21 note, and Winer, § 53. 7, Hermann on Viger, p. 832, Klotz, Devar. ii. 519 f., Hartung i. p. 139; the views of Hermann and Klotz differing slightly from the above and Hartung, but coming to the same in the end. In this place, as De Wette remarks, <strong> καὶ εἰ</strong> assumes as possible, the apparently exceptional case which may seem to justify the wives’ disobedience: εἰ καί would concede that the fact was so and direct notice to the fact itself) <strong> any</strong> (husbands) <strong> are disobedient to the word</strong> (in a state of unbelieving disobedience; most probably, though this is not directly nor necessarily assumed, heathens), <strong> they shall be won</strong> (see reff.: converted to faith and obedience: made a gain for Christian love, and for Christ Himself. Cf. Leighton: “A soul converted is gained to itself, gained to the pastor, or friend, or wife, or husband who sought it, and gained to Jesus Christ: added to His treasury, who thought not His own precious blood too dear to lay out for this gain.” On <strong> ἵνα</strong> with an indic. fut., see Winer, § 41. <em> b.</em> 1. b: and cf. reff.) <strong> without word</strong> (without the wives preaching to them, or exhorting them, but simply by your Christian behaviour. The grammarians call this way of speaking, in which a word ( λόγου ) is intentionally used in two different senses in the same sentence, <em> antanaclasis</em> . The other rendering, ‘ <em> without the word</em> ,’ is not indeed, as Wiesinger, precluded by the absence of the article, for λόγου , <em> indefinite</em> , might just as well, with the exclusive preposition ἄνευ , refer to the Gospel, but on account of the general improbability of such a saying, seeing that faith is grounded on hearing, and hearing on the word of God. Besides which, the wives’ conversation, being a shewing forth of obedience to the word, could not be said to produce its effect ἄνευ ( τοῦ ) λόγου . Œc. proposes a curious alternative rendering: ἄνευ λόγου , ἤτοι σχολάζοντος παντὸς λόγου καὶ πάσης ἀντιλογίας ἢ (then follows the interpretation as given above, but very well put) ὡς τῆς διὰ τῶν ἔργων ἐπιδείξεως κυριωτέρας οὔσης τῆς διὰ τῶν λόγων περιεργίας . ἄφωνον γὰρ ἔργον κρεῖσσον ἀπράκτου λόγου ) <strong> by means of the behaviour of their wives</strong> ,</p>
