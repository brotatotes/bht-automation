<p><strong> 7</strong> .] <em> Duty of husbands to their wives</em> . <strong> Ye husbands in like manner</strong> ( <strong> ὁμοίως</strong> , not as Est., Grot., Steiger, al., ‘ <em> vicissim</em> ,’ but referring back to the πάντας τιμήσατε ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:17">1 Peter 2:17</span> ; cf. τιμήν below. This has not been seen, owing to inattention to the aor. there: even Huther, who interprets ὁμοίως rightly, that there is a certain τιμή due to the wife, as to the husband and the master before, does not connect the idea with the general precept under which all these are ranged) <strong> dwelling</strong> ( <strong> συνοικεῖν</strong> is referred by the older expositors (e. g. Jerome contra Jov. i. 7, vol. ii. p. 248, Aug [10] in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+146:0">Psalms 146:0</span> , vol. iv. pt. ii. al.) to the ‘tori conjugalis consuetudo:’ but for this there seems no reason, as the word is often used of the whole conjugal life: so Kypke here, “ <em> connubio juncti vivant</em> : ad totum respicit vitæ consortium, in auo justo copulati matrimonio vitam transigunt. Est hæc frequentior vocis notio, quæ apud Græcos antiquiores, ni fallor, sola occurrit. Demosth. in Neæram, p. 534, scopum τοῦ συνοικεῖν esse dicit, ut liberi gignantur legitiml et ingenui, et ab hoc distinguit τὸ ἑταίρας καὶ παλλακὰς ἒχειν ”) <strong> according to knowledge</strong> (in an intelligent and reasonable manner, well aware of the ἀσθένεια spoken of below: see reff.) <strong> with the feminine as with the weaker vessel</strong> ( <strong> γυναικείῳ</strong> is an adj. not a subst. as Wahl: see reff. For <strong> σκεῦος</strong> , instrument, applied to the wife, see ref. 1 Thess. Here the man is a σκεῦος also; both being God’s instruments in His beneficent work of the multiplication of mankind. The higher use of the word as a vessel of grace, or of wrath, does not preclude the lower one which is most obvious here, where the married relation is the subject of consideration. On <strong> ἀσθενεστέρῳ</strong> , Bengel says, “comparativus: etiam vir habet infirmitatem:” and so Steiger: but this is plainly not so: the word ‘weaker’ being used as comparing with something which is stronger, viz. the man. Some, as Luth., Calv., Beza, Est., Grot., Hamm., E. V., join these words, ὡς ἀσθενεστ . κ . τ . λ ., with ἀπονέμοντες τιμήν . But this mars the parallelism and the sense. For the Apostle prescribes two things: 1. consideration for the wife, as of the weaker sex: 2. honour for the wife, as a fellow-heir of the grace of life. Œc. carries on the same idea, of not exacting too rigid accounts, as on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:6">1 Peter 3:6</span> ; τουτέστιν , αἴσθησιν λαμβάνοντες τῆς τοῦ θήλεος κουφότητος καί τοῦ εὐπαραφόρου ἐν πᾶσι , καὶ εἰς μικροψυχίαν εὐολίσθου , μακρόθυμοι γίνεσθε πρὸς αὐτάς , μὴ λόγον ἀπαιτοῦντες πικρῶς τῶν κατὰ τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτῶν εἰς ταμιείαν παρακατατιθέντων . But for this there does not seem any reason), <strong> giving</strong> ( <strong> ἀπονέμειν</strong> , to apportion, see reff.) <strong> honour as to those who are also</strong> (besides being your wives) <strong> fellow-inheritors</strong> (with you) <strong> of the grace of life</strong> (i. e. God’s gracious gift of life eternal: ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:4">1 Peter 1:4</span> ; 1Pe 1:13 suffice to clear the meaning, the former explaining κληρον ., the latter, χάρις . So that χάρις ζωῆς must not be weakened into χάρις ζῶσα with Erasm., nor into χάρις ζωοποιοῦσα with Grot. The reading συγκληρονόμοι , which it is now proved that [11] has not [Tischdf. however, though he assigns the ς to B 1 (appy), does not think it quite free from doubt], seems to have arisen from the mistaken joining of ὡς ἀσθ . κ . τ . λ . with ἀπονέμοντες τιμήν : see var. readd.): <strong> in order that your prayers be not hindered</strong> ( <strong> ἐγκόπτειν</strong> , ἐμποδίζειν , διακωλύειν , Hesych. The hindrance meant seems to be, that which would be occasioned by the man not giving his wife proper honour as a fellow-heir of the grace of life; in which case the peculiar promise of advantage in social united prayer would be lost: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:19">Matthew 18:19</span> . According to this view, the united prayers of man and wife are meant. And so most of the Commentators. Cf. Schol.-Matth., ὁ γὰρ περὶ τὴν οἰκίαν θόρυβος τῶν κατὰ θεὸν ἔργων ἐμπόδιον : and Lyra, “Cum vir et uxor non sunt bene concordes, minus possunt orationi vacare, et eorum orationes sunt minus exaudibiles.” De Wette understands it of losing the confidence requisite for (mutual?) prayer; Wiesinger, of the prayers of the husband alone. If ἐκκόπτεσθαι be read, it must be “be not cut off,” see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:22">Romans 11:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:24">Romans 11:24</span> ; 2Co 11:12 ).

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [11] The CODEX VATICANUS, No. 1209 in the Vatican Library at Rome; and proved, by the old catalogues, to have been there from the foundation of the library in the 16th century. It was apparently, from internal evidence, copied in Egypt. It is on vellum, and contains the Old and New Testaments. In the latter, it is deficient from Heb 9:14 to the end of the Epistle; it does not contain the Epistles to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon; nor the Apocalypse. An edition of this celebrated codex, undertaken as long ago as 1828 by Cardinal Angelo Mai, has since his death been published at Rome. The defects of this edition are such, that it can hardly be ranked higher in usefulness than a tolerably complete collation, entirely untrustworthy in those places where it differs from former collations in representing the MS. as <em> agreeing with</em> the received text. An 8vo edition of the N.T. portion, newly revised by Vercellone, was published at Rome in 1859 (referred to as ‘Verc’): and of course superseded the English reprint of the 1st edition. Even in this 2nd edition there were imperfections which rendered it necessary to have recourse to the MS. itself, and to the partial collations made in former times. These are (1) that of Bartolocci (under the name of Giulio de St. Anastasia), once librarian at the Vatican, made in 1669, and preserved in manuscript in the Imperial Library (MSS. Gr. Suppl. 53) at Paris (referred to as ‘Blc’); (2) that of Birch (‘Bch’), published in various readings to the Acts and Epistles, Copenhagen, 1798, Apocalypse, 1800, Gospels, 1801; (3) that made for the great Bentley (‘Btly’), by the Abbate Mico, published in Ford’s Appendix to Woide’s edition of the Codex Alexandrinus, 1799 (it was made on the margin of a copy of Cephalæus’ Greek Testament, Argentorati, 1524, still amongst Bentley’s books in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge); (4) notes of alterations by the original scribe and other correctors. These notes were procured for Bentley by the Abbé de Stosch, and were till lately supposed to be lost. They were made by the Abbate Rulotta (‘Rl’), and are preserved amongst Bentley’s papers in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge (B. 17. 20) 1 . The Codex has been occasionally consulted for the verification of certain readings by Tregelles, Tischendorf, and others. A list of readings examined at Rome by the present editor (Feb. 1861), and by the Rev. E. C. Cure, Fellow of Merton College, Oxford (April 1862), will be found at the end of these prolegomena. A description, with an engraving from a photograph of a portion of a page, is given in Burgon’s “Letters from Rome,” London 1861. This most important MS. was probably written in the <em> fourth century</em> (Hug, Tischendorf, al.).</p>
