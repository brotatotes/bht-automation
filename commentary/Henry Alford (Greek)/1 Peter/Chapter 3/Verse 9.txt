The word <em> blessing</em> , in E.

And this is obviously the right connexion; for, as Wies. remarks, it is not in order to inherit a blessing that we must bless; but because our portion is, blessing: and the reasoning is much as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:32">Ephesians 4:32</span> , χαριζόμενοι ἑαυτοῖς καθὼς καὶ ὁ θεὸς ἐν χριστῷ ἐχαρίσατο ὑμῖν ).</p>
