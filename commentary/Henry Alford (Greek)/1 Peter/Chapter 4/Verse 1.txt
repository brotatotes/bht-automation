<p><strong> 1</strong> .] <strong> Christ then having suffered in the flesh</strong> (see on <strong> σαρκί</strong> above, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:18">1 Peter 3:18</span> . This conclusion takes up again the ὅτι καὶ χριστὸς ἔπαθεν there, which led to the enlarging on the result of those His sufferings as regarded both Himself and us), <strong> do ye also arm yourselves with</strong> (put on as armour) <strong> the same mind</strong> (intent, resolution; scil., to suffer in the flesh, as He did. That this is the sense, is shewn, it appears to me, decisively by <strong> καὶ ὑμεῖς</strong> and <strong> τὴν αὐτήν</strong> . Those who, as Calv., Beza, Gerh., Beng., Erasm. Schmid, Wiesinger, al., take <strong> ἔννοιαν</strong> for ‘ <em> thought</em> ,’ and render the following <strong> ὅτι</strong> , ‘ <em> that</em> ,’ can give no adequate interpretation either to καὶ ὑμεῖς or to τὴν αὐτήν . The sentence, for them, stands as if it were ταύτην ἔννοιαν ὁπλίσασθε , ὅτι .… And when obtained, the expression, meaning only ‘remember, that,’ is surely mere rhetorical inflation. Wiesinger denies that ἔννοια ever means “intent” or “resolution;” and refers to Passow to justify his denial. But in Palm and Rost’s edn., the meaning <em> Gesinnung</em> is given, and borne out by Eur. Hel. 1026, ἱκετεύετε … Ἥρας δὲ τὴν ἔννοιαν ἐν ταὐτῷ μένειν , ἣν ἐς σὲ καὶ σὸν πόσιν ἔχει σωτηρίας : Isoc., p. 112 D, οὐ γὰρ ( οἱ θεοὶ ) αὐτόχειρες οὔτε τῶν ἀγαθῶν οὔτε τῶν κακῶν γίγνονται τῶν συμβαινόντων αὐτοῖς ( τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ), ἀλλ ʼ <strong> ἑκάστοις τοιαύτην ἔννοιαν ἐμποιοῦσιν</strong> , ὥστε δι ʼ ἀλλήλων ἡμῖν ἑκάτερα παραγίγνεσθαι τούτων : Diodor. Sic. ii. 30 says of the Chaldæans, that they regard the planets as ἑρμηνεύοντες τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τὴν τῶν θεῶν ἔννοιαν (var. εὔνοιαν ). The meaning then is, “arm yourselves also with the same purpose as that which was in Christ”); <strong> because</strong> (the <strong> ὅτι</strong> assigns a reason for the expression τὴν αὐτὴν ἔννοιαν <strong> ὁπλίσασθε</strong> : “and ye will need this arming, because, the course of suffering according to the flesh which ye have to undergo ending in an entire freedom from sin, your warfare with sin must be begun and carried on from this time forward”) <strong> he that hath suffered in the flesh is made to cease from sin</strong> (if actively expressed, the sentence, as Huther remarks, would be τὸ πάσχειν (rather τὸ παθεῖν ) πέπαυκεν αὐτὸν ἁμαρτίας : he is, by the very fact of having thus suffered, brought to an end with sin has no more to do with it: and by an inference, the suffering in the flesh, and the being made to cease from sin, are commensurate in their progress. Commonly, πέπαυται is taken in a middle sense, and παθών made = πάσχων : but neither of these is justifiable. On the sense see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:7">Romans 6:7</span> , ὁ γὰρ ἀποθανὼν δεδικαίωται ἀπὸ τῆς ἁμαρτίας . Here too there is surely throughout, though Weiss denies it, a presupposition of our being united to the sufferings of Christ, and not merely, ‘quoad’ ourselves, πάσχοντες σαρκί , but by virtue of union with Him, τῷ παθόντι , παθόντες and so divorced from all sin. That this sentence itself is general, and not to be understood <em> in itself</em> of Christ, is plain: equally plain, that He is the person hinted at in the background, and with reference to whom the general truth is adduced. The general assertion itself, here and in Rom. l. c., is enthymematic, resting on the fact that the flesh is the element of sin, and he that has mortified it by suffering has in the same proportion got rid of sin):</p>
