St. Peter himself ἐξενίζετο at our Lord’s sufferings, when he said ἵλεώς σοι , κύριε . On the construction with dat. of reference, cf. Brasidas, Thuc. iv. 85, θαυμάζω δὲ τῇ τε ἀποκλείσει μου τῶν πυλῶν , καὶ εἰ μὴ κ . τ . λ .: and Winer, § 31. 1. <em> f</em> ) <strong> the passing through the fire</strong> ( <strong> πύρωσις</strong> , lit. <em> burning</em> : in its later use, smelting, trying of metal by fire: cf. Psa 65:10 LXX, ἐπύρωσας ἡμᾶς , ὡς πυροῦται τὸ ἀργύριον : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="pr+27:21">Proverbs 27:21</span> , δοκίμιον ἀργυρίῳ καὶ χρυσῷ πύρωσις .
