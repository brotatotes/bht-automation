The aim of this verse is well given by Gerhard: “monuit hæc προθεραπεία ipsorum animos, ne perversis et præposteris illis impiorum judiciis ac blasphemis sermonibus turbentur, multo vero minus ad pristinorum vitiorum societatem sese pertrahi patiantur.” They <em> must</em> give offence to their former companions: for this there is no help) <strong> they are astonished</strong> (think it strange, as E.
