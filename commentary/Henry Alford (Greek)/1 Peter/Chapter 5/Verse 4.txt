Here, clearly of the second coming. It would not be clear, from this passage alone, whether St. Peter regarded the coming of the Lord as likely to occur in the life of these his readers, or not: but as interpreted by the analogy of his other expressions on the same subject, it would appear that he did), <strong> ye shall receive</strong> (reff.) <strong> the amarantine</strong> ( <strong> ἀμαράντινος</strong> is adj. from ἀμάραντος , the everlasting, or unfading, flower. Most Commentators have assumed without reason that it = ἀμάραντος , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:4">1 Peter 1:4</span> , unfading. Philostr. in Heroicis, p. 741, cited in Wolf, has ὅθεν καὶ στεφάνους ἀμαραντίνους εἰς τὰ κήδη πρῶτοι Θετταλοὶ ἐνόμισαν : see also Palm and Rost, sub voce. In the sense, there will be no difference: but the Apostle would hardly have used two derivatives of the same word, to express one and the same quality) <strong> crown</strong> (reff.) <strong> of His glory</strong> (or, of glory: but I prefer the other. That we shall share His glory, is a point constantly insisted on by St. Peter: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:1">1 Peter 5:1</span> , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:13">1 Peter 4:13</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span> ; and above all, 1Pe 5:10 below. This idea reaches its highest in St. John, with whom the inner unity of the divine life with the life of Christ is all in all. Cf. especially <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span> f.).</p>
