It is (see Winer, § 34. 2) much as when an adj. is made into a subst. governing a gen.: e. g. τὸ ἀμετάθετον τῆς βουλῆς <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:17">Hebrews 6:17</span> , τὸ ὑπερέχον τῆς γνώσεως <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:8">Philippians 3:8</span> , τὸ πιστὸν τῆς πολιτείας Thuc. i. 68, τὸ ὑπερβάλλον τῆς λύπης Plato, Phædr. 240 A) <strong> are being accomplished in</strong> ( <em> the case of</em> : the dat. of reference, as in γίνεσθαι ὑμῖν and similar phrases.
