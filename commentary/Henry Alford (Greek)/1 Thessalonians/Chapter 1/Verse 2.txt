<p><strong> 2</strong> .] <strong> εὐχαριστοῦμεν</strong> , coming so immediately after the mention of Paul, Silvanus, and Timotheus, can hardly be here understood of the Apostle alone, as Pelt, Conyb. and Hows., Jowett, al. For undoubted as it is that he often, e.g. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:1-2">1 Thessalonians 3:1-2</span> , where see note, uses the plural of himself alone, yet it is as undoubted that he uses it also of himself and his fellow-labourers e.g., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:18-19">2 Corinthians 1:18-19</span> . And so De W., Lünemann, al., take it here.

<p><strong> πάντοτε περὶ πάντων</strong> ] We have the same alliteration <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:20">Ephesians 5:20</span> . These words belong to εὐχαριστ ., not to μνείαν ποι . On these latter words see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:9">Romans 1:9</span> f.

<p><strong> ἀδιαλείπτως</strong> seems by the nearly parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:9">Romans 1:9</span> , to belong to μνείαν ὑμ . ποι ., not to μνημονεύοντες , as Lün., Pelt, al. Such a formula would naturally repeat itself, as far as specifications of this kind are concerned. Still it must be borne in mind, that the order there is slightly different.</p>
