<p><strong> 4</strong> .] <strong> εἰδότες</strong> refers back to μνημονεύοντες ; <strong> in that we know</strong> or <strong> for we know</strong> . Thdrt., Erasm., Grot., al., take it for οἴδατε γάρ , or εἰδότες ἐστέ , wrongly referring it to the Thessalonians: Pelt joins it with μνείαν ποιούμενοι : but the construction as above seems the best. <strong> ὑπὸ θεοῦ</strong> belongs to ἠγαπημένοι , as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span> , see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span> ; not to εἰδότες , as Est. thinks possible ( ὑπό for παρά ?), nor to ἐκλογήν either as E. V., ‘ <em> your election of God</em> ,’ which is ungrammatical (requiring τὴν ὑπ . θ . ἐκ .), or as Œc., Thl., all., ὑπὸ θ . τὴν ἐκλ . ὑμ . ( εἶναι ), which would introduce an irrelevant emphasis on ὑπὸ θεοῦ .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐκλογή</strong> must not be softened down: it is the <strong> election</strong> unto life of individual believers by God, so commonly adduced by St. Paul (reff.: and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:27">1 Corinthians 1:27</span> ; 2Th 2:13 ).
	</p>
<p><strong> ὑμῶν</strong> , objective genitive after ἐκλογήν knowing that God ἐξελέξατο ὑμᾶς .</p>
