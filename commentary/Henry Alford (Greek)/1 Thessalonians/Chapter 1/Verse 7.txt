<p><strong> πᾶσιν τοῖς πιστεύουσιν</strong> ] <strong> to the whole of the believers. </strong> <strong> οἱ πιστεύοντες</strong> , like ὁ πειράζων , designates the <em> kind</em> . Chrys. understands this participle as if it were πιστεύσασιν : καὶ μὴν ἐν ὑστέρῳ ἦλθε πρὸς αὐτούς · ἀλλ ʼ οὕτως ἐλάμψατε , φησίν , ὡς τῶν προλαβόντων γενέσθαι διδασκάλους … οὐ γὰρ εἶπεν , ὥστε τύπους γενέσθαι πρὸς τὸ πιστεῦσαι , ἀλλὰ τοῖς ἤδη πιστεύουσι τύπος ἐγένεσθε . But it was not so: for the only church in Europe which was in Christ before the Thessalonian, was the Philippian ( Act 16:12 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:1">Acts 17:1</span> , see ch. 1Th 2:2 ).

There is no reference, as Thdrt., to the Greeks being ἔθνη μέγιστα κ . ἐπὶ σοφίᾳ θαυμαζόμενα , and so their praise being the greater: these are mentioned simply because the Apostle had been, since their conversion, in Macedonia, and had left Silvanus and Timotheus there, and was now in Achaia.</p>
