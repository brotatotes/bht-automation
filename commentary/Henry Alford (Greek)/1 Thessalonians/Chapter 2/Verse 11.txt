<p><strong> ὡς ἕνα ἕκαστ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> ὑμᾶς</strong> ] The construction is that of nouns in apposition, in cases where the one designates the individuals of whom the other is the aggregate. In this case the noun of larger designation generally comes first. The simplest instance that can be given is ταῦτα πάντα , where ταῦτα is the aggregate, πάντα the individualizing noun (whereas in πάντα ταῦτα , ταῦτα is the individuals, and πάντα merely the adjective designation of their completeness): so here ἕνα ἕκαστον ὑμῶν … ὑμᾶς differs very little from πάντας ὑμᾶς . As regards the participles, the simplest way of constructing them is to supply ἐγενήθημεν , which has just preceded. Ellicott would rather regard them as an instance of St. Paul’s common participial anacolutha, which may also be: but here the construction is simple without such a supposition. Both <strong> παρακλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> and <strong> παραμυθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> seem here best taken, with Lünem., as applying to <em> exhortation</em> , but in a sense nearly allied to consolation: see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:3">1 Thessalonians 2:3</span> . The subject of the exhortation follows, <strong> εἰς τὸ</strong> κ . τ . λ .: and this would be closely connected with their bearing up under trouble and persecution: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:14">1 Thessalonians 2:14</span> ff.</p>
