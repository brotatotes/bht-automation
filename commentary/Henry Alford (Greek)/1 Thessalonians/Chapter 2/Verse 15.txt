<p><strong> τὸν κύρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀποκτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἰησ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is thus arranged to give prominence to <strong> τὸν κύρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , and thus enhance the enormity of the deed: it should be rendered <strong> who killed Jesus the Lord</strong> , <strong> τὸν κύρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> being in a position of emphasis.

<p><strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τοὺς προφήτας</strong> ] belongs to ἀποκτεινάντων (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:31-37">Matthew 23:31-37</span> ; Act 7:52 ), not to ἐκδιωξ . as De W. His objection, that all the prophets were not killed, is irrelevant: neither were they all persecuted. The ἰδίους of rec. appears to have been an early insertion: Tert. ascribes it to Marcion.

<p><strong> ἐκδιωξ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> drove out by persecution</strong> , viz. from among you, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span> ff., not for the simple verb διωξ . (De W.), nor does the preposition merely strengthen the verb (Lünem.), but it retains its proper meaning ( ὁ δῆμος αὐτῶν ἐξεδίωξε τοὺς δυνατούς , οἱ δὲ ἀπελθόντες … Thuc. i. 24), and the aorist refers it to a definite event, as in the case of ἀποκτεινάντων : when their <em> habit</em> is spoken of, the participles are <em> present</em> , e.g. ἀρεσκόντων and κωλυόντων below.

<p><strong> ἡμᾶς</strong> refers to Paul and Silas.

<p><strong> θεῷ μὴ ἀρεσκ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The <strong> μή</strong> gives a subjective sense: not exactly that of Bengel, al., ‘ <em> Deo placere non quærentium</em> .’ For in strictness, as Ellicott, the shade of subjectivity is only to be found in the aspect in which the subject and the participle is presented to the reader: and therefore can hardly be reproduced in English. Compare on the usage, Winer, edn. 6, § 55. 5, g. β , and Ellicott’s note here. In <strong> πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἐναντίων</strong> , most Commentators, and recently Jowett (see above), have seen the <em> odium humani generis</em> ascribed to the Jews by Tacitus (Hist. 1Th 2:5 ), and by several other classic authors (Juv. Sat. xiv. 103 ff. Diod. Sic. xxxiv. p. 524, &amp;c.). But it is hardly possible that St. Paul, himself a Jew, should have blamed an exclusiveness which arose from the strict monotheism and legal purity of the Jew: and besides this, the construction having been hitherto carried on by copulæ, but now dropping them, most naturally goes on from ἐναντίων to κωλυόντων , <strong> in that they prevent</strong> , and thus κωλ . specifies wherein the ἐναντιότης consists, viz. in opposing the salvation of mankind by the Gospel. So that the other seems to be irrelevant (so nearly Lünem.).</p>
