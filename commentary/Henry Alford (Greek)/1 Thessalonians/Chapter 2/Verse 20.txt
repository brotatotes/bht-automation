<p><strong> 20</strong> .] <strong> γάρ</strong> sometimes serves to render a reason for a foregoing assertion, by asserting it even more strongly, q. d. ‘it must be so, for the fact is certain.’ So Soph. Philoct. 746, “ δεινόν γε τοὐπίσαγμα τοῦ νοσήματος .” “ δεινὸν γάρ , οὐδὲ ῥητόν :” see Hartung, Partikell. i. p. 474. I should be inclined to ascribe to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:20">1 Thessalonians 2:20</span> , on this very account, a wider range than 1Th 2:19 embraces: q.d. <strong> you will be our joy in the day of the Lord: for ye are</strong> (at all times, ye <em> are</em> , abstractedly) <strong> our glory and joy</strong> . This seems to me far better than, with Ellic., to regard the γάρ as only ‘confirmatory and explicative.’</p>
