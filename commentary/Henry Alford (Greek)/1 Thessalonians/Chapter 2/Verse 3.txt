<p><strong> 3</strong> . <strong> παράκλησις</strong> ] <strong> exhortation</strong> to you, viz. our whole course of preaching. Supply is, not ‘ <em> was</em> ;’ cf. λαλοῦμεν below. “The two senses of παράκλησις , exhortation and consolation, so easily passing into one another (compare 1Th 2:11 ), are suggestive of the external state of the early church, sorrowing amid the evils of the world, and needing as its first lesson to be comforted; and not less suggestive of the first lesson of the Gospel to the individual soul, of peace in believing.” Jowett.

<p><strong> πλάνης</strong> ] here probably <strong> error</strong> . “The word is used transitively and intransitively. In the former case, it is ‘ <em> imposture</em> ’ ( Mat 27:64 ) or ‘ <em> seduction</em> ’ ( Eph 4:14 ): in the latter and more usual, <strong> error</strong> .” Lünem.

<p><strong> ἀκαθαρσίας</strong> ] hardly, as Chrys., ὑπὲρ μυσαρῶν πραγμάτων οἷον γοήτων κ . μάγων , though such a reference is certainly possible, considering the vile degradation of that class at the period, but here apparently of the impure desire of gain, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:5">1 Thessalonians 2:5</span> , where ἐν προφάσει πλεονεξίας seems to correspond with ἐξ ἀκαθαρσίας . Still such a meaning seems to want example. If it be correct, this represents (Lün.) the subjective side, the <em> motive</em> , as ἐκ πλάνης the objective side, the <em> ground</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν δόλῳ</strong> ] this of the <em> manner</em> , or perhaps, as Ellic., the <em> ethical sphere, in which</em> : ‘nor did we make use of deceit to win our way with our παράκλησις .’ See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span> .</p>
