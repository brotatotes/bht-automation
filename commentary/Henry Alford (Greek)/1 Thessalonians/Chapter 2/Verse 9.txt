<p><strong> 9</strong> .] <em> Proof of the dearness of the Thessalonians to Paul and his companions</em> : not of ἐγενήθ . ἤπιοι , to which it would be irrelevant, nor of their readiness to give their lives, &amp;c. (as Ellic.), for this verse does not refer to dangers undergone, but to <em> labour, in order not to trouble any</em> . It is no objection to this (Ellic.) that διότι κ . τ . λ . is a subordinate causal member of the preceding sentence, seeing that it is precisely St. Paul’s habit to break the tenor of his style by inserting confirmations of such clauses.

<p><strong> μνημ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is indic. ( γάρ ).
	</p>
<p><strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κόπον κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> μόχθον</strong> ] a repetition (reff.) to intensify as we should say <strong> labour and pains</strong> : no distinction can be established.

<p><strong> νυκτός</strong> first, not merely because the Jews and Athenians (‘Athenienses inter duos occasus,’ Plin. N. H. ii. 77) so reckoned it, but <em> for emphasis</em> , being the most noteworthy, and the <em> day</em> following as matter of course. See besides reff. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:31">Acts 20:31</span> .

<p><strong> ἐργαζόμενοι</strong> (reff.) in its strict meaning of manual labour viz., at tent-cloth making, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:3">Acts 18:3</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> πρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τὸ μὴ ἐπιβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> in order not to burden any of you</strong> , viz. by accepting from you the means of sustenance. One can hardly say with Chrys., ἐνταῦθα δείκνυσιν ἐν πενίᾳ ὄντας τοὺς ἄνδρας : for we know St. Paul’s strong feeling on this point, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:9-10">2 Corinthians 11:9-10</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> εἰς ὑμᾶς</strong> , <strong> to you</strong> not quite = ὑμῖν : the latter represents the preaching more as a thing <em> imparted</em> , this as a thing <em> diffused</em> . On the supposed inconsistency of the statement here with the narrative in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:0">Acts 17:0</span> , see Prolegomena, § ii. 3, and note.</p>
