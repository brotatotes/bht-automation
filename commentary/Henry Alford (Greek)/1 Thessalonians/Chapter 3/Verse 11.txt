<p><strong> 11</strong> . <strong> αὐτός</strong> ] Not as De W. in contrast with the δεόμενοι just spoken of, but as Chrys., αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ θεὸς ἐκκόψαι τοὺς πειρασμοὺς τοὺς πανταχοῦ περιέλκοντας ἡμᾶς , ὥστε ὀρθὴν ἐλθεῖν πρὸς ὑμᾶς , i.e. it exalts the absolute power of God and the Lord Jesus, if He expedites the way, it will be accomplished, <strong> αὐτός</strong> then is in contrast with <em> ourselves</em> , who have once and again tried to come to you, but have been hindered by Satan. Lünem. remarks that ὁ θεός is best taken absolute, and ἡμῶν referred to πατήρ only. More majesty is thus given to the αὐτὸς ὁ θεός , although αὐτός refers to the whole. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:16-17">2 Thessalonians 2:16-17</span> .

<p><strong> κατευθύναι</strong> ] not infinitive, but third person singular optative aorist. It certainly cannot be passed without remark, that the two nominatives should thus be followed, here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:16-17">2 Thessalonians 2:16-17</span> , by a singular verb. It would be hardly possible that this should be so, unless some reason existed in the subjects of the verb. Mere <em> unity of will</em> between the Father and the Son (Lünem.) would not be enough, unless absolute unity were also in the writer’s mind. Athanasius therefore seems to be right in drawing from this construction an argument for the unity of the Father and the Son.

<p><strong> πρὸς ὑμᾶς</strong> more naturally belongs to κατευθύναι than to τὴν ὁδὸν ἡμῶν , in which case it should be τὴν ὁδ . ἡμ . τὴν πρὸς ὑμ .</p>
