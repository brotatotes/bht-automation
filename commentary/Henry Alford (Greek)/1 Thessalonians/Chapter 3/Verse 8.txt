<p><strong> 8</strong> .] <strong> for now</strong> (not so much an adverb of <em> time</em> , here, as implying the fulfilment of the condition ( ἐάν ) which follows: so Eur. Iph. in Aul. 644: “ συνετὰ λέγουσα μᾶλλον εἰς οἶκτὸν μ ʼ ἄγεις .” “ ἀσύνετα <strong> νῦν</strong> ἐροῦμεν , <strong> εἰ</strong> σέ γ ʼ εὐφοανῶ .” See more examples in Hartung, Partikell. ii. p. 25; Kühner, ii. p. 185) we live (the ἀνάγκη and θλῖψις being conceived as a <em> death</em> : but not to be referred to <em> everlasting</em> life, as Chrys. ( ζωὴν λέγων τὴν μέλλουσαν ), nor weakened to ‘vivit qui felix est’ (Pelt), but with direct reference to the infringement of the powers of life by ἀνάγκ . and θλ ., as Lünem., “we are in full strength and freshness of life, we do not feel the sorrows and tribulations with which the outer world surrounds us”) <strong> if ye stand fast in the Lord</strong> . The conditional form of this last sentence, with <strong> ἐάν</strong> , not ἐπεί , carries it forward as an exhortation for the future also; while the solœcistic indicative gives the Apostle’s confident expectation that such would be the case. The reading must not be dismissed, as Ellic., by taking refuge in Scrivener’s assertion that permutations of similar vowels are occasionally found even in the best MSS. I have examined the Vatican Codex through the greater part of the N. T., and can safely say that these permutations are found only in such cases as Η , Ι , and ΕΙ , and Ο and Ω in doubtful inflexions, as ἑωρακ . and ἑορακ .; not in cases like the present, nor in any ordinary occurrences of long and short vowels.
