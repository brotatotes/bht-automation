<p><strong> περισσεύειν</strong> , viz. in this ἀγάπη . (But there does not seem any reason, with Jowett, to ascribe this αταξία to their <em> uneasiness about the state of the dead</em> : much rather (as he also states: see below) to their mistaken anticipations of the immediate coming of the Lord.) It would seem as if, notwithstanding their liberality to those without, there were some defect of quiet diligence and harmony within, which prompted this exhortation: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:11-12">2 Thessalonians 3:11-12</span> . Thdrt. assigns another reason for it: οὐκ ἐναντία τοῖς προῤῥηθεῖσιν ἐπαίνοις ἡ παραίνεσις . συνέβαινε γὰρ τοὺς μὲν φιλοτίμως χορηγεῖν τοῖς δεομένοις τὴν χρείαν , τοὺς δὲ διὰ τὴν τούτων φιλοτιμίαν ἀμελεῖν τῆς ἐργασίας · εἰκότως τοίνυν κἀκείνους ἐπῄνεσε , καὶ τούτοις τὰ πρόσφορα συνεβούλευσε . (So also Est., Benson, Flatt, Schott, and De W.) Lünem. objects to this, that thus the Church would be divided into two sections, the one exhorted to persist and abound in their liberality, the other to work diligently to support themselves; whereas there is no trace in the text of such a division. He therefore would abandon the idea of a connexion, and treat 1Th 4:11-12 as applying to a totally distinct subject; accounting for its introduction in such close <em> grammatical</em> connexion with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:10">1 Thessalonians 4:10</span> , by St. Paul’s rapid transitions in the practical parts of his Epistles. But we may well answer, that instances are frequent enough of exhortations being addressed to whole churches which in their application would require severing and allotting to distinct classes of persons.</p>
