<p><strong> 3</strong> .] <em> further specification</em> ( γάρ ) <em> of the</em> παραγγελίαι : see above.

<p><strong> τοῦτο</strong> is the subject, not the predicate (as De W.): see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:8">Romans 9:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7">Galatians 3:7</span> ; not superfluous, as Pelt, but emphatically prefixed (so Lünem.).

<p><strong> θέλημα τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θεοῦ</strong> serves to take up again the διὰ τ . κυρ . Ἰησοῦ .
	</p>
<p>The article <em> may be</em> omitted, because the predicate θέλημα τ . θ . is not distributed (?): but in this case, τὸ θέλ . would be equally applicable, there being no danger of τὸ θέλ . being mistaken for ‘the whole will,’ but rather specifying ‘that which forms part of the will.’ This explanation is not to be abandoned, as Ellic., on account of the merely occasional omission of the article after a noun substantive, mentioned by Middleton and Ellic.: for the reason of that omission is to be sought rather in logic than in idiom. Rather perhaps should we say that there is in Greek a tendency to omit articles before predicates, even where such an omission cannot be logically pressed.

<p><strong> ὁ ἁγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὑμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is in apposition with <strong> θέλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θ</strong> <strong> .</strong> as a ‘locus communis,’ the will of God respecting us being known to be our sanctification, and then this, sanctification being afterwards specified as consisting in ἀπέχεσθαι , &amp;c. Therefore <strong> ἁγιασμός</strong> must be taken in the most general sense, and that which is afterwards introduced, ἀπέχεσθαι , &amp;c., as a <em> part</em> of our ἁγιασμός .
	</p>
<p><strong> ὑμῶν</strong> is the objective genitive, <strong> of you</strong> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀπέχεσθαι</strong> and <strong> εἰδέναι</strong> are not the negative and positive sides of <strong> ὁ ἁγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὑμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> as Lünem. and Ellic., for the negative comes in again in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:5-6">1 Thessalonians 4:5-6</span> , but the latter ( εἰδέναι to διεμαρτυράμεθα , 1Th 4:6 ) further specifies and ensures the former.</p>
