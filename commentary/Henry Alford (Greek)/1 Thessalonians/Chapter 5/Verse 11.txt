<p>Whitby, Rückert, al., would read <strong> εἰς</strong> τὸν ἕνα , and render ‘ <em> edify yourselves into one body</em> ’ (Whitb. εἰς ἕν ) or ‘ <em> so as to shew the One, Christ, as your foundation</em> , on whom the building should be raised’ (Rückert: but this should be ἐπὶ τῷ ἑνί ). The only allowable meaning of εἰς τὸν ἕνα would be, ‘ <em> into the One</em> ,’ viz., Christ, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span> . But the use of τὸν ἕνα for Christ, with any further designation, would be harsh and unprecedented.</p>
