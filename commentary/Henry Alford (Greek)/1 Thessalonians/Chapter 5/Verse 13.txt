<p><strong> 13</strong> .] <strong> ἡγεῖσθαι ἐν ἀγάπῃ</strong> is an unusual expression for <strong> to esteem in love;</strong> for such seems to be its meaning. Lün. compares ἔχειν τινὰ ἐν ὀργῇ (Thuc. ii. 18). We have περὶ πολλοῦ ἡγεῖσθαι , Herod. ii. 115 ( Job 35:2 does not apply).
	</p>
<p><strong> ὑπερεκπερισσῶς</strong> is best taken with ἐν ἀγάπῃ : it will not form a suitable qualification for ἡγεῖσθαι , which is merely a verbum medium. And so Chrys., all.
	</p>
<p><strong> διὰ τὸ ἔργ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> may mean, <strong> because of the</strong> <em> nature</em> <strong> of their work</strong> , viz. that it is the Lord’s work, for your souls: or, <strong> on account of their activity in their office</strong> , as a recompense for their work. Both these motives are combined in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:17">Hebrews 13:17</span> .
	</p>
<p>The reading εἰρηνεύετε ἐν αὐτοῖς (see var. readd.) can hardly mean, as Chrys., al., μὴ ἀντιλέγειν τοῖς παρ ʼ αὐτῶν λεγομένοις (Thdrt.), but is probably, as De W., a mistaken correction from imagining that this exhortation must refer to the presbyters as well as the preceding: whereas it seems only to be suggested by the foregoing, as enforcing peaceful and loving subordination without party strife: cf. ἀτάκτους below.

<p><strong> ἑαυτοῖς</strong> not = ἀλλήλοις (see ref. Col. and note there, and cf. Mar 9:50 ).</p>
