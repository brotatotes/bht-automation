<p><strong> 2</strong> .] [ <strong> ἡ</strong> ] <strong> ἡμέρα κυρίου</strong> is not the <em> destruction of Jerusalem</em> , as Hammond, Schöttg., al., nor the day of <em> each man’s death</em> , as Chrys., Œc., Thl., Lyr., al., <em> but the day of the Lord’s coming</em> , the <strong> παρουσία</strong> , which has been spoken of, in some of its details, above. So Thdrt. ἡ δεσποτικὴ παρονσία . This is plain, by comparing <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:8">1 Corinthians 1:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:14">2 Corinthians 1:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:6">Philippians 1:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:10">Philippians 1:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:16">Philippians 2:16</span> . It is both the suddenness, and the terribleness (surely we cannot with Ellic. omit this element, in the presence of the image in the next verse) of the Day’s coming, which is here dwelt on: cf. next verse.

<p><strong> οὕτως</strong> fills up the comparison <strong> as a thief in the night</strong> (comes), <strong> so … it comes</strong> (not for future, but expressing, as so often by the present, the absolute truth and certainty of that predicated it is its attribute, to come).</p>
