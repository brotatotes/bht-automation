<p><strong> 22</strong> . <strong> ἀπὸ π</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εἴδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πον</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀπέχ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] These words cannot by any possibility be rendered as in E. V., ‘ <em> abstain from all appearance of evil</em> .’ For (1) <strong> εἶδος</strong> never signifies ‘ <em> appearance</em> ’ in this sense: (2) the two members of the sentence would thus not be logically correspondent, but a new idea would be introduced in the second which has no place in the context: for it is not against being deceived by false <em> appearance</em> , nor against giving occasion by behaviour which <em> appears like</em> evil, that he is cautioning them, but merely to distinguish and hold fast that which is good, and reject that which is evil. <strong> εἶδος</strong> is the <em> species</em> , as subordinated to the <em> genus</em> . So Porphyr. (in Lünem.) isagoge de quinque vocibus 2: λέγεται δὲ εἶδος καὶ τὸ ὑπὸ τὸ ἀποδοθέν γένος · καθ ʼ ὃ εἰώθαμεν λέγειν τὸν μὲν ἄνθρωπον εἶδος τοῦ ζώου , γένους ὄντος τοῦ ζώου · τὸ δὲ λευκὸν τοῦ χρώματος εἶδος · τὸ δὲ τρίγωνον τοῦ σχήματος εἶδος . And πονηροῦ is not an adjective, but a substantive: <strong> from every species</strong> (or <strong> form</strong> ) <strong> of evil</strong> . The objection which Bengel brings against this, ‘ <em> species mali</em> esset εἶδος τοῦ πονηροῦ ,’ is null, as such articles in construction are continually omitted, and especially when the genitive of construction is an abstract noun.
