<p><strong> 7</strong> .] Explanation of the assertion regarding οἱ λοιποί above from the common practice of men. There is no distinction, as Macknight pretends, between μεθυσκόμενοι and μεθύουσιν (‘the former denoting the <em> act</em> of getting drunk, the latter the <em> state</em> of being so’), but they are synonymous, answering to καθεύδοντες and καθεύδουσιν . Nor are the expressions to be taken in a spiritual sense, as Chrys., al. ( μέθην ἐνταῦθά φησιν , οὐ τὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴνου μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν κακῶν : ‘Spiritual sleep and intoxication belong to the state of darkness,’ Baum.-Crus.-): the repetition of the same verbs as subjects and predicates (Lün.) shews that <strong> νυκτός</strong> is merely a designation of <em> time</em> , and to be taken literally.</p>
