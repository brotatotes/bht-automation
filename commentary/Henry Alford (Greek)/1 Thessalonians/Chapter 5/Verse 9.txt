<p><strong> 9</strong> .] Epexegesis of <strong> ἐλπίδα σωτηρίας</strong> ‘and we <em> may</em> with confidence put on such an hope as our helmet’ <strong> for God set us not</strong> (‘appointed <strong> us</strong> not’ (reff.); keep the aorist meaning, referring to the time when He made the appointment) <strong> to</strong> (‘ <em> with a view to</em> ’ so as to issue in, become a prey to) <strong> wrath, but to acquisition</strong> ( περιποιέω , ‘ <em> to make to remain over and above</em> ,’ hence ‘ <em> to keep safe</em> :’ opp. to διαφθείρω , Herod. i. 110; vii. 52, &amp;c. Thuc. iii. 102 (L. and S.). Hence περιποίησις , ‘ <em> a keeping safe</em> :’ Plato, Def. 415 C, σωτηρία , περιποίησις ἀβλαβής . If this last remarkable coincidence be taken as a key to our passage, <strong> σωτηρίας</strong> will be a genitive of apposition, ‘a keeping safe, consisting in salvation.’ But (reff.) it seems more according to the construction to understand <strong> περιπ</strong> <strong> .</strong> simply as <strong> acquisition</strong> , as it undoubtedly is in ref. 2 Thess. Jowett’s note, “ περιποιεῖν , to make any thing over: hence περιποίησις , possession,” if I understand it rightly, alleges a meaning of the verb which has no existence. ‘ <em> To make to remain over</em> ’ is as different as possible from ‘to make over (to another person)’) <strong> of salvation through</strong> ( <strong> διὰ</strong> <strong> …</strong> refers to περιπ . σωτ . not to ἔθετο ) <strong> our Lord Jesus Christ</strong> ,</p>
