<p><strong> 14 22</strong> .] <em> General exhortations with regard to Christian duties</em> . There appears no reason for regarding these verses as addressed to the presbyters, as Conybeare in his translation (after Chrys., Œc, Thl., Est., al.). They are for <em> all</em> : for each to interpret according to the sphere of his own duties. By the ἀδελφοί , he continues the same address as above. The attempt to give a stress to ὑμᾶς (‘you, brethren, I exhort,’ Conyb.) is objectionable: (1) because in that case the order of the words would be different ( ὑμᾶς δέ , ἀδ ., παρ ., or ὑμᾶς δέ παρ ., ἀδ .), (2) because the attention has been drawn off from οἱ προϊστάμενοι by εἰρηνεύετε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς intervening.</p>
