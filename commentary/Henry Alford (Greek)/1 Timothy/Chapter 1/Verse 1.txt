<p><strong> 1. </strong> <strong> κατ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἐπιτ</strong> ] See reff., especially Tit.: a usual expression of St. Paul, and remarkably enough occurring in the doxology at the end of the Epistle to the Romans, which there is every reason to think was written long after the Epistle itself. It is a more direct predication of divine command than διὰ θελήματος θεοῦ in the earlier Epistles.

<p><strong> θεοῦ σωτῆρος ἡμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Apparently an expression belonging to the later apostolic period, one characteristic of which seems to have been the gradual dropping of the article from certain well-known theological terms, and treating them almost as proper names (see, however, Ellicott’s note). Thus in Luk 1:47 it is ἐπὶ τῷ θεῷ τῷ σωτῆρί μου : and indeed in almost every place in the pastoral Epistles except this, σωτήρ has the article. In ref. Jude, the expression is the same as here.

<p><strong> καὶ χρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἰησ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] See a similar repetition after δοῦλος χρ . Ἰησοῦ in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:6">Romans 1:6</span> . The Apostle loves them in his more solemn and formal passages and the whole style of these Epistles partakes more of this character, as was natural in the decline of life.

<p><strong> τῆς ἐλπίσος ἡμῶν</strong> ] It is not easy to point out the exact reference of this word here, any further than we may say that it gives utterance to the fulness of an old man’s heart in the near prospect of that on which it naturally was ever dwelling. It is the ripening and familiarization of χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν ἡ ἐλπὶς τῆς δόξης of ref. Col. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:2">Titus 1:2</span> . I am persuaded that in many such expressions in these Epistles, we are to seek rather a psychological than a pragmatical explanation. Theodoret notices the similar occurrence of words in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+64:0">Psalms 64:0</span> (65):6, ἐπάκουσον ἡμῶν ὁ θεὸς ὁ σωτὴρ ἡμῶν , ἡ ἐλπὶς πάντων τῶν περάτων τῆς γῆς which is interesting, as it might have suggested the expression here, familiar as the Apostle was with O. T. diction. Ellic. refers, for the same expression, to Ignat. Trall. § 2, p. 676.</p>
