The formula πιστὸς ὁ λόγος is peculiar to the pastoral Epistles, and characteristic I believe of their later age, when certain sayings had taken their place as Christian axioms, and were thus designated) <strong> is the saying, and worthy of all</strong> (all possible, i.e. universal) <strong> reception</strong> (see reff. Polyb., and Wetst. and Kypke, h. l. A word which, with its adjective ἀποδεκτός (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:3">1 Timothy 2:3</span> ; 1Ti 5:4 ), is confined to these Epistles. We have the verb, οἱ μὲν οὖν ἀποδεξάμενοι τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ ἐβαπιτίσθησαν , Act 2:41 ), <strong> that Christ Jesus came into the world</strong> (an expression otherwise found only in St. John.
