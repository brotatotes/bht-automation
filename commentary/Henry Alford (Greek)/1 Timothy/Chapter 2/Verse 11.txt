The fact is that the word itself is originally a ‘vox media,’ signifying merely ‘one who with his own hand’ … and the context fills up the rest, αὐθέντης φόνου , or the like. And in course of time, the meaning of ‘autocrat’ prevailing, the word itself and its derivatives henceforth took this course, and αὐθεντέω , - ία , - ημα , all of later growth, bore this reference only. Later still we have αὐθεντικός , <em> from first authority</em> (‘id enim αὐθεντικῶς , nuntiabatur,’ Cic. ad Att. x. 9).
