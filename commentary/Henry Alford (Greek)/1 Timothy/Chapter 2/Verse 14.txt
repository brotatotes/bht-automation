<p><strong> 14</strong> .] <em> Second reason</em> as the woman was <em> last in being</em> , so she was <em> first in sin</em> indeed <em> the only victim</em> of the Tempter’s deceit. <strong> And Adam was not deceived</strong> (not to be weakened, as Thdrt. τὸ οὐκ ἠπατήθη , ἀντὶ τοῦ , οὐ πρῶτος , εἴρηκεν : nor, as Matthies, must we supply ὑπὸ τοῦ ὄφεως : nor, with De W., Wiesinger, al., must we press the fact that the woman only was <em> misled</em> by the senses. Bengel and Huther seem to me (but cf. Ellicott) to have apprehended the right reference: ‘serpens mulierem decepit, mulier virum non decepit, sed ei persuasit.’ As Huther observes, the ἠπάτησεν , in the original narrative, is used of the woman only. We read of no communication between the serpent and the <em> man</em> . The “subtlest beast of all the field” knew his course better: <em> she</em> listened to the lower solicitation of sense and expediency: he to the higher one of conjugal love): <strong> but the woman</strong> (not now <em> Eve</em> , but generic, as the next clause shews: for Eve could not be the subject to σωθήσεται ) <strong> having been seduced</strong> BY DECEIT (stronger than ἀπατηθεῖσα , as <em> exoro</em> than <em> oro</em> : implying the full success of the ἀπάτη ) <strong> has become involved</strong> (the thought is the present state of transgression in which the woman (and the man too: but that is not treated here) by sin is constituted, arose (which was not so in the man) from her originally having been <em> seduced by deceit</em> ) <strong> in transgression</strong> (here as always, breach of a positive command: cf. Rom 4:15 ).</p>
