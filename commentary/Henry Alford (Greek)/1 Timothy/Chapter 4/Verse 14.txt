<p><strong> 14</strong> .] <strong> Do not neglect</strong> (= ἀναζωπυρεῖν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span> , do not suffer to decay and smoulder by carelessness: ‘negligunt qui non exercent, nec putant se posse excidere,’ Bengel) <strong> the spiritual gift which is in thee</strong> (see more at length in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span> . The spiritual gift is that of teaching and ruling the church. Thdrt. says, too narrowly (and so nearly Ellic.), χάρισυα τὴν διδασκαλίαν ἐκάλεσε : it was not teaching only, but the whole grace of God given him for the office to which he was set apart by special ordination), <strong> which was given thee</strong> (by God, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4">1 Corinthians 12:4</span> ; 1Co 12:6 ) <strong> by means of prophecy</strong> (not as Mack, ‘on account of prophecies,’ alleging the plural in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span> . That verse (see note) refers to the same fact as this viz. that, either at the first conversion of Timotheus, or at his ordination to the ministry (and certainly the latter seems here to be pointed at), the Holy Spirit spoke, by means of a prophet or prophets, His will to invest him with χαρίσματα for the work, and thus the gift was said to be conferred, as to its certainty in the divine counsels, by such prophecy ‘ita jubente per os prophetarum Spiritu Sancto,’ Beza. All attempts to make διὰ bear other meanings (‘potest tamen sic accipi ut idem valeat quod εἰς προφητείαν , i.e. ad prophetandum; vel ἐν προφητεία ita ut quod sit hoc donum exprimat apostolus,’ Beza) are illegitimate and needless: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1-3">Acts 13:1-3</span> , which is a case precisely analogous: the gift was in Paul and Barnabas διὰ προφητείας , μετὰ ἐπιθέσεως χειρῶν . Bengel strangely joins προφητείας with πρεσβυτερίου , parenthesizing μετὰ ἐπιθ . τ . χειρῶν , alleging that ‘ <em> impositio manus</em> proprie fit per unam personam et quidem digniorem: <em> prophetia</em> vero fiebat etiam per æquales,’ &amp;c. But this certainly was not so: see below), <strong> with laying on of the hands</strong> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:6">Acts 6:6</span> . Neander, Pfl. u. Leit. i. 267. There is no real difference, as De W. thinks, between this and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span> . There was a special reason there for putting Timotheus in mind of the fact that the Apostle’s own hands <em> were</em> laid on him: but that fact does not exclude this. See references on the χειροθεσία in Ellicott’s note) <strong> of the presbytery</strong> (reff.: of the body of elders who belonged to the congregation in which he was ordained. Where this was, we know not: hardly in Lystra, where he was first converted: might it not be in Ephesus itself, for this particular office?).</p>
