<p><strong> 11</strong> .] <strong> But younger widows decline</strong> (to place on the κατάλογος , see above on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:9">1 Timothy 5:9</span> ; not ‘avoid,’ <em> for fear of scandal</em> , as Chrys. in the homily above cited: nor both of these combined, as Huther: nor ‘decline as objects for the alms of the church,’ as some above. Baur’s idea (Paulus u. s. w. p. 497), that χήρας is the predicate, ‘ <em> the younger women decline as widows</em> ,’ refuse to put on the list of widows, is not justified by the construction, nor does it derive any support from the rendering given above of χήρα καταλεγέσθω , 1Ti 5:9 ): <strong> for when they shall wax wanton</strong> (a very full account of the usage of ἐάν and ὅταν with the indic. is given in Klotz, Devar. ii. pp. 468 ff. Ellicott sums it up by saying that in such cases the whole conditional force is restricted to the particle, and there is no necessary internal connexion between the verb in the protasis and that in the apodosis. He does not hold this to be applicable here, and therefore prefers the rec. reading) <strong> against</strong> ( <strong> στρηνιάω</strong> , and <strong> στρῆνος</strong> , see reff. from στρηνής (strenuus), ‘ <em> strong</em> ,’ ‘to be strong,’ whence <strong> κατα</strong> - στρ ., <em> to be strong against</em> , to rebel against (see Ellic. here): and in the particular matter here treated, ‘to become wanton against’) <strong> Christ</strong> (their proper bridegroom: Jerome’s expression, ep. 123 (11) ad Ageruchiam (Gerontiam) 3, vol. i. p. 901, which the Commentators blame as too strong, in fact gives the sense well, “quæ fornicatæ sunt (-cantur?) in injuriam viri sui Christi.” Thl. similarly, but too vaguely, ὅταν καθυπερηφανεύσονται τοῦ χριστοῦ , μὴ ἀποδεχόμεναι αὐτὸν νυμφίον ), <strong> they desire to marry</strong> (again), <strong> having</strong> (bearing on themselves, as a burden: see reff. and Gal 5:10 ) <strong> judgment</strong> (from God: and as the context necessarily implies, <em> condemnation</em> : but we must not so express it in a version: that which is left to be fixed by the context in the original, should be also left in a translation. The meaning ‘bringing on themselves the imputation of having,’ &amp;c., given by De W. and upheld by Huther, al., appears to me to be ungrammatical), <strong> because they set at nought their first faith</strong> (i.e. broke, made void, their former promise. So Chrys., interpreting it, τὰς πρὸς τὸν χριστὸν καταπατῆσαι συνθήκας , Hom. var. ut supra: and again, πίστιν τὴν συνθήκην λέγει , Hom. in loc.: Thdrt. τῷ χριστῷ συνταξάμεναι σωφρόνως ζῇν ἐν χηρείᾳ , δευτέροις ὁμιλοῦσι γάμοις : Thl. ἐψεύσαντο τὴν συμφωνίαν τὴν πρὸς χριστόν . Tert. de monogam. 13, vol. ii. p. 948, “quod primam fidem resciderunt, illam videlicet a qua in viduitate inventæ et professæ eam non perseverant.” Aug. in Ps. 75:12, § 16, vol. iv. p. 968: “Quid est ‘primam fidem irritam fecerunt?’ voverunt et non reddiderunt.” Having devoted themselves to widowhood as their state of life, and to the duties of the order of πρεσβύτιδες as their occupation, they will thus be guilty of a dereliction of their deliberate promise. Of the later vows of celibacy, and ascetic views with regard to second marriages, there is no trace: see below. Calv. (al.) interprets τὴν πρώτην πίστιν ἠθέτησαν of <em> falling away from the faith</em> , ‘quia a fide baptismi et Christianismo prorsus deficiant,’ and defends this view against that given above, calling it ‘nimis frigidum:’ but as it seems to me quite unsuccessfully. He expresses well, however, the difference between this addiction to single life and the later compulsory vows: ‘non ideo cœlibes se fore promittebant olim viduæ, ut sanctius agerent vitam quam in conjugio: sed quod non poterant marito et ecclesiæ simul esse addictæ:’ see the rest of his note).</p>
