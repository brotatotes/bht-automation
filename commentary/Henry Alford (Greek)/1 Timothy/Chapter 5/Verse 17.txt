<p><strong> 17</strong> .] <strong> Let the presbyters who well preside</strong> (not, as in some former editions, <em> have well presided</em> : the perf. of ἵστημι has the <em> present</em> signification throughout. I owe the correction of this inadvertence to Bishop Ellicott. Preside, viz. over their portion of the Church’s work. Chrys. has well expressed the meaning, but not all the meaning; for wisdom and ability must be taken also into account: τί δε ἐστι , καλῶς προεστῶτας , ἀκούσωμεν τοῦ χριστοῦ λέγοντος · ὁ ποιμὴν ὁ καλὸς τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ τίθησιν ὑπὲρ τῶν προβάτων . ἄρα τοῦτό ἐστι καλῶς προεστάναι , μηδενὸς φείδεσθαι τῆς ἐκείνων κηδεμονίας ἕνεκα ), <strong> be held worthy of double</strong> (not, as compared with the <em> widows</em> , as Chr., (alt. 1: διπλῆς τῆς πρὸς τὰς χήρας , ἢ τῆς πρὸς τοὺς διακόνους , ἢ ἁπλῶς διπλῆς τιμῆς , πολλῆς λέγει ), Thl. (1), Constt.-ap. (ii. 28, p. 674, Migne), Erasm., Calv., al., the <em> deacons</em> , as Chr. (2, see above), Thl. (2), the <em> poor</em> , as Flatt, &amp;c. but as compared with those who have not distinguished themselves by καλῶς προεστάναι ; and evidently, as Chrys. 3, it is not to be taken in the mere literal sense of <em> double</em> , but implies increase generally see reff., and below) <strong> honour</strong> (so Plato, Legg. v. p. 378 D, τίμιος μὲν δὴ καὶ ὁ μηδὲν ἀδικῶν · ὁ δὲ μηδ ʼ ἐπιτρέπων τοῖς ἀδικοῦσιν ἀδικεῖν πλέον ἢ διπλασίας τιμῆς ἄξιος ἐκείνου : and see other examples in Wetstein. From the general tenor of those, as well as from the context here, it is evident that not merely honour, but <em> recompense</em> is here in question: but the word need not be <em> confined</em> to that meaning: honour, and honour’s fruit, may be both included in it. Grot. conceives an allusion to the double portion of the first-born ( Deu 21:17 ): Elsner, to the double share of provision which used to be set before the presbyters in the Agapæ (Heydr., Baur: cf. Constt.-apost. as above). But as De W. remarks, that practice was much more probably owing to a misunderstanding of this passage): <strong> especially those that labour in</strong> (the) <strong> word and teaching</strong> (therefore the preaching of the word, and teaching, was <em> not the office of all</em> the πρεσβύτεροι . Conyb. rightly remarks, that this is a proof of the early date of the Epistle. Of these two expressions, λόγος would more properly express <em> preaching</em> ; διδασκαλία , the work of <em> instruction</em> , by catechetical or other means).</p>
