<p><strong> 20</strong> .] [ <strong> But</strong> ] <strong> those who are doing wrong</strong> (if δέ is read, these are the sinning presbyters, and cannot well be any others. Without the particle, the application may be doubted. De W., Wiesinger, and Ellic., following a few others (Aret., Heinr., Matthies, al.), maintain the <em> general</em> reference. So appears Chrys. to have done, understanding πρεσβ . merely of age, and going on without any further remark, and so (apparently) Thdrt. But, even thus, the other view is the more likely, from the strong language used in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:21">1 Timothy 5:21</span> , and the return again to the subject in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:22">1 Timothy 5:22</span> ; and so most Commentators. The pres. part. is no argument against it (against De W. and Wiesinger): ‘those who are (detected in) sinning,’ who are proved to be living in sin, may well be intended by it: the fact of their being ἁμαρτάνοντες is not ascertained till they have been charged with fault, and the evidence of the witnesses taken) <strong> reprove in the presence of all</strong> (not all <em> the presbyters</em> , the ‘consessus presbyterorum:’ see on καὶ οἱ λοιποί below: but the whole congregation. Had it not been for ecclesiastical considerations, we should never have heard of such a limited meaning for ἐνώπιον πάντων ), <strong> that the rest also</strong> (not, the other presbyters, which would have certainly been pointed out if intended, but in its usual sense of ‘the rest,’ generally: the καί seems to make this even plainer: that the warning may not be confined to a few, but may also spread over the whole church) <strong> may have fear</strong> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+13:11">Deuteronomy 13:11</span> ; fear, on seeing the public disgrace consequent on sin. ἔχωσιν , as above, 1Ti 5:12 ).</p>
