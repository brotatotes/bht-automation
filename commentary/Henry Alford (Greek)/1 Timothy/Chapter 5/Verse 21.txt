<p><strong> 21</strong> .] <strong> I adjure thee</strong> (see reff., especially 2Ti 4:1 ) <strong> in the presence of God, and of Christ Jesus</strong> (on the supposed reference to one Person only, see Ellic.’s note); <strong> and of the elect angels</strong> (the holy angels, who are the chosen attendants and ministers of God. Thus <strong> ἐκλεκτῶν</strong> is an epithet distributed over the whole extent of ἀγγέλων , not one designating any one class of angels above the rest, as De W. Bengel says rightly, ἐκλεκτῶν , “epitheton, Timothei reverentiam acuens: the angels, God’s chosen ministers.” Various meanings have been proposed: <em> good angels as distinguished from bad</em> (so Thl., Ambr., Grot., Est., Wolf, al.), but οἱ ἄγγελοι without any such designation, are ever good angels: <em> the guardian angels</em> of Timotheus and the Ephesian church (Mosheim): ‘those especially selected by God as His messengers to the human race, as Gabriel’ (Conyb.), which, if we suppose these to be any particular class of angels, would be the best; but I doubt ἐκλεκτός , absolute, ever bearing this meaning, and much prefer that upheld above. Calvin says: “electos vocat angelos non tantum ut a reprobis discernat, sed excellentiæ causa, ut plus reverentiæ habeat eorum testimonium.” There is a parallel form of adjuration in Jos. B. J. ii. 16. 4, where Agrippa is endeavouring to persuade the Jews to remain in the Roman allegiance: μαρτύρομαι δ ʼ ἐγὼ ὑμῶν τὰ ἅγια καὶ τοὺς ἱεροὺς ἀγγέλους τοῦ θεοῦ , καὶ πατρίδα τὴν κοινήν .

<p>Schleiermacher thinks this mention of one class of angels as ‘ <em> elect</em> ,’ inconsistent with the Apostle’s warning against genealogies and idle questions: but with the above interpretation such objection falls to the ground. Baur would explain the expression by the gnostic notion of angels more immediately connected with our Lord, alluded to by Irenæus, i. 4. 5, p. 21, οἱ ἡλικιῶται αὐτοῦ ἄγγελοι : see ib. 7. 1, p. 32. But Irenæus’ text is μετὰ τῶν ἡλικιωτῶν αὐτοῦ τῶν ἀγγέλων , which hardly justifies the interpretation: and if it did, the whole lies too far off the matter in our text, to be brought to bear upon it), <strong> that thou keep these things</strong> (viz. the injunctions, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:19-20">1 Timothy 5:19-20</span> . De W., taking 1Ti 5:20 generally, is obliged, although he confesses that the connexion with 1Ti 5:19 would be best if only <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:19">1 Timothy 5:19</span> ; 1Ti 5:21 came together, to explain ταῦτα of 1Ti 5:20 only, see below) <strong> without prejudice</strong> (‘præ-judicium’ previous condemnation before hearing a man’s case: a word only found here), <strong> doing nothing according to partiality</strong> (bias towards, as the other was bias against, an accused presbyter. Diod. Sic., iii. 27, uses the word in its literal sense: τὸ δένδρον διὰ τὴν γινομένην πρὸς αὐτὸ πλεονάκις πρόσκλισιν τοῦ ζώου , τετριμμένον ἐστί : Diog. Laert., proœm. 20, in its metaphorical: εἰ δὲ αἵρεσιν νοοῖμεν πρόσκλισιν ἐν δόγμασιν . Thdrt. says well, δύο παρακελεύεται · μήτε τῇ τῶν κατηγόρων ἀξιοπιστίᾳ πιστεύσαντα κατακρίνειν , ἢ φιλαπεχθημόνως διακείμενον τοῦτο ποιεῖν πρὸ τῆς ἀκριβοῦς ἐξετάσεως . μήτε τῶν ἐλέγχων προφανῶς γενομένων ἀναβάλλεσθαι τὴν ψῆφον τῇ πρὸς τὸν κρινόμενον χάριτι τὸ δίκαιον διαφθείροντα ).</p>
