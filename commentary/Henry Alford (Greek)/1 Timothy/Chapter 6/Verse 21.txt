<p>On the subscription we may remark, that the notice found in A al., owes it origin probably to the notion that this was the Epistle from Laodicea mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+4:16">Colossians 4:16</span> . So Thl.: τίς δὲ ἦν ἡ ἀπὸ Λαοδικείας ; ἡ πρὸς Τιμόθεον πρώτη · αὕτη γὰρ ἐκ Λαοδικείας ἐγράφη . The further addition in rec. al. betrays a date subsequent to the fourth century, when the province of Phrygia Pacatiana was first created. See Smith’s Dict, of Geography, art. Phrygia, circa finem.</p>
