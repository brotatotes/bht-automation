<p><strong> Τιμόθεος ὁ ἀδ</strong> .] So of Sosthenes, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span> ; ‘ <em> one of</em> οἱ ἀδελφοί ;’ but perhaps in this case with peculiar emphasis: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:17">1 Corinthians 4:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2">1 Timothy 1:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:1">2 Timothy 2:1</span> . On his being with Paul at this time, see Prolegg. to this Epistle, § ii. 4.

<p><strong> σὺν τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἁγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πᾶσιν</strong> <strong> .…</strong> ] This, and the Epistle to the Galatians, were circular letters to all the believers in the respective countries: the variation of expression in the two cases ( ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις τ . Γαλατίας , Gal 1:2 ) being accounted for by the circumstance that the matter of this Epistle concerned <em> directly</em> the <em> church at Corinth</em> , and <em> indirectly</em> all the saints in the province, whereas that to the Galatians, being to correct deeprooted Judaizing error, directly concerned all the <em> churches</em> of Galatia. <em> Achaia</em> comprehended Hellas and Peloponnesus; the province was so named by the Romans because they became possessed of them by subduing the <em> Achæan</em> league, Pausan. vii. 16. 7. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:12">Acts 18:12</span> .</p>
