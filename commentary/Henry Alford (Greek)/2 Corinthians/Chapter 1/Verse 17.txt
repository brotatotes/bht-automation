<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] <strong> μή τι</strong> <strong> …</strong> <strong> Did I at all use levity</strong> ( <strong> of purpose</strong> )? <strong> τῇ</strong> ἐλαφ ., as ἡ ἀρετή , ἡ πίστις , the art. being generic. Olsh., De Wette, Billroth, take it to mean ‘ <em> the levity of purpose which has been laid to my charge</em> :’ Winer, ‘ <em> the levity of purpose inherent in human nature.</em> ’

<p><strong> Or those things which I plan, do I plan according to the flesh</strong> (i.e. according to the changeable, self-contradictory, and insincere purposes of the mere worldly and ungodly man), <strong> that there may be with me</strong> (not, <em> so that there is</em> with me: he is speaking not merely of the result, but of the design: ‘ <em> do I plan like the worldly, that I may shift and waver as suits me</em> ?’) <strong> the Yea, yea, and the Nay, nay</strong> (i.e. both affirmation and negation concerning the same thing)? Chrys, Theodoret, Theophyl., Œc [2] , Calv., Bengel, Billroth, Winer, al., take it thus: ‘ <em> Or those things which I plan, do I plan after the flesh</em> (as fleshly men do), <em> so that my yea must</em> (at all events) <em> be yea, and my nay, nay</em> ?’ i.e. as worldly men who perform their promise at all hazards, and whatever the consequences, whereas I am under the guidance of the Spirit, and can only journey whither He permits. But this explanation is directly against the next verse, where ναὶ καὶ οὔ is clearly parallel to ναὶ ναὶ καὶ οὒ οὔ here, the words being repeated, as in ref. Matt., without altering the sense: and inconsistent with 2Co 1:23 and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:1">2 Corinthians 2:1</span> , where he says that his alteration of plan arose <em> from a desire to spare them</em> . See the whole discussed in Stanley’s note.
