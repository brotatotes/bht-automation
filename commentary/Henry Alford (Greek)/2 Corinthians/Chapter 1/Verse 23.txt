<p><strong> οὐκέτι</strong> ‘ <em> no more</em> ,’ viz. after the first time: see Prolegg. to 1 Cor. § <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:6">2 Corinthians 1:6</span> . The following <strong> οὐχ ὅτι κυρ</strong> . seems to be added to remove any false inference which might have been drawn from φειδόμενος as seeming to assert an unreasonable degree of power over them. But why ὑμῶν <strong> τῆς πίστεως</strong> ? He <em> had power</em> over them, but it was in matters of <em> discipline, not of faith</em> : over matters of faith not even an Apostle has power (‘fides enim prorsus ab hominum jugo soluta liberrimaque esse debet.’ Calv.), seeing it is in <em> each man’s faith that he stands before God</em> . And he puts this strongly, that in matters of faith he is only a fellow-helper of their joy (the χαρὰ ἐν τῷ πιστεύειν , Rom 15:13 ), in order to shew them the <em> real department</em> of his apostolic power, and that, however exercised, it would not attempt to rule their faith, but only to secure to them, by purifying them, joy in believing. He proceeds to say, that it was the probable disturbance of this joy, which induced bim to forego his visit.
