<p><strong> ὁ θ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πατ</strong> <strong> …</strong> ] <strong> The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</strong> . Here, as in ref. Rom., De Wette would render, ‘ <em> God, and the Father</em> ’.…, which grammatically is allowable; but I prefer the other rendering, on account of its greater verisimilitude and simplicity.

<p><strong> ὁ π</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οἰκτιρ</strong> .] οἰκτ . can hardly be the gen. of the <em> attribute</em> , as De W. and Grot., seeing that οἰκτ . is plural and refers to <em> acts</em> of mercy; but as Chrys., p. 421, ὁ οἰκτιρμοὺς τοσούτους ἐπιδειξάμενος : see ref. James. This meaning De W. himself recognizes in ὁ θ . πάσης παρακλ ., ‘the God who works all (possible) comfort,’ and refers to ὁ θεὸς τ . ἐλπίδος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:13">Romans 15:13</span> .</p>
