This however will not explain all places where it occurs elsewhere: e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:18">1 Thessalonians 2:18</span> , ἠθελήσαμεν ἐλθεῖν πρὸς ὑμᾶς , ἐγὼ μὲν Παῦλος , καὶ ἅπαξ κ . δίς , where see note. So that after all perhaps it is best to regard it merely as an idiomatic way of speaking, when often only the singular is intended.

Chrys. ib. “Non sibi vivebat Apostolus, sed Ecclesiæ: ita quicquid gratiarum in ipsum conferebat Deus, non sibi soli datum reputabat, sed quo plus ad alios juvandos haberet facultatis.” Calv.
