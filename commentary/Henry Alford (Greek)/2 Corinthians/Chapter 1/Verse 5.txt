<p><strong> 5</strong> .] ‘As He is, so are we in this world:’ <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:17">1 John 4:17</span> . <strong> As the sufferings of Christ</strong> ( <em> endured by Christ</em> , whether in his own person, or in his mystical body the Church, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:40">Matthew 25:40</span> ; Mat 25:45 ) <strong> abound towards us</strong> (i.e. <em> in our case</em> , see reff.); <strong> even so through Christ our consolation also abounds</strong> . The form of expression is altered in the latter clause: instead of ἡ παράκλησις τοῦ χριστοῦ περις . we have ἡ παράκ . ἡμῶν περισς . διὰ τοῦ χριστοῦ . And not without reason: we <em> suffer</em> , because <em> we are His members</em> : we <em> are consoled</em> because <em> He is our Head</em> . There is no <em> comparison</em> (as Chrys., p. 422, οὐ γὰρ ὅσα ἔπαθε , φησίν , ἐπάθομεν μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ περισσά ) between the personal sufferings of Christ, and theirs.</p>
