<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] Proceeding on the ὡς ἄφρονα , he disclaims for this self-boasting the character of inspiration or of being said in pursuance of his mission from the Lord.

<p><strong> κατὰ κύρ</strong> .] as in reff., <strong> after the</strong> (mind of the) <strong> Lord</strong> , in pursuance, i.e. <em> in this case</em> , of θεοπνευστία from above: not as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:10">1 Corinthians 7:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:25">1 Corinthians 7:25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:40">1 Corinthians 7:40</span> .

<p><strong> ὡς ἐν ἀφρ</strong> .] <strong> as it were in folly</strong> , i.e. ‘putting myself into the situation, and speaking the words of a foolish man vaunting of himself.’
	</p>
<p><strong> ὑποστάσει</strong> , as ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:4">2 Corinthians 9:4</span> , <strong> in this present confidence</strong> , not as Chrys. ‘ <em> subject,’ ‘this</em> subject of boasting,’ ἵνα μὴ νομίσῃς <strong> πανταχοῦ</strong> ἀνοηταίνειν αὐτόν , (Hom. xxiv. p. 607) and so al.: but the sense would be insipid in the last degree: nor could such a meaning well be expressed without γε , ἐν ταύτῃ γε τῇ ὑπ . De Wette also renders ὑπ . ‘ <em> subject-matter</em> ,’ and understands, ‘ <em> since we are come to boasting</em> ;’ but here again γε would be more naturally found. He objects to ‘ <em> confidence</em> ,’ that the boasting was <em> not begun</em> : but as Meyer replies, it is <em> conceived of as having begun in Paul’s mind</em> , by the use of the present λαλῶ , <strong> I am speaking.</strong></p>
