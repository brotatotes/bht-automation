<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] ‘That forbearance which you do really extend to me, and for more of which I now pray, is due from you, and I claim to have it exercised by you, because I have undertaken to present you to Christ as a chaste bride to her husband, and ( 2Co 11:3 ) I am jealous for fear of your falling away from Him.’

<p><strong> θεοῦ ζήλῳ</strong> ] so εἰλικρινείᾳ τοῦ θεοῦ , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span> ; <strong> a godly jealousy</strong> : see note there. Meyer after Chrys., Estius, al., would render it, ‘ <em> with God’s jealousy</em> ,’ ‘with such a jealousy as God has.’ But though θεοῦ ζήλῳ and τῷ τοῦ θεοῦ ζήλῳ are for most purposes identical, I cannot but think that the latter expression would have been chosen to express such an idea as ‘ <em> with the zeal which God has</em> .’ And the rendering, ‘with a <em> godly</em> zeal,’ i.e. one which <em> has God’s honour at heart</em> , satisfies well what follows: see below.

<p><strong> ἡρμοσάμην</strong> ] <strong> I betrothed you</strong> (viz. at your conversion: προμνήστωρ ὑμῶν ἐγενόμην καὶ τοῦ γάμου μεσίτης , Theodoret. Ordinarily, the <em> father</em> , or the <em> bridesman</em> ( παρανύμφιος ) is said ἁρμόζ <strong> ειν</strong> : the <em> middle</em> voice is used of the bridegroom only. So among other examples in Wetst., εἶχεν ἐν δόμοις Αἴγισθος , οὐδ ʼ ἥρμοζε νυμφίῳ τινί , Eur. Electr. 24, and ἁρμοσαμένου Λευτυχίδεω Πέρκαλον τὴν Χίλωνος θυγατέρα , καὶ σχὼν γυναῖκα …, Herod, vi. 65. But in Philo we have γάμος ὃν ἁρμόζεται ἡδονή , ed Abr. § 20, vol. ii. p. 15) <strong> to one husband, to present</strong> (i.e. in order that I may present in you [, present you as]) <strong> a chaste virgin to Christ</strong> (viz. at <em> His coming</em> : ὁ μὲν οὖν παρὼν καιρὸς μνηστείας ἐστίν · ὁ δὲ μέλλων τῶν γάμων , ὅτε κραυγὴ γίνεται , ἰδοὺ ὁ νυμφίος . Theophyl.) <strong> τῷ χρ</strong> . is not in constructive apposition with ἑνὶ ἀνδρί , but explains and fixes it: the emphasis being on παρθένον ἁγνήν .</p>
