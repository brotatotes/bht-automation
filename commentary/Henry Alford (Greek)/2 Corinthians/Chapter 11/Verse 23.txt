<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] Meyer remarks, that all three points of Judaistic comparison, of so little real consequence in the matter, were dismissed with the short and contemptuous κἀγώ , ‘ <em> that am I too</em> .’ But that is not enough, now that we are come to the <em> great</em> point ot comparison; the consciousness of his real standing, and their nullity as ministers of Christ requires the ὑπὲρ ἐγώ , and the holy earnestness of this consciousness pours itself forth as a stream over the adversaries, so as to overwhelm their conceited aspirations to apostolic dignity.

<p><strong> παραφρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λ</strong> .] stronger than ἐν ἀφρος . λέγω : <strong> I say it as a madman</strong> . Hardly, as Meyer, spoken from a consciousness of the verdict παραφρονεῖ which the opponents would pronounce on this ὑπὲρ ἐγώ , but rather, as De W., from a deep sense of his own unworthiness, and conscious how utterly untrue was ὑπὲρ <strong> ἐγώ</strong> , in any boasting sense. He therefore repudiates it even more strongly than the τολμῶ κἀγώ .
	</p>
<p><strong> ὑπὲρ ἐγώ</strong> must not be misunderstood. He <em> concedes</em> to them their being διάκ . χρ ., and assumes ( παραφρονῶν ) for himself, <em> something more</em> , if more abundant labours and sufferings are to be any criterion of the matter. That this is the sense is obvious from the comparison being in the <em> amount</em> of labours and sufferings, and not (as Meyer), that he denies to them the διάκ . χρ . and merely puts it hypothetically. ‘Well, then, if <em> they</em> are to be considered διάκ . χρ ., <em> I</em> must be <em> something more</em> .’ If so, the comparison would be not in the <em> degree</em> of ministerial self-sacrifice, but in the <em> credentials of the ministry itself. Both</em> are now assumed to be ministers: but if so, Paul is a minister in a much higher degree, more faithful, more self-denying, richer in gifts and divine tokens, than they. The preposition is used adverbially, see reff.

<p>Clement, in the celebrated passage of his 1st Epistle to the Corinthians (c. v. p. 220) on the labours of Paul, describes him as ἑπτάκις δεσμὰ φορέσας . This whole catalogue should shew the chronologists of the Apostle’s life and epistles how exceedingly unsafe it is to build <em> only</em> on the history in the Acts for a complete account of his journeys and voyages), <strong> by stripes more exceedingly</strong> (particularized below), <strong> by deaths often</strong> (see reff. and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</span> .
