<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] See above. ‘Seeing that there is <em> but one</em> gospel, and they and I profess to preach <em> one</em> Jesus and impart <em> one</em> Spirit, they have no such claim: mine is superior’): <strong> for I reckon that in no respect do I fall short of</strong> (the perf. sets forth the <em> past and present</em> truth of the fact) <strong> these overmuch Apostles</strong> .

<p><strong> τῶν ὑπερλίαν ἀποστ</strong> . has very commonly been taken to mean bona fide ‘ <em> the greatest Apostles</em> ,’ i.e. Peter, James, and John, or perhaps <em> the Twelve</em> : but (1) this hardly seems to suit the expression ὑπερλίαν , in which I cannot help seeing, with De W., some bitterness: (2) it would be alien from the spirit of the passage, in which he institutes no comparison whatever between himself and <em> the other Apostles</em> , but only between himself and <em> the false teachers</em> . (3) had any such comparison been here intended, the ‘punctum comparationis’ would not have been, <em> personal eminence in fruits of apostolic work and sufferings</em> , still less, seeing that the other Apostles were unlearned also, the distinction which immediately follows, between an ἰδιώτης , and one pretending to more skill, but priority of arrival and teaching in Corinth. (4) the expression <strong> ψευ</strong> δαπόστολος <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:13">2 Corinthians 11:13</span> , seems to me to refer to, and give the plain sense of, this ironical designation of ὑπερλίαν ἀπόστολοι . (5) the same expression ch. 2Co 12:11 appears even more plainly than here to require this explanation. The above explanation is that of Beza, Michaelis, Schulz, Fritzsche, Billroth, Rückert, Olsh., Meyer, De Wette.

<p>ὑπερλίαν is not found in classic Greek: but Wetstein cites from Eustath [15] Od. α . p. 27, 35: ἔστι γάρ ποτε καὶ τῷ λίαν κατὰ τὴν τραγῳδίαν χρᾶσθαι καλῶς , καθ ʼ ὃ σημαινόμενον λέγομέν τινα ὑπερλίαν σοφόν . Meyer instances as analogous, ὑπεράγαν ( 2Ma 10:34 ), ὑπέρευ ( ὑπέρευ πεπολίτευμαι , Demosth. 228. 17), and the frequent use by Paul of compounds of ὑπέρ . It has been the practice of Protestant Commentators (e.g. Bengel, Macknight) to adduce this verse against the primacy of Peter, and of the Romanists (e.g. Corn.-a-Lapide) to evade the inference by supposing the pre-eminence to be only in gifts and preaching, not in power and jurisdiction. All this will fall to the ground with the supposed reference to the other Apostles.
