<p><strong> ἄλλας</strong> and <strong> ὑμῶν</strong> stand in the emphatic positions, as contrasted. In the former sentence, he implied that he <em> brought with him</em> from Macedonia supplies towards his maintenance at Corinth: λαβὼν … <strong> πρὸς</strong> τ . ὑμ . διακ .: here, he speaks of a new supply during his residence with the Corinthians, <em> when those resources failed</em> .

<p><strong> κατενάρκησα</strong> ] apparently = κατεβάρησα , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:16">2 Corinthians 12:16</span> . Hesych [16] interprets it ἐβάρυνα . Jerome, Ep. cxxi. (cli.) ad Algasiam, quæst. 10, vol. i. p. 879, says, ‘multa sunt verba, quibus juxta morem urbis et provinciæ suæ familiarius Apostolus utitur: e quibus ex. gr. pauca ponenda sunt … Et, οὐ κατενάρκησα ὑμᾶς , hoc est, non gravavi vos … quibus et aliis multis usque hodie utuntur Cilices.’ Theophylact and Œcum. mention a rendering, οὐκ ἠμέλησα , ἢ ῥᾳθυμοτέρως πρὸς τὸ κήρυγμα γέγονα : and Beza, following the etymology; interprets οὐκ ἐνάρκησα κατ ʼ οὐδενός , ‘ <em> cum cujusquam incommodo</em> .’ But the former meaning suits the context better. The word is found no where else in Greek. ἀποναρκάω occurs in Plutarch, de Liber. Educatione, p. 8, F (Wetst.), ἀποναρκῶσι κ . φρίττουσι πρὸς τοὺς πόνους . On the government of the genitive by verbs compounded with κατά , see Matthiæ, § 376.
