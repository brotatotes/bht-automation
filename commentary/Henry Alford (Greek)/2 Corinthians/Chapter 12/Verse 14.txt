<p><strong> 14.</strong> ] <strong> τρίτον</strong> (the τοῦτο , though so strongly attested, can hardly have been <em> omitted</em> , had it ever been in the text, and therefore has probably been inserted from ch. 2Co 13:1 ) <strong> ἑτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἔχω ἐλθ</strong> ., must, <em> from the context</em> , mean, <strong> I am ready to come the third time</strong> ; not, ‘ <em> I am the third time ready to come</em> ,’ i.e. ‘this is the third time that I have been <em> ready to come</em> to you.’ This latter meaning has been adopted by Beza, Grot., Estius, al., Paley, al., and even De Wette, hesitatingly, in order to evade the difficulty of supposing Paul to have been before this twice at Corinth. But on this see Prolegomena to 1 Cor. § v. Here, the context has absolutely nothing to do with his <em> third preparation</em> to come, which would be a new element, requiring some explanation, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:18">1 Thessalonians 2:18</span> . The natural, and, I am persuaded, only true inference from the words here is, ‘I am coming to you a third time, and I will not burden you this time, any more than I did at <em> my two previous visits</em> .’

<p>Our business in such cases is, not to wrest plain words to fit our preconceived chronology, but to adapt our <em> confessedly uncertain and imperfect history of the Apostle’s life</em> , to the data furnished by the plain honest sense of his Epistles.

<p><strong> οὐ γὰρ ζητῶ</strong> …] Wetst. quotes Cicero de Fin. ii. 26: ‘Me igitur ipsum ames oportet, non mea, si veri amici futuri sumus.’ μείζονα ἐπιζητῶ , ψυχὰς ἀντὶ χρημάτων , σωτηρίαν ἀντὶ χρυσίου , Chrys., p. 629.

<p><strong> οὐ γὰρ ὀφείλει</strong> …] Paul was the <em> spiritual father</em> of the Corinthian Church, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:14-15">1 Corinthians 4:14-15</span> ; he does not therefore want to be <em> enriched by them</em> , his children, but rather to <em> lay up riches for them</em> , seeking to have them as his treasure, and thus to <em> enrich them</em> , as a loving father does his children. The θησαυρός is left indefinite: if pressed strictly, it cannot be <em> earthly</em> treasure in the <em> negative</em> part of the sentence, <em> heavenly</em> , in the <em> positive</em> ; cf. next verse.

<p>Notice, ὀφείλει is not impersonal, but the common verb to τέκνα and γονεῖς , agreeing by proximity with the former.</p>
