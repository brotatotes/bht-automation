<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] ἐγὼ δὲ τῶν φύσει πατέρων καὶ πλέον τι ποιεῖν ἐπαγγέλλομαι , Theodoret: and similarly Chrys. and Theophyl. They <em> lay up</em> treasures: <em> I</em> will <em> spend</em> them: καὶ τί λέγω , χρήματα δαπανήσω ; αὐτὸς ἐγώ ἐκδαπανηθήσομαι · τουτέστι , κἂν τὴν σάρκα δέῃ δαπανῆσαι ὑπὲρ τῆς σωτηρίας τῶν ψυχῶν ὑμῶν , οὐ φείσομαι , Theophyl. Cf. Hor. Od. i. 12. 38: ‘animæque magnæ prodigum Paullum.’

<p><strong> εἰ</strong> is less strong than εἰ καί , which has been apparently a gloss on it. It assumes the case, but does not bring out the contrast between the course of action and the state of circumstances so strongly. <em> Here</em> , it appears as if ἧσσον ἀγαπῶμαι were by the εἰ connected with ἐκδαπανηθήσομαι , ‘ <em> and will be spent</em> , used up, <em> in the service of your souls, if, the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved</em> :’ implying, that such a return for his love was leading to, and would in time accomplish, the ἐκδαπανηθήσομαι .</p>
