<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] <strong> παρεκάλεσα</strong> , scil. ‘ <em> to go to you</em> :’ see reff. This journey of Titus cannot, of course, be the one spoken of ch. 2Co 8:6 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:17">2 Corinthians 8:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:22">2 Corinthians 8:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:24">2 Corinthians 8:24</span> ; but some previous mission to them before this Epistle was written: probably that from which he returned with the report of their penitence to Paul in Macedonia, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:6">2 Corinthians 7:6</span> ff. We certainly have not elsewhere any hint of ὁ ἀδελφός having accompanied him on this journey: but this is no reason why it should not have been so.

<p><strong> τὸν ἀδελφόν</strong> perhaps, one of the two mentioned ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:18">2 Corinthians 8:18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:22">2 Corinthians 8:22</span> ; some other, well known to the Corinthians, but absolutely unknown to us: but not, <em> a brother</em> , as in E. V. It is plain from this and from what follows, that this brother was quite subordinate to Titus in the mission.

The dative ἴχνεσιν , as in ref.= <strong> ἐν</strong> ἴχνεσιν : see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:16">Acts 14:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:11">Jude 1:11</span> .
