<p><strong> 20.</strong> ] ‘Edification, of which you stand in need, for, &amp;c.’ He here completely and finally throws off the apologist and puts on the Apostle, leaving on their minds a very different impression from that which would have been produced had he concluded with the apology. <strong> Lest, when I arrive, I should find you not such as I wish</strong> (in οὐχ οἵους θέλω is an <em> indefinite</em> possibility of aberration from οἵους θέλω , presently <em> particularized</em> , μή πως ἔρεις , κ . τ . λ .), <strong> and I should be found by you</strong> ( ὑμῖν merely the dative of the agent after the passive verb. Meyer makes it ‘ <em> in your judgment</em> ,’ but I much prefer the other: the passive form is adopted to bring out the ἐγώ into emphatic contrast), <strong> such as ye wish not</strong> (not οὐχ οἷον θέλετε , because there is now no indefiniteness; <em> his</em> disposition towards them in such a case could be but of <em> one</em> kind, viz. <em> severity</em> : τουτέστι , τιμωρὸς κ . κολαστής , Theophyl. Chrys., p. 634, brings out another point, οὐκ εἶπεν , οἷον οὐ <strong> θέλω</strong> . ἀλλὰ πληκτικώτερον , οἷον οὐ βούλεσθε ).

<p>What follows, viz. μή πως … ἔπραξαν , is an epexegesis of the last sentence, but in it the definiteness is on the side of the οὐχ οἵους θέλω , the indefiniteness on that of οἷον οὐ θέλετε , which latter is only hinted at by the mild expressions of <em> being humbled, and lamenting the case of the impenitent</em> .
