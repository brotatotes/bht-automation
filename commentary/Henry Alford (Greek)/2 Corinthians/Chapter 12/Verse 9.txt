<p><strong> 9.</strong> ] <strong> And He said to me</strong> (this perf. can hardly in English be represented otherwise than by the historical aorist; in the Greek, it partakes of its own proper sense ‘ <em> He said, and that answer is enough:’ ‘He hath said</em> ,’ but this last would not contain reference enough to the <em> fact</em> itself. The poverty of our language in the finer distinctions of the tenses often obliges us to render inaccurately, and fall short of, the wonderful language with which we have to deal.

Had μᾶλλον signified ‘ <em> rather than in revelations</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> rather than in any thing else</em> ,’ it would have been μᾶλλον ἐν ταῖς ἀσθενείαις μου καυχήσομαι ) <strong> in my infirmities, that</strong> (by my ἀσθένειαι being not removed from me, but becoming my glory) <strong> the Power of Christ may have its residence in me</strong> (see ref. Polyb. ‘may carry on in me its work unto completion,’ as above).</p>
