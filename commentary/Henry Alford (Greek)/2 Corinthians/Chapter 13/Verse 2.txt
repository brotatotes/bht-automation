<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] <strong> I</strong> <strong> have forewarned yon, and I now forewarn you, as</strong> (I did, προείρηκα ) <strong> when present the second time, so also</strong> (I do) <strong> now</strong> ( προλέγω ) <strong> when absent</strong> . It certainly seems to me that this is the only natural way of taking the words. Grot., Est., Bengel, al., and De Wette, take ὡς παρὼν τὸ δεύτ . to mean, ‘ <em> as if I were present the second time</em> ,’ meaning <em> this next time</em> . But is it possible that the Apostle should have written so confusedly, as to have said in the same sentence τρίτον τοῦτο ἔρχομαι , and ὡς παρὼν τὸ δεύτερον , <em> both</em> , according to these interpreters, with reference to the <em> same journey</em> ? And would he not have even on such an hypothesis have said τὸ δεύτερον τοῦτο ? But if we render as above, the <strong> προείρηκα</strong> (perf. because the warning yet endured in force) refers to his <em> second</em> visit ( παρὼν τὸ δεύτ .), and the <strong> προλέγω</strong> to his present condition of absence ( ἀπὼν νῦν ), <strong> ὡς</strong> being <strong> as</strong> (‘ <em> I did</em> ’ or ‘ <em> do</em> ,’ for it applies to both clauses), and <strong> καί</strong> the simple copula.
