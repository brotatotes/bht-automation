<p><strong> 7.</strong> ] Yet he prays God rather that they may require no such demonstration of his apostolic power, even though he lose in reputation by it.

<p><strong> μὴ ποιῆς</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὑμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κακ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> μηδ</strong> .] Not, as Grot., al., ‘ <em> that I may not have to inflict on you any evil</em> ’ (an extraordinary rendering of κακὸν ποιεῖν ), but <strong> that ye may do no evil</strong> , corresponding to <strong> ἵνα ὑμεῖς τὸ καλὸν ποιῆτε</strong> below.

<p><strong> οὐχ ἵνα</strong> …] ‘And the purpose of this my prayer is not to gain any repute by your Christian graces, but that you may be highly endowed with them, and (if it so happen) we may be as of no repute (‘hominum scilicet judicio,’ Beza).’ That this is the sense, and that <strong> δόκιμοι</strong> is not in this verse to be applied to <em> substantiation of power by punishment</em> , is necessitated by the construction, it being plainly shewn by the infin. after εὐχόμ ., that ἵνα is not here meant to apply, even in part, to the <em> purport</em> of the prayer (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:9">Colossians 1:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:11">2 Thessalonians 1:11</span> ; see note on 1Co 14:13 ), but to its <em> purpose</em> . And that being settled, <strong> we pray … not in order that we may appear</strong> <strong> δόκιμοι</strong> , it follows that the <em> appearing</em> δόκιμοι would be a result of the <em> fulfilment of the prayer</em> , viz. of your <em> doing no evil</em> , and this it couid only be by their <em> doing no evil</em> bringing credit on the Apostle’s ministry. It is not <em> for this end</em> that we pray that you may do no evil, but <em> for your own good</em> , even if that tend to the non-exercise, and so depreciation, of our apostolic power.</p>
