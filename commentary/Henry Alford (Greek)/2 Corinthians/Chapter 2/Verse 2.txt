<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] <strong> γάρ</strong> , reason why I would not come to you in grief: because I should have to grieve those who formed my proper material for thankfulness and joy.

<p><strong> ἐγώ</strong> has a peculiar emphasis: ‘If <em> I</em> cause you grief’.… implying, ‘there are who cause you sufficient.’

<p><strong> καί</strong> prefixed to a question denotes <em> inconsequence on</em> , or <em> inconsistency with</em> , the foregoing supposition or affirmation: so Eur. Med. 1388, ὦ τέκνα φίλτατα ! “ μητρί γε , σοὶ δ ʼ οὔ .” κἄπειτ ʼ ἔκτας ; see other examples in Hartung, Partikellehre, i. p. 147. It is best expressed in English by ‘ <em> then</em> :’ <strong> who is he then</strong> , &amp;c. as in E. V.

<p>The explanation of Chrys., who has been followed by Erasm., Bengel, Olsh., al., is curious, and certainly inconsistent with the context: εἰ καὶ λυπῶ ὑμᾶς , χάριν μοι παρέχετε κἀν τούτῳ μεγίστην , ὅτι δάκνεσθε ὑπὸ τῶν παρ ʼ ἐμοῦ λεγομένων . Hom. iv. p. 456. Some of these Commentators refer the <em> singular</em> to the offender, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:5-8">2 Corinthians 2:5-8</span> . But however the words may <em> bear</em> the meaning, and however <em> true</em> the saying might be, it is pretty clear that it would be beside the subject: nay, would give a reason the other way, why he <em> should</em> come to them.</p>
