<p><strong> ἡ ἐπιτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὕτη</strong> ] <strong> This punishment</strong> (= ἐπιτίμιον , see reff.): <em> what it was</em> , we are unable with certainty to say; but <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:0">1 Corinthians 5:0</span> seems to point to <em> excommunication</em> as forming at least a <em> part</em> of it. But it was not a formal and public, only a <em> voluntary individual abstinence from communion</em> with him, as is shewn by ὑπὸ <strong> τῶν πλειόνων</strong> : the anti-pauline party probably refusing compliance with the Apostle’s command.
