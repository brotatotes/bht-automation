<p><strong> 9</strong> .] <em> Reason why</em> they should now be ready to shew love to him again, the end of Paul’s writing to them having been accomplished by their obeying his order. <strong> For to this end I also wrote</strong> : the <strong> καί</strong> signifying that my former epistle, as well as my present exhortation, tended to this, viz. the <em> testing your obedience</em> . Meyer (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:0">Exodus 2:0</span> ) explains the καί as implying that other orders to the same effect were sent by word of mouth. He alludes beyond doubt to the former Epistle, ch. 5. Yet the ancient Commentators, Chrys., &amp;c., and Erasm., Wolf, Bengel, al. (not Olsh., as De Wette says), interpret it of <em> this Epistle</em> : which certainly is grammatically allowable (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:9">1 Corinthians 5:9</span> , note), but opposed to the context (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:3-4">2 Corinthians 2:3-4</span> , besides the manifest sense here, that the object of his writing <em> had been accomplished)</em> . <strong> That I might know the proof of you, whether in all things</strong> (emphatic) <strong> ye are obedient</strong> . This was that one among the various objects of his first Epistle, which belonged to the matter at present in hand, and which he therefore puts forward: not by any means implying that he had <em> no other</em> view in writing it.</p>
