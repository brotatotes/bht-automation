<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] <strong> For</strong> (substantiation of the foregoing πολλῷ μᾶλλον ) <strong> even that which has been glorified</strong> (viz. the διακ . τ . κατακρίς ., which was ἐν δόξῃ by the brightness on the face of Moses) <strong> has not been glorified</strong> (has lost all its glory) <strong> in this respect</strong> (i.e. when compared with the gospel, κατὰ τὸν τῆς συγκρίσεως λόγον , Chrys. Hom. vii. p. 481.

<p>De W. takes ἐν τ . τῷ μέρ . with δεδοξασμένον , ‘that which was in this particular glorified,’ viz. in the brightness on the face of Moses: but that would more naturally be τὸ ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει δεδοξασμένον : as it now stands I cannot divide otherwise than οὐ δεδόξασται | τὸ δεδοξασμένον | ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει . Meyer takes τὸ δεδοξ . as <em> abstract</em> , and ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει as pointing to the <em> concrete</em> : ‘that which has been glorified (general and abstract) has in this particular department (concrete, viz. the διακ . τ . κατακρίς . which was δεδοξασμ .) no glory: q. d. the glorified is unglorified in this case.’ This may certainly be, and is ingenious: but the other is simpler) <strong> on account of</strong> (i.e. when we take into consideration) <strong> the surpassing glory</strong> (viz. of the other διακονία : <em> present</em> , because spoken of qualitatively).</p>
