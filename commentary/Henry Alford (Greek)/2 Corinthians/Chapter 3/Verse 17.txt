<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] <strong> Now</strong> ( δέ exponentis. τίς δὲ οὗτος πρὸς ὃν δεῖ ἀποβλέψαι ; Theodoret) <strong> the Lord is the Spirit:</strong> i.e. the <strong> κύριος</strong> of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:16">2 Corinthians 3:16</span> , is, the <em> Spirit</em> , whose word the O. T. is: the πνεῦμα , as opposed to the γράμμα , which ζωοποιεῖ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span> .
	</p>
<p>But it is not merely, as Wetst., ‘Dominus <em> significat</em> Spiritum,’ nor is πνεῦμα merely, as Olsh., <em> the spiritual sense of the law</em> : but, ‘ <em> the Lord</em> ,’ as here spoken of, ‘Christ,’ ‘ <em> is the Spirit</em> ,’ is identical with the Holy Spirit: not personally nor essentially, but, as is shewn by <strong> τὸ πνεῦμα κυρίου</strong> following, <em> in this department of His divine working: Christ</em> , here, <em> is the Spirit of Christ</em> . The principal mistaken interpretation (among many, see Pool’s Synops., Meyer, De Wette) is that of Chrys., Theodoret, Theophyl., Œcum., Estius, Schulz, making τὸ πνεῦμα the subject, and ὁ κύρ . the predicate, which though perhaps (but would δέ then have had its present position?) allowable, is against the context, ὁ δὲ κύρ . being plainly resumed from ὁ κύρ . in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:16">2 Corinthians 3:16</span> . The words are then used by them as a proof of the Divinity of the Holy Spirit.
	</p>
<p><strong> But</strong> ( δέ appealing to a known or evident axiom, as in a mathematical demonstration) <strong> where the Spirit of the Lord</strong> (see above) <strong> is, is liberty</strong> ( ἐκεῖ has probably been inserted, as being usual after οὗ : but, as Meyer remarks, not in St. Paul’s style, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</span> ; Rom 5:20 ). They are fettered in spirit as long as they are slaves to the letter, = as long as they have the vail on their hearts; but when they turn to the Lord the Spirit, which is not πνεῦμα δουλείας but πν . υἱοθεσίας , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span> , and by virtue of whom οὐκ ἔτι εἶ δοῦλος , ἀλλὰ νἱός , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:7">Galatians 4:7</span> , then they are at liberty. There can hardly be any allusion to a vail over the head implying subjection, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:10">1 Corinthians 11:10</span> , (Erasm., Beza, Grot., Bengel, Fritz.,) for here the <em> covering of the head</em> with a vail is not thought of, but merely intercepting the sight.</p>
