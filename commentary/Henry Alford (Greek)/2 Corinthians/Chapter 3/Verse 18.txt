<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] <strong> But</strong> (the sight of the Jews is thus intercepted; in contrast to whom) WE all (‘ <em> all Christians</em> :’ not, as Erasm., Estius, Bengel, al. m., ‘we Apostles and teachers: the contrast is to the νἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ above) <strong> with unvailed face</strong> (the vail having been removed at our conversion: the stress is on these words) <strong> beholding in a mirror the glory of the Lord</strong> (i.e. Christ: from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:16-17">2 Corinthians 3:16-17</span> .

<p><strong> κατοπτρίζω</strong> is to <em> shew in a mirror, to make a reflexion in a mirror</em> ; so Plutarch, de Placitis Philosophorum, iii. 5: Anaxagoras explained a rainbow to be the reflexion of the sun’s brightness from a thick cloud, that always stands opposite τοῦ κατοπτρίζοντος αὐτὸ ἀστέρος . In the middle, it is ‘ <em> to behold oneself in a mirror</em> :’ so Diog. Laert., Plato, p. 115, τοῖς μεθύουσι συνεβούλευε κατοπτρίζεσθαι ; but also, <em> to see in a mirror</em> , so Philo, Legis Allegor. iii. 33, vol. i. p. 107, μὴ γὰρ ἐμφανισθείης μοι δι ʼ οὐρανοῦ ἢ γῆς ἢ ὕδατος ἢ ἀέρος ἤ τινος ἁπλῶς τῶν ἐν γενέσει , μηδὲ κατοπτρισαίμην ἐν ἄλλῳ τινὶ τὴν σὴν ἰδέαν , ἢ ἐν σοὶ τῷ θεῷ . And such is evidently the meaning here: the gospel is this mirror, the εὐαγγέλιον <strong> τῆς δόξης τοῦ χριστοῦ</strong> , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span> , and we, looking on it with unvailed face, are the contrast to the Jews, with vailed hearts reading their law. The meaning ‘ <em> reflecting</em> the glory,’ &amp;c. as Chrys., Luth, Calov., Bengel, Billroth, Olsh., is one which neither the word nor the context (see above) will bear (see, however, Stanley’s note), <strong> are transfigured into the same image</strong> (which we see in the mirror: the image of the glory of Christ, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:19">Galatians 4:19</span> , which is more to the point than <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span> , cited by Meyer, and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span> . But the change here spoken of is a <em> spiritual</em> one, not the bodily change at the Resurrection: it is going on here in the process of sanctification.

<p>No prep. need be understood before τὴν αὐτὴν εἰκόνα the passive verb indirectly governs the acc., as in ἀποτέμνομαι τὴν κεφαλήν and similar cases) <strong> from glory to glory</strong> (this is explained, either (1) ‘ <em> from one degree of glory to another</em> ;’ so most Commentators and De Wette, or (2) ‘ <em> from</em> (by) <em> the glory which we see, into glory</em> ,’ as Chrys. p. 486, ἀπὸ δόξης , τῆς τοῦ πνεύματος , εἰς δόξαν , τὴν ἡμετέραν , τὴν ἐγγιγνομένην , Theodoret, Œcum., Theophyl., Bengel, Fritz., Meyer, al. I prefer the former, as the other would introduce a tautology, the sentiment being expressed in the words following) <strong> as by the Lord the Spirit.</strong> κυρίου πνεύματος = τοῦ κυρίου τοῦ πνεύματος , the first art. being omitted after the preposition, the second to conform the predicate to its subject, as in ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρός , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:3">Galatians 1:3</span> , and answers to ὁ δὲ κύριος τὸ πνεῦμά ἐστιν above. This seems the obvious and most satisfactory way of taking the words, and, from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span> , to be necessitated by the context; and so Theodoret, Luther, Beza, Calov., Wolf, Estius, al. The rendering upheld by Fritz., Billroth, Meyer, De Wette, ‘ <em> the Lord of the Spirit</em> ,’ i.e. ‘Christ, whose Spirit He is,’ seems to me to convey very little meaning, besides being an expression altogether unprecedented. The transformation is effected <em> by the Spirit</em> ( τοῦτο μεταμορφοῖ , Chrys.), the Author and Upholder of spiritual life, who ‘takes of the things of Christ, and <em> shews them to us</em> ,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:14">John 16:14</span> , see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10-11">Romans 8:10-11</span> , who sanctifies us till we are holy as Christ is holy; the process of renewal after Christ’s image is <em> such a transformation as may be expected by the agency of</em> ( καθάπερ ἀπό , so Chrys., καὶ τοιαύτην οἵαν εἰκὸς ἀπὸ …) <em> the Lord the Spirit</em> , Christ Himself <em> being the image</em> , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span> . The two other renderings are out of the question, as being inconsistent with the order of the words: viz.: (1) that of E. V. and of Vulg., Theophyl., Grot., Bengel, ‘ <em> the Spirit of the Lord</em> ,’ and (2) that of Chrys., Theodoret, Calov., Estius, ‘ <em> the Spirit who is the Lord</em> .’

<p>Meyer objects to the interpretation given above as inconsistent with the <em> self-evident connexion of the genitives</em> . How would he render ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρός ?</p>
