<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] <strong> always carrying about in our body</strong> (i.e. ever in our apostolic work having our body exposed to and an example of: or perhaps even, as Stanley, “bearing with us, wherever we go, the burden of the dead body.” But see below) <strong> the killing</strong> (the word seems only to occur besides, in ref. Rom., where it signifies, figuratively, utter lack of strength and vital power, in a fragment of the Oneirocritica of Astrampsychus (Meyer), νεκροὺς ὁρῶν , νέκρωσιν ἕξεις πραγμάτων , where the sense is also figurative, and in its primary physical sense in the medical works of Aretæus and Galen. But here the literal sense, ‘ <em> the being put to death</em> ,’ must evidently be kept, and the expression understood as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:31">1 Corinthians 15:31</span> , and as Chrys.: οἱ θάνατοι οἱ καθημερινοί , δι ʼ ὧν καὶ ἡ ἀνάστασις ἐδείκνυτο Hom. ix. p. 498. The rendering, ‘the <em> deadness</em> of Jesus to the flesh, as opposed to the vitality, ἡ ζωὴ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ below,’ see Dr. Peile’s Annotations on the Epistles, i. 383, is beside the present purpose, and altogether inconsistent with ἀεὶ εἰς θάνατον παραδιδόμεθα διὰ Ἰησοῦν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:11">2 Corinthians 4:11</span> . See Stanley’s note) <strong> of Jesus</strong> (as τὰ παθήματα τοῦ χριστοῦ , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:5">2 Corinthians 1:5</span> : not ‘ad exemplum Christi,’ as Grot., al.), <strong> in order that also the life of Jesus may be manifested in our body:</strong> i.e. ‘that in our bodies, holding up against such troubles and preserved in such dangers, may be shewn forth that mighty power of God which is a testimony that Jesus lives and is exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour:’ not, ‘that our repeated deliverances might resemble His Resurrection, as our sufferings His Death,’ as Meyer, who argues that the literal meaning must be retained, as in the other member of the comparison, owing ἐν τῷ σώματι ἡμ . But, as De W. justly observes, the bodily deliverance is manifestly a subordinate consideration, and the ζωή of far higher significance, testified indeed by the body’s preservation, but extending far beyond it.</p>
