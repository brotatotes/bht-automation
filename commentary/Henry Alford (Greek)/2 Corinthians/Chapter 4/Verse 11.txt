<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] Explanation and confirmation of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</span> . <strong> For we who live</strong> ( <strong> ζῶντες</strong> asserting that to which death is alien and strange, an antithesis to εἰς θάνατον παραδ ., as in the other clause ζωή to ἐν τῇ θνητῇ σαρκί . No more specific meaning for ζῶντες must be imagined, as ‘ <em> tantis mortibus superstitem</em> ,’ Bengel, Estius, al., or ‘ <em> as long as we live</em> ,’ Beza, al., or ‘ <em> qui adhuc vivimus, qui nondum ex vita excessimus ut multi jam Christianorum</em> ,’ as Grot.) <strong> are alway being delivered to death</strong> (in dangers and persecutions, so ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span> , ἐν θανάτοις πολλάκις ) <strong> on account of Jesus</strong> (so in Rev 1:9 John was in Patmos διὰ τὸν λόγον τοῦ θεοῦ κ . διὰ τὴν μαρτυρίαν Ἰησοῦ ), <strong> that also the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh</strong> (the antithesis is more strongly put by θνητῇ σαρκί than it would be by θνητῷ σώματι , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span> , the <em> flesh</em> being the very pabulum of decay and corruption). By this antithesis, the wonderful greatness of the divine power, ἡ ὑπερβολὴ τῆς δυνάμεως , is strikingly brought out: God exhibits DEATH in the <em> living</em> , that He may exhibit LIFE in the <em> dying</em> .</p>
