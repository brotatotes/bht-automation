<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] By it is also brought out that which is here the immediate subject, the vast and unexampled trials of the apostolic office, all summed up in these words: <strong> So that death works in us, but life in you;</strong> i.e. ‘ <em> the trials by which the dying of Jesus is exhibited in us, are exclusively and peculiarly</em> OUR OWN, <em> whereas</em> (and this is decisive for the <em> spiritual</em> sense of ζωή ) <em> the life, whereof we are to be witnesses, extends beyond ourselves, nay finds its field of action and energizing</em> IN YOU.’ Estius, Grot., and apparently Olsh., take ἐνεργεῖται passively, ‘is wrought’ (‘mors agitur et exercetur … perficitur vita.’ Est.): but it is never so used in N. T. Chrys., Calv., al., take the verse ironically, τὰ μὲν ἐπικίνδυνα ἡμεῖς ὑπομένομεν , τῶν δὲ χρηστῶν ὑμεῖς ἀπολαύετε , but such a sentiment seems alien from the spirit of the passage. Meyer, as unfortunately, limits ζωή to <em> natural</em> life, whereas (as above) the context plainly evinces <em> spiritual life</em> to be meant, not merely natural.

<p>In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10-11">Romans 8:10-11</span> , the vivifying influence of His Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead is spoken of as extending to the body also; <em> here</em> , the upholding influence of Him who delivers and preserves the body, is spoken of as vivifying the whole man: LIFE, in both places, being <em> the higher and spiritual life, including</em> the lower and natural. ‘And, in our relative positions, of this <em> life</em> , YE are the examples, a church of believers, alive to God through Christ in your various vocations, and not called on to be θεατριζόμενοι [cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:9">1 Corinthians 4:9</span> ; Heb 10:33 ] as WE are, who are (not indeed excluded from that <em> life</em> , nay it flows from us to you, but are) more especially examples of conformity to the <em> death</em> of our common Lord: in whom DEATH WORKS.’</p>
