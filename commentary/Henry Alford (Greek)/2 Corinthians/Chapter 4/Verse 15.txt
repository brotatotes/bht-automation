<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] Explanation of σὺν <strong> ὑμῖν</strong> as a ground of his trust: with reference also to ἡ δὲ ζωὴ ἐν <strong> ὑμῖν</strong> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:12">2 Corinthians 4:12</span> ; viz. that all, both the sufferings and victory of the ministers, are <em> for the church:</em> see the parallel expression, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:6-7">2 Corinthians 1:6-7</span> . <strong> For all things</strong> ( <em> of which we have been speaking</em> ; or perhaps hyperbolically, ALL THINGS, the whole working and arrangements of God, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:22">1 Corinthians 3:22</span> , εἴτε ἐνεστῶτα εἴτε μέλλοντα , πάντα ὑμῶν ) <strong> are on your behalf, that Grace, having abounded by means of the greater number</strong> (who have received it), <strong> may multiply the thanksgiving</strong> (which shall accrue), <strong> to the glory of God.</strong> Such (1) is the rendering of Meyer, and, in the main, of Chrys., Erasm., al., and recently, Rückert and Olshausen. <em> Three other ways</em> are possible; (2) ‘ <em> that Grace, having abounded, may, on account of the thanksgiving of the greater number, be multiplied</em> (‘ πλεονάζω habet vim positivi: περισσεύω , comparativi,’ Bengel) <em> to the glory of God.</em> ’ So Luther, Beza, Estius, Grot., Bengel, al.: (3) ‘ <em> that Grace, having abounded, may, by means of the greater number, multiply the thanksgiving to the glory of God</em> .’ So Emmerling and De Wette: (4) ‘ <em> that Grace having multiplied</em> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:12">1 Thessalonians 3:12</span> , for the transitive sense) <em> by means of the greater number the thanksgiving, may abound to the glory of God</em> .’ This last has not been suggested by any Commentator that I am aware of, but is admissible.

<p>I prefer (1), as best agreeing with the position of the words, and with the emphases. If (2) had been intended, I should have expected ἵνα πλεονάσασα ἡ χάρις , πλεονάσασα in its present position standing awkwardly alone. The same remark applies to (3), and this besides, that in that case I should expect πλειόνων , and not τῶν πλ ., in which the art. rather regards the <em> matter of fact</em> , the many who <em> have received</em> the grace, or who give thanks, than the intention, to multiply the thanksgiving by the (possible) greater number of persons. If (4) had been intended, I should have looked for ἵνα ἡ χάρις τὴν εὐχαριστίαν πλεον . διὰ τῶν πλει ., περισς . κ . τ . λ . By adopting (1), we keep the words and emphases just where they stand: ἵνα ἡ χάρις , πλεονάσασα διὰ τῶν πλειόνων (not διὰ τ . πλ . πλεον ., which would give an undue prominence to διὰ τῶν πλειόν ., whereas those words only particularize πλεονάσασα ), τὴν εὐχ . περισσεύσῃ , εἰς τὴν δόξαν τ . θεοῦ . As to the <em> sense</em> , (see the very similar sentiment, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:11">2 Corinthians 1:11</span> ,) <em> thanksgiving</em> is the highest and noblest offering of the Church to God’s glory ( θυσία αἰνέσεως δοξάσει με , Ps. 49:23, LXX): <em> that this may be rendered</em> , in the best sense, as the result of the working of grace which has become abundant by means of the many recipients, is the great end of the Christian ministry.</p>
