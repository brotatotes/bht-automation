<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] <em> Subjective condition under which this working out takes place</em> . <strong> While we regard not</strong> (‘propose not as our aim,’ ‘spend not our care about,’ reff.) <strong> the things which are seen</strong> (ref. = τὰ ἐπίγεια , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:19">Philippians 3:19</span> . Chrys. strikingly says, ubi sup., τὰ βλεπόμενα πάντα , κἂν κόλασις ᾖ , κἂν ἀνάπαυσις · ὥστε μήτε ἐκεῖθεν χαυνοῦσθαι , μήτε ἐντεῦθεν βιάζεσθαι ), <strong> but the things which are not seen</strong> (‘aliud significat ἀόρατα , <em> invisibilia</em> , nam multa quæ non cernuntur, erunt visibilia, confecto itinere fidei.’ Bengel.

<p><strong> μὴ βλ</strong> ., not οὐ , perhaps because μή stands with participles in clauses of a subjective character, so στήκετε … μὴ πτυρόμενοι ἐν μηδενὶ …, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:27-28">Philippians 1:27-28</span> . Winer, edn. 6, § 55. 5. g. β , or rather perhaps, as ib. α , as hypothetic (see also Moulton’s note, p. 606. 1): τὰ <strong> οὐ</strong> βλεπόμ . would be the things which <em> as a matter of fact</em> at <em> any given time</em> we <em> do not see</em> , cf. οἱ οὐκ ἠλεημένοι , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:10">1 Peter 2:10</span> ; τὰ <strong> μὴ</strong> βλ ., <em> generally</em> and <em> hypothetically</em> , the things not seen. So ὁ μὴ ὢν μετ ʼ ἐμοῦ <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:30">Matthew 12:30</span> , in a case indefinite and hypothetical. This amounts to much the same as when in the ordinary account of such clauses, we say that μή belongs to the <em> subject</em> , οὐ to the <em> predicate</em> , but is a better explanation, inasmuch as that account gives only the logical <em> fact, this</em> , the logical <em> reason</em> of the usage): <strong> for the things which are seen are temporary</strong> (not ‘ <em> temporal</em> ,’ belonging to time,’ but ‘ <em> fleeting</em> ,’ ‘only for a time,’ see reff.; i.e. till the day of Christ): <strong> but</strong> <strong> the things which are not seen are eternal</strong> . Chrys. again: κἂν βασιλεία , κἂν κόλασις ᾖ πάλιν · ὥστε καὶ ἐκεῖθεν φοβῆσαι , καὶ ἐκεῖσε (al. ἐντεῦθεν ) προτρέψασθαι , ib.

<p>Seneca, Ep. 59 (Wetst.), has a very similar sentiment: ‘ista imaginaria sunt, et ad tempus aliquam faciem ferunt. Nihil horum stabile nec solidum est … Mittamus animum ad ea, quæ æterna sunt.’</p>
