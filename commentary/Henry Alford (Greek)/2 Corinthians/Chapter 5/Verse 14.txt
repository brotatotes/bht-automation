<p><strong> 14.</strong> ] <strong> For</strong> (reason of his devotion under all reports and circumstances, θεῷ and ὑμῖν , as in last verse) <strong> Christ’s love</strong> (not, <em> love to Christ</em> , as Œc [6] , Beza, al., but <em> Christ’s love to men</em> , subjective, as most Commentators; as shewn in <em> His Death</em> , which is the greatest proof of love, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6-8">Romans 5:6-8</span> . Meyer remarks that the gen. of the person after ἀγάπη is with Paul <em> always</em> subjective, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:5">Romans 5:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8">Romans 5:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:35">Romans 8:35</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:39">Romans 8:39</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:24">2 Corinthians 8:24</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:13">2 Corinthians 13:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:4">Ephesians 2:4</span> ; Php 1:9 al. (but see his own note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:5">2 Thessalonians 3:5</span> , where he maintains the objective sense), whereas with John it is not always so, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:3">1 John 5:3</span> . Paul usually expresses love <em> of</em> , i.e. <em> towards</em> , by <strong> εἰς</strong> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:4">Colossians 1:4</span> ; 1Th 3:12 ) <strong> constraineth us</strong> (a better word could not be found: the idea of συνέχω is that of <em> forcible limitation</em> , either in a good or a bad sense, of <em> confining to one object</em> , or <em> within certain bounds</em> , be that one object a painful or glorious one, those bounds the angustiæ of distress, or the course of apostolic energy, as here. ‘ <em> Constraineth us</em> ,’ generally: limits us to one great end, and prohibits our taking into consideration any others. ‘Metaphora est in verbo <em> constringendi</em> : qua notatur, fieri non posse, quin, quisquis mirificum illum amorem quem testatus est nobis Christus morte sua, vere expendit et reputat, quasi ei alligatus, et arctissimo vinculo constrictus, se in illius obsequium addicat.’ Calv. The varieties of interpretation, some as Meyer, urging more the sense <em> cohibendi</em> , others as Chrys., that <em> excitandi</em> , οὐκ ἀφίησιν ἡμᾶς ἡσυχάζειν , all in fact amount to one that of the <em> forcible compression</em> of his energies to one line of action),
