<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] [ <strong> having judged this</strong> (i.e.] <strong> because we formed this judgment</strong> , viz. at our conversion: learned to regard this as a settled truth) <strong> that One died on behalf of all</strong> (not only, for the <em> benefit</em> of all, as Meyer, but <em> instead of</em> all, suffered death in the root and essence of our humanity, as the second Adam. This death on behalf of <em> all men</em> is the absolute objective fact: that <em> all</em> enter not into the benefit of that Death, is owing to the non-fulfilment of the subjective condition which follows), <strong> therefore all died</strong> (i.e. therefore, in the death of Christ, <em> all, the</em> all for whom He died, οἱ πάντες , <em> died too</em> : i.e. see below, became planted in the likeness of His death, died to sin and to self, that they might live to Him. This was true, <em> objectively</em> , but <em> not subjectively</em> till such death to sin and self is realized in each: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:8">Romans 6:8</span> ff.). The other renderings, ‘ <em> ought to die</em> ,’ as Thomas Aq., Grot., Estius, al., ‘ <em> were under sentence of death</em> ,’ as Chrys., Theodoret, Beza, al.; ‘ <em> as good as died</em> , Flatt; are shewn to be erroneous by carefully noticing the construction, with or without εἰ . The <em> verb</em> is common to both members of the sentence; the correspondent emphatic words in the two members being (1) <strong> εἷς ὑπὲρ πάντων</strong> , (2) <strong> πάντες</strong> : ‘( <em> One on behalf of all</em> ) died, therefore ( <em> all</em> ) died: if <em> One</em> died the death of (belonging to, due from) all, then all died (in and with Him).’

<p>Meyer’s rendering of ὅτι <em> because</em> , can hardly be right as it would leave κρίναντας τοῦτο standing awkwardly alone. <strong> And He died for all, in order that they who live</strong> (in <em> this life</em> , see ἡμεῖς οἱ ζῶντες , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:11">2 Corinthians 4:11</span> ; = in sense, ‘ <em> as long as they are in this state</em> ,’ as De W.: not, ‘those who live <em> spiritually</em> ,’ as Beza, Flatt, which would altogether strike out the sense, for it is, <em> that they may</em> live spiritually, &amp;c.: nor, ‘ <em> superstites</em> ,’ they whom He left behind at His death, ζῶντες in contrast with Him who ἀπέθανεν , as Meyer; for, not to insist on the more general reference to <em> all time</em> , many to whom the Apostle was now writing were <em> not born at the time of His Death</em> ) <strong> should no longer</strong> (now that His Death has taken place: or, as they did before they apprehended that Death as theirs, but I prefer the former, see ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν below) <strong> live to themselves</strong> (with <em> self</em> as their great source and end of action, to please and to obey) <strong> but to Him that died and rose again for them</strong> ( <strong> ὑπέρ</strong> , not merely even as connected with ἐγερθέντι ‘ <em> for the benefit of</em> ,’ as Meyer again; but strictly ‘ <em> in the place of</em> :’ as the Death of Christ is <em> our death</em> , so His Resurrection is <em> our resurrection</em> ).</p>
