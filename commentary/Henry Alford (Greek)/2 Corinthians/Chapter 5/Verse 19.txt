<p><strong> 19.</strong> ] <strong> how that</strong> (the ὡς imports that the proposition following it, introduced by ὅτι , is matter of indirect reference. So Xen. Hell. iii. 2. 14, εἰπὼν τῷ φάρακι ὡς ὅτι ὀκνοίη μὴ ὁ Τισσαφ . κ . τ . λ ., and argum. Isocr. Busir. p. 520 (cited by Winer, edn. 6, § 65. 9), κατηγόρουν αὐτοῦ , ὡς ὅτι καινὰ δαιμόνια εἰσφέρει ) <strong> God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself</strong> ( <strong> ἦν καταλλάσσων</strong> not exactly = κατήλλασσεν , any more than ἦν κηρύσσων <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:44">Luke 4:44</span> = ἐκήρυσσεν : in both cases the habitual state is more emphatically implied than could be done by the imperfect merely: the shade of difference can, however, hardly be expressed in English.

<p><strong> ἦν</strong> cannot, as in Erasm., Luther, Calv., Beza, al., and E. V., belong to ἐν χριστῷ , ‘God <em> was in Christ</em> , reconciling’ &amp;c., partly on account of the position of ἐν χρ ., which would thus probably be before ἦν , but principally (Meyer) because of incoherence with θέμενος ἐν ἡμῖν κ . τ . λ .: for in that case the two latter clauses must express the <em> manner</em> of reconciliation by Christ, which the second of them does not.

Apostles and teachers) <strong> the word of the reconciliation</strong> (as ὁ λόγος ὁ τοῦ σταυροῦ , 1Co 1:18 ).</p>
