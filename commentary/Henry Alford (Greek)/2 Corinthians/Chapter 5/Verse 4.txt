<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] <em> Confirmation and explanation of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:2">2 Corinthians 5:2</span></em> . <strong> For also</strong> (a reason, why we ἐπιποθοῦμεν ἐπενδύσασθαι .… as in ver.2) <strong> we who are in the tabernacle</strong> (before spoken of, i.e. of the body), <strong> groan, being burdened</strong> (not by <em> troubles and sufferings</em> , nor by the <em> body itself</em> , which would be directly opposite to the sense: but for the reason which follows), <strong> because</strong> ( ἐφ ʼ ᾧ as in ref. Rom.) <strong> we are not willing to divest ourselves</strong> (of it), <strong> but to put on (that other) over it, that our mortal part may</strong> (not, die, but) <strong> be swallowed up by life</strong> (absorbed in and transmuted by that glorious principle of life which our new clothing shall superinduce upon us). The feeling expressed in these verses was one most natural to those who, as the Apostles, regarded the coming of the Lord as <em> near</em> , and conceived the possibility of their living to behold it. It was no terror of death as to its <em> consequences</em> but a natural reluctance to undergo the <em> mere act of death as such</em> , when it was within possibility that this mortal body might be superseded by the immortal one, without it.</p>
