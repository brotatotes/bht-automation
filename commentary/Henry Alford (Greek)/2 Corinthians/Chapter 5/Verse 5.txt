<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] This great end, the καταποθῆναι τὸ θνητὸν ὑπὸ τῆς ζωῆς , is justified as the object of the Apostle’s fervent wish, seeing that it is for this very end, that this may ultimately be accomplished, that God has wrought us (see below) and given us the pledge of the Spirit; <strong> But</strong> (and this my wish has reason: for) <strong> He who wrought us out</strong> (prepared us, by redemption, justification, sanctification, which are the qualifications for glory) <strong> unto this very purpose</strong> (viz. that last mentioned τὸ καταποθῆναι τὸ θνητὸν ἡμῶν ὑπὸ τ . ζωῆς , not τὸ ἐπενδύσασθαι , a mere accident of that glorious absorption: see below) <strong> is God, who gave unto us</strong> (a sign that our preparation is of Him: ‘ <em> quippe qui dederit</em> ’.…) <strong> the earnest</strong> (reff. and note) <strong> of</strong> (gen. of apposition) <strong> the (Holy) Spirit</strong> . The Apostle in this verse, is no longer treating exclusively of his own wish for the more summary swallowing up of the mortal by the glorified, but is shewing that <em> the end itself</em> , which he individually, or in common with others then living, wishes accomplished in this particular form of ἐπενδύσασθαι , <em> is, under whatever form brought about</em> , that for which all the preparation, by grace, of Christians, is carried on, and to which the earnest of the Spirit points forward. Meyer would limit this verse entirely to the wish expressed in the last: but he is <em> certainly wrong</em> : for it forms a note of transition to θαῤῥοῦντες οὖν πάντοτε in the next: see below.</p>
