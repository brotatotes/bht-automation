<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] Here even more clearly than before, the first member of the clause ὡς λυπ . ἀεὶ δὲ χαίρ . cannot express the opinion of his adversaries. For however παιδευόμενος might be wrested to signify ‘a man under the chastisement of God’ as a ground of reproach, <strong> λυπούμενος</strong> will surely not bear the meaning <em> solcher der nach gemohnlicher menschlicher Unsicht traurig sehn mußte</em> ,’ ‘one in such a situation, that according to ordinary human estimation he must be wretched,’ as De Wette, but must point to the matter of fact, that he is really ‘ <em> afflicted</em> .’ See reff.

<p><strong> πτωχοί</strong> again can hardly have been a <em> reproach</em> , but sets forth the <em> fact</em> <strong> as poor men, but enriching</strong> (not by distribution of alms, as Chrys., Theodoret, Estius, but by imparting spiritual riches, see 1Co 1:5 ) <strong> many: as having nothing</strong> (in the sense in which οἱ ἔχοντες are ὡς μὴ ἔχοντες , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:29">1 Corinthians 7:29</span> , in the improper sense of ‘to <em> possess</em> ’ in which we here use the word <em> thus</em> , we have nothing, are destitute), <strong> but possessing</strong> (finally and as our own, our inheritance never to be taken away; in that sense of the word ‘ <em> to possess</em> ’ which this world’s buyers are <em> not</em> to use οἱ ἀγοράζοντες , ὡς <strong> μὴ κατέχοντες</strong> , 1Co 7:30 ) <strong> all things</strong> . See a similar ‘possession of all things,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:22">1 Corinthians 3:22</span> ; though this reaches further than even that, to the boundless riches of the heavenly inheritance.</p>
