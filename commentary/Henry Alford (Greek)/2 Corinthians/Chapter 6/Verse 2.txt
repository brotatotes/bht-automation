<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] <em> Ground of the exhortation</em> : viz. the importance of the present time as the day of acceptance, shewn by a Scripture citation. <strong> For he</strong> (God, with whom we συνεργοῦμεν and whose grace we recommend) <strong> saith, ‘In an accepted time</strong> (Heb. בְּעֵת רָצוֹן , ‘ <em> in a season of grace</em> ’) <strong> I heard thee, and in the day of salvation I helped thee:’ behold</strong> (inserted for solemnity to mark the importance of what follows), NOW <strong> is the favourably accepted time</strong> ( εὐπρόσδεκτος , a far stronger term than δεκτός , q. d. the <em> very</em> time of <em> most favourable</em> acceptance, said from the fulness of his feeling of the greatness of God’s grace), <strong> behold</strong> , NOW <strong> is the day of salvation</strong> . ὁ γὰρ ἐν τοιούτῳ καιρῷ ἀγωνιζόμενος , ἐν ᾧ τοσαύτη κέχυται δωρεά , ἐν ᾧ τοσαύτη χάρις , εὐκόλως ἐπιτεύξεται τῶν βραβείων . Chrys. p. 522. The prophecy is one directly of the Lord Jesus, as the restorer and gatherer of his people; and the time of acceptance is the interval of the offer of the covenant to men, conceded to Him by the Father.</p>
