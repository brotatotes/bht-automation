<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] Meyer well remarks the position of συνιστ . ἑαυτούς . When the words signified ‘to recommend <em> ourselves</em> ,’ in a bad sense, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:1">2 Corinthians 3:1</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:12">2 Corinthians 5:12</span> , ἑαυτ . <em> preceded</em> the verb: but here and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:2">2 Corinthians 4:2</span> , where used in a good sense, and without any stress on ἑαυτούς , it <em> follows</em> the verb.

<p>The following datives are a specification of παντί ; but not all of the same sort: some signify <em> instruments by which</em> , some, <em> situations in which</em> , some <em> both these</em> . Bengel remarks: “Insignis gradatio. Sequuntur ter tria patienda (i.e. from θλίψεσιν to νηστείαις ), quibus <em> patientia</em> ( ὑπομονή ) exercetur; <em> pressuræ, plagæ, labores</em> . Primus ternarius continet <em> genera</em> , secundus, <em> species</em> adversorum: tertia <em> spontanea</em> ” (but qu?: see below). So that the ὑπομονὴ πολλή belongs to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:4-5">2 Corinthians 6:4-5</span> , and 2Co 6:6 goes on to other points.
