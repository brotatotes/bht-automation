<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] The nine preceding datives (see on 2Co 6:4 ) have expanded ὑπομονῇ . We now resume the main catalogue, with <strong> ἐν ἁγνότητι</strong> , <strong> in purity</strong> : which is variously explained: of <em> bodily chastity</em> , Grot.: of <em> unselfishness</em> , Theodoret, and Chrys., as an alternative ( ἢ σωφροσύνην … ἢ τὴν ἐν ἅπασι καθαρότητα , ἢ τὸ ἀδωροδόκητον , ἢ καὶ τὸ δωρεὰν τὸ εὐαγγ . κηρύττειν . ib.): I prefer the second of Chrys.’s meanings, <em> general purity of character</em> , εἰλικρίνεια , unblamableness of life, and singleness of purpose.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν γνώσει</strong> ] <strong> knowledge of the Gospel</strong> , in a high and singular degree; see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span> ff. So Chrys.: σοφίᾳ τῇ παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ δεδομένῃ .
	</p>
<p><strong> χρηστότητι</strong> ] <strong> kindness</strong> : a kind and considerate demeanour.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἁγίῳ</strong> ] <strong> in the Holy Spirit</strong> , as the Power by Whom all these motives are wrought. The omission of the article, aft. ἐν , constitutes no objection to this rendering, as Bp. Middleton (in loc.) supposes: cf. διὰ πν . ἁγίου τοῦ δοθέντος ἡμῖν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:5">Romans 5:5</span> , and the very same words as these, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:5">1 Thessalonians 1:5</span> , in both which places the meaning is undoubted; neither of which, however, is noticed by Middleton. The words do not appear to hold any <em> logical</em> place in the list, any more than ἐν δυν . θεοῦ below.</p>
