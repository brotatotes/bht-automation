<p><strong> 14 7:1</strong> .] <em> Separate yourselves from unbelief and impurity</em> . On the nature of the connexion, Stanley has some good remarks. He now applies to circumstances which had arisen among the Corinthians the exhortation which in 2Co 6:1 he described himself as giving in pursuance of his ministry of reconciliation. The following exhortations are <em> general</em> , and hardly to be pressed as applying only to <em> partaking of meats offered to idols</em> , as Calv., al., or to <em> marriage with unbelievers</em> , as Estius, but regard all possible connexion and participation, all leanings towards a return to heathenism which might be bred by too great familiarity with heathens. <strong> Become not</strong> (‘ne <em> fiatis</em> , molliter pro: ne <em> sitis</em> ,’ Bengel: rather, perhaps, as expressing, ‘do not enter into those relations in which you must become’) <strong> incongruous yokefellows</strong> (the word and idea from ref. Levit. Hesych [9] : ἑτερόζυγοι · οἱ μὴ συζυγοῦντες . Grot. explains it, ‘ <em> alteram partem jugi trahere</em> ,’ but this does not give the force of <strong> ἑτερο</strong> <strong> -</strong> : Theophyl., μὴ ἀδικεῖτε τὸ δίκαιον ἐπικλινόμενοι κ . προσκλινόμενοι οἷς οὐ θέμις : so making the simile that of an unequal balance: but this could hardly be without more precise notification) <strong> with unbelievers</strong> (Winer explains the construction, edn. 6, § 31. 10, Remark 4, thus, μὴ γίν . ἑτεροζυγοῦντες , καὶ οὕτως ὁμοζυγοῦντες ἀπίστοις : better, as De W., μὴ γίν . ὁμοζ . ἀπίστοις κ . οὕτως ἑτεροζυγοῦντες ).

<p>Meyer remarks, that the fivefold variation of the term to express partnership, μετοχή , κοινωνία , συμφώνησις , μερίς , συγκατάθεσις , shews the Apostle’s command of the Greek language. The construction of κοινωνία with a dat. and πρός , is illustrated by Wetst. from Stobæus, S. 28, εἰ δέ τις ἔστι κοινωνία πρὸς θεοὺς ἡμῖν , and Philo, leg. ad Caium, § 14, vol. ii. p. 561, τίς οὖν κοινωνία πρὸς Ἀπόλλωνα , τῷ μηδὲν οἰκεῖον ἢ συγγενὲς ἐπιτετηδευκότι ;</p>
