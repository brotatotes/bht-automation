<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] <strong> I rejoice</strong> (more expressive than with a connecting particle) <strong> that in every thing I am</strong> ( <strong> re</strong> )- <strong> assured by you;</strong> ‘am of good courage, in contrast to my former dejection, owing to your good conduct.’ The ordinary rendering, ‘ <em> I can have confidence in you</em> ,’ is wrong in not giving the indic. θαῤῥῶ , and still more, in making θαῤῥεῖν ἐν mean ‘ <em> to have confidence in</em> ,’ which is unexampled. Meyer, who remarks this, does not notice, that the strongest reason against it is not mere want of usage, but the psychological meaning of θαῤῥεῖν , which is not like πεποιθέναι , descriptive of a <em> relative,</em> but of an <em> absolute</em> state of mind, <strong> to be of good courage:</strong> and this admits only of qualification as to the <em> ground</em> of that good courage; thus we have θαῤῥεῖν ὑπέρ περί , ἐπί , in the sense of ‘rejoicing at,’ ‘feeling confident concerning:’ but θαῤῥεῖν <strong> ἐν</strong> for <em> ‘to trust in,’</em> as πεποιθέναι ἐν , would, I think, be inadmissible. Meyer quotes ἐν σοὶ πᾶσ ʼ ἔγωγε σώζομαι , Soph. Aj. 519, where, as here, ἐν gives the <em> ground</em> of the verb as <em> in</em> the person spoken of.</p>
