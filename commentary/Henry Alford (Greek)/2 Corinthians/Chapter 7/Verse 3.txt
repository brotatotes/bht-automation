<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] <strong> I do not say it</strong> ( 2Co 7:2 ) <strong> for condemnation</strong> (with a condemnatory view, in a spirit of blame: there is no ὑμῶν expressed, nor should it be supplied. He means, ‘I do not say 2Co 7:2 in any but a loving spirit’): <strong> for</strong> (and this shews it) <strong> I have said before</strong> (viz. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:11">2 Corinthians 6:11</span> f. see note there) <strong> that ye are in our hearts</strong> (this was implied in ἡ καρδία ἡμῶν πεπλάτυνται , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:11">2 Corinthians 6:11</span> . In the qualifying words, εἰς τὸ συν . κ . τ . λ ., Paul, as Meyer says, is his own commentator), <strong> to die together and live together</strong> . This is ordinarily understood, ‘ <em> so that I could die with you or live with you</em> ,’ as Hor., ‘Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens,’ Od. iii. 9. 24: which Meyer controverts, owing to ὑμεῖς being the subject of the sentence, and renders, ‘in order to die and to live with us:’ i.e. ‘if our lot is to die, <em> in death</em> , and if our lot is to live, <em> in life</em> , never to be torn from our hearts.’ But to this I would reply, that though ὑμεῖς is the subject of ἐν ταῖς καρδ . ἡμ . ἐστε , it is but an accidental and secondary subject as regards the <em> whole sentence</em> ; that <em> they</em> are present in <em> his</em> heart, is a sign, not of their state of mind, but of <em> his</em> : therefore the purpose, <strong> εἰς τό</strong> , must refer logically to <em> him</em> , the main subject, of <em> whom only</em> the <em> purposes</em> can come into consideration.</p>
