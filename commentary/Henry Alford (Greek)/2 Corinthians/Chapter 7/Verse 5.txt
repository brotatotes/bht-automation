<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] <strong> γάρ</strong> gives a reason for θλίψει above: καί connects with ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12-13">2 Corinthians 2:12-13</span> , where he has spoken of the trouble which he had before leaving Troas. <strong> For also, after our coming to Macedonia, our flesh had no rest</strong> (there is a slight, but very slight, distinction from οὐκ ἔσχηκα ἄνεσιν τῷ πνεύματί μου , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span> . Titus <em> was now present</em> , so that that source of inquietude was removed; but the outward ones of fightings generating inward fears (but see below), yet remained. No further distinction must be drawn for ἔσωθεν φόβοι evidently shews that σάρξ must be taken in a wide sense); <strong> without, fightings</strong> (the omission of ἦσαν renders the description more graphic), <strong> within, fears</strong> . Chrys., ἔξωθ . μάχαι · παρὰ τῶν ἀπίστων · ἔσωθ . φόβοι · διὰ τοὺς ἀσθενεῖς τῶν πιστῶν . Hom. xiv. p. 539. So Calv., Grot. Wetst. al. slightly varying in their assignment of each class. But it is better, as Paul speaks of ἡ σὰρξ ἡμῶν , to understand <strong> ἔξωθεν</strong> of the <em> state of things without him</em> [personally], contentions with adversaries either within or without the church, and <strong> ἔσωθεν</strong> of <em> that within</em> [ <em> him</em> personally], fears, for ourselves, for others, or for <em> you</em> , how you might have received our letter.</p>
