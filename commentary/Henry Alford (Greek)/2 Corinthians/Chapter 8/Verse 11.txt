<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] <strong> But</strong> (contrast of your former zeal with your present need to be reminded of it) <strong> now complete the act itself also</strong> ( καί can hardly apply to the whole τὸ ποι . ἐπιτ ., as De Wette, but must be taken with ποιῆσαι ; <em> now</em> shew not only the completion of a ready will in the act begun, but complete <em> the act also</em> , as Meyer), <strong> that, as (there was)</strong> (with you) <strong> readiness of will, so (there may) also (be) completion according to your means</strong> ( <strong> ἐκ τοῦ ἔχειν</strong> , not <em> ‘out of that which ye have</em> ,’ as E. V., but <em> ‘after the measure of your</em> property,’ as in ref. The verbs substantive must be supplied, as in 2Co 8:13 ).</p>
