<p><strong> 14.</strong> ] <strong> but that by the rule of equality</strong> ( ἐξ as in ἐκ τοῦ ἔχειν , above), <strong> at this present time</strong> (of their need: the stress is on ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ as suggesting that this relation may hereafter be altered) <strong> your abundance may subserve</strong> ( γένηται , see next clause. <strong> γίνεσθαι εἰς</strong> , ‘to be extended to,’ see ref. Gal.) <strong> their deficiency; that also</strong> (supposing circumstances changed) <strong> their abundance may subserve your want.</strong> The reference is still, as is evident from the next verse, to the supply of <em> temporal wants,</em> in respect of which there should be a mutual relieving and sharing among Christians. But the passage has been curiously misunderstood to mean, <em> ‘that their</em> (the Jewish Christians’) <em> abundance in spiritual things may be imparted to you to supply your deficiency.’</em> Thus Chrys., al., the <em> ancients</em> regarding this imparting as the <em> Gospel-benefit received from them by the Gentiles</em> (which however was <em> past</em> , not future, and is urged as a <em> motive for gratitude,</em> see Rom 15:27 ), and the modern Romanists introducing the monstrous perversion of the attribution of the merits of the saints to others in the next world. So Estius: “Locus hic apostoli contra nostræ ætatis hæreticos ostendit, posse Christianos minus sanctos meritis sanctorum adjuvari etiam in futuro sæculo. Denique notanda virtus eleemosynæ, quæ facit hominem participem meritorum ejus in quem confertur.”</p>
