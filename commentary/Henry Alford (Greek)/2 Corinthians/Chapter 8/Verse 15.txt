<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] <strong> that there may be equality, as it is written</strong> (i.e. according to the expression used in the Scripture history: παράγει παλαιὰν ἱστορίαν , Chrys., of the gathering of the manna) <strong> He that (gathered) much, did not exceed</strong> (the measure prescribed by God): <strong> and he that (gathered) little, did not fall short</strong> (of it). The fact of <em> equality</em> being the only point brought into comparison as between the Israelites of old and Christians now, it is superfluous to enquire minutely <em> how</em> this equality was wrought among the Israelites. The quotation is according to the reading of the LXX generally supported by MSS.; except that ἔλαττον appears for ὀλίγον in A <em> a secunda manu.</em> Grabe (not F) and the Aldine edition have ᾧ τὸ πολύ and ᾧ τὸ ὀλίγον , probably a correction. The context supplies συλλέξας from the συνέλεξαν in the preceding verse, and is presumed by the Apostle to be familiar to his readers.</p>
