<p><strong> 1.</strong> ] The <strong> μὲν γάρ</strong> connects with the last verse, thus, ‘I beseech you to receive the brethren whom I send, courteously; for concerning the <em> duty of ministration to the saints</em> , it is surely superfluous for me to write to you who are so prompt already.’ No new subject begins, as some have supposed; nor is there any break in the sense at all. Some obscurity has been introduced unnecessarily, by taking τῆς διακ . τ . εἰς τ . ἁγ . for <em> merely this collection which is now making</em> : whereas the Apostle chooses such general terms as a mild reproof to the Corinthians, who, well aware as they were of the duty of ministering to the saints, were yet somewhat remiss in this particular example of the duty. There is an emphasis on γράφειν : ‘nam testes habebitis præsentes,’ Bengel. Theophyl. well remarks: τοσαῦτα καὶ πρότερον εἰπὼν καὶ πάλιν μέλλων εἰπεῖν , ὅμως περιττὸν αὐτῷ λέγει τὸ περὶ τούτων γράφειν . σοφῶς δὲ τοῦτο ποιεῖ , ὥστε μᾶλλον αὐτοὺς ἐπισπάσασθαι . αἰσχυνθήσονται γὰρ εἴ γε τοιαύτην ὑπόληψιν περὶ αὐτῶν ἔχοντος τοῦ Παύλου , ὅτι οὐ δέονται συμβουλῆς πρὸς τὸ ἐλεεῖν , εἶτα φανῶσιν ἐλάττους τῆς ὑπολήψεως .</p>
