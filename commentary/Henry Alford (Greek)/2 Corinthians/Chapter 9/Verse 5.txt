<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] <strong> I therefore</strong> (because of 2Co 9:4 ) <strong> thought it necessary to exhort the brethren</strong> (Titus and the two others) <strong> that they would go before</strong> (my coming) <strong> to you, and previously prepare your long announced beneficence</strong> (i.e. long announced by me to the Macedonians, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:2">2 Corinthians 9:2</span> .

<p><strong> εὐλογία</strong> , <strong> blessing</strong> ; not used only of a blessing in <em> words</em> , but of one expressed by a <em> present</em> , as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:11">Genesis 33:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:15">Judges 1:15</span> . (See Stanley.) But beware of the blunder of connecting it with εὖ and λογία , ‘ <em> a good collection</em> .’ This sense of <em> blessing</em> , combined with the primitive sense, affords the Apostle an opportunity for bringing out the true spirit in which Christian gifts should be given), <strong> that this same may be ready</strong> (the construction is unusual: ταύτην refers back to εὐλ . and the inf. must have ὥστε supplied. De W. compares <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:5">Hebrews 5:5</span> . Perhaps the nearest is Col 4:6 ) <strong> in such sort as beneficence, and not as covetousness</strong> (i.e. as the fruit of blessing, poured out from a beneficent mind, not of a sparing covetous spirit which gives no more than it need. There is no need to alter the primitive meaning, or to make the <em> word signify</em> ‘tenacity,’ as Calv., De Wette, al.: he who defrauds the poor by stinting them πλεονεκτεῖ , in the literal sense. Still less must we with Chrys., al., refer πλεονεξ . to the Apostle, μὴ νομίσητε , φησίν , ὅτι ὡς πλεονεκτοῦντες αὐτὴν λαμβάνομεν , Hom xix. p. 573, which is inconsistent with the interpretation φειδομένως below, and with εὐλογίαν , the corresponding word, which applies to the <em> spirit</em> of the givers).</p>
