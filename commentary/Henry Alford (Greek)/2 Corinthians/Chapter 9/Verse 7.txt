<p><strong> 7.</strong> ] Not, as Meyer and De W., a <em> limitation</em> of the foregoing, or else it would be expressed by some connecting particle, but a continuation of the thought: φειδομένως and ἐπ ʼ εὐλογίαις referred to the <em> spirit</em> of the giver; so does this verse, ἐκ λύπης ἢ ἐξ ἀν . corresponding to φειδομένως , ἱλαρός , to ἐπ ʼ εὐλογίαις .

<p><strong> καθὼς προῄρηται</strong> ] <strong> as he hath determined in his heart</strong> ; supply, ‘so let him give:’ i.e. let the προαίρεσις , the full consent of the free will, go with the gift; let it not be reluctant offering, given ἐκ λύπης , out of an annoyed and troubled mind at having the gift extorted, nor ἐξ ἀνάγκης , out of necessity, because compelled. Such givers, that is implied, God does <em> not</em> love.

<p><strong> δότης</strong> is not a classical word. δότηρ , δωτήρ and (Hes. Op. 353) δώτης , are used (Meyer).</p>
