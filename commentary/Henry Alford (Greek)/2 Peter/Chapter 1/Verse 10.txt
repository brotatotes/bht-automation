But the verb must not be explained away into a pure subjectivity, ‘to make sure to yourselves:’ it carries the reflective force, but only in so far as the act is and must be done for and quoad a man’s own self, the absolute and final determination resting with Another. Calvin’s “studete ut re ipsa testatum fiat, vos non frustra vocatos esse” ( <strong> βεβαίαν</strong> ποιεῖσθαι ?) is a very weak dilution of the sense. We must take the passage as we find it: and as it stands its simple and irrefragable sense is that by σπουδὴν παρεισενέγκαι ἐπιχορηγῆσαι ἐν κ . τ . λ . is the way βεβαίαν ποιεῖσθαι our κλῆσιν and ἐκλογήν .

In His foreknowledge and purpose, there is no insecurity, no uncertainty: but in our vision and apprehension of them as they exist in and for us, much, until they are made secure in the way here pointed out): <strong> for, doing these things</strong> (act., <strong> ποιοῦντες</strong> , now, because these are works done.
