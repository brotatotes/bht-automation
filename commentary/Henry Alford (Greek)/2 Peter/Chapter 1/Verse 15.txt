<p><strong> 15</strong> .] <strong> Moreover</strong> ( δὲ καί both serve for connexion with the foregoing) <strong> I will endeavour that ye may on every occasion have it in your power</strong> (reff.) <strong> after my decease</strong> (it is at least remarkable that, with the recollection of the scene on the mount of transfiguration floating in his mind, the Apostle should use so close together the words which were there also associated, viz. <strong> σκή</strong> νωμα and <strong> ἔξοδος</strong> : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:28">Luke 9:28</span> ff. The coincidence should not be forgotten in treating of the question of the genuineness of the Epistle) <strong> to exercise the memory of these things</strong> ( <strong> μνήμην ποιεῖσθαι</strong> is almost always used for to <em> make mention of</em> : so Herodot. vi. 19, 55, vit. Hom. 14, and other examples in Wetst.: but such evidently is not its sense here. In Thucyd. (ref.) the sense is ambiguous, but from οὕτως ᾄσονται following, it would appear that to <em> quote</em> or <em> make mention</em> is also the sense there, though Palm and Rost give it as here. An interpretation has been given to this latter clause which the very position of the Greek words, μετὰ τὴν ἐμὴν ἔξοδον , after ἔχειν ὑμᾶς , ought sufficiently to have guarded against: viz. that St. Peter says σπουδάσω καὶ μετὰ τὴν ἐμὴν ἔξοδον , meaning, as Œc. and Thl. mentioning this view, ὅτι καὶ μετὰ θάνατον οἱ ἅγιοι μέμνηνται τῶν τῇδε , καὶ πρεσβεύουσιν ὑπὲρ τῶν ζώντων (but not with approval, merely stating that τοῦτό τινες ἐν ὑπερβάτῳ ἀκούοντες (per hyperbaton intelligentes) βούλονται παριστᾷν ἀπὸ τούτου ὅτι κ . τ . λ .). Many of the R.-Catholic interpreters take this view; so Corn. a-Lap., ἔχειν , “habere scilicet in mente et memoria mea (?) ut crebro vestri sim memor apud Deum, eumque pro vobis orem, ut horum monitorum meorum memoriam vobis refricet. Ita Œcumenius (compare above. The more candid Estius confesses, “Œc. etiam hujus meminit interpretationis, sed alteram præfert ut simpliciorem”), &amp;c.” and he concludes: “Hinc patet S. Petrum et Sanctos vita functos curare res mortalium, ideoque esse invocandos.” And so Justiniani, but not so confidently: Feuardentius, doubtingly at first, but “vires acquirens eundo,” and ending with a vehement invective against the heretics who hold the interpretation which he himself had previously given. Estius, on the other hand, impugns this view, supporting the ordinary one, and ending “Jam quid attinet, statuere velle doctrinam certissimam argumento incerto, cum alia certissima nequaquam desint?” It is most instructive, especially in our days, to take up any of the texts, by which the abuses of Rome are supposed to be sanctioned, and to trace their interpretations through the R.-Cath. Commentators themselves. It will be most frequently found, as here, that the confident allegation of them has arisen at first out of some merely conjectural sense, impugned by the very authorities which they quote for it, or supported, as in this case (compare the citations in Corn. a-Lap. and Estius), by spurious writings attributed to the Fathers.</p>
