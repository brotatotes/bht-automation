Œc. understands this, ἐπεικάζει αὐτοὺς πηγαῖς ἀνύδροις , ὡς ἀπολωλεκότας τὸ τῆς ζωῆς ὕδωρ , τουτέστι , τὸ τοῦ κηρύγματος καθαρὸν κ . πότιμον ὕδωρ . But this is going too far into specialities: the comparison, in both Epistles, is simply to that which may be expected to yield water, and yields none. In this case the <strong> πηγή</strong> seems to be the spring itself, which ought to send forth water but does not), <strong> and mists</strong> ( οὐκ εἴσι , φησί , διαυγεῖς ὥσπερ οἱ ἅγιοι οἱ ὄντες νεφέλαι , ἀλλ ʼ ὀμίχλαι , τουτέστι σκότους καὶ γνόφου μεστοί , ὑπὸ τοῦ πονηροῦ πνεύματος ἐλαυνόμενοι .

It is obvious that no just charge of inappropriateness can be brought against our passage because this clause occurs in a different connexion from that in Jude. There it is said of wandering stars, here of driven clouds: of each, with equal appropriateness: darkness being predicable of clouds, as well as of stars extinguished).
