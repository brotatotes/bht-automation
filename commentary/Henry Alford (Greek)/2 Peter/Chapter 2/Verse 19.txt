<p><strong> 19</strong> .] <strong> promising them liberty</strong> (these are the great swelling things which they speak; holding out a state of Christian liberty, which proves to be the bondage of corruption) <strong> while they themselves are</strong> (all the while: <strong> ὑπάρχω</strong> , of previous entity: see on Act 16:20 ) <strong> slaves of corruption</strong> (cf. the same words occurring together in ref. Rom., αὐτὴ ἡ κτίσις ἐλευθερωθήσεται ἀπὸ τῆς δουλείας τῆς φθορᾶς εἰς τὴν ἐλευθερίαν τῆς δόξης τῶν τέκνων τοῦ θεοῦ : which it is very likely St. Peter had in view: cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:15">2 Peter 3:15</span> . They promise that liberty of the sons of God, being themselves in the bondage of corruption. <strong> φθορά</strong> here, moral decay of sin, ending in perdition): <strong> for by what</strong> ( <strong> ever</strong> ) <strong> a man is overcome, by the same he is also enslaved</strong> (cf. ref. John, πᾶς ὁ ποιῶν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν , δοῦλός ἐστιν τῆς ἁμαρτίας : and ref. Rom., ᾧ παριστάνετε ἑαυτοὺς δούλους εἰς ὑπακοήν , δοῦλοί ἐστε ᾧ ὑπακούετε . These passages were certainly in the Apostle’s mind. <strong> ἡττάομαι</strong> , generally found with a gen. of the agent, has here a dat. The classical rendering here would be “in whatever a man is overcome (by another), in that particular he is also enslaved (by that other).” But the context makes it clear that the datives are intended to designate the agent, not the mode).</p>
