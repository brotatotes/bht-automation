<p><strong> 3</strong> .] <strong> and in</strong> (i. e. living in, girt about with, as their element, not as E. V. “ <em> through</em> ”) <strong> covetousness with feigned speeches</strong> (Wetstein quotes Artemid. i. 53, πλάσσειν δοκεῖ … ἀγαθὸν ῥήτορσι … καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ἀπατεῶσι , διὰ τὸ τὰ μὴ ὄντα ὡς ὄντα δεικνύειν τὰς τέχνας ταύτας ) <strong> they will make gain of you</strong> (“quæstum ex vobis facient, ad quæstum suum vobis abutentur.” Gerh. See ref., and Athenag. xiii. 569, Ἀσπασία ἐνεπορεύετο πλήθη γυναικῶν : Philo in Flacc. § 16, vol. ii. p. 536, ἐνεπορεύετο τὴν λήθην τῶν δικαστῶν (Huther). Pott tries to give the word the classic meaning of <em> lucrari</em> , ‘to gain over:’ “sectæ suæ conciliare conantur:” and this is borne out by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:14">Proverbs 3:14</span> , LXX, κρεῖσσον αὐτὴν ἐμπορεύεσθαι , ἢ χρυσίου κ . ἀργυρίου θησαυρούς : but the other meaning seems better here. These false teachers would care not for their sect, but for their gain), <strong> for whom</strong> ( <strong> οἷς</strong> is the dat. incommodi: its antecedents being the subjects of the verb ἐμπορεύσονται , viz. the false teachers) <strong> the sentence</strong> (of God, decreeing their ἀπώλεια ) <strong> from long since</strong> ( <strong> ἔκπαλαι</strong> cannot surely, as De Wette, be joined predicatively with <strong> τὸ κρῖμα</strong> , ‘the sentence from of old decreed,’ cf. οἱ πάλαι προγεγραμμένοι εἰς τοῦτο τὸ κρῖμα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:4">Jude 1:4</span> ; in this case we should at all events expect τὸ κρῖμα τὸ ἔκπαλαι . Rather, with most Commentators, should ἔκπαλαι be taken adverbially with the following verb. The word is found, besides ref., in Arrian, Exp. Alex. i. 9, εἰς λογισμὸν τοῦ ἔκπαλαι : Jos. Antt. xvi. 8. 4, ἔκπαλαι μὲν συνεδρεύων αὐτῷ προσέκειτο : Plut. Aristid. p. 328 E, ἀνὴρ θυμοειδὴς κ . φιλοκίνδυνος , ἔκπαλαι πρὸς τὴν μάχην σπαργῶν . Phrynichus, p. 45, condemns it: ἀπόπαλαι , ἔκπαλαι · ἀμφοῖν δυσχέραινε , ἐκ παλαιοῦ γὰρ χρὴ λέγειν : where see Lobeck’s note) <strong> is not idle</strong> (i. e. is working itself out, is living and in action), <strong> and their destruction slumbereth not</strong> (i. e. is awake, and ready to seize them: ἀπώλεια being personified: for the verb, see reff.).</p>
