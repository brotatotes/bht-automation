<p><strong> 10</strong> .] <em> Assertion of the conclusion as against the scoffers the certainty, suddenness, and effect of the day of the Lord</em> . <strong> But</strong> (notwithstanding the delay) <strong> the day</strong> (the art. is not needed for definiteness in the later Epistles, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:7">2 Peter 3:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:6">Philippians 1:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:10">Philippians 1:10</span> ; Php 2:16 ) <strong> of the Lord</strong> (= τοῦ θεοῦ , below, 2Pe 3:12 ) <strong> shall come</strong> ( <strong> ἥξει</strong> has the emphasis, as opposed to all the doubts of the scoffers. It is more than merely “shall come,” though no one word will give the exact force in English: “shall be here,” “shall be upon you”) <strong> as a thief</strong> (ref. 1 Thess.: from which place probably the expression is taken, as reference is made below to the Epistles of St. Paul); <strong> in which the heavens shall pass away</strong> (reff. Matt.; and Rev 21:1 ) <strong> with a rushing noise</strong> ( <strong> ῥοιζηδόν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> τὸ μετὰ ἤχου · ἴδιος δὲ ὁ τοιοῦτος ἦχος πυρὸς ἐν τοῖς ὑπὸ πυρὸς καταβοσκομένοις , Œc. ῥοῖζος is the rush of a bird, ref. Wisd., of an arrow, Il. π . 361, of the music or a shepherd’s pipe, Od. ι . 315: and, see Palm and Rost’s Lex., of any thing rapidly moving. Some understand it of the actual noise of the flames which shall consume the heavens: others, as De W., of the ‘ruina,’ or crash with which they shall fall: “magno impetu,” vulg.; “in modum procellæ,” Calv.: “cum stridore,” Beza: alii aliter), <strong> and the heavenly bodies</strong> ( <strong> στοιχεῖα</strong> , according to Bed [23] , <em> the four elements</em> , fire, air, earth, and water: but he is obliged to modify the meaning or λυθήσονται , inasmuch as fire cannot dissolve or consume fire: according to Bengel, <em> the sun, moon, and stars</em> , defending it by this word being often used in that sense by Theoph. of Antioch and others in Suicer sub voce. Certainly Justin Martyr so uses the word several times: cf. Apol. ii. 5, p. 92, τὰ οὐράνια στοιχεῖα εἰς αὔξησιν καρπῶν κ . ὡρῶν μεταβολὰς κοσμήσας : and Dial. Tryph. 23, p. 122, Epist. ad Diognet. 7 (Migne, Patr. Gr. vol. ii. p. 1177), and Otto’s notes. And considering that this clause, on account of the <strong> δέ</strong> , followed presently by the <strong> καί</strong> when we come to speak of the earth, necessarily belongs to the heavens, considering also that the mention of the heavenly bodies as affected by the great Day is constant in Scripture, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:9-10">Isaiah 13:9-10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+24:23">Isaiah 24:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+34:4">Isaiah 34:4</span> , &amp;c., I should be inclined on the whole to accept this interpretation, feeling that the above-named reasons overbear the objection alleged by De Wette, that the word does not bear this sense in any other passage of Scripture. This objection is also weakened by remembering, 1. that it occurs in a physical sense here only: 2. that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:3">Galatians 4:3</span> , where it is clearly not in a physical sense, the Greek interpreters give it this meaning: see in Suicer sub voce, and mine and Bishop Ellicott’s notes on Gal. l. c., and note on Mat 24:29 ) <strong> being scorched up</strong> ( <strong> καυσόομαι</strong> , classically, to suffer from excessive heat: to be in a burning fever. The pres. part. gives the ground and reason of the following verb) <strong> shall be dissolved</strong> (not literally, <em> melt</em> [that is expressed by τήκεται below]: cf. λυομένων next verse, and reff. here), <strong> and the earth and the works in it</strong> ( <strong> ἔργα</strong> may mean either the works of men, buildings and the like, or, the works of the Creator: perhaps both of these combined, “opera naturæ et artis,” Bengel. Estius’s sense, “opera peccatorum,” is out of the question: nor does <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:15">1 Corinthians 3:15</span> &amp;c. apply here, any further than that the same purifying fire is spoken of) <strong> shall be burned up</strong> (the var. readd. are very curious. That of [24] [25][26] 27] , εὑρεθήσεται , has plainly arisen from the Latin <em> urentur</em> . That it has so arisen, is a most instructive fact, and leads to inferences which cannot be here followed out).

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [23] Bede, <em> the Venerable</em> , 731; Bedegr, a Greek MS. cited by Bede, nearly identical with Cod. “E,” mentioned in this edn only when it differs from E.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [24] The CODEX VATICANUS, No. 1209 in the Vatican Library at Rome; and proved, by the old catalogues, to have been there from the foundation of the library in the 16th century. It was apparently, from internal evidence, copied in Egypt. It is on vellum, and contains the Old and New Testaments. In the latter, it is deficient from Heb 9:14 to the end of the Epistle; it does not contain the Epistles to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon; nor the Apocalypse. An edition of this celebrated codex, undertaken as long ago as 1828 by Cardinal Angelo Mai, has since his death been published at Rome. The defects of this edition are such, that it can hardly be ranked higher in usefulness than a tolerably complete collation, entirely untrustworthy in those places where it differs from former collations in representing the MS. as <em> agreeing with</em> the received text. An 8vo edition of the N.T. portion, newly revised by Vercellone, was published at Rome in 1859 (referred to as ‘Verc’): and of course superseded the English reprint of the 1st edition. Even in this 2nd edition there were imperfections which rendered it necessary to have recourse to the MS. itself, and to the partial collations made in former times. These are (1) that of Bartolocci (under the name of Giulio de St. Anastasia), once librarian at the Vatican, made in 1669, and preserved in manuscript in the Imperial Library (MSS. Gr. Suppl. 53) at Paris (referred to as ‘Blc’); (2) that of Birch (‘Bch’), published in various readings to the Acts and Epistles, Copenhagen, 1798, Apocalypse, 1800, Gospels, 1801; (3) that made for the great Bentley (‘Btly’), by the Abbate Mico, published in Ford’s Appendix to Woide’s edition of the Codex Alexandrinus, 1799 (it was made on the margin of a copy of Cephalæus’ Greek Testament, Argentorati, 1524, still amongst Bentley’s books in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge); (4) notes of alterations by the original scribe and other correctors. These notes were procured for Bentley by the Abbé de Stosch, and were till lately supposed to be lost. They were made by the Abbate Rulotta (‘Rl’), and are preserved amongst Bentley’s papers in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge (B. 17. 20) 1 . The Codex has been occasionally consulted for the verification of certain readings by Tregelles, Tischendorf, and others. A list of readings examined at Rome by the present editor (Feb. 1861), and by the Rev. E. C. Cure, Fellow of Merton College, Oxford (April 1862), will be found at the end of these prolegomena. A description, with an engraving from a photograph of a portion of a page, is given in Burgon’s “Letters from Rome,” London 1861. This most important MS. was probably written in the <em> fourth century</em> (Hug, Tischendorf, al.).

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [25] The Codex Cyprius, brought from the island of Cyprus to Paris, and now in the Imperial Library there (MS. Gr. 63). Contains the Gospels (entire), memoirs of the saints of the Greek Church, and the canons of Eusebius. Collated by Tischendorf and Tregelles. Its text is peculiar and <em> sui generis;</em> and is consequently of much value. Assigned to the <em> ninth century</em> .

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [26] By these symbols are designated the portions of two ancient MSS., discernible (as also are fragments of Ulphilas’ gothic version) under the later writing of a volume known as the Codex Carolinus in the Ducal Library at Wolfenbüttel. P (GUELPHERBYTANUS A) contains fragments of each of the Gospels. Q (GUELPH. B) fragments of Luke and John. Both are probably of the <em> sixth century</em> . They were edited by F. A. Knittel in 1762; and, more thoroughly, by Tischendorf in 1860 [1869], Monumenta Sacra, vol. iii. [vi.]
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [27] The CODEX SINAITICUS. Procured by Tischendorf, in 1859, from the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai. The Codex Frederico-Augustanus (now at Leipsic), obtained in 1844 from the same monastery, is a portion of the same copy of the Greek Bible, the 148 leaves of which, containing the entire New Testament, the Ep. of Barnabas, parts of Hermas, and 199 more leaves of the Septuagint, have now been edited by the discoverer. A magnificent edition prepared at the expense of the Emperor of Russia appeared in January, 1863, and a smaller edition containing the N.T. &amp;c., has been published by Dr. Tischendorf. The MS. has four columns on a page, and has been altered by several different correctors, one or more of whom Tischendorf considers to have lived in the sixth century. The work of the original scribe has been examined, not only by Tischendorf, but by Tregelles and other competent judges, and is by them assigned to the <em> fourth</em> <em> century</em> . The internal character of the text agrees with the external, as the student may judge for himself from the readings given in the digest. The principal correctors as distinguished by Tischendorf are: A, of the same age with the MS. itself, probably the corrector who revised the book, before it left the hands of the scribe, denoted therefore by us א -corr 1 ; B (cited as א 2 ), who in the first page of Matt. began inserting breathings, accents, &amp;c., but did not carry out his design, and touched only a few later passages; C a (cited as א 3a ) has corrected very largely throughout the book. Wherever in our digest a reading is cited as found in א 1 , it is to be understood, if no further statement is given, that C a altered it to that which is found in our text; C b (cited as א 3b ) lived about the same time as C a , i.e. some centuries later than the original scribe. These are all that we need notice here 6 .</p>
