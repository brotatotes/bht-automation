<p><strong> 16</strong> .] <strong> as also in all</strong> ( <em> his</em> , but not expressed: with the ταῖς it would mean, in all his Epistles <em> as a finished whole</em> : without it, in <em> all Epistles which he writes</em> , leaving room for the possibility that the number of those Epistles was not complete, but still being added to) <strong> Epistles, speaking in them</strong> (as he does: the pres. part. contains the justification of the assertion: not as Huther, “when he speaks”) <strong> of these things</strong> (viz. the coming of our Lord, and the end of the world), <strong> in which</strong> (Epistles, if <strong> αἷς</strong> be read: if <strong> οἷς</strong> , “ <em> in which sayings of his</em> :” not, “in which things,” “in which subjects,” as some (e. g. Bengel) have rendered by way of escape from the supposed difficulty: for οἷς is correlative with τὰς λοιπὰς γραφάς , and must therefore designate some writings previously mentioned: or else the sentence is stultified) <strong> are some things difficult to understand</strong> (De W. especially refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1">2 Thessalonians 2:1</span> ff.: and it is not improbable that this may have been particularly in the Apostle’s mind. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:18">2 Timothy 2:18</span> . Grot. is clearly wrong in extending the list to difficulties about faith and works, &amp;c.), <strong> which the ignorant</strong> (unintelligent, uninformed: hardly, as De W., with an understood meaning of rebellion and unbelief: for that would be too much here. ἀμαθία may arise from many causes: but the misunderstanding of difficult Scriptures is common to the ἀμαθεῖς in general) <strong> and unstable</strong> (ref.: those who, wanting firm foundation and anchorage, waver and drift about with every wind of doctrine. Such persons are stirred from their Christian stability by every apparent difficulty: are rendered anxious and perplexed by hard texts: and shewing more anxiety to interpret them somehow, than to wait upon God for their solution, rush upon erroneous and dangerous ways of interpretation) <strong> distort</strong> ( <strong> στρεβλόω</strong> , properly, to twist with a handscrew or windlass, στρέβλη : σκάφος στρέβλαισι ναυτικαῖς προσηγμένον , Æsch. Suppl. 441. Hence to torment with the στρέβλη : and then met., to distort, pervert, strain, in meaning. Œc. gives for it ἐνδιαστρόφως ἐξαγγέλλειν ), <strong> as also the other Scriptures</strong> (or, passages of Scripture having reference to this great subject: as we have ἑτέρα γραφὴ λέγει <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:37">John 19:37</span> , πᾶσα γραφὴ θεόπνευστος (see note) <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:16">2 Timothy 3:16</span> . Whichever be understood, it is plain, 1. that by these words St. Paul’s Epistles are reckoned among the Christian scriptures: 2. that there were at this time besides those Epistles, other writings holding a similar place, known as γραφαί ; probably, at least, the three Gospels (and Acts?), and some of the earlier written catholic Epistles. That by <strong> τὰς λοιπὰς γραφάς</strong> should be meant the O. T. scriptures, is not probable: these would have been more fully designated than by being placed in the same category with the inspired writings of recent or living men), <strong> to</strong> (as a contribution to towards, so as to help towards) <strong> their own perdition</strong> ( <strong> τὴν ἰδίαν αὐτῶν</strong> , more strongly reflective than with one of these merely).</p>
