Any how, the construction is harsh, the double gen. being unavoidable: but it is surely much better to take ἐντολῆς in its most obvious connexion, and make τῶν ἀποστόλων ὑμῶν the second genitive the command originating in our Lord, and given you by the Apostles who preached to you: τῶν ἀπ . <strong> ὑμῶν</strong> meaning “ <em> your</em> Apostles” as we call St. Paul ἀπόστολον ἐθνῶν .
