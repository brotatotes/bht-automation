<p><strong> 9</strong> .] <strong> The Lord</strong> (i. e. God, the Father, as so often in this and in the first Epistle) <strong> is not tardy</strong> ( <strong> βραδύνειν</strong> , not merely to <em> delay</em> , but to <em> be late</em> , beyond an appointed time; so Gerh.: “discrimen est inter tardare et differre: is demum tardat, qui ultra debitum tempus quod agendum est differt”) <strong> concerning his promise</strong> (so, connecting the gen. with the verb, and not with ὁ κύριος , must the words be taken. The gen. is one of partition, as in ὑστερεῖν τινος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:5">2 Corinthians 11:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:11">2 Corinthians 12:11</span> , παύεσθαί τινος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:1">1 Peter 4:1</span> , &amp;c., the being late implying a falling short) <strong> as some</strong> (viz. the scoffers in question, who are pointed at) <strong> account</strong> (His conduct) <strong> tardiness</strong> (better thus, making <strong> βραδυτῆτα</strong> predicate, than to render <strong> νομίζουσιν</strong> “think concerning,” “define,” “explain,” and make βραδυτῆτα object only): <strong> but He is long-suffering towards you</strong> ( <strong> μακροθυμεῖν</strong> with <strong> εἰς</strong> here only: with ἐπί , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:26">Matthew 18:26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:29">Matthew 18:29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:7">Luke 18:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:7">James 5:7</span> ; with πρός , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:14">1 Thessalonians 5:14</span> : <strong> ὑμᾶς</strong> , the readers of the Epistle; not as a separate class, but as representing all, cf. πάντας below), <strong> not willing that any should perish, but</strong> (willing) <strong> that all should go forward</strong> (reff.) <strong> to repentance</strong> (Calvin is quite wrong in his rendering, “omnes ad pœnitentiam recipere:” equally wrong, in his alternatives, “aut colligi, vel aggregari.” Plutarch has the very expression, De flum. p. 19 (Wetst.), ὀλίγον δὲ σωφρονήσας , καὶ εἰς μετάνοιαν ἐπὶ τοῖς πραχθεῖσι χωρήσας ).</p>
