<p><strong> 11</strong> .] <strong> With a view to which</strong> (consummation, the ἐνδοξασθῆναι , &amp;c., above, in <em> your case</em> , as is shewn below: not ‘ <em> wherefore</em> ,’ as E. V., Grot., Pelt, &amp;c.) <strong> we pray also</strong> (as well as wish: had the καί imported (as Lün.) that the <em> prayer of the Apostle</em> was added on behalf of the Thessalonians to the fact (?) of the ἐνδοξασθῆναι , it would have been καὶ ἡμεῖς προς .) <strong> always concerning you, that</strong> (see note on 1Co 14:13 ) <strong> our God may count</strong> YOU (emphatic) <strong> worthy</strong> (not ‘ <em> make you worthy</em> ,’ as Luth., Grot., Olsh., al., which the word cannot mean. The verb has the secondary emphasis: see below) <strong> of your calling</strong> (just as we are exhorted to <em> walk</em> ἀξίως τῆς κλήσεως ἧς ἐκλήθημεν , Eph 4:1 the calling being taken not merely as the first act of God, but as the enduring state produced by that act (see especially 1Co 7:20 ), the normal termination of which is, <em> glory</em> . So that κλῆσις is not ‘the good thing to which we are called,’ as Lün.: which besides would require τῆς κλήσεως ἀξιώσῃ : now that τῆς κλήσεως is sheltered behind the verb, it is taken as a matter of course, ‘your calling,’ an acknowledged fact), <strong> and may fulfil</strong> (complete, bring to its fulness in you) <strong> all</strong> (possible) <strong> right purpose of goodness</strong> (it is quite impossible, with many ancient Commentators, E. V., &amp;c., to refer <strong> εὐδοκίαν</strong> to <em> God</em> ‘ <em> His good pleasure</em> .’ In that case we must at least have τὴν εὐδοκίαν and <strong> ἀγαθωσ</strong> <strong> .</strong> will not refer with any propriety either to God, of whom the word is never used (occurring <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:14">Romans 15:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span> ; Eph 5:9 only, and always of MAN), or to the Thessalonians ( π . ἀγαθωσύνην εὐδοκίας ). It ( εὐδοκία ) must then apply to the Thessalonians, as it does to human agents in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:15">Philippians 1:15</span> . And then ἀγαθωσύνης may be either a gen. <em> objecti</em> , ‘approval of that which is good,’ or a gen. <em> appositionis</em> , a εὐδοκία <em> consisting</em> in ἀγαθωσύνη . The latter I own seems to me (agst Ellic.) far the best: as ἀγαθωσύνη is in all the above citations a subjective quality, and the <em> approval</em> of that which is good would introduce an element here which seems irrelevant) <strong> and</strong> (all) <strong> work of faith</strong> (activity of faith: see ref. 1 Thess. note. The genitive is again one of apposition), <strong> in power</strong> (belongs to πληρώσῃ , q. d. <em> mightily</em> ), <strong> that</strong> &amp;c. On <strong> ὄνομα</strong> , cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9">Philippians 2:9</span> ff. Lünemann refers ἐν αὐτῷ to ὄνομα , ‘and ye in <em> it</em> :’ but surely the expression is one too appropriated in sacred diction, for it to refer to any but our Lord Himself: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:5">1 Corinthians 1:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:4">2 Corinthians 13:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:21">Ephesians 4:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+2:10">Colossians 2:10</span> , al.</p>
