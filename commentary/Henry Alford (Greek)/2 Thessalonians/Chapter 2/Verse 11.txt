All such distinctions are the merest folly: whatever God <em> permits</em> , He <em> ordains</em> ) <strong> the working of error</strong> (is causing these seducing influences to work among them.

It is better here to take τῷ definite, referring to what has gone before, than abstract), <strong> that</strong> (the higher or ultimate purpose of God) <strong> all might be judged</strong> (i.e. here ‘ <em> condemned</em> ,’ by the context) <strong> who did not</strong> (looking back over their time of probation) <strong> believe the truth, but found pleasure in iniquity</strong> .
