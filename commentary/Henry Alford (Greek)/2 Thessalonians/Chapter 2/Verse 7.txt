<p><strong> 7</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (explanation of last verse) the MYSTERY (as opposed to the ἀποκάλυψις of the man of sin) ALREADY (as opposed to ἐν τῷ ἑαυτοῦ καιρῷ above) <strong> is working</strong> (not ‘ <em> is being wrought</em> ,’ passive, as Est., Grot., all. I retain the inversion of the words, to mark better the primary and secondary emphasis: see below) <strong> of lawlessness</strong> (i.e. ungodliness refusal to recognize God’s law see reff.

<p>The genitive is one of apposition: the <strong> ἀνομία</strong> is that wherein the μυστήριον consists: not a genitive of the working cause, as Thdrt. ( ὡς κεκρυμμένην ἔχοντας τῆς ἀνομίας τὴν πάγην ), nor must we understand by the words, Antichrist himself, as Olsh., comparing τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας μυστήριον , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span> , not <em> the unexampled depths of ungodliness</em> , as Krebs, al., from Joseph.

So in reff.: and Plut. Timol. p. 238. 3 (Wetst.): ἔγνω ζῆν καθ ʼ ἑαυτὸν ἐκ μέσου γενόμενος , Ter. Phorm. v. 9. 40, ‘ea mortem obiit, e medio abiit.’ See also Herod. viii. 22: and for the opposite, ἐν μέσῳ εἶναι , Xen. Cyr. v. 2. 26.

<p>Various erroneous arrangements and renderings of this sentence have been current: of which the principal have arisen from fancying that the participle <strong> κατέχων</strong> requires some verb to be supplied after it. So Vulg. (‘tantum ut qui tenet nunc, teneat, donec de medio fiat:’ so Syr., Erasm., Est., all.), and E. V. (‘only he who now letteth, will let,’ so Beza, Whitby, al.), κατέχει (so Bengel, Pelt, al.): ἐστίν (so Knatchb., Burton, al.)):</p>
