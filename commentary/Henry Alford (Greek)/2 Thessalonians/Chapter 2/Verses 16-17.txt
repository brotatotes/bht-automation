<p><strong> ὁ ἀγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> .</strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> .</strong> <strong> λ</strong> <strong> .</strong> probably refers to ὁ θεὸς κ . ὁ πατ . ἡμ . alone: and yet when we consider how impossible it would have been for the Apostle to have written οἱ ἀγαπήσαντες , and that the singular verb following undoubtedly refers to both, I would not too hastily pronounce this. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:11">1 Thessalonians 3:11</span> .

<p><strong> ἀγαπήσας</strong> <strong> who loved us</strong> refers to a single fact the love of the Father in sending His Son or the love of the Father and Son in our accomplished Redemption.

<p><strong> ἐν χάριτι</strong> belongs, not to <strong> ἐλπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , but to <strong> δούς</strong> , and is the medium through, or element in which, the gift is made. Better thus than to refer it to both the participles <strong> ἀγαπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> δούς</strong> ; for <strong> ὁ ἀγαπήσας</strong> as applied to God (or the Lord Jesus) usually stands absolute, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:37">Romans 8:37</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</span> .

This latter is not ‘ <em> doctrine</em> ,’ as Chrys., Calv. (‘tam in piæ et sanctæ vitæ cursu, quam in sana doctrina’), for ἔργον ( <strong> work</strong> ) and λόγος ( <strong> word</strong> ), seeing that παντί applies to both, must be correlative, and both apply to matters in which the man is an agent. Still less must we understand <strong> ἐν</strong> as = διὰ (Chrys., Thl. 2, Beng., al.): the sphere, and not the instruments, of the consolation and confirmation, is spoken of.</p>
