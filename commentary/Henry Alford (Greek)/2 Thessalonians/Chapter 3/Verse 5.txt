<p><strong> 5</strong> .] There does not appear to be any distrust of the Thessalonians implied by this repeated wish for them, as De W. supposes. Rather is it an <em> enlargement</em> , taken up by the δέ (not only so, but) <em> of the</em> ἃ παραγγέλλομεν κ . ποιεῖτε κ . ποιήσετε .

<p><strong> ὁ κύρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is <strong> our Lord</strong> , as before.

<p><strong> ἡ ἀγάπη τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θεοῦ</strong> here, from the fact of his wishing that their hearts may be <em> directed into it</em> , must be subjective, <em> the love of man to God</em> . The objective meaning, <em> God’s love</em> , is out of the question. The other subjective meanings, <em> the love which God works</em> (Pelt), … <em> which God commands</em> (LeClerc), are far-fetched. ἡ ὑπομονὴ τ . χριστοῦ has very generally been understood as in E. V., ‘ <em> the patient waiting for Christ</em> .’ So Œc., Ambr., Erasm., Corn.-a-lap., Beza, all. But <strong> ὑπομονή</strong> will not bear this meaning. It occurs thirty-four times in the N. T., and always in the sense of <strong> endurance, patience</strong> . Nor again can the expression mean ‘ <em> endurance for Christ’s sake</em> ,’ which the simple genitive will not convey: but it must be, as Chrys. (1) ἵνα ὑπομένωμεν , ὡς ἐκεῖνος ὑπέμεινεν , the <em> patience</em> <strong> of Christ</strong> (gen. possess.), <strong> which Christ shewed</strong> .</p>
