<p><strong> 1</strong> . <strong> διὰ θελ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θεοῦ</strong> ] Cf. reff. <strong> κατ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἐπαγγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ζωῆς</strong> ] <strong> according to</strong> (in pursuance of, with a view to the fulfilment of) <strong> the promise</strong> (ref.) <strong> of life which is in Christ Jesus</strong> (all this is to be taken with ἀπόστολος , not with θελήματος . Thdrt. explains it well, ὥστε με τὴν ἐπαγγελθεῖσαν αἰώνιον ζωὴν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις κηρύξαι . Chrysostom sees, in this mention of the promise of life in Christ, a consolation to Timotheus under present troubles: ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρχῆς ποιεῖται τὴν παραμυθίαν εἰ ἐπαγγελία ἐστί , μὴ ζήτει αὐτὴν ἐνταῦθα · ἐλπὶς γὰρ βλεπομένη οὐκ ἔστιν ἐλπίς . And this idea seems to be borne out by the strain of the subsequent portion of the Epistle, which is throughout one of confirmation and encouragement.
