<p><strong> 2</strong> . <strong> ἀγαπητῷ τέκνῳ</strong> ] “Can it be accidental,” says Mack, “that instead of γνησίῳ τέκν ., as Timotheus is called in the first Epistle, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:2">2 Timothy 1:2</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4">Titus 1:4</span> , here we have ἀγαπητῷ ? Or may a reason for the change be found in this, that it now behoved Timotheus to stir up afresh the faith and the grace in him, before he could again be worthy of the name γνησίον τέκνον in its full sense?” This may be too much pressed: but certainly there is throughout this Epistle an altered tone with regard to Timotheus more of mere love, and less of confidence, than in the former: and this would naturally shew itself even in passing words of address. When Bengel says, “in Ep. i., scripserat, genuino: id compensator hic versu 5,” he certainly misses the delicate sense of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:5">2 Timothy 1:5</span> ; see below. To find in <strong> ἀγαπητῷ</strong> <em> more</em> confidence, as Heyd. (and Chrys., maintaining that οἱ κατὰ πίστιν ὅταν ὦσιν ἀγαπητοί , δι ʼ οὐδὲν ἕτερόν εἰσιν , ἀλλ ʼ ἢ δι ʼ ἀρετήν ), can hardly be correct: the expression of feeling is <em> different</em> in kind, not comparable in degree: suiting an Epistle of warm affection and somewhat saddened reminding, rather than one of rising hope and confidence. I regret to be, on this point, at issue throughout this second Epistle, with my friend Bishop Ellicott, who seems to me too anxious to rescue the character of Timotheus from the slightest imputation of weakness: thereby marring the delicate texture of many of St. Paul’s characteristic periods, in which tender reproof, vigorous reassurance, and fervent affection are exquisitely intermingled.
