He has held up to Timotheus, as an example, his own boldness and constancy: and has given him a sample of the faithful sayings which ruled his own conduct, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span> . He proceeds to speak of a few of the discouragements under which in this confidence he was bearing up: and, affectionate gratitude prompting him, and at the same time by way of an example of fidelity to Timotheus, he dilates on the exception to the general dereliction of him, which had been furnished by Onesiphorus. <strong> Thou knowest this, that all who are in Asia</strong> (it docs not follow, as Chrys., that εἰκὸς ἦν , ἐν Ῥώμῃ εἶναι πολλοὺς τότε τῶν ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀσίας μερῶν : this would rather require οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀσίας : but he uses the expression with reference to him to whom he was writing, who was in Asia) <strong> repudiated me</strong> not as E.
