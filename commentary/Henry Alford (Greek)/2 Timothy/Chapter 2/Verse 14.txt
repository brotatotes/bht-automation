The var. reading λογομάχει changes the whole arrangement, and attaches διαμαρτ . ἐνώπιον τοῦ κυρίου to the preceding. The chief objections to this are 1) that ὑπομίμνησκε διαμαρτυρόμενος ἐνώπ . τοῦ κυρίου is a very lame and inconsistent junction of terms, the strong emphasis of the διαμ . κ . τ . λ . not agreeing with the far weaker word ὑπομίμνησκε : 2) that in the other places where διαμαρτύρομαι occurs in St. Paul, it precedes an exhortation, e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:21">1 Timothy 5:21</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:1">2 Timothy 4:1</span> , and μαρτύρομαι Eph 4:17 ), <strong> (a thing) useful</strong> ( χρήσιμον is in apposition with the preceding sentence, as καθαρίζον in the rec. reading of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:19">Mark 7:19</span> ; see Winer, edn. 6, § 59. 9. b) <strong> for no purpose</strong> (the reading ἐπ ʼ οὐδέν , which has been put by, cf. Ellic. here, on account of the rec. illustrating St. Paul’s love of prepositional variation, does in fact illustrate it quite as much, ἐπί having dat. and accus. in the same sentence, cf. Ps. 117:9 Ed-vat [B 1 def.] [3] 3a &amp;c. χρήσιμος is constructed with εἰς in LXX: e.g., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+15:4">Ezekiel 15:4</span> ; Wis 13:11 . Cf. also Wis 15:15 ), ( <strong> but practised</strong> ) <strong> to</strong> (on condition of following from it as a necessary consequence as if it had been by covenant attached to it) <strong> the ruin</strong> (the opposite of οἰκοδομή , cf. καθαίρεσις , 2Co 13:10 ) <strong> of them that hear</strong> .

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [3] The CODEX SINAITICUS. Procured by Tischendorf, in 1859, from the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai. The Codex Frederico-Augustanus (now at Leipsic), obtained in 1844 from the same monastery, is a portion of the same copy of the Greek Bible, the 148 leaves of which, containing the entire New Testament, the Ep. of Barnabas, parts of Hermas, and 199 more leaves of the Septuagint, have now been edited by the discoverer. A magnificent edition prepared at the expense of the Emperor of Russia appeared in January, 1863, and a smaller edition containing the N.T. &amp;c., has been published by Dr. Tischendorf. The MS. has four columns on a page, and has been altered by several different correctors, one or more of whom Tischendorf considers to have lived in the sixth century. The work of the original scribe has been examined, not only by Tischendorf, but by Tregelles and other competent judges, and is by them assigned to the <em> fourth</em> <em> century</em> . The internal character of the text agrees with the external, as the student may judge for himself from the readings given in the digest. The principal correctors as distinguished by Tischendorf are: A, of the same age with the MS. itself, probably the corrector who revised the book, before it left the hands of the scribe, denoted therefore by us א -corr 1 ; B (cited as א 2 ), who in the first page of Matt. began inserting breathings, accents, &amp;c., but did not carry out his design, and touched only a few later passages; C a (cited as א 3a ) has corrected very largely throughout the book. Wherever in our digest a reading is cited as found in א 1 , it is to be understood, if no further statement is given, that C a altered it to that which is found in our text; C b (cited as א 3b ) lived about the same time as C a , i.e. some centuries later than the original scribe. These are all that we need notice here 6 .</p>
