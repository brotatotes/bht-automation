<p><strong> 4</strong> .] <strong> No soldier when on service is</strong> (suffers himself to be: the passive sense predominates: ‘is,’ as his normal state. Or the verb may be middle, as Ellic., ‘ <em> entangleth himself</em> ,’ and vulg., ‘ <em> implicat se</em> ’) <strong> entangled</strong> (ref.; ἐν βιαίοις ἐνπλακέντων πόνοις , Plato, Legg. vii. p. 814 e. Grot. quotes from Cicero ‘occupationibus implicatus:’ and we have in de Off. ii. 11, ‘qui contrahendis negotiis implicantur’) <strong> in the businesses of life</strong> (cf. Plato, Rep. vi. p. 500, οὐδὲ γάρ που … σχολὴ τῷ γε ὡς ἀληθῶς πρὸς τοῖς οὖσι τὴν διάνοιαν ἔχοντι κάτω βλέπειν εἰς ἀνθρώπων πραγματείας : Arrian, Epict. iii. 22 (Wetst.), ὡς ἐν παρατάξει , μήποτ ʼ ἀπερίσπαστον εἶναι δεῖ , ὅλον πρὸς τῇ διακονίᾳ τοῦ θεοῦ … οὐ προσδεδεμένον καθήκουσιν ἰδιωτικοῖς , οὐδ ʼ ἐμπεπλεγμένον σχέσεσιν : Ambros. de Offic. i. 36 (184), vol. iii. p. 49, ‘si is, qui imperatori militat, a susceptionibus litium, actu negotiorum forensium, venditione mercium prohibetur humanis Iegibus, quanto magis, &amp;c.:’ Ps-Athanas. quæst. in Epistolas Pauli 117: εἰ γὰρ ἐπιγείῳ βασιλεῖ ὁ μέλλων στρατεύεσθαι οὐκ ἀρέσει , ἐὰν μὴ ἀφήσῃ πάσας τὰς τοῦ βίου φρουτίδας , πόσῳ μᾶλλον μέλλων στρατεύεσθαι τῷ ἐπουρανίῳ βασιλεῖ ; see other examples in Wetst. “Vox Græca πραγμάτεια ( פרקמטיא ), pro mercatura, sæpius occurrit in Pandectis Talmudicis.” Schöttgen. On the whole matter, consult Grotius’s note), <strong> that he may please him who called him to be a soldier</strong> (who originally enrolled him as a soldier: the word signifies to <em> levy soldiers</em> , or <em> raise a troop</em> , and ὁ στρατολογήσας designates the commander of such troop. So ἀντὶ τῶν ἀπολωλότων ἀνδρῶν στρατολογήσαντες ἐξ ἁπάσης φυλῆς , Dion. Hal. xi. 24. The same writer uses στρατολογία for a <em> muster</em> , a levy of soldiers, vi. 44; ix. 38. The ‘cui se prohavit’ of the vulgate is unintelligible, unless as Grot. suggests, it is an error for ‘ <em> qui</em> se probavit.’ The taking of these precepts according to the letter, to signify that no minister of Christ may have a secular occupation, is quite beside the purpose: for 1) it is not ministers, but all soldiers of Christ who are spoken of: 2) the position of the verb ἐμπλέκεται shews that it is not the fact of the <em> existence</em> of such occupation, but the being <em> entangled</em> in it, which is before the Apostle’s mind: 3) the Apostle’s own example sufficiently confutes such an idea. Only then does it become unlawful, when such occupation, from its engrossing the man, becomes a hindrance to the work of the ministry, or from its nature is incompatible with it).</p>
