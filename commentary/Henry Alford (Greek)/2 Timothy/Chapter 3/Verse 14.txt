The Vulg. ‘credita sunt tibi,’ followed by Luth., Beza, Calv., besides the Roman-Catholic expositors, would require ἐπιστεύθης , cf. 1Co 9:17 al.), <strong> knowing</strong> (as thou dost) <strong> from what teachers</strong> (viz. thy mother Lois and grandmother Eunice, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:5">2 Timothy 1:5</span> ; cf. ἀπὸ βρέφους below: not Paul and Barnabas, as Grot., nor the πολλοὶ μάρτυρες of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:2">2 Timothy 2:2</span> .
