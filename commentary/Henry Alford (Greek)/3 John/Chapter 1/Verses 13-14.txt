<p><strong> 13 15</strong> .] <em> Close of the Epistle</em> . <strong> I had</strong> (not, as Huther, for εἶχον ἄν : it is a pure imperfect, describing that which has not come to pass, but might have done so under certain conditions: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:22">Acts 25:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</span> , also alleged by Düsterd. is not quite a case in point. He gives the meaning here well: “I had indeed much to write: that I have not written it is owing to this, that I wish not, &amp;c.”) <strong> many things to write to thee, howbeit I will not to write</strong> (present, not only “to write them,” which would be aorist, but to write at all, to write any more) <strong> by means of ink and reed</strong> (see on 2Jn 1:12 ): <strong> but</strong> (on the other hand) <strong> I hope immediately to see thee, and</strong> (then) <strong> we shall speak mouth to mouth</strong> (see 2Jn 1:12 ). <strong> Peace be to thee</strong> (beautifully paraphrased by Lyra, “interna conscientiæ, pax fraterna amicitiæ, pax superna gloriæ.” Remember our Lord’s legacy, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27">John 14:27</span> , and His greeting after the Resurrection, εἰρήνη ὑμῖν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:19">John 20:19</span> ; Joh 20:26 ). <strong> The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name</strong> (“non secus ac si nomina eorum præscripta essent.” Bengel). The reason why St. John mentions φίλοι (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:11">John 11:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:15">John 15:15</span> ; Act 27:3 ), and not ἀδελφοί (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:20">1 Corinthians 16:20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+4:21">Philippians 4:21</span> ; Eph 6:23 ), is probably to be found in the personal character of the Epistle, not addressed as from an Apostle to a church, but as from a friend to his friend, in which mutual friends on both sides would be the senders and receivers of salutation.</p>
