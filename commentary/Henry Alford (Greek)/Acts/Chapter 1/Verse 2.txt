<p><strong> 2. </strong> <strong> ἐντειλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀπ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:48">Luke 24:48</span> ff., and Act 1:4 below.

<p><strong> διὰ πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἁγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> may be joined either with ἐντειλάμενος (as in vulg copt Ch [1] Thl); or with ἐξελέξατο (as in syrr æth Cyril [2] Aug [3] Vig [4] ). In the <em> former</em> case, our Lord is said to have given His commands to the Apostles <strong> through</strong> , or <strong> in the power of</strong> , the Holy Ghost. Similarly He is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span> , <strong> διὰ πνεύματος αἰωνίου</strong> ἑαυτὸν προσενέγκαι ἄμωμον τῷ θεῷ . In the <em> latter</em> , He is said to have chosen the Apostles by the power of the Holy Ghost. Similarly, in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span> , Paul tells the Ephesian elders, that the Holy Ghost had made them overseers in the Church of God. The former construction however appears much the best, as expressing not, as might at first seem, a mere common-place, but the propriety of the fact, that His last commands were given <strong> in the power of</strong> (see Joh 20:22 ) <strong> the Holy Ghost</strong> . To take διὰ πν . ἁγ . with ἀνελήμφθη (see Olsh. i. 629) seems to me inadmissible; as also is Dr. Burton’s rendering, “having told His Apostles that His commands would be more fully made known to them by the Holy Ghost.”

<p><strong> ἀνελήμφ</strong> .] = ἀνεφέρετο εἰς τὸν οὐρ ., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:51">Luke 24:51</span> . The use of the verb in this abbreviated form, without the εἰς τ . οὐρ ., testifies to the familiarity of the apostolic church with the Ascension as a formal and recognized event in our Lord’s course.</p>
