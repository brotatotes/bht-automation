<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] <strong> ἔστησαν</strong> , viz. the <em> whole company, to whom the words had been spoken</em> ; not the eleven Apostles.

<p><strong> Ἰωσὴφ</strong> <strong> .…] The names </strong> <strong> Ἰωσήφ</strong> <strong> and</strong> Ἰωσῆς , different forms of the same, are confused in the MSS., both here and in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36">Acts 4:36</span> . But <em> Barsabbas</em> (or Barsabas) and <em> Barnabas</em> are not to be confounded: they are different names (Barsabbas = son of Sabba or Saba: on Barnabas, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:36">Acts 4:36</span> , note); and Barnabas is evidently introduced in Act 4:36 as a person who had not been mentioned before.
	</p>
<p>Of Barsabas, nothing further is known. Euseb., iii. 39, states, on the authority of Papias, that he drank a cup of poison without being hurt. [There is a Judas Barsabbas mentioned in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span> , whom some take to be his brother.]

<p>In all probability both the selected persons (see Eus [10] i. 12) belonged to the number of the Seventy, as it would be natural that the candidates for apostleship should be chosen from among those who had been already distinguished by Christ Himself among the brethren.

<p>Justus is a Roman cognomen, assumed according to a custom then prevalent. The name Justus seems to have been common: Schöttgen, Hor. Hebr., on this place, gives two instances of Jews bearing it.

<p><strong> Μαθθίαν</strong> ] Nothing historical is known of him. Traditionally, according to Nicephorus (H. E. ii. 40, Winer), he suffered martyrdom in Æthiopia; according to others, in Colchis (Menolog. Græc. iii. 198, Winer): another account (Perionii Vitæ Apost. p. 178 sqq., Winer) makes him preach in Judæa and be stoned by the Jews. Clem [11] Alex., Strom. ii. 9 [45], p. 452 P., vii. 13 [82], p. 882 P., mentions the παραδόσεις of Matthias, which perhaps were the same as an apocryphal gospel once current under his name, mentioned by Eus [12] , H. E. iii. 25. See Winer, Realw.
