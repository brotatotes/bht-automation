<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] It is a question, <em> to Whom this prayer was directed</em> . I think all probability is in favour of the Apostle (for Peter certainly was the spokesman) having addressed <em> his glorified Lord</em> . And with this the language of the prayer agrees. No stress can, it is true, be laid on <strong> κύριε</strong> : see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:29">Acts 4:29</span> , where unquestionably <em> the Father</em> is so addressed: but the <strong> ἐξελέξω</strong> , compared with οὐκ ἐγὼ ὑμᾶς τοὺς δώδεκα <strong> ἐξελεξάμην</strong> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:70">John 6:70</span> , seems to me almost decisive. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:2">Acts 1:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13">Luke 6:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:18">John 13:18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:16">John 15:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:19">John 15:19</span> . The instance cited on the other side by Meyer, ἐξελέξατο ὁ θεὸς διὰ τοῦ στόματός μου ἀκοῦσαι τὰ ἔθνη κ . τ . λ ., is not to the point, as not relating to the matter here in hand; nor are the passages cited by De Wette, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:1">2 Corinthians 1:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:1">Ephesians 1:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:1">2 Timothy 1:1</span> , where Paul refers his apostleship to <em> God</em> , since obviously all such appointment must be referred ultimately to <em> God</em> : but the question for us is, In these words, <em> did the disciples pray as they would have prayed before the Ascension</em> , or <em> had they Christ in their view?</em> The expression <strong> καρδιογνῶστα</strong> (used by Peter himself of <em> God</em> , ch. Act 15:8 ) forms no objection: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:17">John 21:17</span> , also in the mouth of Peter himself. We are sure, from the προσκυνήσαντες αὐτόν of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:52">Luke 24:52</span> , that even at this time, before the descent of the Spirit, the <em> highest kind of worship was paid to the ascended Redeemer</em> . Still, I do not regard it as by any means <em> certain</em> that they addressed Christ, nor can the passage be alleged as convincing in controversy with the Socinian.

<p><strong> ἀνάδειξ</strong> . κ . τ . λ .] Not, as in E. V., ‘ <em> shew whether of these two Thou hast chosen</em> ,’ <strong> but appoint</strong> (see reff.) <strong> one of these two (him) whom Thou hast chosen</strong> . The difference is of some import: they did not pray for a sign merely, to shew whether of the two was chosen, but that the Lord would, by means of their lot, <em> Himself appoint</em> the one of His choice.</p>
