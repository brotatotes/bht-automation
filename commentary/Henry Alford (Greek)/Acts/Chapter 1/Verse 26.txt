<p><strong> 26. </strong> <strong> ἔδωκ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κλήρους αὐτοῖς</strong> ] <strong> They cast lots</strong> for them, αὐτοῖς being a <em> dativus commodi</em> . The ordinary reading, whether αὐτῶν is referred to the Apostles or to the candidates, would require τοὺς κλήρους . Αὐτῶν has been an alteration, to avoid the rendering ‘they gave lots <em> to</em> them.’ These lots were probably tablets, with the names of the persons written on them, and shaken in a vessel, or in the lap of a robe ( Pro 16:33 ); he whose lot first leaped out being the person designated.

<p><strong> συγκατ</strong> .] The <em> lot</em> being regarded as the divine choice, the suffrages of the assembly were unanimously given (not in <em> form</em> , but by cheerful acquiescence) to the candidate thus chosen, and he was ‘voted in’ among the eleven Apostles, i.e. as a <em> twelfth</em> . That Luke does not absolutely <em> say so</em> , and never afterwards speaks of the <em> twelve</em> Apostles, is surely no safe ground on which to doubt this.

<p>Stier seems disposed to question (in his Reden der Apostel, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:18">Acts 1:18</span> ff., which however was a work of his youth) whether this step of electing a twelfth Apostle was altogether suitable to the then waiting position of the Church, and whether Paul was not in reality the twelfth, chosen by the Lord Himself. But I do not see that any of his seven queries touch the matter. We have the precedent, of all others most applicable, of the twelve tribes, to shew that the number, though ever <em> nominally kept</em> , was <em> really exceeded</em> . And this incident would not occupy a prominent place in a book where Paul himself has so conspicuous a part, unless it were by himself considered as being what it professed to be, the filling up of the vacant Apostleship.</p>
