The ἐν is in its signification of <em> investiture</em> , in which it introduces the element or condition in which, and thus the means by which, an agent operates.

<p><strong> ὀπτανόμενος</strong> ] οὐ γὰρ ὥσπερ πρὸ τῆς ἀναστάσεως ὡς ἀεὶ μετ ʼ αὐτῶν <strong> ἦν</strong> , οὕτω καὶ τότε · οὐ γὰρ εἶπε <strong> τεσσεράκοντα ἡμέρας</strong> , ἀλλὰ <strong> δι</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἡμερῶν τεσσεράκοντα</strong> <strong> ·</strong> ἐφίστατο γὰρ καὶ ἀφίστατο πάλιν , Chrysostom. This is the only place where the interval between the Resurrection and the Ascension is specified.

<p><strong> τὰ περ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> β</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> τά</strong> , in the widest sense; not ῥήματα merely: <strong> the matters</strong> . The article has been taken to imply (and so in some of my earlier editions), that during this period they received from our Lord the whole substance of the doctrine of ‘the Kingdom of God.’ But this remark seems to lose its propriety owing to the <em> present</em> participle λέγων . Both the participles, ὀπτανόμενος and λέγων , carry with them a ratiocinative force, in dependence on τεκμηρίοις : “proofs, consisting in this, that He” &amp;c. And thus the art. τά gives the sentence the meaning, “and inasmuch as the things which he said were those pertaining to the Kingdom of God;” thus serving only to define λεγόμενα . [What things these were, we are not told. Certainly, not future events in their detail, as the next portion of the narrative shews us. I should rather believe them to have concerned the future founding and government of the Church: though even here the greatest Apostles were apparently left to the unfolding of the teaching of the Holy Spirit as years went on.]</p>
