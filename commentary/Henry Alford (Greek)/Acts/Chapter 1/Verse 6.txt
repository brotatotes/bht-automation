<p><strong> 6</strong> .] This συνελθόντες does not belong to another assembling, different from the former; but takes up again the συναλιζόμενος of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:4">Acts 1:4</span> . Olsh. has mistaken the sense of the μὲν οὖν , which refers, not to another <em> incident</em> , but to other actors; <em> they</em> , as distinguished from Him who had been speaking.

<p><strong> Κύριε</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> εἰ</strong> <strong> …</strong> ] The stress of this question is in the words, prefixed for emphasis, <strong> ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ τούτῳ</strong> . That the Kingdom was, <em> in some sense</em> , and <em> at some time</em> , to be restored to Israel, was plain; nor does the Lord deny this implication (see on Act 1:8 ). Their fault was, a too curious enquiry on a point reserved among the arcana of God. Lightfoot’s idea, that the disciples wondered at the Kingdom being about to be restored to the ungrateful Jews, <em> at this time</em> , now that they had crucified Him, &amp;c., would make our Lord’s answer irrelevant.

<p>Meyer would refer ἐν τῷ χρ . τού . to the interval designated by οὐ μετὰ πολλ . ταύ . ἡμ ., ‘during this time.’ But this does not seem natural: I should rather understand it, <strong> at this present period, now</strong> . The pres. <strong> ἀποκαθιστάνεις</strong> , is that so often used in speaking with reference to matters of prophecy, importing fixed determination: as in ὁ ἐρχόμενος (ref. Mt.) and the like. So that we must not render, “Art thou restoring?” but “ <em> wilt</em> ” or “ <em> dost</em> thou restore?” As to the word itself, καθιστάνω (= στημι ) is to establish or set up, and ἀπό gives the sense of completeness, or the cognate one of entire restitution.
