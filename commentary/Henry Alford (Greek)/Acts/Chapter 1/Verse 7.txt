<p><strong> 7</strong> .] This is a <em> general</em> reproof and assertion, spoken with reference to <em> men</em> , as forbidden to search curiously into a point which Omniscience has reserved the times and seasons of the future divine dealings. But it is remarkable that not θεός , but ὁ πατήρ , is here used; and this cannot fail to remind us of that saying ( Mar 13:32 ), περὶ δὲ τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης ἢ τῆς ὥρας οὐδεὶς οἶδεν , οὐδὲ ἄγγελος ἐν οὐρανῷ , οὐδὲ ὁ υἱός , <strong> εἰ μὴ ὁ πατήρ</strong> . It may be observed however, that the same assertion <em> is not made here</em> : only the times and seasons said to be in the <em> power</em> of the Almighty Father, Who ordereth all things κατὰ τὴν βουλὴν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ . The <em> Knowledge of the Son</em> is not here in question, only <em> that of the disciples</em> . It is an enquiry intimately connected with the interpretation of the two passages, but one beyond our power to resolve, how far, among the things not yet put under His feet, may be this very thing, the <em> knowledge of that day and hour</em> . Bengel attempts to evade the generality of the οὐχ ὑμῶν ἐστιν : ‘quæ apostolorum <em> nondum</em> erat nosse, per Apocalypsin postea sunt significata.’ But signified <em> to whom?</em> What individual, or portion of the Church, has ever read plainly these χρόνους ἢ καιρούς in that mysterious book? There is truth in Olsh.’s remark, that the Apostles were to be less prophets of the future, than witnesses of the past; but we must not so limit the ὑμῶν , nor forget that the γνῶναι χρόνους ἢ καιρ . has very seldom been imparted by prophecy, which generally has formed a testimony to this very fact, that God has them in His foreknowledge, and, while He announces the events, conceals for the most part in obscurity the <em> times</em> .
