That he <em> may</em> have been such, there is nothing in the narrative to preclude: nor does Meyer’s objection apply, that it is not probable that, among the many thousand converts, no Greek proselyte had yet been admitted by baptism into the church. Many such cases may have occurred, and some no doubt had: but the object of this providential interference seems to have been, to give <em> solemn sanction</em> to such reception, by the agency of him who was both the chief of the Apostles, and the strong upholder of pure Judaism. It is hardly possible that μαρτυρούμενος ὑπὸ ὅλου τοῦ ἔθνους τῶν Ἰουδαίων ( Act 10:22 ) should have been said of a Gentile not in any way conformed to the Jewish faith and worship. The great point (ch. Act 11:3 ) which made the present event so important, was, that Cornelius was ἀνὴρ <strong> ἀκροβυστίαν ἔχων</strong> <strong> .</strong> Doubtless also among his <em> company</em> ( Act 10:24 ) there must have been many who were <em> not proselytes</em> .

<p><strong> δεόμενος τ. θεοῦ διὰ π.</strong> ] From Cornelius’s own narrative, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:31">Acts 10:31</span> , as well as from the analogy of God’s dealings, we are certainly justified in inferring, with Neander, that the subject of his prayers was that he might be guided into truth, and if so, hardly without reference to that faith which was now spreading so widely over Judæa. This is not matter of conjecture, but is implied by Peter’s <strong> οἴδατε</strong> τὸ γενόμ . δῆμα καθ ʼ ὅλης τῆς Ἰουδαίας . Further than this, we cannot infer with certainty; but, if <em> the particular difficulty present in his mind</em> be sought, we can hardly avoid the conclusion that it was connected with the apparent necessity of embracing Judaism and circumcision in order to become a believer on Christ.</p>
