<p><strong> 30. </strong> <strong> ἀπὸ τετ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The rendering of Meyer and others, ‘From the fourth day (reckoned back) down to this hour have I been fasting,’ is ungrammatical; for (1) this would require <strong> τῆσδε</strong> τῆς ὥρας , and (2) ἤμην cannot possibly reach to the <em> present time</em> , but is the historical past: <strong> I was fasting</strong> . This being so, ἀπὸ τετάρτης ἡμέρας must indicate the time denoted by ἤμην ‘quarto abhinc die’ <strong> four days ago</strong> ; see reff. (2), which fully justify this rendering. De Wette’s and Neander’s rendering, ‘For four (whole) days was I (i.e. had I been) fasting up to this hour (i.e. the hour in which he saw the vision),’ does not satisfy <strong> ταύτης</strong> τῆς ὥρας , which must in that case be ἐκείνης , if indeed such an expression could be at all used of ‘the time when the following incident took place.’ The only legitimate meaning of ταύτ . τ . ὥρ . I take to be <strong> this hour of the day</strong> : and this meaning is further established by the omission of ὥραν after ἐνάτην .

<p>The hour alluded to is probably the <em> sixth</em> , the hour of the mid-day meal, which was the only one partaken by the Jews on their solemn days. (Lightf.)

<p><strong> λαμπρᾷ</strong> ] <strong> bright</strong> . In Luke (ref.) the brightness was in the colour: here, probably, in some supernatural splendour. The garment might have been white (as in ch. Act 1:10 ), or not, but at all events, it was radiant with brightness.</p>
