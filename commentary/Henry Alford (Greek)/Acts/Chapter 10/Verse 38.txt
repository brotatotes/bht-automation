<p><strong> 38. </strong> <strong> Ἰησοῦν τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀπὸ Ναζ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The <em> personal subject</em> of the γενόμενον ῥῆμα , q. d. ‘Ye know the subject which was preached … viz. Jesus of Nazareth.’
	</p>
<p><strong> ὡς ἔχρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> how that God anointed him</strong> …, not as Kuin. and Kypke, ‘how that God anointed Jesus of N.,’ taking αὐτόν as redundant by a Hebraism. See a construction very similar in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:19-20">Luke 24:19-20</span> .
	</p>
<p>The fact of the anointing with the Holy Spirit, in His baptism by John, was the historical opening of the ministry of Jesus: this anointing however was not His <em> first</em> unction with the Spirit, but only symbolic of that which He had in His incarnation: so Cyril in Johan. lib. xi. vol. vii. p. 993, οὐ δήπου πάλιν ἐκεῖνό φαμεν ὅτι τότε γέγονεν ἅγιος ὁ κατὰ σάρκα χριστός , ὅτε τὸ πνεῦμα τεθέαται καταβαῖνον ὁ βαπτιστής · ἅγιος γὰρ ἦν καὶ ἐν ἐμβρύῳ καὶ μήτρᾳ … ἀλλὰ δέδοται μὲν εἰς σημεῖον τῷ βαπτιστῇ τὸ θέαμα : which unction abode upon Him, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:32-33">John 1:32-33</span> , and is alleged here as the continuing anointing which was upon Him from God.
	</p>
<p>Stier well remarks, how entirely all personal address to the hearers and all doctrinal announcements are thrown into the background in this speech, and the <em> Person and Work and Office of Christ</em> put forward as the sole subject of apostolic preaching.
	</p>
<p><strong> καταδυναστ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Subdued, so that he is their δυνάστς , and this power used for their oppression. Here, it alludes to physical oppression by disease (see Luk 13:16 ) and possession: in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:26">2 Timothy 2:26</span> , a very similar description is given of those who are <em> spiritually</em> bound by the devil.
	</p>
<p><strong> ὁ θεὸς ἦν μετ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] So Nicodemus had spoken, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:2">John 3:2</span> ; and probably Peter here used the words as well known and indicative of the presence of divine power and co-operation (see Jdg 6:16 ): beginning as he does with the outer and lower circle of the things regarding Christ, as they would be matter of observation and inference to his <em> hearers</em> , and gradually ascending to those higher truths regarding His Person and Office, which were matter of <em> apostolic testimony</em> and demonstration from Scripture, His resurrection ( Act 10:40 ), His being appointed Judge of living and dead ( Act 10:42 ), and the predestined Author of salvation to all who believe on Him ( Act 10:43 ).</p>
