<p><strong> 26.</strong> ] The unusual word <strong> πρώτως</strong> seems to imply priority not only in time, but also in usage: at Antioch first and principally. So we have in Aristot. Eth. Nic. viii. 5, πρώτως καὶ κυρίως .

<p><strong> Χριστιανούς</strong> ] This name is never used by Christians <em> of themselves</em> in the N. T. (but οἱ μαθηταί , οἱ πιστοί , or οἱ πιστεύοντες , οἱ ἀδελφοί , οἱ ἅγιοι , οἱ τῆς ὁδοῦ ), only (see reff.) as <em> spoken by</em> , or <em> coming from</em> , those without the church. And <em> of</em> those, it cannot have arisen with the Jews, who would never have given a name derived from the Messiah to a hated and despised sect. By the Jews they were called Ναζωραῖοι , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:5">Acts 24:5</span> , and <em> Galilæans</em> : and Julian, who wished to deprive them of a name in which they gloried (see below), and to favour the Jews, ordered that they should not be called Christiani; but Galilæi, Greg. Naz [58] Orat. iv. (in Jul. i.) 86, vol. i. p. 114. That it has a Latin form is no decided proof of a Latin origin: Latin forms had become naturalized among the Greeks, and in this case there would be no Greek adjective so ready to hand as the Latin possessive, sanctioned as it was by such forms as Pompeiani, Cæsariani, Herodiani (Christus being regarded as a proper name, see Tacit. Ann. xv. 44, ‘… quos vulgus … Christianos appellabat. Auctor ejus nominis Christus, Tiberio imperitante, per procuratorem Pontium Pilatum supplicio affectus erat’). The name soon became matter of glorying among its bearers: ref. 1 Pet., Eus [59] H. E. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1">Acts 11:1</span> , in the epistle of the churches of Lyons and Vienne, τοῦ ἡγεμόνος .… μόνον τοῦτο πυθομένου εἰ καὶ αὐτὸς εἴη Χριστιανός , τοῦ δὲ (Epagathus) λαμπροτάτῃ φωνῇ ὁμολογήσαντος , … and again, πρὸς πάντα τὰ ἐπηρωτημένα ἀπεκρίνατο (Sanctus) τῇ Ῥωμαικῇ φωνῇ , Χριστιανός εἰμι . And in the Clementine Liturgy (Humphry, Comm. on Acts, p. 84), εὐχαριστοῦμέν σοι , ὅτι τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ χριστοῦ σου ἐπικέκληται ἐφ ʼ ἡμᾶς , καὶ σοὶ προσῳκειώμεθα .

	</p>
<p>Before this, while the believers had been <em> included among Jews</em> , no distinctive name for them was needed: but now that a body of men, compounded of <em> Jews and Gentiles</em> , arose, distinct in belief and habits from both, some new appellation was required.

<p>It may be observed, that the inhabitants of Antioch were famous for their propensity to jeer and call names; see instances in C. and H. i. p. 148, note 2. See several interesting particulars respecting the name collected in Wordsw.’s note: who however maintains that it was given by the Church herself.</p>
