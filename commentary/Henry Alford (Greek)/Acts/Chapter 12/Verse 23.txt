<p><strong> 23</strong> .] The <em> fact</em> may be correctly related by Josephus (see above): but our narrative alleges the <em> cause</em> of what happened to have been the <em> displeasure of God</em> , and the stroke to have been inflicted <em> by His angel</em> . Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+19:35">2 Kings 19:35</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ch+21:15-16">1 Chronicles 21:15-16</span> . But no <em> appearance</em> of an angel is implied: nor was I aware that such had ever been inferred; but I see in Valesius’s note on Euseb. ii. 10, “Quasi vero non utrumque fieri potuerit, ut et bubo supra caput Agrippæ, et ex alia parte angelus eidem appareret.”

<p><strong> σκωληκόβρωτος</strong> ] Another additional particular: and one to be expected from a physician. In several cases of deaths by divine judgment we have accounts of this loathsome termination of the disease. So Herodotus, iv. 205, ἡ Φερετίμη … ζῶσα εὐλέων ἐξέζεσε : which he alleges as an instance that excessive indulgence of revenge, such as Pheretima had shewn against the Barcæans, is looked on with anger by the gods. See too the very similar account of the death of Antiochus Epiphanes, 2Ma 9:5-9 . So also Jos. Antt. xvii. 6. 5, describing the disease of which Herod the Great died, mentions σῆψις σκώληκας ἐμποιοῦσα . So also Euseb. (viii. 16) of the death of Galerius. So also Tertullian, ad Scapulam, c. 3, vol. i. p. 702, Migne, “Claudius Lucius Herminianus in Cappadocia, cum indigne ferens uxorem suam ad hanc sectam transiisse, solusque in Prætorio suo vastatus peste vivus vermibus ebullisset, Nemo sciat, aiebat, ne gaudeant Christiani. Postea cognito errore suo, quod tormentis quosdam a proposito suo excidere fecisset, pæne Christianus decessit.”</p>
