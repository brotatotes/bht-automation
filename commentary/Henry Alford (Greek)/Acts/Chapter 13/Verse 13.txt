<p>Henceforward <em> Paul is the principal person</em> , and Barnabas is thrown into the background.

<p><strong> Πέργην τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Παμφ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Perga lies on the Cestrus, which flows into the bay of Attaleia. It is sixty stadia from the mouth ( εἶθ ʼ ὁ Κέστρος ποταμός , ὃν ἀναπλεύσαντι σταδίους ἑξήκοντα Πέργη πόλις , Strabo, xiv. p. 667), “between and upon the sides of two hills, with an extensive valley in front, watered by the river Cestrus, and backed by the mountains of the Taurus.” (C. and H. vol. i. p. 195, from Sir C. Fellows’s Asia Minor.) The remains are almost entirely Greek, with few traces of later inhabitants (p. 194 and note).

<p>The inhabitants of Pamphylia were nearly allied in character to those of Cilicia ( οἱ Πάμφυλοι , πολὺ τοῦ Κιλικίου φίλου μετέχοντες , Srabo, xii. § 7): and it may have been Paul’s design, having already preached in his own province, to extend the Gospel of Christ to this neighbouring people.

<p>John probably took the opportunity of some ship sailing from Perga. His reason for returning does not appear, but may be presumed from ch. Act 15:38 to have been, unsteadiness of character, and unwillingness to face the dangers abounding in this rough district (see below). He afterwards, having been the subject of dissension between Paul and Barnabas, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:37-40">Acts 15:37-40</span> , accompanied the latter again to Cyprus; and we find him at a much later period spoken of by Paul, together with Aristarchus and Jesus called Justus, as <em> having been a comfort to him</em> ( Col 4:10-11 ): and again in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:11">2 Timothy 4:11</span> , <em> as profitable to him for the ministry</em> .</p>
