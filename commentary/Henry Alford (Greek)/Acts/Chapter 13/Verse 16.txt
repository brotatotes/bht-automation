	</p>
<p>The contents of this speech ( Act 13:16-41 ) may be thus arranged: I. <em> Recapitulation of God’s ancient deliverances of His people and mercies towards them, ending with His crowning mercy, the sending of the Deliverer and promised Son of David</em> ( Act 13:16-25 ). II. <em> The history of the rejection of Jesus by the Jews, and of God’s fulfilment of His promise by raising Him from the dead</em> ( Act 13:26-37 ). III. <em> The personal application of this to all present, the announcement to them of justification by faith in Jesus, and solemn warning against the rejection of Him</em> ( Act 13:38-41 ). It is in the last degree unsafe to argue, as Wordsworth has done, that, because Strabo asserts the language of the Pisidians to have been neither Greek nor Lydian, St. Paul must have spoken to them by virtue of his miraculous gift of tongues. To the question put by Wordsw., “In what language did St. Paul preach in Pisidia?” we may reply, seeing that he preached in the synagogue after the reading of the law and prophets, “In the same language as that in which the law and prophets had just been read.”

<p><strong> οἱ φοβ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The (uncircumcised) proselytes of the gate; not excluding even such pious Gentiles, not proselytes in any sense, who might be present. The speech, from the beginning and throughout, is <em> universal</em> in its application, embracing Jews and Gentiles.</p>
