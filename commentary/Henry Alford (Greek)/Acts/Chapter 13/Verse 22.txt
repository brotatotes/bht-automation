<p><strong> 22. </strong> <strong> μεταστήσας</strong> ] <strong> having deposed him</strong> (reff.): in this case, by his <em> death</em> , for David was not made king till then. Or perhaps μεταστ . may refer to the sentence pronounced against Saul, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1sa+13:14">1 Samuel 13:14</span> , or <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:23">Acts 15:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:28">Acts 15:28</span> , and ἤγειρεν to the whole process of the exaltation of David to be king. But I prefer the former.

<p><strong> ᾧ κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εἶπεν μ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The two passages, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:0">Psalms 89:0</span> ; (88 LXX) 20, and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1sa+13:14">1 Samuel 13:14</span> , are interwoven together: both were spoken of David, and both by prophetic inspiration. They are cited from memory, neither τὸν τοῦ Ἰεσσαί nor ὅς … μου being found in them. These latter words are spoken of <em> Cyrus</em> , see reff. That such citations are left in their present shape in our text, forms a strong presumption that we have the speeches of Paul verbatim as delivered by him, and no subsequent general statement of what he said, in which case the citations would have been <em> corrected by the sacred text</em> .</p>
