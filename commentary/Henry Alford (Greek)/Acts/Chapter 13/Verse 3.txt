Fasting and prayer have ever been connected with the solemn times of ordination by the Christian church; but the ‘jejunia quatuor temporum,’ or ‘ember days at the four seasons,’ for the special purpose of ordinations, were probably not introduced till the fourth or even fifth century. See Bingham, iv. 6. 6.
