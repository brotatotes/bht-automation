<p><strong> 32. </strong> <strong> ἡμεῖς ὑμᾶς</strong> ] He and Barnabas were not of the number of the συναναβάντες , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:31">Acts 13:31</span> , nor was their mission to the Jewish people. ‘ <em> They</em> are at this moment witnessing to the people, <em> we</em> , preaching to you.’ Stier observes (Red. d. Apost. p. 367) how entirely Paul sinks <em> himself</em> , his history and commission from Christ, in the great object of his preaching.

<p><strong> ἀναστήσας</strong> ] The meaning <strong> having raised Him from the dead</strong> is absolutely required by the context: both because the word is repeated with ἐκ νεκρῶν ( Act 13:34 ), and because the Apostle’s emphasis throughout the passage is on the <em> Resurrection</em> ( Act 13:30 ) as the <em> final fulfilment</em> ( ἐκπεπλήρωκεν ) <em> of God’s promises regarding Jesus</em> . This is maintained by Luther, Hammond, Le Clerc, Meyer, &amp;c.: the other meaning, ‘ <em> having raised up</em> ,’ as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:37">Acts 7:37</span> , προφήτην ὑμῖν ἀναστήσει ὁ κύριος , by Calvin, Beza, Calov., Wolf, Michaelis, Rosenm., Heinrichs, Kuinoel, Olsh., and by Mr. Humphry. Meyer well remarks, that this meaning would hardly in our passage have been thought of or defended, had it not been that the subjoined citation from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:0">Psalms 2:0</span> has been thought necessarily to apply to our Lord’s <em> mission upon earth</em> .</p>
