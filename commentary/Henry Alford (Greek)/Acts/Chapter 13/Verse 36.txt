<p><strong> 36</strong> .] The psalm, though spoken by David, cannot have its fulfilment <em> in David</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἰδίᾳ γενεᾷ</strong> ] The dative <em> commodi</em> , not ‘sua generatione,’ which is flat in the extreme. David ministered only to <em> the generation in which he lived</em> : but διὰ <strong> τούτου</strong> , remission of sins is preached ὑμῖν , and to <em> all who believe on Him</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> τῇ τοῦ θ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> βουλῇ</strong> is best taken with ὑπηρετήσας , not with ἐκοιμήθη : as E. V., <strong> after he had served his own generation by the will</strong> (i.e. according to the appointment) <strong> of God</strong> . His whole course was marked out and fixed by God he fulfilled it, and fell asleep. I prefer this, because joining τῇ τοῦ θ . β . with ἐκοιμήθη seems to diminish the importance of that verb in the sentence. (See, on the whole, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:12">2 Samuel 7:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ki+2:10">1 Kings 2:10</span> .)
