<p><strong> 11. </strong> <strong> Λυκαονιστί</strong> ] The nature of this dialect is uncertain: its existence is further mentioned by Steph. Byzant., cf. τῇ τῶν Λυκαόνων φωνῇ , in note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:20">Acts 14:20</span> . The notice is inserted to shew that the Apostles <em> had no knowledge of the inference drawn by the crowd</em> , till they saw the bulls being brought to their doors, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:13">Acts 14:13</span> . So Chrysostom: οὐκ ἦν τοῦτο οὐδέπω δῆλον τῇ γὰρ οἰκείᾳ φωνῇ ἐφθέγγοντο , λέγοντες κ . τ . λ . διὰ τοῦτο οὐδὲν αὐτοῖς ἔλεγον (meaning, “for this reason they, the Lycaonians, spoke unintelligibly to the Apostles:” ἔλεγον taking up the λέγοντες . Wordsw. has, in his ardour to vindicate Chrysostom from heterodoxy, fallen into the mistake of rendering, “therefore the Apostles said nothing to them”)· ἐπειδὴ δὲ εἶδον τὰ στέμματα , τότε ἐξελθόντες κ . τ . λ . Hom. xxx., p. 235 f.

<p>These ἐπιφάνειαι of the gods are frequent subjects of heathen poetry and mythology. Hom. Od. <em> ρ</em> . 484, says, καί τε θεοὶ ξείνοισιν ἐοικότες ἀλλοδαποῖσι Παντοῖοι τελέθοντες ἐπιστρωφῶσι πόληας . It was in the neighbouring country of Phrygia that Jupiter and Mercury were said to have wandered, and to have been entertained by Baucis and Philemon: ‘Jupiter huc, specie mortali, cumque parente Venit Atlantiades positis caducifer alis.’ (Ov. Met. viii. 626, f.) Dio Chrysostom (Orat. xxxiii. p. 408) says, φασὶ τοὺς οἰκιστὰς ἥρωας ἢ θεοὺς πολλάκις ἐπιστρέφεσθαι τὰς αὑτῶν πόλεις . (From Mr. Humphry’s note.)</p>
