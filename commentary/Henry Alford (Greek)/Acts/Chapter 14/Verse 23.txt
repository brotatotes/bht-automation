<p><strong> 23. </strong> <strong> χειροτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] ‘ <em> cum suffragiis creassent</em> ,’ Erasm.: not necessarily as the meaning of the <em> word</em> conventionally, which had passed to any kind of appointment, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:41">Acts 10:41</span> ; but by the analogy of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:2-6">Acts 6:2-6</span> . See ref. 2 Cor. The word will not bear Jerome’s and Chrys.’s sense of ‘ <em> laying on</em> of hands,’ adopted by Roman Catholic expositors. Nor is there any reason here for departing from the usual meaning of electing by show of hands. The Apostles may have admitted by ordination those <em> presbyters whom the churches elected</em> .
