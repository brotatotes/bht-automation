<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] The variation of reading here is remarkable. The text which I have given is in all probability the original, and the words inserted in the rec. have been intended as a help out of their difficulty. Not only are they wanting in several ancient MSS., but they bear the sure mark of spuriousness, manifold variations in the MSS. where they do occur. The sense, and account of the text seem to be this: the Apostle paraphrases the ὁ ποιῶν ( πάντα ) ταῦτα of the LXX, adding γνωστὰ ἀπ ʼ αἰῶνος , and intending to express ‘saith the Lord, who from the beginning revealed these things,’ viz. by the prophet (of old, see reff.) just cited. The addition in the rec. has been made to fill up the apparently elliptical γνωστὰ ἀπ ʼ αἰῶνος , which not being found in the passage of Amos, was regarded as a sentence by itself. These last words, κύρ . ὁ ποι . ταῦ . γν . ἀπ ʼ αἰ ., may perhaps be an allusion to the mystery of the admission of the Gentiles into the, church, which was now being revealed practically, and had been from of old announced by the prophets: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25-26">Romans 16:25-26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5-6">Ephesians 3:5-6</span> , &amp;c.</p>
