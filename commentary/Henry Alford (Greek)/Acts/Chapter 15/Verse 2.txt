<p><strong> ἔταξαν ἀναβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] I assume here what seems to me to be almost beyond the possibility of question (see note to chronological table in Prolegg., where I have given the reasons), that this journey was the same as that mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1-10">Galatians 2:1-10</span> . In that case, Paul there ( Act 15:2 ) says that he went up κατὰ ἀποκάλυψιν . In this expression I cannot see it necessarily implied that the revelation was made <em> to himself</em> , but that there was <em> some intimation</em> of the Holy Ghost, similar perhaps to that in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span> , in accordance with which the church at Antioch sent him and Barnabas; there being προφῆται there, by whom the Spirit spoke His will.

<p><strong> τινας ἄλλους</strong> ] Titus was one, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1">Galatians 2:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:3">Galatians 2:3</span> , and that, in all probability, in order to <em> give an example of a Gentile convert of the uncircumcision endowed with gifts of the Holy Spirit</em> , Titus is <em> not mentioned in the Acts</em> : but only in 2 Cor., Gal., 2 Tim., and the epistle addressed to him.</p>
