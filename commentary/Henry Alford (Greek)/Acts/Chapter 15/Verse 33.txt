<p>[ <strong> 34.</strong> ] On every account it is probable that the words forming this verse in rec. (see var. readd.) are an interpolation. For, (1) manuscript evidence against them is weighty, especially as D, in the case of <em> insertions</em> in the Acts, is of very low authority. (2) The αὐτοῦ is αὐ <strong> τούς</strong> in C and D, and αὐτοῖς and αὐτόθι in some cursives; and D and the Vulg. add μόνος δὲ Ἰούδ . ἐπορεύθη ; the former shewing the copying of an indistinct marginal gloss which was not understood, and the latter betraying the secret of the whole, viz. that the notice was interpolated to account for Silas being found again at Antioch in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:40">Acts 15:40</span> . (3) Internally considered, the insertion is very improbable: coming after ἀπελύθησαν unexplained (which from its voice and tense implies that the dismissal actually took place and they departed) and followed by Παῦλος <strong> δέ</strong> after ἔδοξε δὲ τῷ Σίλᾳ . On Silas’s subsequent presence at Antioch, see note, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:40">Acts 15:40</span> .
	</p>
<p>We learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:10">Galatians 2:10</span> , that <em> a condition</em> was attached to the cordiality with which the Gentile mission of Paul and Barnabas was recognized by the chief Apostles: that they should <em> remember the poor</em> , i.e. the poor <em> at Jerusalem</em> : that the wants of the mother church should not be forgotten by those converts, whose Judaical bond to her was thus cast loose. This was an object which Paul was ever most anxious to subserve. See Gal. l. c. and note.]</p>
