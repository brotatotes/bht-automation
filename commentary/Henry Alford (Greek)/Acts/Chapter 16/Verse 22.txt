The multitude probably cried out tumultuously, as on other occasions (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:18">Luke 23:18</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:28">Acts 19:28</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:34">Acts 19:34</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:30">Acts 21:30</span> ; Act 22:22-23 ), and the duumviri, without giving them a trial ( ἀκατακρίτους , Act 16:37 ), rent off their clothes, scil. by the lictors ( τοῖς ῥαβδούχοις ἐκέλευσαν τὴν ἐσθῆτά τε περικαταῤῥῆξαι καὶ ταῖς ῥάβδοις τὸ σῶμα ξαίνειν , Dion [80] . Hal. ix. 39). The form was, ‘Summove, lictor, despolia, verbera,’ Seneca (C. and H. i. 357). See also Livy, ii. 8; Valer. Max [81] ii. 28, in Wetst. Erasmus fancied that the duumviri rent <em> their own</em> clothes from indignation: but, to say nothing of the improbability of such a proceeding on the part of a Roman magistrate, a man could not very well <strong> περι</strong> ῤῥῆξαι his own garments
