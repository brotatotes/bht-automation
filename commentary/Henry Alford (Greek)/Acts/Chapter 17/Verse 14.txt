<p><strong> 14. </strong> <strong> ὡς ἐπὶ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The various readings seem to have arisen from not understanding <strong> ὡς</strong> , which cannot, here or any where else, be redundant (as De Dieu, Raphel, Wolf, Heinrichs, &amp;c.): nor can it well here signify that his going, ‘ <em> as if to the sea</em> ,’ was only a <em> feint</em> , to deceive his enemies (as Beza, Piscator, Grot., Olsh., Neander, &amp;c.): for, as there is no mention of any land journey, or places passed through on his way to Athens, there can be little doubt that he <em> did really go by sea</em> . But ὡς ἐπὶ τ . θ . I believe simply to indicate the <em> direction in which</em> the Berœan brethren sent him forth [implying probably that all that was known at Berœa of his intended route was, that it was in the direction of the sea]. ὡς is used thus before participles and prepositions, without any assignable reference to its (more usual) subjective reference in such a connexion. Thus Hermann on Soph. Philoct. 58, says ‘cogitationem significat particula ὡς . Sed multo usu factum est, ut aliquandoetiam ibi usurparetur, ubi non opus esset respici id, quod quis in mente haberet.’ We have the same expression in Pausan. ii. 25, καταβάντων δὲ (the walls of Tyrius) ὡς ἐπὶ θάλασσαν , ἐνταῦθα οἱ θάλαμοι τῶν Προίτου θυγατέρων εἰσίν , and Diod. Sic. xiv. 49, κελεύσας κατὰ τάχος λάθρα πλεῖν ὡς ἐπὶ Συρακοσίους , and Polyb. passim in Wetst., e.g. καθήκουσαν ( τὴν Σελουκείαν ) ὡς ἐπὶ θάλασσαν , v. 59, and with the same signification. <em> Where</em> he embarked for Athens, is not said: probably (C. and H. i. 403) at Dium, near the base of Mt. Olympus, to which two roads from Berœa are marked in the ancient tables.</p>
