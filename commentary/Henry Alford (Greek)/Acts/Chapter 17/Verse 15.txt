<p>The course of <em> Timotheus</em> appears to have been, as far as we can follow it from the slight notices given, as follows: when Paul departed from Berœa, not having been able to revisit Thessalonica as he wished ( 1Th 2:18 ), he sent Timotheus (from Berœa, not from Athens) to exhort and confirm the Thessalonians, and determined to be left at Athens <em> alone</em> ( 1Th 3:1 ), Silas meanwhile remaining to carry on the work at Berœa. Paul, on his arrival at Athens, sends (by his conductors, who returned) this message to both, to come to him as soon as possible. They did so, and found him (ch. Act 18:5 ) at Corinth. See Prolegg. to 1 Thess., Vol. III.

<p><strong> Ἀθηνῶν</strong> ] See a long and interesting description of the then state of Athens, its buildings, &amp;c., in C. and H. chap. 10 vol. i. pp. 407 ff.; and Lewin, i. pp. 268 ff. It was a <em> free city</em> . Strabo (ix. 1) gives an epitome of its fortunes from the Roman conquest nearly to this time: Ῥωμαῖοι δ ʼ οὖν παραλαβόντες αὐτοὺς δημοκρατουμένους ἐφύλαξαν τὴν αὐτονομίαν αὐτοῖς κ . τὴν ἐλευθερίαν . ἐπιπεσὼν δ ʼ ὁ Μιθριδατικὸς πόλεμος τυράννους αὐτοῖς κατέστησεν οὓς ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐβούλετο , τὸν δ ʼ ἰσχύσαντα μάλιστα τὸν Ἀριστίωνα κ . ταύτην βιασάμενον τὴν πόλιν . ἐκ πολιορκίας ἑλὼν Σύλλας ὁ τῶν Ῥωμαίων ἠγεμὼν ἐκόλασε · τῇ πόλει δὲ συγγνώμην ἔνειμε , καὶ μέχρι νῦν ἐν ἐλευθερίᾳ τε ἐστὶ κ . τιμῇ παρὰ τοῖς Ῥωμαίοις .
