<p><strong> ἐπὶ τὸν Ἄρειον πάγον</strong> ] There is no allusion here to the <em> court</em> of Areiopagus, nor should the words have been so rendered in E. V. especially as the same Ἀρείου πάγου below ( Act 17:22 ) is translated ‘ <em> Mars’ Hill</em> .’ We have in the narrative <em> no trace of any judicial proceeding</em> , but every thing to contradict such a supposition. Paul merely makes his speech, and, having satisfied the curiosity of the multitude who came together on Mars’ Hill, departs unhindered: <strong> they brought him up to the hill of Mars</strong> . Wordsworth believes he finds a trace of a judicial proceeding in Ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι , denoting rather a public apology than a private discussion: and in the conversion of Dionysius <em> the Areopagite</em> . But what words other than those would St. Paul have been likely to use in making a speech to a concourse of Athenians? for no one supposes it to have been a <em> private</em> discussion. And why should not Dionysius have been present? As a convert of note, he would naturally have his title attached.

<p>The following note is borrowed from Mr. Humphry’s Commentary: ‘It might be expected that on the hill of Mars the mind of the stranger would be impressed with the magnificence of the religion which he sought to overthrow. The temple of the Eumenides was immediately below him: opposite, at the distance of 200 yards, was the Acropolis, which, being entirely occupied with statues and temples, was, to use the phrase of an ancient writer (Aristides), ἀντ ʼ ἀναθήματος , as one great offering to the gods. The Persians encamped on the Areiopagus when they besieged the Acropolis (Herod. viii. 52): from the same place the Apostle makes his first public attack on Paganism, of which the Acropolis was the stronghold. Xerxes in his fanaticism burnt the temples of Greece (Æschyl. Pers.: Cic. de Leg. ii. 10). Christianity advanced more meekly and surely: and though the immediate effect of the Apostle’s sermon was not great, the Parthenon in time became a Christian church (Leake, Athens, p. 277). Athens ceased to be a κατείδωλος πόλις , and the repugnance of the Greeks to images became so great, as to be a principal cause of the schism between the churches of the east and west in the eighth century.’

<p>The hill of Mars was so called according to Paus. i. 28. 5, ὅτι πρῶτος Ἄρης ἐνταῦθα ἐκρίθη . It was on the west of the Acropolis. The Areiopagus, the highest criminal court of Athens, held its sittings there. To give any account of it is beside the purpose, there being no allusion to it in the text. Full particulars may be found sub voce in Smith’s Dict. of Gr. and Rom. Antt.
