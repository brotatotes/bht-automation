<p><strong> 30. </strong> <strong> ὑπεριδών</strong> ] In this word lie treasures of mercy for those who lived in the times of ignorance. God <strong> overlooked</strong> them [the rendering of the E. V. bears the same meaning, but is to our ears in these days objectionable]: i.e. corrected not this <em> ignorance itself</em> as a sin, but <em> the abuses even of this</em> , by which the heathen sunk into deeper degradation. The same argument is treated more at length in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:0">Romans 12:0</span> . The πᾶσι of the rec. and ἵνα πάντες of D 1 have both been corrections occasioned by the apparent difficulty of τοῖς ἀνθρώποις πάντας . The genuine reading gives the emphatic πάντας πανταχοῦ , following on the foregoing assertion of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:25-26">Acts 17:25-26</span> , its proper place.</p>
