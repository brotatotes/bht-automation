<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] PAUL’S VISIT TO THE CHURCHES IN GALATIA AND PHRYGIA.
	</p>
<p>Either (1) Galatia is here a general term including Lycaonia, and Paul went by Derbe, Lystra, Iconium, &amp;c. as before in ch. 16, or (2) he did not visit Lycaonia this time, but went through Cappadocia: to which also the words διελθόντα τὰ ἀνωτερικὰ μέρη (ch. Act 19:1 ) seem to point, ἡ ἄνω Ἀσία being the country east of the Halys. We find Christian churches in Cappadocia, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span> . On this journey, as connected with the state of the Galatian churches, see Prolegg. to Gal. § iii. 1.
	</p>
<p><strong> καθεξῆς</strong> implies taking the churches in order; regularly visiting them, each as they lay in his route.
	</p>
<p>One work accomplished by him in this journey was the ordaining (but apparently not collecting) a contribution for the poor saints at Jerusalem: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:1">1 Corinthians 16:1</span> .
	</p>
<p>Timotheus and Erastus probably accompanied him, see ch. Act 19:22 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:1">2 Corinthians 1:1</span> ; and Gaius and Aristarchus, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span> ; and perhaps Titus, 2Co 12:18 al. (and Sosthenes? ( 1Co 1:1 ), but see on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:17">Acts 18:17</span> .)</p>
