<p><strong> συνείχετο τῷ λόγῳ</strong> ] ‘ <em> When Silas and Timotheus arrived</em> [see ch. Act 17:15 note] <em> from Macedonia, they found Paul anxiously occupied in discoursing to the Jews</em> .’ This I believe to be the meaning: that they found him in a state of more than ordinary anxiety, more than usually absorbed in the work of testifying to the Jews (see reff.): a crisis in the work being imminent, which resulted in their rejection of the word of life. (On the whole character of his early preaching at Corinth, see notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1-5">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</span> .) Thus only, the δέ in Act 18:5 and that in Act 18:6 will both be satisfied: <strong> he discoursed in the synagogue, &amp;c.… but when Silas and Timotheus arrived, he was earnestly occupied in discoursing, &amp;c. But, as they opposed themselves and blasphemed, &amp;c</strong> . Wordsworth adopts the view that after the arrival of Silas and Timotheus with supplies from Macedonia, Paul gave up his tent-making and gave himself up ( συνείχετο ) to preaching. But surely this is ungrammatical. The aor. ( ὡς κατῆλθον ) and imperf. ( συνείχετο ) require the rendering ‘when they arrived, they found him συνεχόμενον .’</p>
