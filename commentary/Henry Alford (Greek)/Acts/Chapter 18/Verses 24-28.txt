<p><strong> 24 28.</strong> ] APOLLOS AT EPHESUS, AND IN ACHAIA.

<p><strong> Ἀπολλώς</strong> ] abbreviated from Ἀπολλώνιος [as Lucas from Lucanus, &amp;c.]: see var. read.

<p><strong> Ἀλεξανδρεύς</strong> ] Alexandria was the great seat of the Hellenistic [or later Greek] language, learning, and philosophy (see ch. Act 6:9 ). A large number of Jews had been planted there by its founder, Alexander the Great. The celebrated LXX version of the O. T. was made there under the Ptolemies. There took place that remarkable fusion of Greek, Oriental, and Judaic elements of thought and belief, which was destined to enter so widely, for good and for evil, into the minds and writings of Christians. We see in the providential calling of Apollos to the ministry, an instance of adaptation of the workman to the work. A masterly exposition of the Scriptures by a learned Hellenist of Alexandria formed the most appropriate watering ( 1Co 3:6 ) for those who had been planted by the pupil of Gamaliel.

<p><strong> λόγιος</strong> ] either (1) <em> learned</em> , as Philo, Vita Mos. i. 5, vol. ii. p. 84, Αἰγυπτίων οἱ λόγιοι , and Jos. B. J. vi. 5. 3, who distinguishes, in the interpretation of the omens preceding the siege, οἱ ἰδιῶται from οἱ λόγιοι , or (2) <em> eloquent</em> : so Jos. Antt. xvii. 6. 2 calls Judas and Matthias, Ἰουδαίων λογιώτατοι and πατρίων ἐξηγηταὶ νόμων . The etymologists make the former the ancient, the latter a subsequent meaning. So Thom. Mag.: λογίους τοὺς πολυΐστορας οἱ ἀρχαῖοι Ἀττικίζοντες , ὡς καὶ Ἡρόδοτος · λογίους δὲ τοὺς διαλεκτικοὺς οἱ ὕστερον . The latter meaning is most appropriate here, both because the peculiar kind of learning implied by λόγιος [acquaintance with stories and legends] would not be likely to be predicated of Apollos, and because the subsequent words, δυνατὸς ἐν τ . γραφαῖς , sufficiently indicate his <em> learning</em> , and in what it lay.
