<p><strong> 2. </strong> <strong> ἦχ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὥσπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> φερ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πνοῆς βιαίας</strong> ] could not be better rendered than in E. V., <strong> a sound at of a rushing mighty wind</strong> . The distinction between πνοῆς and πνεύματος , on which De Wette insists, can hardly be expressed in our language. It is possible that Luke may have used πνοῆς to avoid the concurrence of πνεύματος βιαίου and πνεύματος ἁγίου . It doubtless has its especial propriety; it is the <em> breathing</em> or <em> blowing</em> which we hear: it was the sound as of a violent blowing, borne onward, which accompanied the descent of the Holy Spirit. To treat this as a natural phænomenon, even supposing that phænomenon <em> miraculously produced</em> , as the earthquake at the crucifixion, is contrary to the text, which does not describe it as ἦχος φερομένης πν . βι ., but ἦχος <strong> ὥσπερ</strong> φ . πν . βι . It was the <em> chosen vehicle</em> by which the Holy Spirit was <em> manifested to their sense of hearing, as by the tongues of fire to their sense of seeing</em> .

<p>‘ <strong> φέρεσθαι</strong> ad violentum quo venti moventur impetum notandum adhiberi solet. Æl. Hist. An. vii. 24, ἐπειδὰν τὸ πνεῦμα βίαιον ἐκφέρηται : Diog. Laërt. x. 25. 104, διὰ τοῦ πνεύματος πολλοῦ φερομένου .’ Kypke.

<p><strong> οἶκον</strong> ] Certainly Luke would not have used this word of a <em> chamber in the Temple</em> , or of <em> the Temple itself</em> , without further explanation. Our Lord, it is true, calls the Temple ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:38">Matthew 23:38</span> , and Josephus informs us that Solomon’s Temple was furnished τριάκοντα βραχέσιν οἴκοις , and again ἐπῳκοδόμηντο δὲ τούτοις ἄνωθεν ἕτεροι οἶκοι : but to suppose either usage here, seems to me very far-fetched and unnatural.</p>
