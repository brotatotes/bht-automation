<p><strong> 22.</strong> ] <strong> ἄνδρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἰσρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> binds all the hearers in <em> one term</em> , and that one reminds them of their covenant relation with God: compare πᾶς οἶκος Ἰσραήλ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36">Acts 2:36</span> .

<p><strong> τὸν Ναζωραῖον</strong> ] Not emphatically used by way of contrast to what follows, as Beza, Wetst., &amp;c. but only as the ordinary appellation of Jesus by the Jews, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:5">John 18:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:7">John 18:7</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:8">Acts 22:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:9">Acts 26:9</span> .

<p><strong> ἀπό</strong> , not <em> for</em> ὑπό , here or any where else (see Winer, edn. 6, § 47, b): but signifying the <em> source whence</em> , not merely the <em> agency by which</em> , the deed has place. See reff., and especially <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:13">James 1:13</span> .

<p><strong> ἀποδεδειγμένον</strong> ] ‘demonstratum,’ more than ‘ <em> approved</em> ’ (E. V.): <strong> shewn to be</strong> that which He claimed to be. ἀποδεδ . must be taken with ἀπὸ τ . θεοῦ : not, as some have divided the words, ἄνδρ . ἀπὸ τ . θεοῦ , ἀποδ . κ . τ . λ .: Gal 1:1 is no justification of this, for there ἀπό refers to ἀπόστολος , and certainly Peter would never have barely thus named our Lord ‘a man from God.’ The whole connexion of the passage would besides be broken by this rendering: that connexion being, that the Man Jesus of Nazareth was <em> by God</em> demonstrated, <em> by God</em> wrought in among you, <em> by God’s counsel</em> delivered to death, <em> by God</em> raised up (which raising up is argued on till <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:32">Acts 2:32</span> , then taken up again), <em> by God</em> ( Act 2:36 ), finally, made Lord and Christ. This was the process of argument then with the Jews, proceeding on the identity of a man whom they had seen and known, and then mounting up from His works and His death and His resurrection, to <em> His glorification</em> , all THE PURPOSE AND DOING OF GOD. But if His <em> divine origin</em> , or even His divine <em> mission</em> , be stated at the outset, we <em> break this climacterical sequence</em> , and lose the power of the argument. The ἀποδεδειγμένον ( εἶναι ) ἀπὸ θεοῦ of Dr. Bloomfield is of course worse still.

This side of the subject is here especially dwelt on in argument with these Jews, to exhibit (see above) the whole course of Jesus of Nazareth, as the <em> ordinance and doing of</em> THE GOD OF ISRAEL.</p>
