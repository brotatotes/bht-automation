<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] <strong> βουλή</strong> and <strong> πρόγνωσις</strong> are not the same: the former designates the <strong> counsel</strong> of God His Eternal Plan, by which He has arranged (cf. ὡρισμένῃ ) all things; the latter, the <strong> omniscience</strong> , by which every part of this plan is foreseen and unforgotten by Him.

<p><strong> ἔκδοτον</strong> ] <em> by whom</em> , is not said, but was supplied by the hearers. τῇ ὡρισμ . &amp;c. are not to be joined to ἔκδοτον as agents the dative is that of <em> accordance</em> and <em> appointment</em> , not of agency: see Winer, edn. 6, § 31. 6, b, and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:1">Acts 15:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:21">2 Peter 1:21</span> .

<p>Peter lays the charge on the multitude, because they <em> abetted their rulers</em> , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:17">Acts 3:17</span> , where this is fully expressed: not for the far-fetched reason given by Olshausen, that ‘all mankind were in fact guilty of the death of Jesus:’ in which case, as Meyer well observes (and the note in Olsh.’s last edn. ii. p. 666, does not answer this), Peter must have said ‘ <em> we</em> ,’ not <em> ‘you</em> .’</p>
