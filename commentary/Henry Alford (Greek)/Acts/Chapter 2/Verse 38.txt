<p><strong> 38.</strong> ] <strong> μετανοήσατε</strong> , not, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:17">Matthew 4:17</span> , μετανοεῖτε . The aorist denotes <em> speed</em> , a definite, sudden act: the present, a habit, more gradual, as that first moral and legal change would necessarily be. The word imports <em> change of mind</em> ; here, change from thinking Jesus an impostor, and scorning Him as one crucified, to being baptized in His name, and looking to Him for remission of sins, and the gift of the Spirit.

<p>The miserable absurdity of rendering μεταν ., or ‘pœnitentiam agite,’ by ‘ <em> do penance</em> ,’ or understanding it as referring to a <em> course of external rites</em> , is well exposed by this passage in which the <em> internal change of heart and purpose</em> is insisted on, to be testified by admission into the number of Christ’s followers. See Calvin’s note.

<p><strong> βαπτισθήτω</strong> ] Here, on the day of Pentecost, we have the first mention and administration of CHRISTIAN BAPTISM. Before, there had been the <em> baptism of repentance</em> for the remission of sins, by John, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:3">Luke 3:3</span> ; but now we have the important addition ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόμ . Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ , <strong> on the Name</strong> i.e. <em> on the confession</em> of that which the Name implies, and <em> into the benefits and blessings</em> which the Name implies. The Apostles and first believers were <em> not thus baptized</em> , because, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:5">Acts 1:5</span> , they had received the BAPTISM BY THE HOLY GHOST, the <em> thing signified</em> , which superseded that by water, the <em> outward and visible sign</em> .
	</p>
<p>The <em> result</em> of the baptism to which he here exhorts them, preceded by repentance and accompanied by faith in the forgiveness of sins in Christ, would be, the <em> receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit</em> .</p>
