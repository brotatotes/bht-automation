<p><strong> 39.</strong> ] <strong> τοῖς τέκνοις ὑμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , viz. as included in the prophecy cited <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span> , <strong> your little ones:</strong> not, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:32">Acts 13:32</span> , ‘ <em> your descendants</em> ,’ which would be understood by any Jew to be <em> necessarily implied</em> . [Thus we have a providential recognition of Infant Baptism at the very founding of the Christian Church.]

<p><strong> πᾶσιν τοῖς εἰς μακράν</strong> , <strong> the Gentiles;</strong> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:13">Ephesians 2:13</span> . There is no difficulty whatever in this interpretation. The Apostles <em> always expected</em> the conversion of the Gentiles, as did every pious Jew who believed in the Scriptures. It was their conversion <em> as Gentiles</em> , which was yet to be revealed to Peter. It is surprising to see such Commentators as Dr. Burton and Meyer finding a difficulty where all is so plain. The very expression, ὅσους ἂν προσκαλέσηται ὁ θεὸς ἡμ ., shews in what sense Peter understood τοῖς εἰς μακρ .; not <em> all</em> , but as many as the Lord our God <strong> προσ</strong> καλ ., shall summon to <em> approach to Him, bring near</em> , which, <em> in his present understanding of the words</em> , must import <em> by becoming one of the chosen people, and conforming to their legal observances</em> .</p>
