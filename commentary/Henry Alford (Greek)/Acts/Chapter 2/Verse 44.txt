<p><strong> 44</strong> .] If it surprise us that so large a number should be continually assembled together (for such is certainly the sense, not ‘fraterno amore conjunctos,’ as Calvin) we must remember that a large portion of the <em> three thousand</em> were persons who had come up to Jerusalem for the feast, and would by this time have returned to their homes.

<p><strong> εἶχον ἅπαντα κοινά</strong> ] <strong> they had all things</strong> (in) <strong> common</strong> , i.e. <em> no individual property, but one common stock</em> : see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:32">Acts 4:32</span> . That this was <em> literally the case</em> with the infant church at Jerusalem, is too plainly asserted in these passages to admit of a doubt. Some have supposed the expressions to indicate merely a partial community of goods: ‘non omnia vendiderunt, sed partem bonorum, quæ sine magno incommodo carere poterant,’ Wetstein; contrary to the express assertion of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:32">Acts 4:32</span> . In order, however, rightly to understand this <em> community</em> , we may remark: (1) <em> It is only found in the Church at Jerusalem</em> . No trace of its existence is discoverable any where else: on the contrary, St. Paul speaks [constantly] of the rich and the poor, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:17">1 Timothy 6:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:2">1 Corinthians 16:2</span> [ Gal 2:10 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:13-15">2 Corinthians 8:13-15</span> ; 2Co 9:6-7 ]: also St. James, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1-5">James 2:1-5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:13">James 4:13</span> . And from the practice having at first prevailed at Jerusalem, we may [partly] perhaps explain the great and constant poverty of that church, Rom 15:25-26 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:1-3">1 Corinthians 16:1-3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span> ; also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:17">Acts 24:17</span> .

<p>The non-establishment of this <em> community</em> elsewhere may have arisen from the inconveniences which were found to attend it in Jerusalem: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span> . (2) This community of goods was not, even in Jerusalem, enforced by <em> rule</em> , as is evident from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:4">Acts 5:4</span> [ Act 12:12 ], but, originating in free-will, became perhaps an understood custom, still however in the power of any individual not to comply with. (3) It was not (as Grotius and Heinrichs thought) <em> borrowed from the Essenes</em> (see Jos. B. J. ii. 8. 3), with whom the Apostles, who certainly must have sanctioned this community, do not appear historically to have had any connexion. But (4) it is much more probabl that it arose from a <em> continuation</em> , and application to the now increased number of disciples, <em> of the community in which our Lord and His Apostles had lived</em> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:6">John 12:6</span> ; Joh 13:29 ) <em> before</em> . (The substance of this note is derived from Meyer, in loc.)

<p>The practice probably did not long continue even at Jerusalem: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:26">Romans 15:26</span> , note.</p>
