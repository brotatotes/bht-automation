Act 20:32 ) in Mysia or Troas, opposite to Lesbos, twenty-four Roman miles (Peutinger Table) from Troas, built on a high cliff above the sea, with a descent so precipitous as to have prompted a pun of Stratonicus, the musician (see Athen [104] viii., p. 352), on a line of Homer, Il. ζ . 143, Ἄσσον ἴθ ʼ, ὥς κεν θᾶσσον ὀλέθρου πείραθ ʼ ἵκηαι . Strab. xiii. 1, p. 126, Tauchn.
