<p><strong> 31.</strong> ] <strong> μνημ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὅτι</strong> is only (retf.) used by Paul.

<p><strong> νύκτα κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡμέραν</strong> ] This expression is remarkable: we have it (see reff.) in Mark, but Luke always uses the genitive, except in the speeches of Paul: and so Paul himself, except as in reff.

<p><strong> νουθετῶν</strong> (reff.) is used only by Paul.

<p>On the <em> three years</em> spoken of in this verse, see note, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:10">Acts 19:10</span> . We may just remark here (1) that this passage being precise and definite, must be the master key to those others (as in ch. 19) which give wide and indefinite notes of time: and (2) that it seems at first sight to preclude the idea of a journey (as some think) to Crete and Corinth having taken place during this period. But this apparent inference may require modifying by other circumstances: cf. Prolegg. to 1 Cor. § <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span> .</p>
