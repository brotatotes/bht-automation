<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] Two renderings are given to the latter clause of this verse: (1) making Μνάσωνι , &amp;c. depend on ἄγοντες , and agreeing by attr. with ᾧ , as E. V., ‘ <em> and brought with them one Mnason, … with whom we should lodge</em> ’ (so Beza, Calvin, Wolf, Schött., &amp;c.): and (2) resolving the attraction into ἄγοντες παρὰ Μνάσωνα , παρ ʼ ᾧ ξ . ‘ <em> bringing us to Mnason,’ &amp;c.</em> (So Grot., Valcknaer, Bengel, De Wette, Meyer, al.) Both are legitimate: and it is difficult to choose between them. The probability of Mnason being a resident at Jerusalem, and of the Cæsarean brethren going to introduce the company to him, seems to favour the <em> latter</em> : as also does the fact that Luke much more frequently uses ἄγω with a person <em> followed by a preposition</em> than absolutely. Of Mnason nothing further is known.

<p><strong> ἀρχαίῳ</strong> probably implies that he had been a disciple ἐξ ἀρχῆς , and had accompanied our Lord during His ministry. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:15">Acts 11:15</span> , where the term ἐξ ἀρχῆς is applied to the time of the Pentecostal effusion of the Spirit.</p>
