<p><strong> 22. </strong> <strong> πάντως δ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> συνελθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Not, as E. V., Calv., Grot., Calov., ‘ <em> the multitude must needs come together</em> ,’ i.e. there must be a meeting of the whole church ( τὸ πλῆθος , ch. Act 2:6 ): but <strong> a multitude</strong> (of these Judaizers) <strong> will certainly come together</strong> : ‘ <em> they will meet and discuss your proceeding in a hostile manner</em> .’</p>
