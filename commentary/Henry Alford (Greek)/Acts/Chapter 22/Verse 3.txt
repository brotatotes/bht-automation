<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] De Wette and others would place the comma after ταύτῃ , so to make the two clauses, beginning with γέγ . and ἀνατ ., exactly correspond. But (not to insist, with Meyer, on the reason that a new circumstance is introduced with each participle) it is surely better, as the rule of the sentence seems to be to place the participles <em> before</em> the words which qualify them, to take ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ παρὰ τ . π .

<p>Some of the older Commentators make τοῦ πατρῴου νόμου governed by πεπαιδ ., and take κατὰ ἀκρίβ . adverbially: which would give a very vapid sense, the accuracy and carefulness of his education having been already implied in παρὰ τ . π . Γαμαλιήλ .
