<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] By these few words, the Lord assured him (1) of a <em> safe issue from his present troubles</em> ; (2) of an <em> accomplishment of his intention of visiting Rome</em> ; (3) of the certainty that however he might be sent thither, he should <em> preach the gospel, and bear testimony there</em> . So that they upheld and comforted him (1) in the <em> uncertainty of his life from the Jews</em> : (2) in the <em> uncertainty of his liberation from prison at Cæsarea</em> : (3) in the <em> uncertainty of his surviving the storm in the Mediterranean</em> : (4) in the <em> uncertainty of his fate on arriving at Rome</em> . So may one crumb of divine grace and help be multiplied to feed five thousand wants and anxieties.
