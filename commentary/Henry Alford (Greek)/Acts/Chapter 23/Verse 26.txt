<p><strong> 26. </strong> <strong> κρατίστῳ</strong> ] See ref. Luke.

<p>This letter seems to be given (translated from the Latin) <em> as written</em> , not merely according to its general import (see the false statement in Act 23:27 ): <em> from what source</em> , is impossible to say, but it may be imagined that the contents transpired through some officers at Jerusalem or at Cæsarea friendly to Paul.

<p>Such letters were called <em> elogia</em> : so Modestin. Dig. lib. 49, tit. 16, leg. 3 (Facciolati): ‘Desertorem auditum ad suum ducem cum elogio præses mittet,’ ‘with an abstract of the articles brought against him.’</p>
