<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] Surely no defence of Paul for adopting this course is required, but all admiration is due to his skill and presence of mind. Nor need we hesitate to regard such skill as the fulfilment of the promise, that in such an hour, the Spirit of wisdom should suggest words to the accused, which the accuser should not be able to gainsay. All prospect of a fair trial was hopeless: he well knew from past and present experience, that personal odium would bias his judges, and violence prevail over justice: he therefore (Neand.) uses, in the cause of Truth, the maxim so often perverted to the cause of falsehood, ‘divide et impera.’ In <em> one tenet</em> above all others, did the religion of Jesus Christ and the belief of the Pharisees coincide that of <em> the resurrection of the dead</em> . That <em> they</em> looked for this resurrection by right of being the seed of Abraham, and denied it to all others, whereas <em> he</em> looked for it through Jesus whom they hated, in whom <em> all</em> should be made alive who had died in Adam, this was <em> nothing to the present point</em> : the belief was common in the truest sense it was the <em> hope of Israel</em> in the truest sense does Paul use and bring it forward to confound the adversaries of Christ. At the same time (De W.) by this strong assertion of his Pharisaic standing and extraction, he was further still vindicating himself from the charge against him.
