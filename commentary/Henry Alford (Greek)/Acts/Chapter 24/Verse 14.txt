<p><strong> οὕτως</strong> = κατὰ ταύτην . Notice in the words <strong> πατρώῳ θεῷ</strong> the skill of Paul. The term was one well known to the Greeks and Romans, and which would carry with it its own justification. “Invisum quippe erat gentibus, nominatim etiam Romanis, si quis se peregrinis aut diis aut deorum cultibus addiceret; præterea Judæis per multa imperatorum et magistratuum decreta et senatus consulta sancita erat potestas, Deum patrium colendi, patriis ritibus et sacris utendi. Jos. Antt. xiv. 17; xvi. 4” (Kuinoel). In his address <em> to the Jews</em> (ch. Act 22:14 ) the similar expression ὁ θ . τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν , brings out more clearly those πατέρες , in whom Felix had no interest further than the identification of <em> Paul’s religion with that of his ancestors</em> required.

Then (if the words in brackets be omitted: and it is not easy to imagine that St. Luke wrote them) the dat. is used of the personal agents, the prophets. He avoids saying ‘ <em> by Moses</em> ,’ because the mention of <em> the law</em> would carry more weight.</p>
