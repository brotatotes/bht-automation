<p><strong> Πόρκιον φῆστον</strong> ] Festus appears to have succeeded Felix in the summer or autumn of the year 60 A.D.: but the question is one of much chronological difficulty. It is fully discussed in Wieseler, Chron. d. Apost.-g. pp. 91 99. He found the province (Jos. Antt. xx. 8. 10) wasted and harassed by bands of robbers and sicarii, and the people the prey of false prophets. He died, after being procurator a very short time, from one to two years. Josephus (B. J. ii. 14. 1) contrasts him, as a putter down of robbers, favourably with his successor Albinus.

<p><strong> χάριτα καταθέσθαι</strong> ] See reff. ‘Est locutio bene Græca, Demostheni quoque usitata et Xenophonti: quales locutiones non paucas habet Lucas, ubi non alios inducit loqueutes, sed ipse loquitur, et quidem de rebus ad religionem non pertinentibus.’ Grot. The reading χάριτα , brought into the text by the evidence of the best MSS., has apparently been a correction to suit the context, only <em> one</em> such act being spoken of. The plural would describe the <em> wish</em> of Felix to confer <em> obligations</em> on the Jews, who were sending to complain of him at Rome, and so win their favour.

<p><strong> δεδεμένον</strong> ] There was no <em> change</em> in the method of custody, see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:23">Acts 24:23</span> . He left him in the ‘ <em> custodia militaris</em> ’ in which he was.</p>
