<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] It seems more probable that the unusual word καταδίκη should have been changed to δίκην , especially as κατά precedes, than the converse. Luke never uses δίκη , except as <em> personified</em> , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:4">Acts 28:4</span> ; and in the only two places besides where it occurs in the N. T. (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:9">2 Thessalonians 1:9</span> ; Jud 1:7 ), it has the sense of <em> condemnation</em> or <em> punishment</em> ; and in neither place is there any various reading.</p>
