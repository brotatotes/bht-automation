<p><strong> 9.</strong> ] <strong> κριθῆναι</strong> , the aor., refers to the <em> one act</em> , of <em> deciding finally</em> concerning these charges. This not having been seen, the later MSS. have substituted κρίνεσθαι , which is more ‘ <em> going to law,’ ‘being involved</em> in a trial.’

<p>The question is asked of Paul as a Roman citizen, having a right to be tried by Roman law: and more is contained in it, than at first meets the eye. It <em> seems</em> to propose only a change of <em> place</em> ; but doubtless in the <strong> ἐκεῖ</strong> κριθῆναι was contained by implication a sentence pronounced by the Sanhedrim. <strong> ἐπ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἐμοῦ</strong> may mean no more than ἐπὶ σοῦ , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:2">Acts 26:2</span> , viz., that the procurator would <em> be present</em> and sanction the trial: so Grot., “visne a synedrio judicari me præsente?” Otherwise, a journey to Jerusalem would be superfluous. Festus may very probably have anticipated the rejection of this proposal by Paul, and have wished to make it appear that the obstacle in the way of Paul being tried by the Sanhedrim arose not from <em> him</em> , but from the prisoner himself.</p>
