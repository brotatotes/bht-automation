<p><strong> παθητός</strong> ] not, as Beza, ‘ <em> Christum fuisse passurum</em> ’ (so E. V., ‘ <em> should suffer</em> ’): but as Vulg., ‘ <em> si passibilis Christus</em> .’ Paul does not refer to the prophetic announcement, or the historical reality, of the <em> fact</em> of Christ’s suffering, but to the <em> idea</em> of the Messiah as <em> passible</em> and suffering being in accordance with the testimony of the prophets. That the fact of His having suffered on the cross was in the Apostle’s mind, can hardly be doubted: but that the words do not assert it, is evident from the change of construction in the next clause, where the fact of the bringing life and immortality to light by the resurrection is spoken of, εἰ παθητὸς ὁ χρ ., <strong> εἰ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> μέλλει καταγγέλλειν</strong> . In Justin Martyr, Trypho c. 89, p. 187, the following words are put into the month of Trypho the Jew: παθητὸν τὸν χριστόν , ὅτι αἱ γραφαί κηρύσσουσι , φανερόν ἐστι . See also the same, Trypho c. 36, p. 133, and c. 76, p. 173.
