<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] The words ταῦτα ἀπολογουμένον must refer, on account of the present part., to the Iast words spoken by Paul: but it is not necessary to suppose that <em> these only</em> produced the effect described on Festus. Mr. Humphry remarks, “Festus was probably not so well acquainted as his predecessor (ch. Act 24:10 ) with the character of the nation over which he had recently been called to preside. Hence he avails himself of Agrippa’s assistance ( Act 25:26 ). Hence also he is unable to comprehend the earnestness of St. Paul, so unlike the indifference with which religious and moral subjects were regarded by the upper classes at Rome. His self-love suggests to him, that one who presents such a contrast to his own apathy, must be mad: the convenient hypothesis that much learning had produced this result, may have occurred to him on hearing Paul quote prophecies in proof of his assertions.”

<p><strong> μαίνῃ</strong> ] <strong> Thou art mad</strong> , not merely, ‘ <em> thou ravest</em> ,’ nor ‘ <em> thou art an enthusiast</em> :’ nor are the words spoken in jest (Olsh.), but in earnest ( θυμοῦ ἦν κ . ὀργῆς ἡ φωνή , Chrys.). Festus finds himself by this speech of Paul yet more bewildered than before (De W.).

<p><strong> τὰ πολλὰ γράμμ</strong> .] Meyer understands Festus to allude to the many rolls which Paul had with him in his imprisonment (we might compare τὰ βιβλία , μάλιστα τὰς μεμβράνας of 2Ti 4:13 ) and studied (so also Heinrichs and Kuinoel), but the ordinary interpretation, <strong> thy much learning</strong> , seems more natural, and so De W.
