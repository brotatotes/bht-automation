<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] <strong> ἀλήθεια</strong> may be spoken <em> warmly</em> and <em> enthusiastically</em> , but <em> cannot be predicated of a madman’s words</em> : <strong> σωφροσύνη</strong> ) is directly opposed to μανία . So Xen. Mem. i. 16, recounting the subjects of Socrates’ discourses, τί δίκαιον , τί ἄδικον · τί σωφροσύνη , τί μανία · τί ἀνδρία , τί δειλία . The expression ἀληθείας &amp;c. ῥήματα , though of course in sense = ῥήματα ἀληθῆ , &amp;c., yet has a distinctive force of its own, and is never to be confounded with, or supposed to be put by a Hebraism for the other. Such forms occur in classic as well as Hellenistic writers, and indeed in all languages: the idea expressed by them being, <em> the derivation of the quality predicated, from its source:</em> so here, <strong> words</strong> (not merely true and sober, but) <strong> of truth and soberness</strong> , springing from, and indicative of, subjective truth and soberness.</p>
