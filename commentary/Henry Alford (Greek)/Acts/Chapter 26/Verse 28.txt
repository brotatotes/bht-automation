<p><strong> 28. </strong> <strong> ἐν ὀλίγῳ</strong> ] These words of Agrippa have been very variously explained. (1) The rendering ‘ <em> propemodum</em> ,’ ‘ <em> parum abest, quin</em> ,’ (‘ <em> almost</em> ,’ E. V.,) adopted by Chrys., Beza, Grot., Valla, Luther, Piscator, Calov., &amp;c. is inadmissible, for want of any example of ἐν ὀλίγῳ having this meaning, which would require ὀλίγου ( ὀλίγου μ ʼ ἀπωλέσας , Aristoph. Vesp. 829, and al.), or ὀλίγου δεῖ , or παρ ʼ ὀλίγον . (2) Calvin, Kuinoel, Schöttg., Olsh., Neander, take it for ἐν ὀλίγῳ χρόνῳ , which certainly is allowable, but does not correspond to μεγάλῳ below, nor, as I believe, does it come up to the <em> general</em> sense of the expression. (3) The phrase ἐν ὀλίγῳ occurs in Greek writers with various nouns understood according to the nature of the case, and sometimes it will bear any of several supplements with equal propriety. Thus in Demosth. p. 33. 18, ῥάδιον εἰς ταὐτὸ πάνθ ʼ ὅσα βούλεταί τις ἀθροίσαντα ἐν ὀλίγῳ , where Schaefer in his Index Græcitatis says, scil. χρόνῳ , aut χώρῳ , aut λόγῳ , aut πόνῳ . So also here we may understand λόγῳ or πόνῳ (or χρόνῳ ?) or still better as it seems to me, <em> leave the ellipsis unsupplied</em> (see Eph 3:3 ). We have a word in English which exactly expresses it, one which has fallen into disuse, but has no equivalent; <strong> lightly:</strong> i.e. with little pains, few words, small hesitation. Then next as to the <em> reading</em> , I have followed the most ancient MSS., in editing <strong> ποιῆσαι</strong> and not γενέσθαι . This being so, we have to choose between πείθεις of [152] [153] and πείθῃ of [154] . It is almost impossible to give any assignable meaning to the former; and I suspect it has come in by a confusion of the two readings. Whereas πείθῃ seems to take up the πείθομαι of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:26">Acts 26:26</span> . The received reading has probably found its way in from first imagining that πειθ - had to do with <em> Paul’s persuading Agrippa</em> , and then the ποιῆσαι having no sense, became conformed to the γενέσθαι in the Apostle’s speech below. And now, as to the <em> sense of Agrippa’s saying</em> . In determining this, enough attention has not been paid to two points: (1) the <em> present tense</em> , πείθῃ , <strong> thou art persuading</strong> thyself, art imagining; and (2) the use, <em> in the mouth of a Jew</em> , and <em> that Jew a king</em> , of the <em> Gentile and offensive appellation</em> χριστιανός . To my mind, the <em> first</em> of these considerations decides that Agrippa is characterizing <em> no effect on himself</em> , but <em> what Paul was</em> fancying in his mind, reckoning the πείθομαι which he had expressed above: the <em> second</em> , that he speaks of something <em> not</em> that he is <em> likely to become</em> , but that <em> contrasts strangely with his present worldly position and intentions</em> . I would therefore render the words thus: <strong> Lightly</strong> (with small trouble) <strong> art thou persuading thyself that thou canst make me a Christian:</strong> and understand them, in connexion with Paul’s having attempted to make Agrippa a witness on his side, ‘ <em> l am not so easily to be made a Christian of, as thou supposest</em> .’ Most of the ancient Commentators (especially as reading πείθεις ) take the words as implying some effect on Agrippa’s mind, and as spoken in earnest: but this I think is hardly possible, philologically or exegetically. I may add that the emphatic position of both <strong> ἐν ὀλίγῳ</strong> and <strong> χριστιανόν</strong> , before their respective verbs, strongly confirms the view taken above. I must again caution the reader against the mistake committed by Wordsworth, in supposing the enclitic με to be emphatic, which it cannot be, ἐμέ being required in such a case. Indeed, a more insignificant position than it here holds, next to the most emphatic word of the sentence, cannot be conceived.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [152] The CODEX VATICANUS, No. 1209 in the Vatican Library at Rome; and proved, by the old catalogues, to have been there from the foundation of the library in the 16th century. It was apparently, from internal evidence, copied in Egypt. It is on vellum, and contains the Old and New Testaments. In the latter, it is deficient from Heb 9:14 to the end of the Epistle; it does not contain the Epistles to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon; nor the Apocalypse. An edition of this celebrated codex, undertaken as long ago as 1828 by Cardinal Angelo Mai, has since his death been published at Rome. The defects of this edition are such, that it can hardly be ranked higher in usefulness than a tolerably complete collation, entirely untrustworthy in those places where it differs from former collations in representing the MS. as <em> agreeing with</em> the received text. An 8vo edition of the N.T. portion, newly revised by Vercellone, was published at Rome in 1859 (referred to as ‘Verc’): and of course superseded the English reprint of the 1st edition. Even in this 2nd edition there were imperfections which rendered it necessary to have recourse to the MS. itself, and to the partial collations made in former times. These are (1) that of Bartolocci (under the name of Giulio de St. Anastasia), once librarian at the Vatican, made in 1669, and preserved in manuscript in the Imperial Library (MSS. Gr. Suppl. 53) at Paris (referred to as ‘Blc’); (2) that of Birch (‘Bch’), published in various readings to the Acts and Epistles, Copenhagen, 1798, Apocalypse, 1800, Gospels, 1801; (3) that made for the great Bentley (‘Btly’), by the Abbate Mico, published in Ford’s Appendix to Woide’s edition of the Codex Alexandrinus, 1799 (it was made on the margin of a copy of Cephalæus’ Greek Testament, Argentorati, 1524, still amongst Bentley’s books in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge); (4) notes of alterations by the original scribe and other correctors. These notes were procured for Bentley by the Abbé de Stosch, and were till lately supposed to be lost. They were made by the Abbate Rulotta (‘Rl’), and are preserved amongst Bentley’s papers in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge (B. 17. 20) 1 . The Codex has been occasionally consulted for the verification of certain readings by Tregelles, Tischendorf, and others. A list of readings examined at Rome by the present editor (Feb. 1861), and by the Rev. E. C. Cure, Fellow of Merton College, Oxford (April 1862), will be found at the end of these prolegomena. A description, with an engraving from a photograph of a portion of a page, is given in Burgon’s “Letters from Rome,” London 1861. This most important MS. was probably written in the <em> fourth century</em> (Hug, Tischendorf, al.).

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [153] The CODEX SINAITICUS. Procured by Tischendorf, in 1859, from the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai. The Codex Frederico-Augustanus (now at Leipsic), obtained in 1844 from the same monastery, is a portion of the same copy of the Greek Bible, the 148 leaves of which, containing the entire New Testament, the Ep. of Barnabas, parts of Hermas, and 199 more leaves of the Septuagint, have now been edited by the discoverer. A magnificent edition prepared at the expense of the Emperor of Russia appeared in January, 1863, and a smaller edition containing the N.T. &amp;c., has been published by Dr. Tischendorf. The MS. has four columns on a page, and has been altered by several different correctors, one or more of whom Tischendorf considers to have lived in the sixth century. The work of the original scribe has been examined, not only by Tischendorf, but by Tregelles and other competent judges, and is by them assigned to the <em> fourth</em> <em> century</em> . The internal character of the text agrees with the external, as the student may judge for himself from the readings given in the digest. The principal correctors as distinguished by Tischendorf are: A, of the same age with the MS. itself, probably the corrector who revised the book, before it left the hands of the scribe, denoted therefore by us א -corr 1 ; B (cited as א 2 ), who in the first page of Matt. began inserting breathings, accents, &amp;c., but did not carry out his design, and touched only a few later passages; C a (cited as א 3a ) has corrected very largely throughout the book. Wherever in our digest a reading is cited as found in א 1 , it is to be understood, if no further statement is given, that C a altered it to that which is found in our text; C b (cited as א 3b ) lived about the same time as C a , i.e. some centuries later than the original scribe. These are all that we need notice here 6 .

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [154] The MS. referred to by this symbol is that commonly called the Alexandrine, or CODEX ALEXANDRINUS. It once belonged to Cyrillus Lucaris, patriarch of Alexandria and then of Constantinople, who in the year 1628 presented it to our King Charles I. It is now in the British Museum. It is on parchment in four volumes, of which three contain the Old, and one the New Testament, with the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians. This fourth volume is exhibited open in a glass case. It will be seen by the letters in the inner margin of this edition, that the first 24 chapters of Matthew are wanting in it, its first leaf commencing ὁ νυμφίος , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span> : as also the leaves containing ἵνα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:50">John 6:50</span> , to καὶ σύ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:52">John 8:52</span> . It is generally agreed that it was written at Alexandria; it does not, however, <em> in the Gospels</em> , represent that commonly known as the Alexandrine text, but approaches much more nearly to the Constantinopolitan, or generally received text. The New Testament, according to its text, was edited, in uncial types cast to imitate those of the MS., by Woide, London, 1786, the Old Testament by Baber, London, 1819: and its N.T. text has now been edited in common type by Mr. B. H. Cowper, London, 1861. The date of this MS. has been variously assigned, but it is now pretty generally agreed to be the <em> fifth century</em> .</p>
