<p><strong> 7. </strong> <strong> τὸ δωδεκάφυλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The Jews in Judæa and those of the dispersion also. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span> . There was a difference between Paul and the Jews, which lies beneath the surface of this verse, but is yet not brought out: <em> he</em> had already arrived at the accomplishment of this hope, to which <em> they</em> , with all their sacrifices and zeal, were as yet only earnestly <em> tending</em> , having it yet in the future only (so <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:2">Romans 10:2</span> ; ζῆλον θεοῦ ἔχουσιν , ἀλλ ʼ οὐ κατ ʼ ἐπίγνωσιν ). It was <em> concerning this hope</em> (in what sense appears not yet) that he was accused by the Jews.
