<p><strong> 15 18.</strong> ] There can be no question that Paul here <em> condenses into one, various sayings of our Lord to him at different times, in visions</em> , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:18-21">Acts 22:18-21</span> ; and <em> by Ananias</em> , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span> ; see also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:15-16">Acts 22:15-16</span> . Nor can this, on the strictest view, be considered any deviation from truth. It is what all must more or less do who are abridging a narrative, or giving the general sense of things said at various times. There were reasons for its being minute and particular in the <em> details of his conversion</em> ; that once related, the commission which he thereupon received is not followed into <em> its</em> details, but <em> summed up as committed to him by the Lord himself</em> . It would be not only irreverent, but false, to imagine that he put <em> his own thoughts</em> into the mouth of our Lord; but I do not see, with Stier, the necessity of maintaining that all these words were actually <em> spoken</em> to him <em> at some time</em> by the Lord. The message delivered by Ananias certainly furnished some of them; and the unmistakeable utterings of God’s Spirit ( τὸ πνεῦμα Ἰησοῦ , ch. Act 16:7 ) which supernaturally led him, may have furnished more, all within the limits of truth.</p>
