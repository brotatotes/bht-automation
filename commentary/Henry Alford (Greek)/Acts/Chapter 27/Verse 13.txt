<p><strong> 13.</strong> <strong> ὑποπνεύσαντος</strong> ] as E. V., <strong> softly blowing</strong> , compare ὑπομειδιάω . The S. wind was favourable for them in sailing from Fair Havens to Phœnice.

<p><strong> δόξ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> προθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κεκρατ</strong> .] <strong> imagining that they had</strong> (as good as) <strong> accomplished their purpose</strong> ; i.e. that it would now be a very easy matter to reach Phœnice.

<p><strong> ἄραντες</strong> “may be translated either ‘ <em> weighed</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> set sail</em> ;’ for ancient authors supply sometimes τὰς ἀγκύρας , and sometimes τὰ ἱστία .… Julius Pollux, however, like St. Luke, supplies neither, which is certainly the most nautical way of expressing it: he says, αἴροντες ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς , lib. i. 103.” Smith, p. 55.

<p><strong> ἆσσον παρ</strong> .] They crept close along the land till they passed Cape Matala. “A ship which could not lie nearer to the wind than seven points, would just weather that point which bears W. by S. from the entrance of Fair Havens. We see therefore the propriety of the expression <strong> ἆσσον</strong> παρ ., ‘they sailed <em> close</em> by Crete,’ which the author uses to describe the first part of their passage.” Smith, p. 56.

<p>The Vulg. has: ‘quum sustulissent de Asson,’ connecting ἄραντες with Ἄσσον , and understanding the latter as the name of a Cretan town. There is an Asus mentioned by Pliny (iv. 12), but it is ‘in Mediterraneo,’ not on the coast, and the construction would be inadmissible. Erasmus, Luther, &amp;c., have taken Ἄσσον as the accusative of direction, ‘when they had weighed for Assus.’ But besides the <em> local</em> objection, this construction also would be most harsh, as ἄραντες does not indicate the progress of their voyage, but only the setting out. Heinsius took ἄραντες = ἀναφανέντες , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:3">Acts 21:3</span> , ‘postquam Asos attollere se visa est’ (Meyer). But there can be little doubt that all of these are mistakes, and that ἆσσον is the adverb.</p>
