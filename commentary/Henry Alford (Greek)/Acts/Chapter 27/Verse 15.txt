<p><strong> ἀντοφθαλμεῖν</strong> ] It is hardly likely that this term, which is used so naturally and constantly of men <em> facing an enemy</em> (Polyb. i. 17. 3, and eight times more), and also metaphorically of <em> resisting temptation</em> ( μὴ δύνασθαι τοῖς χρήμασιν ἀντοφθαλμεῖν , Polyb. xxviii. 17. 18), should have been originally a naval term, derived from the practice of painting <em> eyes</em> on either side of the beaks of ships. More probably the expression was transferred to a ship from its usage in common life.
