<p><strong> 18. </strong> <strong> ἐκβολ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐποι</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] “The technical terms for taking cargo out of a ship, given by Julius Pollux, are ἐκθέσθαι , ἀποφορτίσασθαι , κουφίσαι τὴν ναῦν , ἐπελάφρυναι , ἐκβολὴν ποιήσασθαι τῶν φορτίων . So that both here, and afterwards in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:38">Acts 27:38</span> ( ἐκούφιζον τ . πλοῖον ), St. Luke uses appropriate technical phrases.” Smith, ib.

<p><em> Of what the freight consisted</em> , we have no intimation. Perhaps <em> not of wheat</em> , on account of the separate statement of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:38">Acts 27:38</span> . See ref.</p>
