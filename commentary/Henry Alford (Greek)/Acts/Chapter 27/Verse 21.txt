<p><strong> 21. </strong> <strong> ἀσιτίας</strong> ] “What caused the abstinence? A ship with nearly 300 people on board, on a voyage of some length, must have had more than a fortnight’s provisions (and see Act 27:38 ): and it is not enough to say with Kuinoel, ‘Continui labores et metus a periculis effecerant ut de cibo capiendo non cogitarent.’ ‘Much abstinence’ is one of the most frequent concomitants of heavy gales. The impossibility of cooking, or the destruction of provisions from leakage, are the principal causes which produce it.” Smith, p. 75: who quotes instances. But doubtless anxiety and mental distress had a considerable share in it.

<p><strong> κερδῆσαι</strong> ] ‘ <em> lucrifecisse</em> ,’ <strong> to have gained</strong> , not = <em> to have incurred</em> , but <strong> to have turned to your own account</strong> , i.e. ‘to have spared or avoided.’ So Jos. in ref. Aristotle, Magn. Mor. ii. 8, ᾧ κατὰ λόγον ζημίαν ἦν λαβεῖν , τὸν τοιοῦτον κερδάναντα εὐτυχῆ φάμεν (‘if he escape it’). Plin. vii. 40, ‘quam quidem injuriam lucrifecit ille.’ Cicero, Verr. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:12">Acts 1:12</span> , ‘lucretur indicia veteris infamiæ’ (‘may have them wiped out,’ and so make gain of them by getting rid of them).

<p><strong> ὕβριν</strong> ] See on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:10">Acts 27:10</span> . “The ὕβριν was to their persons, the ζημίαν to their property.” C. and H. ii. 410, note 4.</p>
