<p><strong> 29.</strong> <strong> ἐκ πρύμνης</strong> ] The usual way of anchoring in ancient, as well as in modern navigation, <em> was by the bow:</em> ‘anchora de prora jacitur.’ But under certain circumstances, they anchored <em> by the stern</em> ; and Mr. Smith has shewn from the figure of a ship which he has copied from the “Antichità de Ercolano,” that their ships had hawse-holes aft, to fit them for anchoring by the stern. “That a vessel <em> can</em> anchor by the stern is sufficiently proved (if proof were needed) by the history of some of our own naval engagements. So it was at the battle of the Nile. And when ships are about to attack batteries, it is customary for them to go into action prepared to anchor in this way. This was the case at Algiers. There is still greater interest in quoting the instance of the battle of Copenhagen, not only from the accounts we have of the precision with which each ship let go her anchors astern as she arrived nearly opposite her appointed station, but because it is said that Nelson stated after the battle that he had that morning been reading <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:0">Acts 27:0</span> .” C. and H. ii. p. 414. The passage from Cæsar, Bell. Civ. i. 25, ‘has quaternis ancoris ex quatuor angulis distinebat, ne fluctibus moverentur,’ is not to the purpose, for it was in that case a platform composed of two vessels, and anchored by the four corners. “The anchorage in St. Paul’s Bay is thus described in the Sailing Directions: ‘The harbour of St. Paul is open to E. and N.E. winds. It is, notwithstanding, safe for small ships; the ground, generally, being very good: and while the cables hold, there is no danger, <em> as the anchors will never start</em> .’ ” Smith, p. 92.

Hence also the ungenerous but natural attempt of the seamen to save their lives by taking to the boat. See Smith, p. 97.</p>
