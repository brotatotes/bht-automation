<p><strong> 4. </strong> <strong> ὑπεπλεύσαμεν</strong> ] <strong> sailed under</strong> , i.e. ‘ <em> in the lee of</em> ,’ Cyprus. “Ubi navis vento contrario cogitur a recto cursu decedere, ita ut tunc insula sit interposita inter ventum et navem, dicitur ferri <em> infra</em> insulam.” Wetst., who also says, “Si ventus favisset, alto se commisissent, et Cyprum ad dexteram partem reliquissent, ut <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:3">Acts 21:3</span> , nunc autem coguntur legere littus Ciliciæ, inter Cyprum et Asiam.” With this explanation Mr. Smith agrees; and there can hardly be a doubt that it is the right one. The κατὰ τὴν Ἀσίαν τόποι of Act 27:2 being to the <em> west</em> of Pamphylia (which was not in Asia, ch. Act 2:10 ), the direct course thither would have been <em> S. of Cyprus</em> ; but having the wind contrary, i.e. from the W. or N.W. (“the very wind which might have been expected in this part of the Mediterranean at this season (summer). Admiral de Saumarez writes, Aug. 19, 1798, ‘We have just gained sight of Cyprus, so invariably do the westerly winds prevail at this season.’ ” Smith, p. 27), they kept under shelter of Cyprus, i.e. between Cyprus and Cilicia; and so διαπλεύσαντες , <strong> having sailed the whole length of</strong> the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, they came to Myra. See the account of the reverse voyage, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:3">Acts 21:3</span> , where, the wind being nearly in the same quarter (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:1">Acts 27:1</span> , εὐθυδρομήσαντες εἰς τ . Κῶ ), the direct course was taken, and they left Cyprus at a distance (for so ἀναφ . seems to imply) on their left, in going to Tyre. On the διαπλεύσαντες , &amp;c., it may be well to quote (from Smith) the testimony of M. de Pagés, a French navigator, who, on his voyage from Syria to Marseilles, informs us that after making Cyprus, “the winds from the west, and consequently contrary, which prevail in these places during the summer, <em> forced us to run to the north</em> . We made for the coast of Caramania (Cilicia), in order to meet the northerly winds, <em> which we found accordingly</em> .”</p>
