<p><strong> 8. </strong> <strong> μόλις παρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] “After passing this point (Salmone), the difficulty they experienced in navigating to the westward along the coasts of Asia, would recur; but as the south side of Crete is also a weather shore with N.W. winds, they would be able to work up as far as Cape Matala. Here the land trends suddenly to the N., and the advantages of a weather shore cease, and their only resource was to make for a harbour. Now Fair Havens is the harbour nearest to Cape Matala, the farthest point to which an ancient ship could have attained with N.W.-ly winds”. Smith, ib.

<p><strong> παραλεγ</strong> . does not, as Servius on Æn. iii. 127 supposes, imply that the ship was <em> towed</em> (“funem legendo, i.e. colligendo, aspera loca prætereunt”), but, as Meyer explains it, that, the places on the coast being touched (or perhaps, rather, <em> appearing</em> ) one after another, are, as it were, <em> gathered up</em> by the navigators.
	</p>
<p>Mr. Smith (p. 42) exposes the mistake of Eustathius (adopted by Valpy, from Dr. Falconer), by which the ship taking the <em> S. coast of Crete</em> is attempted to be explained: viz. δυσλίμενος ἡ Κρήτη πρὸς τὴν βόῤῥαν : whereas there are, in fact, excellent harbours on the N. side of Crete, Souda and Spina Longa.

<p><strong> Καλοὺς Λιμένας</strong> ] The situation of this anchorage was ascertained by Pococke, from the fact of the name still remaining. “In searching after Lebena farther to the west, I found out a place which I thought to be of greater consequence, because mentioned in Holy Scripture, and also honoured by the presence of St. Paul, that is, ‘the Fair Havens, near unto the city of Lasea;’ for there is another small bay about two leagues to the E. of Matala, which is now called by the Greeks good or fair havens ( λιμέονες καλούς ):” (Calolimounias of Mr. Brown’s letter: see excursus as above.) Travels in the East, ii. p. 250: cited by Mr. Smith, who adds: “The most conclusive evidence that this is the Fair Havens of Scripture, is, that its position is precisely that where a ship circumstanced as St. Paul’s was, must have put in. I have already shewn that the wind must have been about N.W.; but with such a wind she could not pass Cape Matala: we must therefore look <em> near, but to the E. of</em> this promontory, for an anchorage well calculated to shelter a vessel in N.W. winds, but not <em> from all winds</em> , otherwise it would not have been, in the opinion of seamen ( Act 27:12 ), an unsafe winter harbour. Now here we have a harbour which not only fulfils every one of the conditions, but still retains the name given to it by St. Luke.” Smith, p. 45. He also gives an engraving of the place from a sketch by Signr. Schranz, the artist who accompanied Mr. Pashley in his travels.

<p>There is no ground for identifying this anchorage with καλὴ ἀκτή mentioned as a <em> city</em> in Crete by Steph. Byzant. For <em> this</em> is clearly <em> not</em> the name of a city, by the subjoined notice, ᾧ ἐγγὺς ἦν πόλις Λασέα .
	</p>
<p>Nor is there any reason to suppose, with Meyer, that the name <strong> καλοὶ λιμ</strong> . was euphemistically given, because the harbour was not one to winter in: this (see above) it may not have been, and yet may have been an excellent refuge at particular times, as now, from prevailing westerly winds.
	</p>
<p><strong> Λασέα</strong> ] This place was, until recently, altogether unknown; and from the variety of readings, the very name was uncertain. Pliny (iv. 12) mentions <em> Lasos</em> among the cities of Crete, but does not indicate its situation. It is singular, and tends to support the identity of Lasos with our Lasea, that as here Alassa, so there Alos, is a various reading. The reading Thalassa appears to have been an error of a transcriber from - αλασσα forming so considerable a part of a word of such common occurrence.
	</p>
<p>There is a <em> Lisia</em> named in Crete in the Peutinger Table, which may be the same. On the very interesting discovery of <em> Lasea</em> by the Rev. G. Brown in the beginning of the year 1856, see the excursus at the end of Prolegg. to Acts. The ruins are on the beach, about two hours eastward of Fair Havens.</p>
