<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] [The omission of the words ὁ ἑκατ … to στρατοπεδάρχῳ (- χῃ ) [though too strongly attested to allow us to retain them in the text] may have been originally caused by the transcriber’s eye passing from - αρχος to - αρχω , as in Syr. (‘permisit centurio Paulo’): this done, the emendation of the text so as to construe by ejecting ὁ ἑκατόνταρχος was obvious.

<p>It does not follow, <em> from the singular being used</em> , that there was <em> but one</em> præfectus prætorio at this time, and <em> that one</em> Burrus; though it may have been so. <em> The prefect</em> mentioned might be <em> one of the two</em> who preceded Burrus, or one of the two who followed him so that no chronological datum is here contained (against Wieseler, who builds upon it: Chron. der Apostg. p. 86). He attempts to meet the above argument by accounting it improbable that the prisoners would be <em> consigned to either</em> of the prefects; this may have been so, but they certainly would be delivered to <em> one, not to both</em> ; and the fact might well be thus related. Luke is not so precise in Roman civil and military matters, as that he necessarily should in this case have written ἑνὶ τῶν στρατοπεδάρχων .

<p>The ‘ <em> præfectus prætorio</em> ’ was the person officially put in charge with the prisoners sent from the provinces: so Plin. Epp. x. 65, “Vinctus mitti ad præfectos prætorii mei debet.”

<p>The prætorian camp was outside the Porta Viminalis, where it had been fixed and fortified by Sejanus: see Tacit. Ann. iv. 2. [It was incorporated in Aurelian’s walls, and now forms a square projection from their line.] <strong> ]

<p><strong> ἐπετράπη τῷ Π</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] This permission probably resulted from the letters of Festus, expressing that no crime was laid to the charge of Paul; perhaps also partly from the favour of Julius, and his report of the character and bearing of Paul on the journey.
