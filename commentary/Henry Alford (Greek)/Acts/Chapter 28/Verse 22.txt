<p>Their short notice of Christianity is perhaps the result of caution, seeing as they did the favour shewn by the authorities towards Paul (see Hackett, p. 392): or perhaps of dissimulation.

<p>Many Commentators have noticed the omission of all mention of the <em> Christian Church at Rome</em> , and of Paul’s connexion with or work among them. And some recently in Germany (e.g. Bauer) have called in question the credibility of the Acts on this account. But without any reason: for the work of the Apostle among <em> churches already founded</em> is not the subject of our history, and is seldom related by Luke, without a special reason. Of the three years at Ephesus (ch. Act 20:31 ), the year and a half (ch. Act 18:11 ), and three months (ch. Act 20:3 ) at Corinth, we know from the narrative nothing that took place among the Christians themselves. Besides, one great object of this history is to shew forth Paul as working out the Lord’s implied command (ch. Act 1:8 ), to preach the Gospel ‘to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile,’ and, having every where done this, it is but natural that he should open his commission in Rome by assembling and speaking to the <em> Jews</em> .</p>
