<p><strong> ἐπιθέντος</strong> κ . τ . λ .] The difficulty here is, that there are <em> now no venomous serpents</em> in Malta. But as Mr. Smith observes, “no person who has studied the changes which the operations of man have produced on the animals of any country, will be surprised that a particular species of reptiles should have disappeared from Malta. My friend, the Rev. Mr. Landsborough, in his interesting excursions in Arran, has repeatedly noticed the gradual disappearance of the viper from the island since it has become more frequented. Perhaps there is no where a surface of equal extent in so artificial a state as that of Malta is at the present day, and no where has the aboriginal forest been more completely cleared. We need not therefore be surprised that, with the disappearance of the woods, the noxious reptiles which infested them should also have disappeared.” pp. 111, 112.

<p>The reading <strong> ἐκ</strong> τ . θέρμ . has been an explanation of ἀπό , which here signifies <strong> from</strong> <em> locally</em> , not ‘ <em> on account of</em> .’ To suppose the converse (“the ἀπό was adopted by those who thought the sense was ‘ <em> on account of</em> the fire,’ ” Dr. Bloomf.), is simply absurd; for 1) no man ever could suppose the sense of ἐκ in such a connexion to be this: and 2) even if any one did, he would not have substituted another ambiguous preposition, <strong> ἀπό</strong> . Paul had placed the faggot on the fire, and was settling or arranging it in its place, when the viper glided out of the heat and fixed on his hand.

<p><strong> καθῆψεν</strong> ] <strong> attached itself</strong> : a usage unexampled in earlier Greek. The narrative leaves no doubt that the bite did veritably take place.</p>
