<p>That the words, as spoken by Moses, seem to point to the whole line of prophets sent by God, is not any objection to their being applied to Christ, but rather necessitates, and entirely harmonizes with, that application. See the parable <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:33-41">Matthew 21:33-41</span> . And <em> none</em> of the whole prophetic body entirely answered to the ὡς ἐμέ , <em> but Christ</em> . The Jews therefore rightly understood it (though not always consistent in this, compare Joh 1:21 with Act 6:14 ) of the Messiah.</p>
