<p><strong> 26.</strong> ] <strong> πρῶτον</strong> , <strong> first</strong> ; implying the offer to the Gentiles (but as yet, in Peter’s mind, only <em> by embracing Judaism</em> ) afterwards: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span> .

<p>It is strange how Olshausen can suppose that the Spirit in Peter overleapt the bounds of his subsequent prejudice with regard to the admission of the Gentiles: <em> he never had any such prejudice</em> , but only against their admission <em> uncircumcised</em> , and <em> as Gentiles</em> .
	</p>
<p>It is still stranger how a scholar like Dr. Burton can propose the ungrammatical and unmeaning rendering, “ πρῶτον is perhaps used with reference to Christ’s first coming, as opposed to his second.” This would require τὸ πρῶτον , and would certainly imply in the mind of the speaker an <em> absolute exclusion of all but Jews till the second coming</em> .

<p><strong> ἀναστήσας</strong> , not ‘ <em> from the dead</em> :’ but as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:22">Acts 3:22</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> παῖδα</strong> , <strong> His Servant</strong> : see note, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:13">Acts 3:13</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀπέστειλεν</strong> , indefinite, of the sending in the flesh; <strong> sent</strong> , not ‘ <em> hath sent</em> ;’ it does not apply to the <em> present time</em> , but to God’s procedure in raising up His Servant Jesus, and His mission and ministry: and is distinct from the ἀποστείλῃ of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:20">Acts 3:20</span> . This is also shewn by the pres. part. εὐλογοῦντα , ingeniously, but not quite accurately rendered in E. V. ‘ <em> to bless you</em> .’ He came <strong> blessing you</strong> (his coming was an act of blessing it consisted in the εὐλογεῖν : an anarthrous present participle in such a connexion carries necessarily a slightly ratiocinative sense), <strong> in</strong> (as the conditional element of the blessing) <strong> turning every one from your iniquities</strong> : thus conferring on you the best of blessings. εὐλογ ., in allusion to ἐνευλογ ., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:25">Acts 3:25</span> . ἐν τῷ in this sense, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:5">Luke 8:5</span> . The application to the <em> present time</em> is made by inference: ‘ <em> as that was His object then, so now</em> :’ but (see below) the discourse is unfinished.
	</p>
<p>The <em> intransitive</em> sense of ἀποστρέφειν , ‘ <em> which blessing is to be gained by</em> ( <em> in</em> ) <em> every one of you turning from your iniquities</em> ,’ given in the Vulg., ‘ut convertat se unusquisque,’ and maintained by Theophyl., Œc [37] , Beza, Kuinoel, Meyer, &amp;c., on the strength of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:19">Acts 3:19</span> , is inadmissible, as ἀποστρέφω is not found thus used in the N. T., and we have the precedent of ref. Luke and Rom 11:26 for the transitive sense. The argument from Act 3:19 tells just as well for <em> it</em> : ‘Repent and be converted, … for this was the object of Jesus being raised up, to confer on you this very blessing, the <em> turning away</em> each of you from your iniquities.’

<p>This discourse does not come to a final conclusion as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36">Acts 2:36</span> , because it was <em> interrupted by the apprehension of the Apostles</em> .</p>
