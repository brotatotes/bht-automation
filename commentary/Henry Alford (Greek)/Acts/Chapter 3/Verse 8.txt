<p><strong> 8</strong> .] <strong> ἐξαλλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> describes his first joyous liberation from his weakness: as soon as he felt himself strengthened, he leapt up, for joy. No suppositions need be made, such as πειράζων ἴσως ἑαυτόν (Chrys.): or that it was from ignorance how to walk (Bloomf.). His joy is quite sufficient to explain the gesture, and it is better to leave the narrative in its simplicity. If καί before αἰνῶν is omitted (see digest), the present participle has its ratiocinative force, alleging the cause of the walking and leaping: and would best be rendered in English, <strong> in his praising of God</strong> .</p>
