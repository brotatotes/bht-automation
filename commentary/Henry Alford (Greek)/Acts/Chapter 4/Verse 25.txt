<p><strong> 25</strong> .] The text of this verse (see var. readd.) is in a very confused state. I have kept to that of the oldest MSS., adopted also by Lachmann. Though harsh in construction, their words are not <em> senseless</em> , as De Wette styles them, στόματος Δαυεὶδ … being in apposition with πνεύματος ἁγίου . The rec. has been an emendation and simplification of the text, which bears, in this its original form, the solemn and stately character, in the accumulation of parallel clauses, of the rest of the prayer; cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:27">Acts 4:27</span> .

<p>The Messianic import of this Psalm has been acknowledged even by those who usually deny all such reference, e.g. De Wette. Meyer endeavours to refer it to some circumstances then present, but is not bold enough to enter into any vindication of his view.

<p><strong> φρυάσσω</strong> is only found in the middle in good Greek (see Kypke, Observ. ii. p. 30 f. Meyer). φρύαγμά ἐστι τὸ ἀλόγιστον κίνημα , Athanas. in Catena.</p>
