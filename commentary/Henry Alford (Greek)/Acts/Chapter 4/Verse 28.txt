<p>ποιῆσαι must not be rendered, with Kuinoel, ‘ita ut facerent.’ It does not express the <em> result</em> , but the <em> intention</em> , of their assembling. Still worse is it to take ποιῆσαι with ἔχρισας , ‘Whom Thou hast anointed, … to do,’ &amp;c., as some have proposed: the parenthesis, as well as the whole train of thought, forbidding it.

The Wisdom decreed, the Hand performed: but the same word προώρισεν is used of both by what grammarians call <em> zeugma</em> as in γάλα ὑμᾶς ἐπότισα ‚ οὐ βρῶυα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:2">1 Corinthians 3:2</span> .
