<p><strong> 32.</strong> <strong> τῶν πιστευσάντων</strong> ] Much the same meaning as τῶν πιστευόντων , but with reference to their having <em> become converts</em> , and specially to those mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:4">Acts 4:4</span> , though the description is general. ‘Ubi regnum habet fides, animos ita conciliat ut omnes idem velint et nolint. Hinc enim discordiæ, quod non regimur eodem Christi Spiritu.’ Calvin. On the community of goods, see note at ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:45">Acts 2:45</span> . We have the view there taken strikingly confirmed here by the expressions used. <strong> No one called</strong> (reckoned) <strong> any thing of his goods</strong> (which were still τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῷ , not alienated) ( <strong> to be) his own</strong> . ( <strong> ἔλεγεν</strong> , <em> dicebat</em> : hoc ipso præsupponitur <em> proprietatem</em> possessionis non plane fuisse deletam. Bengel.)</p>
