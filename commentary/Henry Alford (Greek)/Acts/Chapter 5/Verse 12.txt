<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] <strong> δέ</strong> is merely <em> transitional</em> , and does not imply any contrast to the φόβος just mentioned, q. d. ‘notwithstanding this fear, the Apostles went on working, &amp;c.’ See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:43">Acts 2:43</span> .

<p><strong> ἅπαντες</strong> , the Apostles only, not <em> all the Christians</em> . It does not follow, from πάντες referring to <em> all the believers</em> in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:1">Acts 2:1</span> (see note there), that ἅπαντες necessarily refers to the same here also. The Apostles are <em> the subject of the paragraph</em> : and it is to set forth <em> their</em> unanimity and dignity that the description is given. They are represented as distinct from all others, believers and unbelievers (both which I take to be included under the term οἱ λοιποί ): and the Jewish people itself magnified them. The further connexion see on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:14">Acts 5:14</span> .
