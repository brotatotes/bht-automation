Now especially was fulfilled to him the promise of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> (see note there): and even the shadow of the <em> Rock</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+32:2">Isaiah 32:2</span> , Heb., and E.V., spoken primarily of His divine Master) was sought for.

But what a fertile harvest of superstition and imposture has been made to spring out of these scanty examples!
