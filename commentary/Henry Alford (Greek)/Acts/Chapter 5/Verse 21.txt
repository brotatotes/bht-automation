<p><strong> παραγενόμενος</strong> ] to the ordinary session chamber in the Temple, on the south side of it (Winer, Realw.): and therefore, if the Apostles were teaching <em> in Solomon’s porch</em> ( Act 5:12 ), not in their immediate vicinity. Perhaps the παραγενόμενος … συνεκάλεσαν …, implying that the summons was not issued till <em> after the arrival of the H. P. and his friends</em> , may point to a meeting of the Sanhedrim hurriedly and insufficiently called, for the purpose of ‘packing’ it against the Apostles. If so, they did not succeed, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:40">Acts 5:40</span> ; perhaps on account of the arrival of some who had been listeners to the Apostles’ preaching.

<p><strong> πᾶσαν τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γερουσίαν</strong> ] Probably the πρεσβύτεροι , including perhaps some who were not members of the Sanhedrim; the well-known foes of Jesus and his doctrine. The expression π . τ . γερους . τῶν υἱ . Ἰσραήλ , common in the LXX, is perhaps translated from the form of words in which they were summoned. γερουσία , being the ordinary word for the πρεσβύτεροι , would be the Hellenistic formal expression.</p>
