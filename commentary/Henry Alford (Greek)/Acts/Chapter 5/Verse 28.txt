The same shyness of open allusion to the names or facts connected with Jesus and the spread of his doctrine may be traced in the <strong> ὀνόματι τούτῳ</strong> , and the <strong> ἀνθρώπου τούτου</strong> , and is a strong mark of truth and circumstantiality. ‘Fugit appellare Jesum: Petrus appellat et celebrat, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:30-31">Acts 5:30-31</span> .’ Bengel.

The preceding clause ( πεπληρ . κ . τ . λ .) shews this to be their thought. Compare the pointed address of Peter to the Sanhedrim, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:8-12">Acts 4:8-12</span> , and the distinction between them and the people in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:21">Acts 4:21</span> . This being so, the resemblance between this expression and the imprecation of the people in Mat 27:25 must not be too closely pressed, though the coincidence is too striking to escape notice.</p>
