<p><strong> 34.</strong> ] <strong> Γαμαλιήλ</strong> = גַּמְלִיאֵל , (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+1:10">Numbers 1:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+2:20">Numbers 2:20</span> ,) is generally, and not without probability, assumed to be identical with the celebrated Rabban Gamaliel, הַזָּקֵן (the old man), one of the seven, to whom, among their Rabbis, the Jews give this title Rabban (= ῥαββουνί , Joh 20:16 ), a wise and enlightened Pharisee, the son of Rabban Symeon (traditionally the Symeon of Luk 2:25 ) and grandson of the famous Hillel. His name often appears in the Mischna, as an utterer of sayings quoted as authorities. He died eighteen years before the destruction of the city. (See Lightf. Centuria Chorogr. Matth. præmissa, ch. 15) He was the preceptor of St. Paul (ch. Act 22:3 ). Ecclesiastical tradition makes him become a Christian and be baptized by Peter and John (Phot [41] cod. 171, vol. iii. p. 118 b. Winer, Realw.), and in the Clementine Recognn. (i. 65, p. 1242), he is stated to have been at this time a Christian, but secretly. The Jewish accounts do not agree, which make him die a Pharisee, with much more probability. Nor is the least trace of a Christian leaning to be found in his speech: see below [on Act 5:39 ]. And considering that he was a Pharisee, opposing the prevalent faction of Sadducæism in a matter where the Resurrection was called in question, and a wise and enlightened man opposing furious and unreasoning zealots, considering also, that when the <em> anti-pharisaical</em> element of Christianity was brought out in the acts and sayings of Stephen, his pupil Saul was found the foremost persecutor, we should, I think, be slow to suspect him of any favouring of the Apostles <em> as followers of Jesus</em> . (See particulars respecting Gamaliel collected in Conybeare and Howson’s St. Paul, edn. 2, vol. i. p. 69, f.) He does not here appear as the president of the Sanhedrim, but only as a member.
