<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] <strong> τὸ πλῆθος τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> μ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , ‘the <em> whole number</em> of disciples in Jerusalem:’ summoning a general meeting of the church. How many they were in number at the time, is not said. Clearly the 120 names of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15">Acts 1:15</span> , cannot (Lightf.) be meant.
	</p>
<p><strong> οὐκ ἀρεστόν ἐστιν</strong> ] ‘non placet:’ <strong> it is not our pleasure:</strong> not ‘non æquum est,’ as Beza, Calv., Kuin., and others (and E. V.), defending this rendering by ἀρεστόν being used in the LXX for the Heb. טוֹב : but even there it never signifies <em> good</em> or <em> right</em> absolutely, but is used subjectively, with בְּעֵינָיִךְ , ‘in thine eyes:’ see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+16:6">Genesis 16:6</span> , ὡς ἄν σοι ἀρεστὸν ᾖ : also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+12:28">Deuteronomy 12:28</span> , τὸ ἀρεστὸν … ἐναντίον κυρίου τ . θεοῦ σου .
	</p>
<p><strong> καταλείψαντας</strong> ] For to this it would come, if the Apostles were to enquire into, and do justice in, every case of asserted neglect.
	</p>
<p><strong> διακονεῖν τραπέζαις</strong> ] It is a question whether this expression import the service of distributing money (see reff. and Luk 19:23 al.) or that of apportioning the daily public meals. The latter seems to me most probable, both on account of the καθημερινή above, and of the usage of διακονεῖν (see reff.). That both kinds of tables may be meant, is possible: but hardly probable.</p>
