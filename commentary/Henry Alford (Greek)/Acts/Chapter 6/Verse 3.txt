<p><strong> 3. </strong> <strong> ἐπισκ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οὖν</strong> ] The similarity to ref. Gen. seems to shew that the <strong> look ye out</strong> of the E. V. is the right rendering.

<p><strong> μαρτυρουμένους</strong> ] For this use of the pass. not found in the Gospp., compare besides reff., Jos. Antt. iii. 2. 5, τὸν στρατηγὸν Ἰησοῦν ἐνεγκωμίαζε , μαρτυρούμενον ἐφ ʼ οἶς ἔπραξεν ὑπὸ παντὸς τοῦ στρατοῦ and Marc [42] Antonin. vii. 62, συνεχῶς ἐφιστάναι , τίνες εἰσὶν οὗτοι , ὑφ ʼ ὧν μαρτυρεῖσθαι θέλεις .

<p><strong> ἑπτά</strong> ] Some have supposed a reference to the number of nations of which the Hellenistic Jews would perhaps be composed: some, to 7000, to which number the believers would by this time amount (Bengel): some, to the mystic number seven, so common in Jewish writings (Meyer, De Wette): but the best remark is Lightfoot’s: ‘quare septem eligendi, dicat cui est audacia.’

<p><strong> ἐπὶ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> χρείας τ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] ‘super hoc opus,’ Vulg.: ‘ad hunc usum, Grot.: ‘over this requirement (desideratum),’ Meyer: but the occurrence of the very same expression 1Ma 10:37 , ἐκ τούτων κατασταθήσεται ἐπὶ χρειῶν τῆς βασιλείας τῶν οὐσῶν εἰς πἰστιν , seems to make the sense <strong> business</strong> (as E. V.), <strong> duty</strong> , more probable. The <em> duty</em> (see above) was, not that of ministering to the Hellenistic Jews only, but that of superintending the whole distribution.</p>
