<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] <strong> πίστεως</strong> , not in the lower sense (Kuin.) of ‘truthfulness,’ but in the higher of <strong> faith</strong> , the root of all Christian virtues: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:24">Acts 11:24</span> (De W.).

<p>Of these seven, Stephen and Philip (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:5">Acts 8:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:26">Acts 8:26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:40">Acts 8:40</span> ; Act 21:8 ) only are elsewhere mentioned. On the idea of Nicolas having founded the heretical sect of the Nicolaitanes, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+2:6">Revelation 2:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+2:15">Revelation 2:15</span> (Lightf. and Grot. from Iren [43] adv. Hær. i. 26, p. 105, and Epiph [44] Hær. 25, p. 76), see note ad loc. From his being called προσήλυτον Ἀντιοχέα , some have argued (Heins.) that <em> he only</em> was a proselyte, and none of the rest: some (Salmasius), that <em> all</em> were proselytes, but the rest, of Jerusalem. But neither inference seems justified: rather I should say that the addition simply imports that he became better known than the rest, from the very circumstance perhaps of Antioch having been afterwards so important a spot in the Christian history (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span> , note). These names are <em> all Greek</em> : but we cannot thence infer that the seven were all Hellenists: the Apostles Philip and Andrew bore Greek names, but were certainly not Hellenists. There does appear however, in the case of these two Apostles, to have been a connexion with Greeks of some sort, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:20-22">John 12:20-22</span> . Possibly, though Ἑβραῖοι , they may not have been ἑξ Ἑβραίων (see above on Act 6:1 ), but sprung from inter-marriage with Hellenists. And so these seven may have been partly Ἑβραῖοι , though their names seem to indicate, and their office would appear to require, that they were connected with Hellenists, and not likely to overlook or disparage them. The title of ‘ <em> deacons</em> ’ is no where applied to these seven in Scripture, nor does the word occur in the Acts at all. In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span> ff. there is no absolute identification of the duties of deacons with those allotted to the seven, but at the same time nothing to imply that they were different. And ἀνέγκλητοι , ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:10">1 Timothy 6:10</span> , at all events is parallel with our μαρτυρουμένους , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:3">Acts 6:3</span> . The universal consent of all Christian writers in regarding this as the institution of the office of deacons should not be overlooked: but at the same time we must be careful not to imagine that we have here the institution of the <em> ecclesiastical order</em> so named. The distinctness of the two is stated by Chrysostom, Hom. xiv. p. 115, ὁποῖον δὲ ἆρα ἀξίωμα εἶχον οὗτοι , καὶ ποίαν ἐδέξαντο χειροτονίαν , ἀναγκαῖον μαθεῖν . ἆρα τὴν τῶν διακόνων ; καὶ μὴν τοῦτο ἐν ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις οὐκ ἔστιν · ἀλλὰ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων ἐστὶν ἡ οἰκονομία . ὅθεν οὔτε διακόνων , οὔτε πρεσβυτέρων οἶμαι τὸ ὄνομα εἶναι δῆλον καὶ φανερόν . ἀλλὰ τέως εἰς τοῦτο ἐχειροτονήθησαν . So also Œcumenius in loc.: τοὺς ἐκλεγέντας εἰς διακόνους ἐχειροτόνησαν , οὐ κατὰ τὸν νῦν ἐν ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις βαθμόν , ἀλλὰ τοῦ διανέμειν μετὰ ἀκριβείας καὶ ὀρφανοῖς καὶ χήραις τὰ πρὸς διατροφήν .

<p>But that the subsequent office of deacon was founded upon this appointment is very probable. The only one of these seven who appears in the subsequent history (ch. Act 21:8 ), is called Φίλιππος ὁ εὐαγγελιστής , probably from the success granted him as recorded in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:12">Acts 8:12</span> . In these early days titles sprung out of realities, and were not yet mere hierarchical classifications.</p>
