<p><strong> 2. </strong> <strong> ἄνδρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πατ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] So Paul, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:1">Acts 22:1</span> , before <strong> a</strong> mixed assembly of Jews. The <strong> ἄνδρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀδ</strong> <strong> .</strong> would embrace all: the <strong> πατ</strong> <strong> .</strong> would be a title of respect to the members of the Sanhedrim, in <em> this case</em> , but hardly in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:1">Acts 22:1</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ὁ θεὸς τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> δόξης</strong> ] Not = θεὸς ἔνδοξος , <strong> but the God of</strong> (i.e. who possesses and manifests Himself by) <strong> Glory</strong> , viz. the Shechinah, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:16-17">Exodus 24:16-17</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:55">Acts 7:55</span> .
	</p>
<p>The words <strong> τῷ πατρὶ ἡμῶν</strong> decide nothing as to Stephen’s genuine Hebrew extraction. Any Jew would thus speak.

<p><strong> ὤφθη</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> πρὶν ἢ κατ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐν Χαῤ</strong> .] This was the Jewish tradition, though not asserted in Genesis. Thus Philo (de Abrah. § 15 end, vol. ii. p. 12), having paraphrased the divine command, says, διὰ τοῦτο τὴν πρώτην ἀποικίαν ἀπὸ τῆς Χαλδαίων γῆς εἰς τὴν Χαῤῥαίων λέγεται ποιεῖσθαι . But he accurately distinguishes between the λόγιον which he obeyed in leaving Chaldæa, and the θεὸς ὤφθη afterwards, adding a reason after his manner, why God could not be seen nor apprehended by him while he was yet χαλδαΐζων and an astrologer. The fact of his having left Ur by <em> some divine intimation</em> is plainly stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:7">Genesis 15:7</span> , and referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ne+9:7">Nehemiah 9:7</span> . It was surely both natural and allowable to express this first command in the well-known words of the second. But we can hardly suppose that Stephen adopted the pluperfect rendering of וַיֹּאמֶר in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:1">Genesis 12:1</span> , as the LXX has εἶπεν . (Josephus, ordinarily cited as relating the same tradition, throws, as he often does, the whole history into confusion, saying, it is true, Antt. i. 7. 1, καταλείπει τ . Χαλδαίαν … τοῦ θεοῦ κελεύσαντος εἰς τὴν Χαναναίαν μετελθεῖν , but omitting entirely the sojourn in Haran, and connecting the migration with an outbreak of the Chaldæans against him for teaching the worship of the true God.)

<p><strong> Χαῤῥάν</strong> ] So the LXX for חָרָן , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:31">Genesis 11:31</span> , &amp;c. 4 Kings <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:12">Acts 19:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+27:23">Ezekiel 27:23</span> , Κάῤῥαι τῆς Μεσοποταμίας , Herodian iv. 13 (Ptol. v. 18. 12. Strabo, xvi. p. 747), ‘Carras cæde Crassi nobiles,’ Plin. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:24">Acts 7:24</span> , ‘Miserando funere Crassus Assyrias Latio maculavit sanguine Carras,’ Lucan i. 104. It lay on an ancient road, in a large plain surrounded by mountains; it was still a great city in the days of the Arabian caliphs. See Winer, Realw.</p>
