<p><strong> 38.</strong> ] γίνομαι μετά is not a Hebraism, as Kuin.: see reff.
	</p>
<p>That Moses conversed with both the Angel of the covenant and our fathers, implies that he was the <em> mediator between them</em> , as indeed ὃς ἐδέξατ . λόγ . ζ . more plainly declares.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐκκλησίᾳ</strong> probably, the assembly held (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:0">Exodus 19:0</span> ) for the promulgation of the law at Mt. Sinai, not ‘ <em> the Church</em> ’ generally: but the article does not determine this: it would be expressed, whichever meaning we take. Wordsw. observes on the meaning which the words ἡ ἐκκλησία ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ carry for the student of Christian prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+12:1-6">Revelation 12:1-6</span> .

<p><strong> λόγια ζῶντα</strong> ] living, see reff., not = ζωοποιοῦντα (Grot., Kuin.), ‘ <em> life-giving</em> :’ still less to be understood ‘given <em> vivá voce</em> ’ (Pisc. Alberti). So Soph. Gild [47] Tyr. 482, τὰ μεσόμφαλα γᾶς ἀπονοσφίζων | μαντεῖα · τὰ δ ʼ αἰεὶ | ζῶντα περιποτᾶται .

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [47] Gild <em> as</em> , fl. 581</p>
