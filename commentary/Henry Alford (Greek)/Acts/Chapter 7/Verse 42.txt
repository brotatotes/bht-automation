<p><strong> 42. </strong> <strong> ἔστρεψεν</strong> ] neuter, <strong> changed, turned</strong> , as ἀναστρέψω , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:16">Acts 15:16</span> . No word, as ἑαυτόν , or τὴν γνώμην , or τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ , need be supplied: nor must ἔστρ . κ . παρ . be rendered ‘ <em> again delivered them</em> ’ (Vitring., De Dieu, al.), a Hebraism which has no place in the N. T. (Mey.): nor must we understand αὐτούς (as C in var. readd.), God turned <em> them</em> ; for, though philologically there is no objection to this, the sense requires that ἔστρεψεν should form an introduction to παρέδωκεν God, who had hitherto watched over them for good, <em> now provoked by their rebellion, turned</em> , and delivered them up to their own ways.
	</p>
<p><strong> παρέδωκεν</strong> not ‘ <em> suffered them to fall into</em> :’ all these explainings away of the strong expressions of Scripture belong to the rationalistic school of interpreters (which is not modern merely: even Chrysostom has here εἴασε ): it was a <em> judicial delivering up</em> , not a mere letting alone, see reff.

<p><strong> τῇ στρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οὐρ</strong> .] This fact is not mentioned in the Pentateuch, but may refer to the worship of Baal. In aftertimes we have frequent traces of star-worship: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+17:16">2 Kings 17:16</span> ; 2Ki 21:3 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+21:5">2 Kings 21:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+23:4-5">2 Kings 23:4-5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+19:13">Jeremiah 19:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="zep+1:5">Zephaniah 1:5</span> . See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+4:19">Deuteronomy 4:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+17:3">Deuteronomy 17:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="job+31:26">Job 31:26</span> .

<p><strong> βίβλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> προφ</strong> .] The book of the prophets, regarded as a whole. The citation (ref.) is from the LXX.
	</p>
<p><strong> μὴ σφάγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θ</strong> .] A question usually preceding a <em> negative</em> answer, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:9">Matthew 7:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:1">Romans 11:1</span> ; 1Co 9:8 al.: but not always: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:23">Matthew 12:23</span> ( Act 26:22 ); <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:29">John 4:29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:22">John 8:22</span> . Winer, edn. 6, § 57. 3, b. There is no stress on μοί (‘Is it to <em> Me</em> that ye offered, &amp;c. (i.e. to me only?’) as Rosenm., Heinr., Olsh., Kuin., Stier: the position of μοί in the sentence will not allow of this). I should take the question here according to the usual construction, and understand it as a reproach, implying that God does not receive as offered to Him, sacrifices in which He has been made to share with idols: <strong> it is not true that ye offered to Me</strong> (but no stress on Me) <strong> sacrifices</strong> , &amp;c. ‘I regard it as never having happened.’</p>
