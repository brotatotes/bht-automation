<p><strong> διαδεξ</strong> .] <strong> Having inherited it</strong> , i.e. succeeded to its custody and privileges. The sense of ‘successores,’ ‘qui majores exceperunt,’ is ungrammatical; as also is that of ‘postea,’ ‘deinceps.’

<p><strong> ἐν τῇ κατασχέσει</strong> ] <strong> at</strong> (or ‘in’) <strong> their taking possession</strong> . The Vulg. rendering, ‘in possessionem gentium,’ is philologically inadmissible; ‘in terram a gentibus occupatam’ (Calvin, De Dieu, Grot., Kuin.) is still worse. The passage of the LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+32:5">Numbers 32:5</span> , δοθήτω ἡ γῆ αὕτη τοῖς οἰκέταις σου ἐν κατασχέσει , brought forward to justify these renderings, is directly against them. The word is one of those examples of verbal nouns in - σις where the meaning hovers uncertainly between the act of doing and the thing done. Such is often the case with καύχησις in St. Paul. Cf. for a very near approach to the concrete meaning of this word, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+27:4">Numbers 27:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+27:7">Numbers 27:7</span> . But, abstract or concrete, it always, as might be expected from the very composition of the word, is used of that final and settled possession which Israel took of the land, not of that transitory possession from which the gentes were driven out. So that Wordsw.’s rendering, “the portion, or possession of the Gentiles,” is out of the question.

<p>The martyr combines rapidly a considerable period, during which this κατάσχεσις and this expulsion was taking place (for it was not complete till the time of David) in order to arrive at the next great event of his history, <em> the substitution of the temple of Solomon for the tabernacle</em> .</p>
