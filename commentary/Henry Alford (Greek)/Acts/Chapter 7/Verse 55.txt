<p><strong> 55.</strong> ] Certainly, in so far as the vision of Stephen was <em> supernatural</em> , it was not <em> necessary</em> that the <em> material heavens should have been visible</em> to him; but from the words ἀτενίσας <strong> εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν</strong> it would seem that they <em> were</em> . We are not told <em> where</em> the Sanhedrim were assembled. It does not seem as if they were convened in the ordinary session room: it may have been in one of the courts of the temple, which would give room for more than the members of the Sanhedrim to be present, as seems to have been the case.

<p><strong> ἑστῶτα</strong> ] A reason why the glorified Saviour was seen <em> standing</em> , and not <em> sitting</em> , has been pleasingly given by Chrysostom (in Cramer’s Catena): τί οὖν ἑστῶτα καὶ οὐχὶ καθήμενον ; ἵνα δείξῃ τὴν ἀντίληψιν τὴν εἰς τὸν μάρτυρα · καὶ γὰρ περὶ τοῦ πατρὸς λέγεται “ ἀνάστα ὁ θεός .” Similarly Gregory the Great, Hom. ii. 29, vol. i. p. 1572, ‘Stephanus stantem vidit, quem adjutorem habuit.’ So also Arator, i. 611 ff. p. 124, ed. Migne, ‘pro martyre surgit, Quem tunc stare videt; confessio nostra sedentem Cum soleat celebrare magis.’ (See also the collect for St. Stephen’s day.) But not perhaps correctly: for ‘help’ does not seem here to be the applicable idea, but the <em> confirmation of his faith</em> by the ecstatic vision of the Saviour’s glory at God’s right hand.

<p>I should be rather disposed to think that there was reference in the vision to that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:1">Zechariah 3:1</span> , where Zech. sees Ἰησοῦν τὸν ἱερέα τὸν μέγαν , ἑστῶτα πρὸ προσώπου ἀγγέλου κυρίου . Stephen, under accusation of blaspheming the <em> earthly temple</em> , is granted a sight of the <em> heavenly temple</em> ; being cited before the <em> Sadducee High Priest</em> who believed neither angel nor spirit, he is vouchsafed a vision of the <em> heavenly</em> HIGH PRIEST, standing and ministering at the throne amidst the angels and just men made perfect.</p>
