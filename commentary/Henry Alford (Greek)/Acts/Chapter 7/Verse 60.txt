<p><strong> 60.</strong> ] The more accurate philological Commentators, De Wette and Meyer, deny that στήσῃς here can, as ordinarily explained, refer to <em> weighing</em> (reff. Matt.; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+39:0">Jeremiah 39:0</span> (32) 10), since not the <em> sin</em> , but the <em> punishment</em> , would be the thing weighed out, and it would be harsh to take the one for the other, in a sentence of this kind. Meyer would understand ἱστάναι as opposed to ἀφιέναι , τὴν ἁμαρτίαν , ‘ <em> Fix not this sin upon them</em> :’ but De Wette, as seems to me more probably, renders it <strong> Reckon not this sin to them</strong> (‘lay not this sin to their charge,’ E. V.), supporting this by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:3">Romans 10:3</span> .

<p>This again was somewhat similar (though not exactly, see note there) to our Lord’s prayer, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:34">Luke 23:34</span> .

<p><strong> ἐκοιμήθη</strong> ] Not a Christian expression only: Wetstein, on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:52">Matthew 27:52</span> , cites Jewish examples: and we have in the Anthology, iii. 1. 10, τῇδε Σάων ὁ Δίωνος Ἀκάνθιος ἱερὸν ὕπνον | κοιμᾶται · θνήσκειν μὴ λέγε τοὺς ἀγαθούς . But it became <em> the usual</em> Christian <em> term</em> for death. Its use here, when the circumstances, and the actors in them, are remembered, is singularly touching, from the contrast.</p>
