<p><strong> 2. </strong> <strong> ἄνδρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εὐλαβεῖς</strong> ] Whether Jews or Christians is not certain. Ananias is so called, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:12">Acts 22:12</span> (not in rec), and he was a Christian. At all events, there is no contrast implied in the δέ (as Mey.), ‘Yet, notwithstanding the persecution and dispersion, pious men were found who, &amp;c.:’ the δέ is merely the transitional particle, and, so far from its being any unusual thing to bury an executed person, it was commanded among the Jews. Olshausen thinks that, if they had been Christians, the term ἀδελφοί would have been used: but this does not seem by any means certain: we can hardly reason so minutely from the diction of one section in the narrative to that of another, especially in the case of a section so distinct and peculiar as this one. (Besides, ἀδελφοί in this sense does not occur till ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:30">Acts 9:30</span> ; see reff. there.) Probably they were pious Jews, not yet converts, but hearers and admirers of Stephen.</p>
