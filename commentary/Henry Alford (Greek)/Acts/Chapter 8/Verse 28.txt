<p><strong> 28. </strong> <strong> ἀνεγίνωσκεν</strong> ] aloud, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:30">Acts 8:30</span> . Schöttg. quotes from the Rabbis: ‘Qui in itinere constitutus est, neque comitem lmbet, is student in Lege.’

<p>He probably read in the LXX, the use of which was almost universal in Egypt. The word περιοχή below (see on Act 8:32 ) is not decisive (Olsh.) against this (as if there were περιοχαί only in the Hebrew, not in the LXX), as it would naturally be used as well of one as the other by those cognizant of the term. Besides, must there not have been περιοχαί in the copies of the LXX read in the synagogues?</p>
