<p><strong> 33. </strong> <strong> ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει αὐτοῦ ἡ κρίσις αὐτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἤρθη</strong> ] Heb. ‘He was taken away by distress and judgment’ [so in the margin of E. V.]: i.e. as Lowth, ‘by an oppressive judgment.’
	</p>
<p><strong> γενεὰν αὐτοῦ</strong> ] i.e., <strong> the age in which He shall live</strong> ‘the wickedness of his contemporaries.’ The fathers, and Bede [55] (and so Wordsworth), explain ‘ <em> His generation</em> ’ of His eternal Sonship and His miraculous Incarnation. But the Heb. does not seem to bear this out. See the meaning discussed at length, and another interpretation defended in Stier, Jesaias, &amp;c., pp. 466 470. Cf. also Gesenius’ Thesaurus under דּוֹר .
