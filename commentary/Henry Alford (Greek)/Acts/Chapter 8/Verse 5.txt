<p><strong> 5. </strong> <strong> Φίλιππος</strong> ] <em> The deacon</em> ; not, as apparently implied in the citation from Polycrates in Eus [53] H. E. iii. 31, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:24">Acts 8:24</span> , <em> one of the twelve</em> : this is precluded by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:14">Acts 8:14</span> . And it is probable, that the persecution should have been directed especially against the colleagues of Stephen. Philip is mentioned again as ὁ εὐαγγελιστής , probably from his having been the first recorded who εὐηγγελίσατο τὸν λόγον , in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:8">Acts 21:8</span> , as married and having four daughters, virgins, who prophesied.

<p><strong> πόλιν τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Σαμ</strong> .] Verbatim as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:5">John 4:5</span> , in which case it is specified as being Sychar (Sichem). As the words stand here ( πόλιν = τὴν πόλιν , after εἰς , compare also 2Pe 2:6 ), seeing that Σαμάρεια (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:9">Acts 8:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:14">Acts 8:14</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:31">Acts 9:31</span> ; Act 15:3 ) signifies the <em> district</em> , I should be inclined to believe that Sychem is here also intended. It was a place of rising importance, and in after-times eclipsed the fame of its neighbour Samaria, which latter had been, on its presentation by Augustus to Herod the Great, re-fortified and called Sebaste, Jos. Antt. xv. 7. 3, and 8. 5. It still, however, bore the name of Samaria, Jos. xx. 6. 2, where, from the context, the <em> district</em> can hardly be intended.

<p><strong> αὐτοῖς</strong> ] The inhabitants, implied in πόλις .</p>
