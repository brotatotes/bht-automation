<p><strong> 7.</strong> ] According to the reading in the text, which is too strongly upheld by manuscript authority to be rejected for the easier ordinary one, πολλαί is a ‘nominativus pendens’ (compare ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:40">Acts 7:40</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span> . Winer, edn. 6, § 29. 1), <strong> For in the case of many who had unclean spirits, they crying out with a loud voice, came out:</strong> <strong> ἐξήρχοντο</strong> being plur., as often when the neuter plural betokens living agents; see Winer, edn. 6, § 58. 3, a. β .

<p><strong> πολλοί</strong> has probably been altered to πολλῶν , to agree with τῶν ἐχόντων , on the difficulty being perceived.</p>
