<p><strong> 10</strong> .] Paul adds, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:12">Acts 22:12</span> , with particularity, as defending himself before the <em> Jews</em> , that Ananias was ἀνὴρ εὐλαβὴς κατὰ τὸν νόμον μαρτυρούμενος ὑπὸ πάντων τῶν κατοικούντων Ἰουδαίων : saying nothing of the command received by him, <em> nor that he was a disciple</em> . In ch. 26, speaking before the Roman governor, he <em> does not mention him</em> .

<p>Mr. Howson (edn. 2, vol. i. p. 114) remarks on the close analogy between the divine procedure by visions here, and in ch. 10. Here, Ananias is prepared for his work, and Saul for the reception of him as a messenger, each by a vision: and similarly Peter and Cornelius in ch. 10. I may add, that in ch. 8, where the preparation of heart was already found in the eunuch, <em> Philip only</em> was supernaturally prepared for the interview.</p>
