<p><strong> 17. </strong> <strong> Σαούλ</strong> ] The Hebrew form of Saul’s name is only found here, and in the report of our Lord’s previous address to him.

<p><strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πλησθῇς πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἁγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] I can hardly think, with De W. and Meyer, that these words imply that the Lord had said to Ananias more than is above related: I would rather view them as a natural inference from what was said in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:15">Acts 9:15</span> .
	</p>
<p>In ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span> , where the command to Ananias is omitted, <em> his</em> speech contains much of the reason given in the command here. It is remarkable again how Paul, speaking there to an infuriated Jewish mob, gives the words spoken just that form which would best gain him a favourable hearing with them e.g. ὁ θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν , ἰδεῖν <strong> τὸν δίκαιον</strong> , πάντας ἀνθρώπους , avoiding as yet the hateful word ἔθνη . He there too gives ἀναστὰς βάπτισαι καὶ ἀπόλουσαι τὰς ἁμαρτίας σου , ἐπικαλεσάμενος τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ as part of the exhortation of Ananias.</p>
