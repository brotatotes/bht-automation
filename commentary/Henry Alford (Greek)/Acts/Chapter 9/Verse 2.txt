<p><strong> εἰς Δαμασκόν</strong> ] DAMASCUS is probably the oldest existing city in the world. We read of it in Abraham’s time (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:15">Genesis 14:15</span> ; Gen 15:2 ): then no more till David subdued it ( 2Sa 8:6 ): it became independent again under Solomon (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ki+11:24">1 Kings 11:24</span> ff.), and from that time was the residence of the kings of Syria (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ki+15:18">1 Kings 15:18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ki+20:1">1 Kings 20:1</span> ff.), who were long at war with Israel and Judah, and at last were permitted to prevail considerably over Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+10:32">2 Kings 10:32</span> ; Amo 1:3-4 ) and to exact tribute from Judah (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+12:17-18">2 Kings 12:17-18</span> , see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+13:3">2 Kings 13:3</span> ; 2Ki 13:22 ; 2Ki 13:25 ). Damascus was recovered to Israel by Jeroboam II. (cir. 825 A.C. 2Ki 14:28 ). Not long after we find Rezin, king of Syria, in league with Pekah, king of Israel, against Ahaz ( 2Ki 15:37 ). Ahaz invited to his assistance Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, who took Damascus and slew Rezin, and led the people captive (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+16:5-9">2 Kings 16:5-9</span> ; Isa 8:4 ). From this time we find it subject to Assyria (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:11">Isaiah 9:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+10:9">Isaiah 10:9</span> ; Isa 17:1 ), then to Babylon (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+24:2">2 Kings 24:2</span> ; Jer 35:11 ), Persia (Arrian. Alex. ii. 11, Δαρεῖος τῶν χρημ . τὰ πολλὰ … πεπόμφει εἰς Δαμασκόν , Strabo, xvi. 756; Q. Curt. iii. 12. 27), the Syrian Seleucidæ ( 1Ma 11:62 ; 1Ma 12:32 ), and from the time of Pompey (64 A.C.), to the Romans, and attached to the province of Syria (Jos. Antt. xiv. 4. 5; 9. 5). Many Jews were settled there, and the majority of the wives of the citizens were proselytes, Jos. B. J. ii. 20. 2.

<p>On its subjection to Aretas, see below, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:24">Acts 9:24</span> , note. It was later the residence of the Ommiad Caliphs, and the metropolis of the Mahommedan world. (Conybeare and Howson, edn. 2, vol. i. p. 106.)
	</p>
<p>At present it is a large city, with (Burckhardt) 250,000 inhabitants, nearly 70,000 of whom are Christians.
	</p>
<p>It is situated most beautifully, in a large and well-watered plain, on the river Chrysorrhoas (Barrada), which divides into many streams (see 2Ki 5:12 ), and fertilizes the plain (Strabo, xvi. 756, ἡ Δαμασκηνὴ χώρα διαφερόντως ἐπαινουμένη ), bounded on all sides by the desert. See Winer, Realw., from which the above is mainly taken: Vitringa in Jesaiam, p. 650 ff. (Notitia Damasci et Regni Damasceni), and a vivid description in C. and H., pp. 104 108.

<p><strong> πρὸς τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> συν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] i.e. to the <em> presidents</em> of the synagogues, who would acknowledge the orders of the Sanhedrim, and could, under the authority of the Ethnarch, carry them out.

<p><strong> τῆς ὁδοῦ</strong> ] Not ‘ <em> this way</em> ,’ E. V., which rendering should be kept for the places where the pronoun is <em> expressed</em> , as ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:4">Acts 22:4</span> , but <strong> the way</strong> , viz. of ‘salvation,’ ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:17">Acts 16:17</span> , or ‘of the Lord,’ ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:25">Acts 18:25</span> . (The genitive, as τῆς γνώμης εἶναι , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span> .) The expression ‘THE WAY’ had evidently become a well-known one among Christians (see reff.); and it only was necessary to prefix the pronoun when <em> strangers</em> were addressed.
	</p>
<p>The special journey to Damascus presupposes the existence of Christians there, and in some numbers. This would be accounted for by the return of many who may have been converted at the Pentecostal effusion of the Spirit, and perhaps also by some of the fugitives from the persecution having settled there. This latter is rendered probable by Ananias’s ἤκουσα ἀπὸ πολλῶν περὶ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς τούτου , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:13">Acts 9:13</span> .</p>
