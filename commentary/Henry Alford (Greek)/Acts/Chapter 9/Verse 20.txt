<p><strong> 20. </strong> <strong> Ἰησοῦν</strong> ] The alteration to χριστόν has probably, as Meyer suggests, been made from doctrinal considerations, to fix on ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ the theological sense, <em> that Christ is the Son of God</em> instead of that which it now bears, that <em> Jesus is the Son of God</em> , i.e. that Jesus of Nazareth <em> as a matter of fact</em> , is the Son of God, i.e. the Messiah expected under that appellation. Be this as it may, the following <strong> τὸ ὄνομα τοῦτο</strong> ( Act 9:21 ) is decisive for the reading Ἰησοῦν , and οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ χριστός Act 9:22 still more so.</p>
