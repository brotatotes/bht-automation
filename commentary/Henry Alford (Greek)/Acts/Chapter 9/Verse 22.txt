<p><strong> 22</strong> .] I regard the <strong> μᾶλλον ἐνεδυναμοῦτο</strong> , as the <em> only words beneath which can lie concealed the journey to Arabia</em> . Paul mentions this journey ( Gal 1:17 ) with no obscure hint that to it was to be assigned the reception by him, in full measure, of the Gospel which he preached. And such a reception would certainly give rise to the great accession of power here recorded. I am the more disposed to allot that journey this place, from the following considerations. The omission of any mention of it here can arise only from one of two causes: (1) whether Paul himself were the source of the narrative, or some other narrator, <em> the intentional passing over of it, as belonging more to his personal history</em> (which it was his express purpose to relate in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:0">Galatians 1:0</span> ) <em> than to that of his ministry</em> : (2) on the supposition of Paul not having been the source of the narrative, <em> the narrator having not been aware of it</em> . In either case, this expression seems to me one very likely to have been used: (1) if the omission was <em> intentional</em> , to record a remarkable accession of power to Saul’s ministry, without particularizing whence or how it came: (2) if it was <em> unintentional</em> , as a simple record of that which was observed in him, but of which the source was to the narrator unknown.
