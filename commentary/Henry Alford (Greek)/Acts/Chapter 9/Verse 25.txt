<p><strong> 25</strong> .] The reading in the text, <strong> λαβ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ</strong> , is ambiguous, Chrys. (see in var. readd.), al. take it as if Saul had disciples of his own who did this. The only escape from this inference is by supposing an unusual government of a gen. by <strong> λαβόντες</strong> , such as we sometimes find in Homer, e.g. ἀγκὰς λαβέτην ἀλλήλων , Il. ψ . 711; Ὀδυσῆος λάβε γούνων , Od. χ . 310: see also Il. γ . 369, θ . 371; Od. ε . 428, τ . 480. So we have κρατήσας τῆς χειρὸς αὐτῆς , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:54">Luke 8:54</span> . But whether this is justified in a case where the whole person is concerned, as here, may be a question.
