<p><strong> 4. </strong> <strong> λεγουσαν αὐτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] τῇ Ἑβραΐδι διαλέκτῳ , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</span> . And it is a remarkable undesigned coincidence, that the form <strong> Σαούλ</strong> should have been preserved in this account, and rendered in Greek in the translation of Paul’s speech in ch. 22. In ch. 26, where he was speaking in Griek before Festus, he inserts the words τῇ Ἑβρ . διαλ ., to account for the use of the form Σαούλ : or perhaps he spoke the solemn words, ineffaceable from his memory, <em> as they were uttered, in Hebrew</em> , for King Agrippa. (See note on Σαούλ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span> .)

<p><strong> τί με διώκεις</strong> ;] A remarkable illustration of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:45">Matthew 25:45</span> . The με is not emphatic (agst Wordsw.); but the very lack of emphasis, assuming the awful fact, gives more solemnity to the question.</p>
