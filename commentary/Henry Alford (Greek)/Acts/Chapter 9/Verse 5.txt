<p><strong> 5. </strong> <strong> ὁ δέ</strong> ] That Saul <em> saw</em> , as well as heard, Him who spoke with him, is certain from Ananias’s speech, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span> , and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span> , that of Barnabas, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:27">Acts 9:27</span> , from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:16">Acts 26:16</span> ( ὤφθην σοι ), and from the references by Paul himself to his having seen the Lord, 1Co 9:1 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:8">1 Corinthians 15:8</span> . These last I unhesitatingly refer to this occasion, and not to any subsequent one, when he saw the Lord ἐν ἐκστάσει , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17">Acts 22:17</span> . Such appearances could hardly form the subject of autoptic testimony which should rank with that of the other apostles: this, on the contrary, was no ἔκστασις , but the <em> real bodily appearance of the risen Jesus</em> : so that it might be adduced as the ground of testimony to His Resurrection.

<p>On the words excluded from our text, as having been interpolated from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:10">Acts 22:10</span> , see note at <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:14">Acts 26:14</span> . It is natural that the account of the <em> historian</em> should be less precise than that of the <em> person concerned, relating his own history</em> . In ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:15-18">Acts 26:15-18</span> , very much more is related to have been said by the Lord: but perhaps he there, as he omits the subsequent particulars, includes the revelations made to him during the three days, and in the message of Ananias.</p>
