<p><strong> 3</strong> .] <strong> We</strong> (I and Timotheus. In this Epistle, the plural and singular are too plainly distinguished to allow us to confuse them in translating: the plural pervading ch. 1., the singular ch. 2., and the two occurring together in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+4:3-4">Colossians 4:3-4</span> , and the singular thenceforward. The change, as Mey. remarks, is never made without a pragmatic reason) <strong> give thanks to God the Father</strong> ( πατήρ , like ἥλιος , γῆ ,&amp;c. is anarthrous, as indeed often in our own language, from its well-known universal import as a predicate necessarily single of its kind: see Eph 1:2-3 ) <strong> of our Lord Jesus Christ, always</strong> (I prefer, against De W., Mey., B.-Crus., Eadie, to join πάντοτε to περὶὑμ . προσευχ ., rather than to εὐχαριστ .
