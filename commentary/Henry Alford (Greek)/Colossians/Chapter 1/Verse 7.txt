<p><strong> 7</strong> .] <strong> as</strong> (scil, ἐν ἀληθείᾳ ‘in which truth’) <strong> ye learnt from Epaphras</strong> (mentioned again ch. Col 4:12 as of Colossæ, and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:23">Philemon 1:23</span> , as then a fellow-prisoner with the Apostle. The name <em> may be</em> (hardly as Conyb., <em> is</em> ) identical with Epaphroditus. A person of this latter name is mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:25">Philippians 2:25</span> , as sent by St. Paul to the church at Philippi, and ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+4:18">Philippians 4:18</span> , as having previously brought to him offerings from that church. There is no positive reason disproving their identity: but probability is against it) <strong> our</strong> (not ‘ <em> my</em> ’) <strong> beloved fellow-servant</strong> (of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span> ; not necessarily ‘ <em> fellow-bondsman</em> ,’ as Conyb.: συναιχμάλωτος , Phm 1:23 ), <strong> who is a minister of Christ faithful on our behalf</strong> (the stress of the predicatory sentence is on πιστὸς ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν , which ought therefore in the translation not to be sundered. He was one acting faithfully “vice Apostoli” (Ambrst.), and therefore not lightly to be set aside in favour of the new and erroneous teachers), <strong> who also made known to as your love in the Spirit</strong> (viz. the ἀγάπη of which he described himself in Col 1:4 as having heard; their love εἰς πάντας τοὺς ἁγίους . This love is emphatically a gift, and in its full reference the chief gift of the Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span> ; Rom 15:30 ), and is thus in the elemental region of the Spirit, as distinct from those unspiritual states of mind which are ἐν σαρκί . This love of the Colossians he lays stress on, as a ground for thankfulness, a fruit of the hope laid up for them, as being that side of their Christian character where he had no fault (or least fault, see ch. Col 3:12-14 ) to find with them. He now proceeds, gently and delicately at first, to touch on matters needing correction).</p>
