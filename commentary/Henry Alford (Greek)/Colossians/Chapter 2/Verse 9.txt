There, the lower side, so to speak, of that fulness, was set forth the side which is presented to us here, is the higher side. Some strangely take πλήρωμα here to mean the Church so Heinr. in Mey.: “Ab eo collecta est omnis ex omnibus sine discrimine gentibus ecclesia, eo tauquam οἴκῳ , tanquam σώματι , continetur gubernaturque.” Others again hold <em> Christ</em> here to <em> mean</em> the Church, in whom [or which] the πλήρωμα dwells: so τινές in Thdrt. and Chrys.) <strong> bodily</strong> (i.e. manifested corporeally, in His present glorified Body cf. on οἰκεῖ above, and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span> . Before His incarnation, it dwelt in Him, as the λόγος ἄσαρκος , but not σωματικῶς , as now that He is the λόγος ἔνσαρκος . This is the obvious, and I am persuaded only tenable interpretation.

<p>Nor must ἐστε be taken as imperative, against the whole context, which is assertive, no less than usage ‘verbum ἐστέ nunquam in N.
