<p><strong> 16</strong> .] See the connexion in Chrys. above. This thankfulness to God will shew itself in the rich indwelling in you and outflowing from you of the word of Christ, be it in mutual edifying converse, or in actual songs of praise. <strong> Let Christ’s word</strong> (the Gospel: genitive subjective; the word which is His He spoke it, inspired it, and gives it power) <strong> dwell in you</strong> (not ‘among you,’ as Luther, De W., al.: which does not suit <strong> ἐν</strong> οικ . As Ellic. observes, St. Paul’s usage (reff., remembering that ref. 2 Cor. is a quotation) seems to require that the indwelling should be individual and personal. Still we may say with Mey. that the ὑμεῖς need not be <em> restricted</em> to individual Christians: it may well mean the whole community you, as a church. The word dwelling in them richly, many would arise to speak it to edification, and many would be moved to the utterance of praise. And to this collective sense of ὑμῖν , <strong> ἑαυτούς</strong> below seems to correspond; see above on Col 3:13 ) <strong> richly</strong> (i.e. in abundance and fulness, so as to lead to the following results), <strong> in all wisdom</strong> (these words seem to be better taken with the following than with the foregoing. For 1) ch. Col 1:28 already gives us νουθ … κ . διδ … ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ . 2) ἐνοικείτω has already its qualifying adverb πλουσίως emphatically placed at the end of the sentence. 3) The two following clauses will thus correspond ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ διδάσκοντες … ἐν τῇ χάριτι ᾄδοντες . And so Beng., Olsh., De W., Mey., al.: the usual arrangement has been with E. V., all. (not Chrys.), to join them with the preceding) <strong> teaching and warning</strong> (see on ch. Col 1:28 ) <strong> each other</strong> (see on Col 3:13 ) <strong> in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs</strong> (on the meaning of the words, see notes, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:19">Ephesians 5:19</span> . The arrangement here adopted may be thus vindicated: ψ . ὕμν . ᾠδ . πν . must be joined with the preceding, not with the following, because 1) the instrumental dative is much more naturally taken after διδ . κ . νουθ . ἑαυτ ., from the analogy of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:19">Ephesians 5:19</span> , λαλοῦντες ἑαυτοῖς ψ . κ . ὕμν . κ . ᾠδ . [ πν .], ᾄδοντες κ . τ . λ . 2) ᾄδοντες here has already two qualifying clauses, one before and one after, ἐν τῇ χάριτι and ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν . Meyer’s note here is important: “Notice moreover that Paul here also (see on Eph. ut supra) is not speaking of ‘divine service’ properly so called, for this teaching and admonishing is required of his <em> readers generally</em> and mutually, and as a proof of their <em> rich</em> possession of the word of Christ: but of the communication of the religious life among one another (e.g. at meals, at the Agapæ, and other meetings, in their family circles, &amp;c.), wherein spiritual influence caused the mouth to overflow with the fulness of the heart, and gave utterance to brotherly instruction and reproof in the higher form of psalms, &amp;c. perhaps in songs already known, or extemporized, according to the peculiarity and productivity of each man’s spiritual gift: perhaps sung by individuals alone (which would especially be the case when they were extemporized), or in chorus, or in the form of antiphonal song (Plin. Ep. x. 97).” How common religious singing was in the ancient church, independently of ‘divine service’ properly so called, see in Suicer, Thes. 2. p. 1568 f. Euseb., H. E. ii. 17, v. 28, testifies to the existence of a collection of rhythmical songs which were composed ἀπαρχῆς by Christians ( ψαλμοὶ δὲ ὅσοι κ . ᾠδαί , ἀδελφῶν ἀπαρχῆς ὑπὸ πιστῶν γραφεῖσαι , τὸν λόγον τοῦ θεοῦ τὸν χριστὸν ὑμνοῦσι θεολογοῦντες , v. 28). On singing at the Agapæ, see Tert. Apol. 39, vol. i. p. 477: “post aquam manualem et lumina, ut quisque de scripturis Sanctis vel proprio ingenio potest, provocatur in medium Deo canere”); <strong> in grace</strong> ( <em> the</em> grace of Christ (see reff. for the absolute use of ἡ χάρις ) ἀπὸ τῆς χάριτος τοῦ πνεύματός φησιν ᾄδοντες , Chrys.: so Œc., διὰ τῆς παρὰ τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος δοθείσης χάριτος : not as Erasm., Luth., Melaneth., Calv. (‘pro dexteritatc quæ grata sit’), and indeed Chrys. (alten.: ταῖς ἐν χάριτι ᾠδαῖς ), Beza, Corn.-a-lap., al., ‘ <em> gracefully</em> ,’ which would be irrelevant as applied to the singing of the heart: see below nor as Anselm, and De W., Conyb., al., ‘ <em> thankfully</em> ,’ which would be a flat and unmeaning anticipation of εὐχαριστοῦντες below. The article marks ‘the grace,’ which is yours by God’s indwelling Spirit) <strong> singing in your hearts to God</strong> (this clause has generally been understood as qualifying the former. But such a view is manifestly wrong. That former spoke of their teaching and warning one another in effusions of the spirit which took the form of psalms, &amp;c.: in other words, dealt with their intercourse <em> with one another</em> ; this on the other hand deals with their own private intercourse <em> with God</em> . The second participle is coordinate with the former, not subordinate to it. The mistake has partly arisen from imagining that the former clause related to public worship, in its external form: and then this one was understood to enforce the genuine heartfelt expression of the same. But this not being so, that which is founded on it falls with it. The singing <strong> τῷ θεῷ</strong> is an analogous expression to that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:28">1 Corinthians 14:28</span> , ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ᾖ διερμηνευτής , … ἑαυτῷ … λαλείτω κ . τῷ θεῷ . So the ἐν ταῖς καρδ . ὑμ . describes the method of uttering this praise, viz. by the thoughts only: τῷ θεῷ designates to whom it is to be addressed, not, as before, to one another, but to God):</p>
