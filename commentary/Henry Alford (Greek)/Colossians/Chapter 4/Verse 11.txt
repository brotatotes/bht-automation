<p><strong> 11</strong> . <strong> Ἰησοῦς</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> Ἰοῦστος</strong> ] Entirely unknown to us. A Justus is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:7">Acts 18:7</span> , as an inhabitant of Corinth, and a proselyte: but there is no further reason to identify the two. The surname Justus ( צדוק ) was common among the Jews: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:23">Acts 1:23</span> , and Jos. Vit. 9, 65, 76.

<p><strong> These alone who are of the circumcision</strong> (the construction is of the nature of an anacoluthon, οἱ ὄντες ἐκ π . being equivalent to ‘of those of the circumcision.’
	</p>
<p>We have a similar construction frequently in the classics: e.g. ἄμφω δ ʼ ἑζομένω γεραρώτερος ἦεν Ὀδυσσεύς , Il. γ . 211: ὅρκια πιστὰ ταμόντες ὁ μὲν βασιλευέτωαἰεί , Od. ω . 483. See many more examples in Kühner, ii. § 678. 2. This seems far better, with Meyer and Lachmann, than with rec. Ellic. al. to place the stop at περιτομῆς and attach the clause to the three preceding names. For thus we lose (in spite of the assertion by Ellic. that the μόνοι naturally refers the thought to the category last mentioned) the fact that there were other συνεργοί not of the circumcision who had been a comfort to him. The judaistic teachers were for the most part in opposition to St. Paul: cf. his complaint, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:15">Philippians 1:15</span> ; Php 1:17 ) <strong> are my fellow-workers towards the kingdom of God</strong> (the rest would not be called by this name so that De W.’s objection to the construction does not apply, that the opponents would not be called συνεργοί ; for they <em> are not</em> so called), <strong> man that proved</strong> (the passive meaning of ἐγενήθησαν is not safely to be pressed: see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:7">Ephesians 3:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:5-6">1 Thessalonians 1:5-6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:15">1 Peter 1:15</span> . The aor. alludes to some event recently passed: to what precisely, we cannot say) <strong> a comfort to me</strong> (they are my συνεργοί ‘quippe qui.…’ Hierocles, de nuptiis, apud Stob. (Kypke), has the same phrase: ἡ γυνὴ δὲ παροῦσα μεγάλη γίνεται κ . πρὸς ταῦτα παρηγορία : so Plutarch, de auditione, p. 43 (id.), νόσημα παρηγορίας … δεόμενον ).</p>
