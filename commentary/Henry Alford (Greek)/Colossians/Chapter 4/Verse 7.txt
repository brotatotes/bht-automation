<p><strong> ὁ ἀγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀδελφός</strong> , as dear to his heart: <strong> πιστ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> διάκ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , as his tried companion in the ministry, <strong> σύνδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐν κυρίῳ</strong> , as one with him in the motives and objects of his active work: ὥστε , as Chrys., αὐτῷ πάντοθεν τὸ ἀξιόπιστον ξυνήγαγεν . There is a delicate touch of affection in ἵνα γνῷ τὰ περὶ ὑμ ., which can hardly, in the doubtfulness of the reading, be the work of a corrector. It implies that there were painful circumstances of trial, to which the subsequent <strong> παρακαλέσῃ</strong> also has reference. δείκνυσιν αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς πειρασμοῖς ὄντας , Chrys. The objection (Eadie), that thus the <strong> εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦτο</strong> will announce another purpose from that enounced above in τὰ κατ ʼ ἐμὲ π . γνωρ ., will apply just as much to the other reading; for any how the αὐτὸ τοῦτο must iuclude the καὶ παρακαλέσῃ κ . τ . λ . But the fact is, that αὐτὸ τοῦτο may apply exclusively to the <em> following</em> , without any reference to what has <em> preceded</em> : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:17">Romans 9:17</span> ; the parallel place, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:22">Ephesians 6:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:6">Philippians 1:6</span> .</p>
