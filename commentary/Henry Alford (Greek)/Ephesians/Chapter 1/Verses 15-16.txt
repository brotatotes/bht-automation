<p><strong> 15, 16</strong> .] INTRODUCTION TO THE PRAYER. <strong> Wherefore</strong> (i.e., on account of what has gone before since <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span> : but especially of what has been said since <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span> , where καὶ ὑμεῖς first came in: because ye are in Christ, and in Him were sealed, &amp;c.) <strong> I also</strong> ( κἀγώ , either as resuming the first person after the second, going back to the ἐκληρώθημεν <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span> , or as corresponding to καὶ ὑμεῖς above: not, as Mey., al., because he is sensible that in thus praying for them he is helping <em> their</em> prayers for themselves) <strong> having heard of</strong> (on the indication supposed to be furnished by this respecting the readers, see Prolegg. § ii. 12) <strong> the faith among you in the Lord Jesus</strong> ( καθ ʼ ὑμᾶς is not = ὑμετέραν , as ordinarily rendered (even by Meyer), either here or any where else: cf. the example which Mey. quotes from Thuc. vi. 16, τῷ κατ ʼ αὐτοὺς βίῳ , ‘the life which prevails among them:’ Ellic. compares, for the distinction, τῷ νόμῳ τῷ ὑμετέρῳ , addressed to Pharisees, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:17">John 8:17</span> , with νόμου τοῦ καθ ʼ ὑμᾶς , said with reference to Jews in Achaia, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:15">Acts 18:15</span> : nor is ‘among you’ merely local ( <em> chez vous</em> ), but is <em> partitive</em> , implying the possibility of some not having this faith, and thus intensifying the prayer which follows) <strong> and</strong> [ <strong> your love which is</strong> ] <strong> towards all the saints</strong> (on the reading, see digest. Taking the bracketed words as genuine, τήν <em> specifies</em> τὴν ἀγ - which might be general: τ . καθ ʼ ὑμπίστιν wants no such specification, <em> all our faith</em> being ἐν τ . κυρ . Ἰησ ., grounded in Him. Chrys. remarks: πανταχοῦ συνάπτει κ . συγκολλᾷ τ . πίστιν κ . τ . ἀγάπην θαυμαστήν τινα ξυνωρίδα ) <strong> cease not giving thanks for you, making mention (of them</strong> , viz. your faith and love) <strong> in</strong> (see reff. ‘In ἐπί with a genitive, the apparent <em> temporal</em> reference partakes somewhat of the <em> local</em> reference of juxtaposition.’ Bernhardy, p. 216) <strong> my</strong> (ordinary, see Rom 1:9 note) <strong> prayers</strong> .</p>
