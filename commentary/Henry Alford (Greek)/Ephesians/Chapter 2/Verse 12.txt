<p><strong> 12</strong> .] <strong> that ye were</strong> (the <strong> ὅτι</strong> takes up again the ὅτι in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:11">Ephesians 2:11</span> , after the relative clause, and the <strong> τῷ κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐκείνῳ</strong> takes up the ποτέ there. It is not a broken construction, but only a repetition; ‘that, I say.…’) <strong> at that time</strong> (when ye were, not τὰ ἔθνη ἐν σαρκί , which ye are now, and which is carefully divided from ποτέ above by ὑμεῖς , but that which is implied in ποτέ , heathens, before your conversion to Christ. On the dative of time without the preposition ἐν , see Kühner, vol. ii. § 569, and remarks on its difference from the genitive and accusative) <strong> without Christ</strong> (separate from, having no part in, the promised Messiah. That this is the sense, is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:13">Ephesians 2:13</span> : see below. The words <strong> χωρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> χρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> are not a defining clause to ἦτε ἀπηλ λοτρ ., as Lachmann points them, and De W. and Eadie render: ‘that ye were, being without Christ, &amp;c.’ The arrangement would thus be harsh and clumsy beyond all precedent) <strong> alienated from</strong> ( οὐκ εἶπε , κεχωρισμένοι … πολλὴ τῶν ῥημάτων ἡ ἔμφασις , πολὺν δεικνῦσα τὸν χωρισμόν . ἐπεὶ καὶ Ἰσραηλῖται τῆς πολιτείας ἦσαν ἐκτός , ἀλλ ʼ οὐχ ὡς ἀλλότριοι ἀλλ ʼ ὡς ῥᾴθυμοι , κ . τῶν διαθηκῶν ἐξέπεσον , ἀλλ ʼ οὐχ ὡς ξένοι , ἀλλ ὡς ἀνάξιοι , Chr. Gentiles and Jews were once united in the hope of redemption this was constituted, on the apostasy of the nations, into a definite πολιτεία for the Jews, from which and its blessings the Gentiles were alienated) <strong> the commonwealth</strong> ( πολιτεία is both <em> polity, state</em> (objective), τῶν τὴν πόλιν οἰκούντων τάξις τις , Aristot. Polit. iii. 1, and <em> right of citizenship</em> , ref. Acts. The former appears best here, on account of ἀπηλλοτρ ., which seems to require as its reference an objective external reality) <strong> of Israel</strong> (either as synonymous genitive, ‘that commonwealth which is designated by the term Israel,’ or possessive (as Ellic.) ‘that commonwealth which Israel possessed.’ I prefer the former, as more simple) <strong> and strangers from</strong> (so Soph. Œd. Tyr. 219, ἃ ʼ γὼ ξένος μὲν τοῦ λόγου τοῦδ ʼ ἐξερῶ , ξένος δὲ τοῦ πραχθέντος . The genitive may be explained either 1) as one of the quality, as in μέλεος ἥβης , εὐδαίμων μοίρας , or as 2) one of privation = negative of possession, ξένος being resolved into οὐ μέτοχος . This latter is perhaps the best. See Bernhardy, p. 171 ff.; Kühner, ii. 163) <strong> the covenants of the promise</strong> ( τίνες ἦσαν αἱ δ . τ . ἐπ .; “ Σοὶ κ . τῷ σπέρματί σου δώσω τ . γῆν ταύτην ,” κ . ὅσα ἕτερα ἐπηγγείλατο , Chrys. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:4">Romans 9:4</span> . The meaning here, as there, has been mistaken (Calv. al.) to be ‘the two tables of the law.’ Cf. Wis 18:22 ; Sir 44:11 ), <strong> not having</strong> ( <strong> μή</strong> on account of the subjective colouring given to the whole sentence by μνημονεύετε . So in ἀπιστοῦντες αὐτὸν μὴ ἥξειν , Thuc. ii. 101: ὃ ἂν γνῶσι δυνάμενον μὲν χάριν ἀποδιδόναι , μὴ ἀποδιδόντα δέ , Xen. Cyr. i. 2. 7: ψυχὴν σκοπῶν φιλόσοφόν τε καὶ μή , Plato, Rep. p. 486 B. See Winer, § 55. 5; Kühner, ii. § 715. 3) <strong> hope</strong> (not ‘covenanted hope’ ( τὴν ἐλπ .), but ‘hope’ at all. The emphatic position of <strong> ἐλπίδα</strong> makes this the more necessary) <strong> and without God</strong> (this is the best rendering, as it leaves ἄθεος in its latitude of meaning. It may be taken either 1) actively, ‘ <em> denying God,’ ‘atheist</em> ,’ 2) in a neuter sense (see Ellic.) ‘ <em> ignorant of God</em> ’ ( ἔρημοι θεογνωσίας , Thdrt.: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:8">Galatians 4:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:5">1 Thessalonians 4:5</span> , where the Gentiles are described as οὐκ εἰδότες τ . θεόν ), or 3) passively, ‘ <em> forsaken of God</em> ’ (so Soph. Œd. Tyr. 661, ἐπεὶ <strong> ἄθεος</strong> ἄφιλος ὅ τι πύματον ὀλοίμαν : ib. 254, τῆσδέ τε γῆς , ὧδ ʼ ἀκάρπως <strong> κἀθέως ἐφθαρμένης</strong> ). This latter meaning is best here, on account of the passive character of the other descriptive clauses) in the <strong> world</strong> (contrast to the πολιτεία τοῦ Ἰσρ . “He subjoins to the godless ‘How,’ the godless ‘Where,’ ” Mey. Olsh. understands, ‘in this wicked world, in which we have so much need of divine guidance,’ which is hardly in the simple words: Rück., ‘in God’s world,’ contrast to ἄθεοι . These words must not be separated, as some, from ἄθεοι ).</p>
