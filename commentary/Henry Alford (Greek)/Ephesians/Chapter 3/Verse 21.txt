<p><strong> 21</strong> .] <strong> to Him</strong> (solemn and emphatic repetition of the personal pronoun) <strong> be the glory</strong> (the whole glory accruing from all His dealings which have been spoken of: His own resulting glory) <strong> in the Church</strong> (as its theatre before men, in which that glory must be recognized and rendered) [ <strong> and</strong> ] <strong> in Christ Jesus</strong> (as its inner verity, and essential element in which it abides. If the καί be omitted, beware of rendering ‘ <em> in the Church which is in Christ Jesus</em> ,’ which would not only require the article (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:22">Galatians 1:22</span> , ταῖς ἐκκλ . τῆς Ἰουδαίας ταῖς ἐν χριστῷ ), but would make <strong> ἐν χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ</strong> superfluous. As the text stands, we need not say that <strong> ἐν χρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἰησ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is a second independent clause: it belongs to <strong> ἐν τῇ ἐκκ</strong> <strong> .</strong> as inclusive of it, though not as descriptive of ἐκκλ .: ‘in the Church and (thus) in Christ Jesus’) <strong> to all the generations of the age of the ages</strong> (probably as Grot., ‘augendi causa duas locutiones Hebraicas miscuit Apostolus, quarum prior est ἀπὸ γενεᾶς εἰς γενεάν , לְדֹר וָדֹר , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+10:6">Psalms 10:6</span> , altera ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος עוֹלְמֵי עַד , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:17">Isaiah 45:17</span> .’ Probably the account of the meaning is, that the <em> age of ages</em> (eternity) is conceived as containing ages, just as our ‘age’ contains years: and then those ages are thought of as made up, like ours, of generations. Like the similar expression, αἰῶνες τῶν αἰώνων , it is used, by a transfer of what we know in time, to express, imperfectly, and indeed improperly, the idea of Eternity).</p>
