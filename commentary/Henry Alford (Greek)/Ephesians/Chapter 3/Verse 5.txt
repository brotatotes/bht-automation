Olshausen says, “It is certainly peculiar, that Paul here calls the Apostles, and consequently himself among them, ‘holy Apostles.’ It is going too far when De W. finds in this a sign of an unapostolic origin of the Epistle: but still the expression remains an unusual one. I account for it to myself thus, that Paul here conceives of the Apostles and Prophets, as a corporation (cf. ch. Eph 4:11 ), and as such, in their official character, he gives them the predicate ἅγιος , as he names believers, conceived as a whole, ἅγιοι or ἡγιασμένοι , but never an individual”) <strong> Apostles and Prophets</strong> (as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span> , the N.
