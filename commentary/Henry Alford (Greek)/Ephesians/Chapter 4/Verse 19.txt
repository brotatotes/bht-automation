Theod. Mops. in Stier. From the ‘ <em> desperatio</em> ’ of the Vulg. Syr., seems to have come the reading ἀπηλπικότες , see var. readd. The obduration described may spring in ordinary life from despair: so Cicero, Ep. fam. ii. 16, in Bengel, ‘diuturna desperatione rerum obduruisse animum ad dolorem novum,’ and Polyb. ix. 40. 9, ἀπαλγοῦντες ταῖς ἐλπίσι (where see Ernesti’s note), but may also result from other reasons. Certainly despair has nothing to do with the matter here, but rather the carrying on of the πώρωσις to positive ἀπάλγησις by the increasing habit of sin) <strong> gave up themselves</strong> (“ ἑαυτ ., with terrific emphasis. It accorded here with the hortatory object of the Apostle to bring into prominence that which happened on the side of their own free will.

<p><strong> πλεονεξία</strong> , the desire of having more, is obviously a wider vice than mere covetousness, though this latter is generally its prominent form. It is self-seeking, or <em> greed</em> : in whatever direction this central evil tendency finds its employment. So that it may include in itself as an element, as here, lustful sins, though it can never actually mean ‘lasciviousness.’ In 1Co 5:10 it ( πλεονέκταις ) is disjoined from πόρνοις by ἤ , and joined by καί to ἅρπαξιν clearly therefore meaning covetous persons.
