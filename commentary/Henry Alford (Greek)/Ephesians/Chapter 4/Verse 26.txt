<p><strong> 26</strong> .] <strong> Be ye angry and sin not</strong> (citation: see ref. Psa.: and that from the LXX, not from the Hebrew, which (see Hupfeld on the Psalms in loc.) means ‘ <em> tremble</em> (‘stand in awe,’ E. V.) and sin not.’ The first imperative, although jussive, is so in a weaker degree than the other: it is rather assumptive, than permissive.

<p>‘Be angry (if it must be so):’ as if he had said, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:31">1 Corinthians 7:31</span> , χράσθε τῷ κόσμῳ τούτῳ (for that must be), καὶ μὴ καταχρᾶσθε . As Chr., εἴ τις ἐμπέσοι ποτὲ εἰς τὸ πάθος , ἀλλὰ μὴ εἰς τοσοῦτον . Thus Tholuck’s question, Bergpred., p. 186, is answered: “If Paul speaks of culpable anger, how can he distinguish sinning from being angry? If of allowable anger, how can he expect not to retain it over the night?” the answer being, that he speaks of anger which <em> is</em> an infirmity, but by being cherished, may become a sin): <strong> let the sun not set upon</strong> (so Thuc. has, νὺξ ἐπεγένετο τῷ ἔργῳ ) <strong> your irritation</strong> (i.e. set to your wrath with a brother (in every case: the omission of the art. gives the sense ‘ <em> upon any</em> παροργισμός ’) a speedy limit, and indeed that one which nature prescribes the solemn season when you part from that brother to meet again perhaps in eternity. The Commentators quote from Plut. de am. frat., p. 488 B, a custom of the Pythagoreans, εἴποτε προσαχθεῖεν εἰς λοιδορίας ὑπ ʼ ὀργῆς , πρὶν ἢ τὸν ἥλιον δῦναι , τὰς δεξιὰς ἐμβάλλοντες ἀλλήλοις κ . ἀσπασάμενοι διελύοστο .

<p><strong> παροργισμός</strong> is a late word, apparently not found beyond the N. T. and LXX: the verb <strong> -</strong> <strong> ίζω</strong> occurs ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:4">Ephesians 6:4</span> , where see note. The <strong> παρ</strong> <strong> -</strong> implies, irritation <em> on occasion given</em> , as in παρορμάω , παροξύνω ),</p>
