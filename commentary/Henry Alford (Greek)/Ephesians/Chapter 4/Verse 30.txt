So far from the doctrine of final perseverance, for which Eadie more sharply than reasonably contends, being involved here, there could hardly be a plainer denial of it by implication. For in what would issue the <em> grieving</em> of the Holy Spirit, if not in quenching His testimony and causing Him to depart from them? The caution of Thl., μὴ λύσῃς τὴν σφραγῖδα , is a direct inference from the passage).</p>
