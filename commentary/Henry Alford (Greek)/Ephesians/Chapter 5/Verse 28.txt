<p><strong> 28</strong> .] <strong> Thus</strong> (two ways of understanding this <strong> οὕτως</strong> are open to us: 1) as referring back to Christ’s love for the church, ‘Thus,’ ‘in like manner,’ &amp;c., as (being) ‘their own bodies:’ and 2) as referring forward to the ὡς below, as very frequently (though Eadie calls it contrary to grammatical law) in St. Paul (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:15">1 Corinthians 3:15</span> ; 1Co 4:1 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:26">1 Corinthians 9:26</span> , al., and Eph 5:33 below, where Eadie himself renders, ‘ <em> so … as himself</em> ’), ‘ <em> Thus</em> ,’ ‘ <em> so</em> ,’ &amp;c., ‘ <em> as</em> (they love) <em> their own bodies</em> .’ After weighing maturely what has been said on one side and the other, I cannot but decide for the <em> latter</em> , as most in accordance with the usage of St. Paul and with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:33">Ephesians 5:33</span> : also as more simple. The sense (against Ellic.) remains substantially the same, and answers much better to the comment furnished by the succeeding clauses: husbands ought to love their own wives as they love their own bodies (= themselves: for their wives are in fact part of their own bodies, Eph 5:31 ): this being illustrated by and referred to the great mystery of Christ and His church, in which the same love, and the same incorporation, has place) <strong> ought the husbands also</strong> (as well as Christ in the archetypal example just given) to <strong> love their own</strong> (emphatic: see above on Eph 5:22 ) <strong> wives, as</strong> (with the same affection as) <strong> their own bodies. He that loveth his own</strong> (see above) <strong> wife, loveth himself</strong> (is but complying with that universal law of nature by which we all love ourselves. The best words to supply before the following γάρ will be, “And this we all do”): <strong> for</strong> (see above) <strong> no man ever hated his own flesh</strong> (= ἑαυτόν , but put in this form to prepare for εἰς σάρκα μίαν in the Scripture proof below. Wetst. quotes from Seneca, Ep. 14, ‘fateor, insitam nobis esse corporis nostri caritatem’), <strong> but nourishes it up</strong> (through all its stages, to maturity: so Aristoph. Ran. 1189, of Œdipus, ἵνα μὴ ʼ κτραφεὶς γένοιτο τοῦ πατρὸς φονεύς : and ib. 1427, οὐ χρὴ λέοντος σκύμνον ἐν πόλει τρέφειν (at all): ἢν δ ʼ ἐκτραφῇ τις (have been brought up), τοῖς τρόποις ὑπηρετεῖν ) <strong> and cherishes</strong> (ref. 1 Thess. It is certainly not necessary to confine the meaning to ‘ <em> warming</em> ,’ as Beng. (‘ <em> id spectat amictum</em> ’), Mey., al.: for it is very forced to apply the feeding and clothing to the other member of the comparison (as Grot.: ‘nutrit eam verbo et spiritu, vestit eam virtutibus’), as must then be done (against Mey.)) <strong> it, as also</strong> (does) <strong> Christ</strong> (nourish and cherish) <strong> the church.</strong></p>
