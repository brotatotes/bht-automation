<p><strong> 30</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (again a link is omitted; ‘the church, which stands in the relation of marriage to Him: for, &amp;c.’) <strong> members we are of His Body</strong> [, ( <strong> being</strong> ) <strong> of His flesh, and of His bones</strong> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:23">Genesis 2:23</span> . As the woman owed her natural being to the man, her source and head, so we owe our entire spiritual being to Christ, our source and head: and as the woman was one flesh with the man in this natural relation, so we in our entire spiritual relation, body, soul, and Spirit, are one with Christ, God manifested in our humanity, parts and members of His glorified Body. Bengel well remarks, that we are not, as in Gen., l. c. ὀστοῦν ἐκ τῶν ὀστέων αὐτοῦ , καὶ σὰρξ ἐκ τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτ .: ‘non ossa et caro nostra, sed <em> nos</em> spiritualiter propagamur ex humanitate Christi, carnem et ossa habente’)]: <strong> wherefore</strong> (the allusion, or rather free citation, is still carried on: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24">Genesis 2:24</span> : i.e. because we are members of Him in the sense just insisted on. This whole verse is said (see on Eph 5:32 below) not of human marriages, but of Christ and the church. He is the <strong> ἄνθρωπος</strong> in the Apostle’s view here, the Church is the <strong> γυνή</strong> . But for all this, I would not understand the words, as Meyer, in a prophetical sense of the future coming of Christ: the omission of the article before <strong> ἄνθρωπος</strong> sufficiently retains the general aphorismatic sense: but would regard the saying as applied to that, past, present, and future, which constitutes Christ’s Union to His Bride the Church: His leaving the Father’s bosom, which is <em> past</em> His gradual preparation of the union, which is <em> present</em> : His full consummation of it, which is <em> future</em> . This seems to me to be necessary, because we are as truly now <strong> εἰς σάρκα μίαν</strong> with Him, as we shall be, when heaven and earth shall ring with the joy of the nuptials; and hence the exclusive future sense is inapplicable. In this allegorical sense (see below), Chrys., Jer., and most of the ancients: Beng., Grot., Mey. (as above), al., interpret: and Eadie would have done well to study more deeply the spirit of the context before he characterized it as ‘strange romance,’ ‘wild and visionary,’ and said, ‘there is no hint that the Apostle intends to allegorize.’ That allegory, on the contrary, is the <em> key to the whole</em> ) <strong> shall a man leave father and mother and shall be closely joined to his wife, and they two shall become</strong> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:5">Matthew 19:5</span> , note) <strong> one flesh</strong> (‘non solum uti antea, respectu ortus: sed respectu novæ conjunctionis.’ Beng.).</p>
