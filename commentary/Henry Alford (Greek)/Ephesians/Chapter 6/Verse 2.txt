Whereas the obedience rests on the fact implied in ἐντολή , and the promise comes in to shew its special acceptableness to God) <strong> the first commandment</strong> (in the decalogue, which naturally stands at the head of all God’s other commandments; and which, though not formally binding on us as Christians, is quoted, in matters of eternal obligation (not of positive enactment), as an eminent example of God’s holy will) <strong> with a promise</strong> (i.e. with a special promise attached: ‘in respect of promise’ is too vague, and does not convey any definite meaning in English. The fact certainly is so, and the occurrence of the description of God as ‘shewing mercy unto thousands, &amp;c.’ after the second commandment, does not, as Jer., al., have thought, present any difficulty for that is no special promise attached to the commandment. Nor does the fact that no other commandment occurs in the <em> decalogue</em> with a promise: see above.

It is surely a mistake, as Jer., Aq., Est., Olsh., to spiritualize the promise, and understand by τῆς γῆς the heavenly Canaan.

To consider it as such, is far better than to suppose a change of construction to the direct future ‘and thou shalt be, &amp;c.’).</p>
