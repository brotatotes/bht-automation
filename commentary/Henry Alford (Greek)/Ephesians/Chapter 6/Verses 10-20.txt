He there sends his apostolic blessing τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς , but does not directly address them) <strong> be strengthened</strong> (passive, not middle, see reff. and Fritz. on Rom 4:20 ) <strong> in the Lord</strong> (Christ), <strong> and in the strength of his might</strong> (see on <strong> κράτος τῆς ἰσχύος</strong> , note, ch. Eph 1:19 ). <strong> Put on the entire armour</strong> (emphatic: repeated again <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span> : offensive, as well as defensive. It is probable that the Apostle was daily familiarized in his imprisonment with the Roman method of arming) <strong> of God</strong> (Harl. maintains that the stress is on <strong> τοῦ θεοῦ</strong> , to contrast with <strong> τοῦ διαβόλου</strong> below: but there is no distinction made between the armour of God and any other spiritual armour, which would be the case, were this so. <strong> τοῦ θεοῦ</strong> , as supplied, ministered, by God, who ἅπασι διανέμει τὴν βασιλικὴν παντευχίαν , Thdrt.), <strong> that ye may be able to stand against</strong> (so Jos. Antt. xi. 5. 7, θαῤῥεῖν μὲν οὖν τῷ θεῷ πρῶτον , ὡς καὶ πρὸς τὴν ἐκείνων ἀπέχθειαν στησομένῳ : see Kypke, ii. p. 301, and Ellicott’s note here) <strong> the schemes</strong> (the instances (concr.) of a quality (abstr.) of <strong> μεθόδεια</strong> <strong> .</strong> τίἐστι <strong> μεθόδεια</strong> ; μεθοδεῦσαί ἐστι τὸ ἀπατῆσαι , κ . διὰ συντόμον ἑλεῖν , Chrys.: the word is however sometimes used in a good sense, as Diod.
