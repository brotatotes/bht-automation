<p><strong> 13</strong> . <strong> ἠκούσ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> ye heard</strong> , viz. when I was among you: from myself: not as E. V., ‘ <em> ye have heard</em> .’ <strong> γάρ</strong> binds the narrative to the former verses, as in the opening of a mathematical proof.

<p><strong> ἀναστρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Wetst. cites Polyb. iv. 82. 1, κατά τε τὴν λοιπὴν ἀναστροφὴν καὶ τὰς πράξεις τεθαυμασμένος ὑπὲρ τὴν ἡλικίαν . This meaning of the word seems (Mey.) to belong to post-classical Greek. There is no article before nor after ποτε , perhaps because the whole, ἀναστ .- ποτε - ἐν - τῷ - Ἰουδ ., is taken as one, q.d. τὸν ἐμόν ποτε Ἰουδαϊσμόν : or better, as Donaldson in Ellicott, “the position of ποτε is due to the verb included in ἀναστροφήν . As St. Paul would have said ἀνεστρεφόμην ποτε , he allows himself to write τὴν ἐμ . ἀναστροφήν ποτε .” Mey. cites as a parallel construction, ἡ τῆς Τροίας ἅλωσις τὸ δεύτερον , Plato, Legg. iii. 685 D.

<p><strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐκκλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θεοῦ</strong> ] for solemnity, to set himself in contrast to the Gospel, and shew how alien he then was from it ( 1Co 15:9 ).

But more than the <em> mere attempt</em> is to be understood: he was verily <em> destroying</em> the Church of God, as far as in him lay. Nor must we think of merely <em> laying waste</em> ; the verb applies to <em> men</em> , not only to cities and lands, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:21">Acts 9:21</span> , κεῖνος γὰρ ἔπερσεν ἀνθρώπους , Soph. Aj. 1177, and σὲ παρακαλῶ , μὴ ἡμῖν ὁ Πρωταγόρας τὸν Σιμωνίδην ἐκπέρσῃ , Plato, Protag., p. 340.</p>
