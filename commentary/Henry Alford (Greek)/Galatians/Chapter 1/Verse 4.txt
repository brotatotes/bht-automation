<p><strong> 4</strong> .] He thus <em> obiter</em> reminds the Galatians, who wished to return to the bondage of the law, of the great object of the Atonement, which they had forgotten. Ch. Gal 3:13 is but a restatement, in more precise terms, of this.

<p><strong> δόντος ἑαυ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] viz. as an offering, unto death: an expression only found (in N. T.) here and in the Pastoral Epistles. Several such will occur; see the inference, in Prolegomena to Past. Epistles, § i. 32, note.

<p><strong> περί</strong> , in this connexion, has much the same sense as ὑπέρ : see reff., and note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:19">Ephesians 6:19</span> ; also Ellic.’s note here.

<p><strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αἰῶνος τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐνεστ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πονηροῦ</strong> ] <strong> the present</strong> (not, as Mey., ‘ <em> coming</em> .’ The word will not bear this meaning in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:26">1 Corinthians 7:26</span> , nor apparently (see note) in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span> , much less in Rom 8:38 ) <strong> evil age</strong> (state of things; i.e. the course of this present evil world; and, as understood, make us citizens and inheritors of a better αἰῶνος , τοῦ μέλλοντος . So Luther: “vocat hunc totum mundum, qui fuit, est et erit, præsens seculum, ad differentiam futuri et æterni sæculi.” The allusion (Jowett) to the Jewish expressions, “the present age,” “the age to come,” as applying to the periods before and after the Messiah’s coming, is very faint, indeed hardly traceable, in the change which the terms had undergone as used in a spiritual sense by Christians.

And this, not as the lord merely of His works, but as πατρὸς ἡμῶν , bound to us in the ties of closest love for our good, as well as to fulfil His own eternal purpose. On the question, whether the genitive ἡμῶν depends on both, or only on the latter of the two nouns θεοῦ κ . πατρός , I agree in Ellicott’s conclusion, that as πατρός is regularly anarthrous, and thus purely grammatical considerations are confounded, as θεός conveys one absolute idea, while πατήρ might convey many relative ones, it is natural to believe that the Apostle may have added a defining genitive to πατήρ , which he did not intend to be referred to θεός . Render therefore, <strong> God and our Father</strong> , not ‘ <em> our God and Father</em> .’</p>
