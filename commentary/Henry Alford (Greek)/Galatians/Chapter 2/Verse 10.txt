<p><strong> 10</strong> . <strong> μόν. τ. πτ. ἵνα μν.</strong> ] The genitive is put before the conjunction for emphasis: see reff., and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:29">John 13:29</span> , where remarkably enough it is the same word which precedes ἵνα , … τοῖς πτωχοῖς ἵνα τὶ δῷ . The construction is complete without supplying any participle ( αἰτοῦντες or παρακαλοῦντες ), depending upon ἔδωκαν .

<p><strong> ὃ καὶ ἐσπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτὸ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ποι</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> which was the very thing that I also was anxious to do</strong> , viz., then and always: it was my habit. So that ἐσπούδασα has not a pluperfect sense. He uses the singular, because the plural could not correctly be predicated of the whole time to which the verb refers: for he parted from Barnabas shortly after the council in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:0">Acts 15:0</span> . Meyer understands ἐσπούδ . of the time subsequent to the council only: but this does not seem necessary. The proofs of this σπουδή on his part may be found, Rom 15:25-27 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:1-4">1 Corinthians 16:1-4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:17">Acts 24:17</span> ; which, though they probably happened after the date of our Epistle, yet shewed the bent of his habitual wishes on this point.

<p><strong> αὐτὸ τοῦτο</strong> is not merely redundant, as in ἧς εἶχεν τὸ θυγάτριον αὐτῆς πνεῦμα ἀκάθαρτον , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:25">Mark 7:25</span> , but is an emphatic repetition of that to which ὅ refers, as in the version above. So that ὃ ἐσπ . αὐτὸ τοῦτο ποι . = καὶ ἐσπ . τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ποι . Cf. Thuc. i. 10, Ἀθηναίων δὲ τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο παθόντων . Cf. Ellicott’s note.</p>
