So that παραβ . ἐμ . συνιστ . is the explanation of ἁμαρτωλοὶ εὑρέθημεν ). The <em> force</em> of the verse is, ‘You, by now reasserting the obligation of the law, are proving ( <em> quoad te</em> ) that your former step of setting aside the law was in fact a <em> transgression</em> of it:’ viz. in that you neglected and set it aside, not, as Chrys., Thl., and Meyer (from Gal 2:19 ), because the law itself was leading you on to faith in Christ: for (1) that point is not yet raised, not belonging to this portion of the argument, and (2) by the hypothesis of this verse the ἐγώ has <em> given up</em> the faith in Christ, and so cannot be regarded as acknowledging it as the end of the law.
