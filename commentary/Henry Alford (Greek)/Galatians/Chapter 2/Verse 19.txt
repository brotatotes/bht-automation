<p><strong> 19</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (the <strong> γάρ</strong> (agst Ellic.) retains, on our view of παραβάτης , its full exemplifying force) <strong> I</strong> ( <strong> ἐγώ</strong> , for the first time expressed, is marked and emphatic. The first person of the <em> last</em> verse, serves as the transition point to treating, as he now does, of HIS OWN state and course. And this ἐγώ , as that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:0">Romans 7:0</span> , is purely and bona fide ‘I Paul;’ not ‘I and all believers’) <strong> by means of the law died to the law</strong> (Christ was the end of the law for righteousness: the law itself, properly apprehended by me, was my παιδαγωγός to Christ: and in Christ, who fulfilled the law, I died to the law: i.e. satisfied the law’s requirements, and passed out of its pale: the dative, as Ellic. remarks, is a sort of dativus commodi, as also in ζῆν θεῷ ) <strong> that I should live to God</strong> (the end of Christ’s work, LIFE unto God. <strong> ζήσω</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:0">Isaiah 1:0</span> aor. subj. in subordination to the aor. preceding: not fut., as stated in former edd. [before 1865]. See Ellic.). Many of the Fathers (some as an <em> alternative</em> ), Luther, Bengel, al., take the first νόμος here to mean the Gospel (the νόμος τοῦ πνεύματος τῆς ζωῆς of Rom 8:2 ); but it will be manifest to any who follow the argument, that this cannot be so. This διὰ νόμου νόμῳ ἀπέθανον is in fact a compendium of his expanded experience in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:0">Romans 7:0</span> ; and also of his argument in ch. Gal 3:4 below.

<p><strong> I am</strong> (‘ <em> and have been</em> ,’ perf.) <strong> crucified with Christ</strong> (specification of the foregoing ἀπέθανον : the way in which I died to the law was, by being united to, and involved in the death of, that Body of Christ which was crucified): <strong> but it is no longer I that live, but</strong> (it is) <strong> Christ that liveth in me</strong> (the punctuation χρ . συνεσταύρωμαι , ζῶ δέ · οὐκέτι ἐγώ , ζῇ δὲ ἐν ἐμ . χρ ., as in E. V., &amp;c. is altogether wrong, and would require ἀλλά before οὐκέτι . The construction is one not without example, where the emphatic word is repeated in two parallel clauses, each time with δέ . Thus Eur. Iph. Taur. 1367, φιλεῖς δὲ καὶ σὺ τὸν κασίγνητον , θεά · φιλεῖν δὲ κἀμὲ τοὺς ὁμαίμονας δόκει : Xen. Cyr. vi. 2. 22, ἔνθα πολὺς μὲν οἶνος , πολλὰ δὲ σῦκα , πολὺ δὲ ἔλαιον , θάλαττα δὲ προσκλύζει . So that our second δέ is not <em> sondern</em> , ‘ <em> not I, but</em> ,’ but <em> aber</em> , as the first q. d. ‘but the life is not mine, but the life is Christ’s within me.’ Notice, not ὁ ἐν ἐμοὶ χρ .: Christ is the vine, we the branches: He lives, He, the same Christ, through and in every one of His believing people) but (taken up again, parallel with ζῶ δὲ … ζῇ δέ ) <strong> that which</strong> (i.e. ‘the life which,’ as E. V.) <strong> I now</strong> (since my conversion, as contrasted with the time before: not, as Rück., al., the <em> present</em> life contrasted with the <em> future</em> ) <strong> live in the flesh</strong> (in the fleshly body; which, though it appear to be a mere animal life, is not. So Luth.: “in carne quidem vivo, sed ego hanc vitam quantulacunque est, quæ in me agitur, non habeo pro vita. Non enim est vere vita, sed tantum larva vitæ, sub qua vivit alius, nempe Christus, qui est vere vita mea”) <strong> I live in</strong> (not ‘ <em> by</em> ,’ as E. V., Chr. ( διὰ τὴν πίστιν ), Œc., Thl., Thdrt. ( διὰ τῆς πίστεως ): ἐν π . corresponds to ἐν σαρκί : <em> faith</em> , and <em> not the flesh</em> , is the real element in which I live) <strong> faith, viz. that</strong> (the article particularizes, what sort of faith) <strong> of</strong> (having for its object, see on Gal 2:16 ) <strong> the Son of God</strong> (so named for solemnity, and because His eternal Sonship is the source of His life-giving power, cf. Joh 5:25-26 ) <strong> who loved me</strong> (the link, which binds the eternal Son of God to me) <strong> and</strong> (proved that love. in that He) <strong> gave Himself up</strong> (to death) <strong> for me</strong> (on my behalf).</p>
