<p><strong> στύλοι</strong> ] pillars, i.e. principal supporters of the church, men of distinction and weight; see reff., and examples in Wetst.: and Suicer, sub voce. Clem.-rom. ad Cor. i. 5, p. 217, uses the word directly, without metaphor: οἱ δικαιότατοι στύλοι ἐδιώχθησαν .

<p><strong> δεξ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἔδωκ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κοιν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] On the separation of the genitive from its governing noun, see Winer, § 30. 3, remark 2. It is made here, because what follows respects rather κοινωνίας than ἔδωκαν .

<p><strong> ἵνα κ</strong> <strong> .</strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> .</strong> <strong> λ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] There is an ellipsis of some verb; πορευθῶμεν and - θῶσιν , or perhaps εὐαγγελιζώμεθα , - ζωνται which might connect with εἰς (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:25">1 Peter 1:25</span> . But Meyer objects that it is not found with εἰς in St. Paul): or as Beza, ἀπόστολοι γενώμεθα . Similar ellipses occur <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:16">Romans 4:16</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:13">Galatians 5:13</span> . This division of labour was not, and could not be, strictly observed. Every where in the Acts we find St. Paul preaching ‘to the Jews first,’ and every where the Judaizers followed on his track; see Jowett’s note.</p>
