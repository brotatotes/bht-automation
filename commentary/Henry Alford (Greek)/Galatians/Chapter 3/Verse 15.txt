<p><strong> 15</strong> .] τί ἐστι <strong> κατʼ ἄνθρ. λέγω</strong> ; ἐξ ἀνθρωπίνων παραδειγμάτων . Chr. But (see 1Co 15:32 ) the expression refers not only to the character of the example chosen, but to the temporary standing-point of him who speaks: I put myself for the time on a level with ordinary men in the world.

<p><strong> ὅμως</strong> is out of its logical place, which would be after οὐδείς ; see on ref. 1 Cor. To make it ‘ <em> even</em> ’ and take it with ἀνθρώπου , is contrary to its usage. <strong> A</strong> (mere) <strong> man’s covenant</strong> (not ‘testament,’ as Olsh., after Aug., al.; for there is here no introduction of that idea: the promise spoken to Abraham was strictly a <em> covenant</em> , and designated διαθήκη in the passages which were now in the Apostle’s mind, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:18">Genesis 15:18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:7">Genesis 17:7</span> . On the general meaning, see Mr. Bagge’s note) <strong> when ratified</strong> (reff.), <strong> no one notwithstanding</strong> (that it is merely a human covenant) <strong> sets aside or supplements</strong> (with new conditions, Jos. Antt. xvii. 9. 4 describes Archelaus as ὁ ἐν ταῖς <strong> ἐπιδιαθήκαις</strong> ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρὸς ἐγγεγραμμένος βασιλεύς , ‘in his father’s subsequent testament:’ and again says of Antipas, B. J. ii. 2. 3, ἀξιῶν τῆς <strong> ἐπιδιαθήκης</strong> τὴν διαθήκην εἶναι κυριωτέραν , ἐν <strong> ᾗ</strong> βασιλεὺς αὐτὸς ἐγέγραπτο . Nothing is implied as to the nature of the additions, whether consistent or inconsistent with the original covenant: the simple fact that <em> no additions are made</em> , is enounced).</p>
