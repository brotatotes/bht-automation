Gal 2:16 ) <strong> the works of the Law</strong> (not a Law) <strong> receive the Spirit</strong> (evidently here to be taken as including <em> all His gifts</em> , spiritual and external: not as Chr., Thl., Jer., χαρίσματα only: for the two are distinguished in Gal 3:5 ), <strong> or from the hearing of faith</strong> (meaning either, ‘ <em> that preaching which proclaimed faith</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> that hearing, which received</em> ( <em> the</em> ) <em> faith</em> .’ The first is preferable, because (1) where their first receiving the Gospel is in question, the <em> preaching</em> of it would probably be hinted at, as it is indeed taken up by the οὖν below, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:5">Galatians 3:5</span> ; (2) where the question is concerning the power of faith as contrasted with the works of the law, faith would most likely be <em> subjective</em> .
