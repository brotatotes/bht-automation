<p><strong> 27</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (substantiates and explains the assertion of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:26">Galatians 3:26</span> ; see below) <strong> as many of you as were baptized into</strong> (see Rom 6:3 and notes) <strong> Christ, put on Christ</strong> (at that time, compare the aorists in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:2">Acts 19:2</span> ; not “ <em> have been baptized</em> ,” and “ <em> have put on</em> ,” as E. V., which leaves the two actions only concomitant: the aorists make them identical: as many as were baptized into Christ, did, in that very act, put on, clothe yourselves with, Christ: see Ellicott’s note). The force of the argument is well given by Chrys.: τίνος ἕνεκεν οὐκ εἶπεν , ὅσοι γὰρ εἰς χριστὸν ἐβαπτίσθητε , ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐγεννήθητε ; τὸ γὰρ ἀκόλουθον τοῦ δεῖξαι υἱοὺς τοῦτο ἦν . ὅτι πολὺ φρικωδέστερον αὐτὸ τιθησιν . εἰ γὰρ ὁ χριστὸς υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ , σὺ δὲ αὐτὸν ἐνδέδυσαι , τὸν υἱὸν ἔχων ἐν ἑαυτῷ κ . πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀφομοιωθείς , εἰς μίαν συγγένειαν κ . μίαν ἰδέαν ἤχθης . Observe here how boldly and broadly St. Paul asserts the effect of Baptism on all ( πάντες γὰρ … and ὅσοι ἐβαπτ .) the baptized. Luther remarks: “Hic locus diligenter observandus est contra fanaticos spiritus, qui majestatem baptismi extenuant, et sceleste et impie de eo loquuntur. Paulus contra magnificis titulis baptismum ornat, appellans lavacrum regenerationis ac renovationis Sp. sancti ( Tit 3:5 ), et hic dicit omnes baptisatos Christum induisse, quasi dicat: non accepistis per baptismum tesseram, per quam adscripti estis in numerum christianorum, ut nostro tempore multi fanatici homines senserunt, qui ex baptismo tantum tesseram fecerunt, hoc est, breve et inane quoddam signum, sed ‘quotquot’ inquit etc.: id est, estis extra legem rapti in novam nativitatem, quæ facta est in baptismo.” But we may notice too, as Meyer remarks, that the very putting on of Christ, which as matter of standing and profession is done in baptism, forms a subject of exhortation to those already baptized, in its ethical sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:14">Romans 13:14</span> .</p>
