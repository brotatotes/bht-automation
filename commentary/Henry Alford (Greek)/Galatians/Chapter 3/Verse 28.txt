<p><strong> 28</strong> .] The absolute equality of all in this sonship, to the obliteration of all differences of earthly extraction or position. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+3:11">Colossians 3:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:12">Romans 10:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span> . οὐκ ἔνι = οὐκ ἔνεστιν ‘il n’y a pas:’ De Wette quotes Plato, Gorg. 507, ὅτῳ δὲ μὴ ἔνι κοινωνία , φιλία οὐκ ἂν εἴη . Buttmann (ii. 299), Kühner (i. 671), Winer (§ 14. 2, remark), maintain ἔνι to be a form of the preposition ἐν , and the same of ἔπι , πάρα , &amp;c. But Meyer replies, that all those passages are against this view, where ἔνι and ἐν occur together, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:5">1 Corinthians 6:5</span> ; Xen. Anab. v. 3. 11. Observe, Ἰουδ . <strong> οὐδὲ</strong> Ἕλλ ., δοῦλος <strong> οὐδὲ</strong> ἐλεύθ ., but ἄρσεν <strong> καὶ</strong> θῆλυ : the two former being accidental distinctions which may be entirely put off in falling back on our humanity, but the latter a necessary distinction, absorbed however in the higher category: q. d. “there is no distinction into male and female.” ἄρσεν κ . θῆλυ , generalized by the neuter, as being the only gender which will express both.

<p><strong> γάρ</strong> , reason why there is neither, &amp;c. viz. our unity in Christ. On the unavoidable inference from an assertion like this, that Christianity did alter the condition of women and slaves, see Jowett’s note.

<p><strong> εἷς</strong> , more forcible and more strict than ἕν : for we are one, <em> in Him</em> , εἷς καινὸς ἄνθρωπος , as he says in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span> , speaking on this very subject.</p>
