<p><strong> 5</strong> .] <strong> οὖν</strong> takes up again the question of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:2">Galatians 3:2</span> , and asks it in another form. There is a question whether the participles <strong> ἐπιχορηγῶν</strong> and <strong> ἐνεργῶν</strong> are present, referring to things done among them while the Apostle was <em> writing</em> , or imperfect, still spoken of the time when he was with them? Chrys., Thdrt., &amp;c., and Bengel, al., maintain the latter: Luth., Calv., Rück., Meyer, De W., &amp;c., the former. It seems to me, that this question must be settled by first determining who is the agent here spoken of. Is it the Apostle? or is it not rather GOD, and is not this indicated by the reference to Abraham’s faith in the next verse, and the taking up the passive ἐλογίσθη by δικαιοῖ <strong> ὁ θεός</strong> in Gal 3:8 ? If it be so, then the participles here must be taken as present, but indefinite, in a substantive sense (Winer), as ὁ διώκων ἡμᾶς ποτέ , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:23">Galatians 1:23</span> . And certainly God alone can be said (and so in ref. 2 Cor.) ἐπιχορηγεῖν τὸ πνεῦμα , and ἐνεργεῖν (Ch. Gal 2:8 ) δυνάμεις ἐν ὑμῖν (see below).

<p><strong> ἐπιχορ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The ἐπί does not imply <em> addition</em> , but as so often with prepositions of motion in composition, the <em> direction</em> of the supply: see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:7">Acts 27:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:16">Romans 8:16</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> δυνάμεις</strong> ] here, not merely <em> miracles</em> or χαρίσματα , though those are included: nor is ἐν ὑμῖν , ‘ <em> among you</em> ;’ but <strong> δυν</strong> <strong> .</strong> are the wonders wrought by divine Power <strong> in you</strong> (cf. θεὸς ὁ ἐνεργῶν τὰ πάντα ἐν πᾶσιν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:6">1 Corinthians 12:6</span> . θεὸς γάρ ἐστιν ὁ ἐνεργῶν ἐν ὑμῖν τὸ θέλειν κ . τ . λ . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:13">Philippians 2:13</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span> ; also Mat 14:2 ), viz. at your conversion and since.

<p><strong> ἐξ ἔργ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] (supply <strong> does He it</strong> ) <strong> in consequence of</strong> (“as the originating or moving cause,” Ellic.) <strong> the works of the law</strong> , or <strong> in consequence of the hearing</strong> (see above, Gal 3:2 ) <strong> of faith?</strong></p>
