<p><strong> 12</strong> .] This has been variously understood. But the only rendering which seems to answer the requirements of the construction and the context, is that which understands εἰμι or γέγονα after ἐγώ , and refers it to the Apostle having in his own practice cast off Jewish habits and become as the Galatians: i.e. a Gentile: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:20-21">1 Corinthians 9:20-21</span> . And so Winer, Neander, Fritz., De W., Meyer, Jowett (alt.), &amp;c. (2) Chrys., Thdrt., Thl., Erasm.-par., al., regard it as said to Jewish believers, and explain, τοῦτον εἷχον πάλαι τὸν ζῆλον · σφόδρα τὸν νόμον ἐπόθουν · ἀλλ ʼ ὁρᾶτε πῶς μεταβέβλημαι . ταύτην τοίνυν καὶ ὑμεῖς ζηλώσατε τὴν μεταβολήν (Thdrt.). But to this Meyer rightly objects, that ἤμην , which would in this case have to be supplied, must have been <em> expressed</em> , as being emphatic, and cites from Justin ad Græcos, c. 2, where however I cannot find it, γίνεσθε ὡς ἐγώ , ὅτι κἀγὼ ἤμην ὡς ὑμεῖς . (3) Jerome, Erasm.-not., Corn.-a-lap., Estius, Michaelis, Rückert, Olsh., ‘… as also I have accommodated myself to you.’ But thus the second member of the sentence will not answer to the first. (4) Luther, Beza, Calvin, Grot., Bengel, Morus, Peile, al., would understand it, ‘love me, as I love you’ (“accipite hanc meam objurgationem eo animo quo vos objurgavi: … sit in vobis is affectus erga me, qui est in me erga vos,” Luth.). But nothing has been said of a want of <em> love</em> : and certainly had this been meant, it would have been more plainly expressed. The words ἀδελφοί , δέομαι ὑμῶν are by Chrys., Thdrt., al., Luther, Koppe, al., joined to the following: but wrongly, for there is no δέησις in what follows.

<p><strong> οὐδέν με ἠδικήσατε</strong> ] The key to rightly understanding these words is, their apposition with ἐξουθενήσατε , … ἐξεπτύσατε … ἐδέξασθε below. To that period they refer: viz. to the time when he first preached the Gospel among them, and the first introduction of this period seems to be in the words, ὅτι κἀγὼ ὡς ὑμεῖς . Then I became as you: and at that time you did me no wrong, but on the contrary shewed me all sympathy and reverence. Then comes in the inference, put in the form of a question, at <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:16">Galatians 4:16</span> , I must then have <em> since</em> become your enemy by telling you the truth. The other explanations seem all more or less beside the purpose: δηλῶν ὅτι οὐ μίσους , οὐδὲ ἔχθρας ἦν τὰ εἰρημένα … Chrys., and similarly Thl., Aug., Pel., Luth., Calv. (‘non excandesco mea causa, nec quod vobis sim infensus’), Estius, Winer, al., which would be irrelevant, and indeed preposterous without some introduction after the affection of the foregoing words: ‘ <em> ye have done me no wrong</em> ,’ i.e. ‘ex animo omnia condonabat si resipiscerentur,’ Beza: so Bengel, Rückert, al., which is refuted by the aorist ἠδικήσατε , of some definite <em> time</em> . The same is true of ‘ye have wronged not me but yourselves’ (Ambr., Corn.-a-lap., Schött.), ‘… not me, but God, or Christ’ (Grot. al.).</p>
