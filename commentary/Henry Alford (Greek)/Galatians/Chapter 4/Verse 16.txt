Not <em> at his first visit</em> , from the whole tenor of this passage: nor <em> in this letter</em> , as some think (Jer., Luther, al.), which they had <em> not yet read</em> ; but at his <em> second visit</em> , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:23">Acts 18:23</span> , when he probably found the mischief beginning, and spoke plainly against it. Cf. similar expressions in Wetst.: especially ‘obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit,’ Ter. Andr. i. 1. 40: ὀργίζονται ἅπαντες τοῖς μετὰ παῤῥησίας τ ʼ ἀληθῆ λέγουσι , Lucian, Abdic. 7.</p>
