<p><strong> 18</strong> .] Two meanings are open to us: (1) as E. V. (apparently: but perhaps ‘zealously affected’ may be meant for the passive for ‘earnestly courted’) and many Commentators taking ζηλοῦσθαι as middle or passive with a signification nearly the same, ‘ <em> it is good to be zealously affected in a good cause, and not only during my presence with you</em> :’ in which case the sense must be referred back to vv.13 15, and the allusion must be to their zeal while he was with them. But, considering that this context is broken at <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:17">Galatians 4:17</span> , that the words ζηλοῦσθαι ἐν καλῷ are an evident reference to ζηλοῦσιν ὑμ . οὐ καλῶς , and that the wider context of the whole passage adduces a contrast between their conduct when he was with them and now, I think it much better (2) to explain thus: ‘I do not mean to blame them in the abstract for τὸ ζηλοῦν ὑμᾶς : any teacher who did this καλῶς , preaching Christ, would be a cause of joy to me ( Php 1:15-18 ): and it is an honourable thing (for you) to be the objects of this zeal (‘ambiri’) ἐν καλῷ , in a good cause (I still cannot see how this rendering of ἐν καλῷ ‘ <em> alters the meaning of the verb</em> ’ (Ellic.): it rather seems to me that the non-use of καλῶς , while the paronomasia is retained, leads to this meaning), at all times and by every body, not only when I am (or was) present with you:’ q. d. ‘I have no wish, in thus writing, to set up an exclusive claim to ζηλοῦν ὑμᾶς whoever will really teach you good, at any time, let him do it and welcome.’ Then the next verse follows naturally also, in which he narrows the relation between himself and them, from the wide one of a mere ζηλωτής , to the closer one of their parent in Christ, much as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:14">1 Corinthians 4:14</span> f., ὡς τέκνα μου ἀγαπητὰ νουθετῶ · ἐὰν γὰρ μυρίους παιδαγωγοὺς ἔχητε ἐν χριστῷ , ἀλλ ʼ οὐ πολλοὺς πατέρας · ἐν γὰρ χρ . Ἰησοῦ διὰ τ . εὐαγγελίου ἐγὼ ὑμᾶς ἐγέννησα .

<p>On other interpretations, I may remark, ( α ) that after ζηλοῦσιν , the strict passive meaning is the only suitable one for ζηλοῦσθαι , as it is indeed the only one justified by usage: ( β ) that ζηλόω must keep its meaning throughout, which will exclude all such renderings as ‘ <em> invidiose tractari</em> ’ here (Koppe): ( γ ) that all applications of the sentence to the Apostle himself as its object ( ἐν καλῷ , in the matter of a good teacher, as Estius, Corn.-a-lap., al.) are beside the purpose.</p>
