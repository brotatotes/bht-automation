There is a contrast in the δέ between his present anxiety in absence from them and his former παρεῖναι <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:18">Galatians 4:18</span> ; similar constructions with δέ are frequent, especially after vocatives, when some particular is adduced more or less inconsistent with the <em> address</em> which has preceded: thus Hom. Il. ο . 244, Ἕκτορ , υἱὲ Πριάμοιο , τίη δὲ σὺ νόσφιν ἀπ ʼ ἄλλων | ἧσ ʼ ὀλιγηπελέων ; Eur.

But surely such a change would be altogether beside the tone of this deeply affectionate address. I should rather hold, with Meyer, from my former severity, when I became your enemy by ἀληθεύων ὑμῖν , to the softness and mildness of a mother, still ἀληθεύων , but in another tone. The great majority of Commentators understand ἀλλάξαι as Corn.-a-lap. (Mey.): ‘ut scilicet quasi mater nunc blandirer, nunc gemerem, nunc obsecrarem, nunc objurgarem vos.’ But so much can hardly be contained in the mere word ἀλλάξαι without some addition, such as πρὸς τὸν καιρόν , πρὸς τὸ συμφέρον ( 1Co 12:7 ), or the like): <strong> for I am perplexed about you</strong> (not ‘ <em> I am suspected among you</em> ,’ but ἐν ὑμῖν as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:16">2 Corinthians 7:16</span> , θαῤῥῶ ἐν ὑμῖν , the element in which: the other is irrelevant, and inconsistent with the N. T. usage of ἀποροῦμαι : see reff. The verb is passive: Meyer quotes Demosth. p. 830. 2, πολλὰ τοίνυν ἀπορηθεὶς περὶ τούτων κ . καθ ʼ ἕκαστον ἐξελεγχόμενος , and Sir 18:7 , ὅταν παύσηται , τότε ἀπορηθήσεται ).</p>
