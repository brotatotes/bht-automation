<p><strong> 31</strong> .] I am inclined to think, against Meyer, De W., Ellic., &amp;c., that this verse is, as commonly taken, the conclusion from what has gone before: and that the διό is bound on to the κληρονομήσῃ preceding. For that we are κληρονόμοι , is an acknowledged fact, established before, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:29">Galatians 3:29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:7">Galatians 4:7</span> . And if we are, we are not the children of the handmaid, of whom it was said οὐ μὴ κληρονομ ., but of the free-woman, of whose son the same words asserted that he should inherit. Observe in the first clause παιδίσκης is anarthrous: most likely because emphatically prefixed to its governing noun (cf. ἐθνῶν ἀπόστολος , Rom 11:13 ): but possibly, as indefinite, q. d. we are the children of no bondwoman, but of the freewoman. I prefer the former reason, as most consonant to N. T. diction. V.</p>
