<p><strong> 4</strong> .] <strong> τὸ πλήρωμα τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> χρόνου</strong> (‘that whereby the time was filled up:’ see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span> , Fritzsche’s note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:12">Romans 11:12</span> , and Stier’s, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:0">Ephesians 1:0</span> . p. 199 ff. for a discussion of the meanings of πλήρωμα ) answers to the προθεσμία τ . πατρός , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:2">Galatians 4:2</span> ; see reff. The Apostle uses this term with regard not only to the absolute will of God, but to the preparations which were made for the Redeemer on this earth: partly as Thl., ὅτε πᾶν εἶδος κακίας διεξελθοῦσα ἡ φύσις ἡ ἀνθρωπίνη ἐδεῖτο θεραπείας , partly as Bengel, ‘suas etiam ecclesia ætates habet.’ The manifestation of man’s guilt was complete: and the way of the Lord was prepared, by various courses of action which He had brought about by men as his instruments.

<p><strong> ἐξαπέστ</strong> <strong> .</strong> cannot, however little, for the purposes of the present argument, the divine side of our Lord’s mission is to be pressed, mean any thing less than <strong> sent forth from Himself</strong> (reff.).

<p><strong> γενόμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐκ γυν</strong> <strong> .</strong> will not bear being pressed, as Calv., Grot., Estius, al., have done (“discernere Christum a reliquis voluit hominibus: quia ex semine matris creatus sit, non viri et mulieris coitu,” Calv.): it is Christ’s HUMANITY which is the point insisted on, not His being born of a virgin. On the other hand, the words cannot for an instant be adduced as <em> inconsistent</em> with such birth: they state generically, what all Christians are able, from the Gospel record, to fill up specifically.

<p><strong> γενόμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὑπὸ νόμον</strong> ] ‘ <em> born of a woman</em> ,’ identified Him with all mankind: <strong> born under</strong> (the idea of motion conveyed by the accusative after ὑπό is accounted for by the transition implied in γενόμενος ) <strong> the law</strong> , introduces another condition, in virtue of which He became the Redeemer of those who were under a special revelation and covenant. A Gentile could not (humanly speaking, as far as God has conditioned His own proceedings) have saved the world: for the Jews were the representative nation, to which the representative man must belong. <strong> γενόμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is both times emphatic, and therefore not to be here rendered ‘legi subjectum,’ as Luther, ‘ <em> unter das Gesess gethan</em> .’</p>
