Here the propriety of the expression is even more strikingly manifest than there: the Galatians did not so much acquire the knowledge of God, as they were taken into knowledge, recognized, by Him, προσληφθέντες ὑπὸ θεοῦ , Thl.: οὐδὲ γὰρ ὑμεῖς καμόντες εὕρετε τὸν θεόν , … αὐτὸς δὲ ὑμᾶς ἐπεσπάσατο , Chrys. And this made their fall from Him the more matter of indignant appeal, as being a resistance of His will respecting them. No change of the meaning of <strong> γνωσθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> must be resorted to, as ‘ <em> approved</em> ,’ ‘ <em> loved</em> ’ (Grot., al.: see others in De W. and Mey.): cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:12">Matthew 25:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:19">2 Timothy 2:19</span> .

Or both words may perhaps refer back to the state of childhood hinted at in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:6">Galatians 4:6</span> , during which the heir is ἀσθενής , as immature, and πτωχός , as not yet in possession. But this would not strictly apply to the elements as the Gentiles were concerned with them: see below. On στοιχεῖα , see note, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:3">Galatians 4:3</span> .

<p><strong> πάλιν</strong> ] These Galatians had never been <em> Jews</em> before: but they had been be fore under the στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου , under which generic term both Jewish and Gentile cultus was comprised: so that they were turning back again to these elements.
