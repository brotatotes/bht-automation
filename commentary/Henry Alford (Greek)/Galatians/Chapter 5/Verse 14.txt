<p><strong> 14</strong> .] See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:8-9">Romans 13:8-9</span> . The rec. reading πληροῦται would mean merely ‘ <em> is in course of being fulfilled</em> ,’ whereas now it is, ‘is fulfilled:’ not ‘ <em> comprehended</em> ’ (Luth., Calv., Olsh., Winer, al.). “The question, how the Apostle can rightly say of the <em> whole</em> law, that it is fulfilled by loving one’s neighbour, must not be answered by understanding νόμος of the <em> Christian</em> law (Koppe), or of the <em> moral</em> law only (Estius, al.), or of the <em> second</em> table of the decalogue (Beza, al.), or of every divinely revealed law in general (Schött.); for ὁ πᾶς νόμος cannot from the circumstances of the whole Epistle, mean any thing but ‘ <em> the whole law of Moses</em> :’ but by placing ourselves on the lofty spiritual level from which St. Paul looked down, and saw all other commands of the law so far subordinated to the law of love, that whoever had fulfilled <em> this</em> command, must be treated as having fulfilled the whole.” Meyer: who also remarks that τὸν πλησίον σου applies to fellow-Christians; cf. ἀλλήλους below.</p>
