The emphasis is on <strong> παντί</strong> , substantiating, and carrying further, the last verse. <strong> ὅλον</strong> has the stress. The circumcised man became a ‘proselyte of righteousness,’ and bound to keep the whole law. “This true and serious consequence of circumcision the false Apostles had probably at least dissembled.” Mey.</p>
