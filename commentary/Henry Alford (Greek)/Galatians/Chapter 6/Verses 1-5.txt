This makes it necessary to assign a meaning to it which shall justify its emphatic position. And such meaning is clearly not found in the ordinary renderings. E.g. Chrysostom, ἐὰν συναρπαγῇ , so E. V. ‘ <em> overtaken</em> ,’ and De Wette, al., which could not be emphatic, but would be palliative: Grotius, ‘ <em> si quis antea</em> (h.e. antequam hæc ep. ad vos veniat) <em> deprehensus fuerit</em> :’ Winer, ‘ <em> etiam si</em> (si vel) <em> quis antea deprehensus fuerit in peccato, eum tamen</em> (iterum peccantem) <em> corrigite</em> :’ Olsh., who regards the προ - almost as expletive, betokening merely that the λαμβάνεσθαι comes in time before the καταρτίζειν . The only meaning which satisfies the emphasis is that of being caught in the fact, ‘ <em> flagrante delicto</em> ,’ before he can escape: which, though unusual, seems justified by ref. Wisd.: and so Meyer, Ellic., al.) <strong> in any transgression</strong> (with the meaning ‘overtaken’ for προλημφθῇ , falls also that of ‘ <em> inadvertence</em> ’ for <strong> παράπτωμα</strong> <strong> .</strong> The stronger meaning of ‘ <em> sin</em> ,’ is far commoner in St. Paul: see ref.
