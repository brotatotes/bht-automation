<p><strong> 11</strong> .] <strong> They</strong> (seems most naturally to refer to οί οὐρανοί immediately preceding. There is no reason in the Psalm why the pronoun should not represent both antecedents, the heavens and the earth. Here, however, the subsequent context seems to determine the application to be only to the heavens: for to them only can be referred the following image, ὡσεὶ περιβόλαιον ἑλίξεις αὐτούς ) <strong> shall perish</strong> (as far as concerns their present state, cf. ἀλλαγήσονται below. ἐδήλωσε καὶ τῆς κτίσεως τὴν ἐπὶ τὸ κρεῖττον μεταβολὴν ἀπ ʼ αὐτοῦ γεννησομένην , αὐτοῦ δὲ τὸ ἄναρχον καὶ ἀνώλεθρον . Thdrt. On this change, see the opinions of the Fathers in Suicer, vol. ii. pp. 151 2, 365, and 520 B), <strong> but thou remainest</strong> (Bleek prefers the fut. διαμενεῖς , see var. readd., on the ground of the verbs being all future in the Heb. text. But perhaps the consideration alleged by Lünemann, that the Writer, using only the LXX, seems to place σὺ δὲ διαμένεις and σὺ δὲ ὁ αὐτὸς εἶ as parallel clauses, is of more weight than the other. De Wette, on the Ps., renders the Hebrew verbs <em> present</em> : <em> Dieselben vergehen, doch du bestehest</em> . <strong> δια</strong> μένω , as in reff. and Ps. 118:90, ἐθεμελίωσας τὴν γῆν καὶ διαμένει . The preposition gives the sense of endurance through all changes): <strong> and they all shall wax old as a garment</strong> (see besides reff. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+51:6">Isaiah 51:6</span> , ἡ δὲ γῆ ὡς ἱμάτιον παλαιωθήσεται : ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:9">Isaiah 50:9</span> ; and Sir 14:17 , πᾶσα σὰρξ ὡς ἱμάτιον παλαιοῦται ), <strong> and as a mantle</strong> ( <strong> περιβόλαιον</strong> (reff.) is a word of unusual occurrence, found principally in the later classics; but also in Eurip. Herc. Fur. 549, θανάτου περιβόλαι ʼ ἀνήμμεθα , and 1269, σαρκὸς περιβόλαια ἡβῶντα . It, as περιβολή , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:11">Genesis 49:11</span> , signifies any enveloping, enwrapping garment) <strong> shalt thou fold them up</strong> (the Heb. here and apparently some copies of the LXX have the same verb as below: תַּחֲלִיפֵם וִיַחֲלֹפוּ , ἀλλάξεις αὐτοὺς καὶ ἀλλαγήσονται , “thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed.” See also var. readd. here. LXX-A (not F.), with which [14] [15] agree, reads as our text: and there can be little doubt that the Writer of this Epistle followed that text as usual. Grot. thinks ἑλίξεις has come into the Greek text from ref. Isa., ἑλιγήσεται ὁ οὐρανὸς ὡς βιβλίον . See also ref. Rev.), <strong> and they shall be changed</strong> (viz. as a mantle is folded up to be put away when a fresh one is about to be put on. Bleek quotes, as illustrating the idea, Philo de Profug. § 20, vol. i. p. 562, ἐνδύεται δὲ ὁ μὲν πρεσβύτατος τοῦ ὄντος λόγος ὡς ἐσθῆτα τὸν κόσμον · γῆν γὰρ καὶ ὓδωρ καὶ ἀέρα καὶ πῦρ κ . τὰ ἐκ τούτων ἐπαμπίσχεται ): <strong> but Thou art the same</strong> (Heb. וְאַתָּה הוּא , “and Thou art He:” viz. He, which Thou hast ever been: cf. Isa 46:4 Heb. and E. V. Bleek compares Philo, de Profug. § 11, p. 554: ἥλιος γὰρ οὐκ ἀλλαττόμενος ὁ αὐτός ἐστιν ἀεὶ κ . τ . λ .), <strong> and thy years shall not fail</strong> (Heb., “Thy years end not,” are never completed: so LXX render the same verb תָּמַם by ἐκλείπειν , Ps. 103:35: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ki+16:11">1 Kings 16:11</span> ; (4) <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+7:13">2 Kings 7:13</span> , &amp;c.). The account to be given of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+102:0">Psalms 102:0</span> seems to be as follows: according to its title it is “a prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the Lord.” It was probably written during the Babylonian exile (cf. 2Ki 1:14-15 ) by one who “waited for the consolation of Israel.” That consolation was to be found only in Israel’s covenant God, and the Messiah Israel’s deliverer. And the trust of Israel in this her Deliverer was ever directed to the comfort of her sons under the immediate trouble of the time, be that what it might. As generations went on, more and more was revealed of the Messiah’s office and work, and the hearts of God’s people entered deeper and deeper into the consolation to be derived from the hope of His coming. Here then we have this sorrowing one casting himself on the mercy of the great Deliverer, and extolling His faithfulness and firmness over, and as distinguished from, all the works of His hands. To apply then these words to the Redeemer, is to use them in their sense of strictest propriety. See Delitzsch’s note, where the whole matter is discussed.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [14] The CODEX VATICANUS, No. 1209 in the Vatican Library at Rome; and proved, by the old catalogues, to have been there from the foundation of the library in the 16th century. It was apparently, from internal evidence, copied in Egypt. It is on vellum, and contains the Old and New Testaments. In the latter, it is deficient from Heb 9:14 to the end of the Epistle; it does not contain the Epistles to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon; nor the Apocalypse. An edition of this celebrated codex, undertaken as long ago as 1828 by Cardinal Angelo Mai, has since his death been published at Rome. The defects of this edition are such, that it can hardly be ranked higher in usefulness than a tolerably complete collation, entirely untrustworthy in those places where it differs from former collations in representing the MS. as <em> agreeing with</em> the received text. An 8vo edition of the N.T. portion, newly revised by Vercellone, was published at Rome in 1859 (referred to as ‘Verc’): and of course superseded the English reprint of the 1st edition. Even in this 2nd edition there were imperfections which rendered it necessary to have recourse to the MS. itself, and to the partial collations made in former times. These are (1) that of Bartolocci (under the name of Giulio de St. Anastasia), once librarian at the Vatican, made in 1669, and preserved in manuscript in the Imperial Library (MSS. Gr. Suppl. 53) at Paris (referred to as ‘Blc’); (2) that of Birch (‘Bch’), published in various readings to the Acts and Epistles, Copenhagen, 1798, Apocalypse, 1800, Gospels, 1801; (3) that made for the great Bentley (‘Btly’), by the Abbate Mico, published in Ford’s Appendix to Woide’s edition of the Codex Alexandrinus, 1799 (it was made on the margin of a copy of Cephalæus’ Greek Testament, Argentorati, 1524, still amongst Bentley’s books in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge); (4) notes of alterations by the original scribe and other correctors. These notes were procured for Bentley by the Abbé de Stosch, and were till lately supposed to be lost. They were made by the Abbate Rulotta (‘Rl’), and are preserved amongst Bentley’s papers in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge (B. 17. 20) 1 . The Codex has been occasionally consulted for the verification of certain readings by Tregelles, Tischendorf, and others. A list of readings examined at Rome by the present editor (Feb. 1861), and by the Rev. E. C. Cure, Fellow of Merton College, Oxford (April 1862), will be found at the end of these prolegomena. A description, with an engraving from a photograph of a portion of a page, is given in Burgon’s “Letters from Rome,” London 1861. This most important MS. was probably written in the <em> fourth century</em> (Hug, Tischendorf, al.).

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [15] The CODEX SINAITICUS. Procured by Tischendorf, in 1859, from the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai. The Codex Frederico-Augustanus (now at Leipsic), obtained in 1844 from the same monastery, is a portion of the same copy of the Greek Bible, the 148 leaves of which, containing the entire New Testament, the Ep. of Barnabas, parts of Hermas, and 199 more leaves of the Septuagint, have now been edited by the discoverer. A magnificent edition prepared at the expense of the Emperor of Russia appeared in January, 1863, and a smaller edition containing the N.T. &amp;c., has been published by Dr. Tischendorf. The MS. has four columns on a page, and has been altered by several different correctors, one or more of whom Tischendorf considers to have lived in the sixth century. The work of the original scribe has been examined, not only by Tischendorf, but by Tregelles and other competent judges, and is by them assigned to the <em> fourth</em> <em> century</em> . The internal character of the text agrees with the external, as the student may judge for himself from the readings given in the digest. The principal correctors as distinguished by Tischendorf are: A, of the same age with the MS. itself, probably the corrector who revised the book, before it left the hands of the scribe, denoted therefore by us א -corr 1 ; B (cited as א 2 ), who in the first page of Matt. began inserting breathings, accents, &amp;c., but did not carry out his design, and touched only a few later passages; C a (cited as א 3a ) has corrected very largely throughout the book. Wherever in our digest a reading is cited as found in א 1 , it is to be understood, if no further statement is given, that C a altered it to that which is found in our text; C b (cited as א 3b ) lived about the same time as C a , i.e. some centuries later than the original scribe. These are all that we need notice here 6 .</p>
