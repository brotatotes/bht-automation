<p><strong> 3</strong> .] “The Son of God now becomes Himself the subject. The ‘verbum finitum’ belonging to the relative <strong> ὅς</strong> is not found till ἐκάθισεν at the end of the verse. But the intermediate participial clauses do not stand in the same relation to the main sentence. The first members, ὢν ἀπαύγασμα … δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ , still set forth those attributes of the Son of God which are of a permanent character, and belonging to Him before the Incarnation: whereas the following member, the last participial clause, stands in nearer relation to the main sentence, expressing as it does the purification of mankind from sin, wrought by the incarnate Son of God, as one individual historical event, as the antecedent of that exaltation of Him to the right hand of God, which the main sentence enounces.” Bleek.

<p><strong> Who</strong> (the <strong> ὅς</strong> represents, it will be evident, rather the præ-existent than the incarnate Logos. But it is perhaps a mistake to let this distinction be too prominent, and would lead to the idea of a change having taken place in the eternal relation of the Son to the Father, when He subjected himself to the conditions of space and time. Even then He could say of himself, ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ὁ ὢν ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ . See Ebrard’s note), <strong> being</strong> (cf. ὑπάρχων , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span> , also of His præ-existent and essential being. This comparison seems decisive against Hofmann, who (Schriftbeweis, i. 140 ff.) takes ὤν and φέρων according to his theory that all the attributes of the Son of God spoken of in the N. T. are adduced in connexion with and as manifested by His work of Redemption. See against this view Delitzsch, h. l. p. 7. But it must also be remembered that <strong> ὤν</strong> and <strong> φέρων</strong> are <em> present</em> participles. They must not be rendered <em> utpote qui</em> , or <em> cum esset</em> and <em> ferret</em> , but kept to their essential and timeless sense, ‘ <em> being</em> ,’ and ‘ <em> bearing</em> ’) <strong> the brightness</strong> ( <em> effulgentia</em> , not “ <em> repercussus</em> , qualis est in nube quæ dicitur παρήλιος ,” as Grot., Calv. (“splendor ex illius lumine refulgens, refulgentia”), al. This latter would be legitimate, but does not seem to have been the ordinary usage. Bl. cites from Philo de Concupiscent. § 11, vol. ii. p. 356, τὸ δὲ ἐμφυσώμενον ( Gen 2:7 ) δῆλον ὡς αἰθέριον ἦν πνεῦμα καὶ εἰ δή τι αἰθερίου πνεύματος κρεῖττον , ἅτε τῆς μακαρίας καὶ τρισμακαρίας φύσεως ἀπαύγασμα , where the sense clearly is, that the breath breathed into man was as it were a <em> ray</em> of the divine nature itself. See also id. de Opif. Mund. § 51, vol. i. p. 35; de Plant. Noë, § 12, p. 154. Cf. Wis 7:26 , where wisdom is called an ἀπαύγασμα φωτὸς ἀϊδίου . And this (which, as Delitzsch remarks, is represented by the φῶς ἐκ φωτός of the Church) seems to have been universally the sense among the ancients: no trace whatever being found of the meaning ‘ <em> reflexion</em> .’ Nor would the idea be apposite here: the Son of God is, in this his essential majesty, the expression, and the sole expression, of the divine Light, not, as in his Incarnation, its reflexion. So Thdrt.: τὸ γὰρ ἀπαύγασμα καὶ ἐκ τοῦ πυρός ἐστι , καὶ σὺν τῷ πυρί ἐστι · καὶ αἴτιον μὲν ἔχει τὸ πῦρ , ἀχώριστον δέ ἐστι τοῦ πυρός .… καὶ τῷ πυρὶ δὲ ὁμοφυὲς τὸ ἀπαύγασμα · οὐκοῦν καὶ ὁ υἱὸς τῷ πατρί . (Cf. Athanasius contra Arianos Orat. i. (ii.) § 12, vol. ii. (Migne) p. 328: τίς οὕτως ἐστὶν ἀνόητος , ὡς ἀμφιβάλλειν περὶ τοῦ αἰεὶ εἶναι τὸν υἱόν ; πότε γάρ τις εἶδε φῶς χωρὶς τῆς τοῦ ἀπαυγάσματος λαμπρότητος ;) And Thl.: καὶ γὰρ τὸ ἀπαύγασμα τῷ ἀπαυγάζοντι συνεμφαίνεται . οὔτε γὰρ ἥλιος ὡράθη ποτὲ χωρὶς ἀπαυγάσματος · οὔτε πατὴρ νοεῖται χωρὶς υἱοῦ . ὅταν οὖν ἀκούσῃς τῶν Ἀρειανῶν λεγόντων , ὅτι εἰ ἐκ πατρὸς ὁ υἱός , λοιπὸν ὕστερος αὐτοῦ · ἀντίθες αὺτοῖς , ὅτι καὶ τὸ ἀπαύγασμα ἐκ τοῦ ἡλίου , καὶ οὐχ ὕστερον αὐτοῦ . ἅμα γὰρ ἥλιος , ἅμα ἀπαύγασμα . And Origen, tom. xxxii. in Joann. § 18, vol. iv. p. 450: ὅλης μὲν οὖν οἶμαι τῆς δόξης τοῦ θεοῦ αὐτοῦ ὰπαύγασμα εἶναι τὸν υἱόν , κατὰ τὸν εἰπόντα Παῦλον Ὃς ὢν ἀπαύγασμα τῆς δόξης · φθάνειν μέντοι γε ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀπαυγάσματος τούτου τῆς ὅλης δόξης μερικὰ ἀπαυγάσματα ἐπὶ τὴν λοιπὴν λογικὴν κτίσιν · οὐκ οἶμαι γάρ τινα τὸ πᾶν δύνασθαι χωρῆσαι τῆς ὅλης δόξης τοῦ θεοῦ ἀπαύγασμα , ἢ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ . Hesychius gives as the meaning of ἀπαύγασμα , ἡλίου φέγγος : and the MS. Lexicon of Cyril, ἀκτὶς ἡλίου ἡ πρώτη τοῦ ἡλιακοῦ φωτὸς ἀποβολή . See also Clem-rom. in reff. and several other authorities cited in Bleek) <strong> of His glory</strong> (not simply <em> His light</em> : nor need ἀπαύγασμα be confined to such literal sense: cf. Clem.-rom. as above. His glory, in its widest and amplest reference.
	</p>
<p>It has been attempted to give to ἀπ . τῆς δόξης the meaning <em> splendor gloriosus</em> , and to make αὐτοῦ below refer, not to the Father, but to ἀπαύγασμα . But to this Bleek answers after Seb.-Schmidt, that ἀπαύγασμα never is found without a genitive of the ἀπαυγαζόμενον , which genitive here can be no other than τῆς δόξης ( αὐτοῦ , i. e. τοῦ θεοῦ ). Again, Owen (vol. i. p. 85 f.) supposes the Shechinah to be alluded to; Akersloot, the Urim and Thummim. It is hardly probable that in a preliminary description, couched in the most general and sublime terms, any such particular allusion should be intended. Notice again the anarthrous predicate, to which the same remarks will apply as to υἱῷ above.

<p>Delitzsch remarks, <em> Es ist kein nimbus um Gott, welchen, hier</em> δόξα <em> genannt wird, sondern die übersinnliche geistige Feuer und Lichtnatur Gottes selber, welche er, um sich vor sich selbst offenbar zu merden, aus sich herausfeßt</em> ) <strong> and impress</strong> (“ <em> figura</em> ,” vulg.: “figure,” Wiclif and Rheims: “very image,” Tyndal and Cranmer: “ingraved forme,” Geneva: “express image,” E. V. The word <strong> χαρακτήρ</strong> , which by formation would be the stamp or die itself on which a device χαράσσεται , and which stamps it on other things, never appears to bear this meaning, but always to be taken for the impression itself so stamped. Thus Æsch. Suppl. 279, Κύπριος χαρακτήρ τ ʼ ἐν γυναικείοις τύποις εἰκὼς πέπληκται τεκτόνων πρὸς ἀρσένων . “Aristot. Œc. ii. p. 689, ἀνενεχθέντος δὲ τοῦ ἀργυρίου ἐπικόψας χαρακτῆρα : id. Pol. i. 6, where χαρακτῆρα ἐπιβάλλειν is to stamp coin, and it is said, ὁ γὰρ χαρακτήρ ἐτέθη τοῦ πόσου σημεῖον . Diod. Sic. xvii. 66, τάλαντα χρυσοῦ , χαρακτῆρα δαρεικὸν ἔχοντα . Hence the word is taken, 1. generally for any fixed and sharply marked lineaments, material or spiritual, by which a person or an object may be recognized and distinguished. Herod. i. 116, ὁ χ . τοῦ προσώπου . Diod. Sic. i. 82, τοὺς τῆς ὄψεως χαρακτῆρας , the lines of the countenance. Lucian, de Amoribus, p. 1061, calls mirrors τῶν ἀντιμόρφων χαρακτήρων ἀγράφους εἰκόνας , and ib. p. 1056, ἧς ὁ μὲν ἀληθῶς χ . ἄμορφος . Demosth. (in Stephan.), ἐν μὲν τοῖς ἐσόπτροις ὁ τῆς ὄψεως , ἐν δὲ ταῖς ὁμιλίαις ὁ τῆς ψυχῆς χαρακτὴρ βλέπεται . Philo, de Mund. Opif. § 4 (vol. i. p. 4), τοὺς χαρακτῆρας ἐνσφραγίζεσθαι , to impress on the mind the lines and forms of an intended city: id. Legg. Allegor. i. § 18 (vol. i. p. 55), ὁ τῆς ἀρετῆς χαρακτήρ , οἰκεῖος ὢν ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ : id. de Mundi Opif. § 23 (p. 15), τὴν δὲ ἐμφέρειαν (the likeness of man to God) μηδεὶς εἰκαζέτω σώματος χαρακτῆρσιν , ib. § 53 (p. 36), τῆς ἑκατέρου φύσεως (viz. of God and the creation) ἀπεμάττετο (scil. man, while he was alone) τῇ ψυχῇ τοὺς χαρακτῆρας : and, 2. of the objects themselves, on which the features of another are expressed, which bear its peculiar image, so that they appear as if taken off from it by impression of a die. So Philo, Quod Det. Potiori Ins. § 23 (vol. i. p. 217), designates the πνεῦμα imparted by God to man τύπον τινὰ καὶ χαρακτῆρα θείας δυνάμεως , Moses naming the same εἰκών , to shew ὅτι ἀρχέτυπον μὲν φύσεως λογικῆς ὁ θεός ἐστι , μίμημα δὲ καὶ ἀπεικόνισμα ἄνθρωπος : De Plant. Noë, § 5 (p. 332), he says, Moses named the rational soul τοῦ θείου καὶ ἀοράτου εἰκόνα , δόκιμον εἶναι νομίσας οὐσιωθεῖσαν κ . τυπωθεῖσαν σφραγῖδι θεοῦ , ἧς ὁ <strong> χαρακτήρ</strong> ἐστιν ὁ ἀΐδιος λόγος . Here the λόγος is designated as the impress of the seal of God, by the impression of which in like manner on the human soul, this last receives a corresponding figure, as the image of the unseen and divine. Compare also Clem.-rom. ad Cor. c. 33, αὐτὸς ὁ δημιουργὸς κ . δεσπότης ἁπάντων … τὸν … ἄνθρωπον ταῖς ἰδίαις αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀμώμοις χερσὶν ἔπλασεν , τῆς ἑαυτοῦ εἰκόνος <strong> χαρακτῆρα</strong> . Hence the usage of <strong> χαρακτήρ</strong> here will be easily understood.” Bleek: see also the word in Palm and Rost’s Lex.

V.: Wesen, Luther, &amp;c., De Wette, Bleek, al.: <em> das der Erscheinung unterliegende Wesen, der Wesensgrund</em> , Delitzsch. The various meanings of <strong> ὑπόστασις</strong> are well traced by Bleek, from whom, as so often in this Epistle, I take the account. Etymologically, the word imports the lying or being placed underneath: and this is put in common usage for, 1. <em> substratum</em> or <em> foundation</em> <em> fundamentum</em> . Diod. Sic. i. 66, ὑπόστασις τοῦ τάφου : id. xiii. 82, κατὰ τὸ μέγεθος τῆς <strong> ὑποστάσεως</strong> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+43:11">Ezekiel 43:11</span> , κ . διαγράψεις τὸν οἶκον κ . τὰς ἐξόδους αὐτοῦ κ . τὴν <strong> ὑπόστασιν</strong> αὐτοῦ : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:2">Psalms 68:2</span> , ἐνεπάγην εἰς ἰλὺν βυθοῦ κ . οὐκ ἔστιν <strong> ὑπόστασις</strong> . Nearly connected with this is, 2. <em> establishment</em> , or the state of being established: hence α . <em> firmness</em> , to which idea the word approaches in the last citation: but especially in reference to firmness of spirit, confidence: see more on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:14">Hebrews 3:14</span> , β . <em> substantial existence, reality</em> , in contradistinction to that which exists only in appearance or idea: Aristot. de Mundo iv. 19, τῶν ἐν ἀέρι φαντασμάτων τὰ μέν ἐστι κατ ʼ ἔμφασιν , τὰ δὲ καθ ʼ ὑπόστασιν : Artemidor. Oneirocrit. iii. 14, φαντασίαν μὲν ἔχειν πλούτου , ὑπόστασιν δὲ μή : Diog. Laert. ix. 91, ζητεῖται δ ʼ οὐκ εἰ φαίνεται ταῦτα , ἀλλ ʼ εἰ καθ ʼ ὑπόστασιν οὕτως ἔχει : id. vii. 135, καὶ κατ ʼ ἐπίνοιαν καὶ καθ ʼ ὑπόστασιν . Hence γ . generally, <em> consistence</em> or <em> existence</em> . So Philo, de Incorrupt. Mund. § 18, vol. i. p. 505, αὐγὴ ὑπόστασιν ἰδίαν οὐκ ἔχει , γεννᾶται δ ʼ ἐκ φλογός : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+38:5">Psalms 38:5</span> , καὶ ἡ ὑπόστασίς μου ὡσεὶ οὐθὲν ἐνώπιόν σου : Ps. 88:47, μνήσθητι τίς ὑπόστασίς μου (in both places for the existence of man, Heb. חֶלֶד : hence also, as ὕπαρξις , for <em> possessions</em> or <em> goods</em> , as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+11:6">Deuteronomy 11:6</span> ; Jer 10:17 ). Hence also δ . it imports the <em> especial manner of being</em> , the <em> peculiar essence</em> of an object. Thus <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ki+13:21">1 Kings 13:21</span> , τῇ ἀξίνῃ κ . τῷ δρεπάνῳ ὑπόστασις ἦν ἡ αὐτή : Wis 16:21 , ἡ μὲν γὰρ ὑπόστασίς σου ( τ . θεοῦ ) τὴν σὴν γλυκύτητα πρὸς τέκνα ἐνεφάνισε . And this last seems to be the best meaning in our place: His <em> essential being</em> , His <em> substance</em> . For in regarding the history of the word, we find that the well-known theological meaning ‘ <em> person</em> ’ was not by any means generally received during the first four centuries. We have it indeed in Origen, tom. ii. in Joann. § 6, vol. iv. p. 61 ( ἡμεῖς μέντοι γε τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις πειθόμενοι τυγχάνειν , τὸν πατέρα , κ . τὸν υἱόν , κ . τὸ ἅγιον πνεῦμα , κ . τ . λ .): but the usage is by no means constant. The Nicene council itself uses ὑπόστασις and οὐσία in the same sense, and condemns the deriving the Son ἐξ ἑτέρας ὑποστάσεως καὶ οὐσίας from the Father (cited in Bleek, p. 60, note): and so usually (in the genuine works: e. g. Ep. ad Afros, c. 4, vol. ii. (Migne) p. 714: ἡ ὑπόστασις οὐσία ἐστί , καὶ οὐδὲν ἄλλο σημαινόμενον ἔχει ἢ αὐτὸ τὸ ὄν .… ἡ γὰρ ὑπόστασις καὶ ἡ οὐσία ὕπαρξίς ἐστιν . ἔστι γὰρ καὶ ὑπάρχει . See Gieseler, Kirchengesch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:0">1 Peter 2:0</span> , p. 63) Athanasius. The fact was, that the Easterns most commonly used <strong> ὑπόστασις</strong> to designate the three separate Persons (cf. e. g. Chrys. de Sacerdot. iv. 4, vol. i. p. 410 A, τὴν μὲν θεότητα πατρὸς κ . υἱ . κ . ἁγ . πν . μίαν ὁμολογοῦντας , προστιθέντας δὲ καὶ τὰς τρεις ὑποστάσεις , &amp;c., and especially Basil, whom Gieseler regards as the representative of this view: Ep. 236. 6, vol. iv. p. 363, οὐσία κ . ὑπόστασις ταύτης ἔχει τὴ διαφοράν , ἣν ἔχει τὸ κοινὸν πρὸς τὸ καθ ʼ ἕκαστον . See other passages in Gieseler, ubi supra) in distinction from Sabellianism, which acknowledged three πρόσωπα , but not three ὑποστάσεις , i. e. self-subsisting personalities: whereas the Westerns continued to regard ὑπόστασις as = οὐσία , and assumed but one ὑπόστασις : and the Western bishops, assembled with Athanasius at the council of Sardica in 347, distinctly pronounced the assumption of three hypostases heretical, i. e. Arian. Their words, as cited by Suicer from Theodoret, Hist. Eccl. ii. 6, are very decisive: τὸ τῶν αἱρετικῶν σύστημα φιλονεικεῖ , διαφόρους εἶναι τὰς ὑποστάσεις τοῦ πατρός , κ . τοῦ υἱοῦ , κ . τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος , κ . εἶναι κεχωρισμένας . ἡμεῖς δὲ ταύτην παρειλήφαμεν κ . δεδιδάγμεθα , κ . ταύτην ἔχομεν τὴν καθολικὴν παράδοσιν κ . πίστιν κ . ὁμολογίαν , μίαν εἶναι ὑπόστασιν , ἣν αὐτοὶ οἱ αἱρετικοὶ οὐσίαν προσαγορεύουσι , τοῦ πατρός , κ . τοῦ υἱοῦ , κ . τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος . Subsequently however to this, in the Synod assembled at Alexandria in 362, at which Athanasius, and bishops of Italy, Arabia, Egypt, and Libya were present, the Easterns and Westerns agreed, on examination of one another’s meaning, to acknowledge one another as orthodox, and to allow indifferently of the use of τρεῖς ὑποστάσεις signifying ‘Persons,’ and μία ὑπόστασις signifying ‘substance,’ ‘essence,’ οὐσία . The Epistle from this synod to the bishops of Antioch is among the works of Athanasius, vol. ii. p. 615 ff., and is a very interesting document. But it attempted conciliation in vain, the Miletian schism at Antioch, which began on this point, having been confirmed and perpetuated by external causes. See on the whole subject, Bleek’s note: Jerome, Epist. 15 (al. 57) ad Damasum, § 4, vol. i. p. 40; and on the use made of this description by orthodox and heretics in early times, Bleek, Chrys. in loc.: Calvin’s note, where he gives some excellent cautions against the speculative pressing of each expression: “Nam hoc quoque notandum est, non hic doceri frivolas speculationes, sed tradi solidam fidei doctrinam. Quare debemus in usum nostrum hæc Christi elogia applicare, sicuti ad nos relationem habent.”

<p>On all grounds it will be safer here to hold to the primitive meaning of the word, and not to introduce into the language of the apostolic age a terminology which was long subsequent to it), <strong> and</strong> ( <strong> τε</strong> couples closely clauses referring to the same subject, and following as matter of course on one another) <strong> upholding</strong> (we have this sense of <strong> φέρειν</strong> in reff. and in the later Greek writers, e. g. Plut. Lucull. 6, φέρειν τὴν πόλιν . So in Latin, Val. Max. xi. 8.5, “humeris gestare salutem patriæ:” Cic. pro Flacco, c. 38, “quam (remp.) vos universam in hoc judicio vestris humeris.… judices, sustinetis:” Senec. Ep. 31, “Deus ille maximus potentissimusque vehit omnia.” But the usage is principally found in the Rabbinical writings, as appears from the extracts in Schöttgen, e. g. Sohar Chadasch, fol. ix. 1, “Creator benedictus portans omnes mundos robore suo ( סובל כל־העלמות בכוהו ),” &amp;c. Chrys. says, φέρων , τουτέστι κυβερνῶν , τὰ διαπίπτοντα συγκρατῶν : and so Thl.: “Sursum tenet, ne decidant, et in nihilum revertantur,” Ps.-Anselm) <strong> the universe</strong> (the same πάντα as designated by πάντων above: not that the art. expressly refers back to that word, for τὰ πάντα is the ordinary expression for the aggregate of all things. The meaning attempted to be given by some Socinian expositors, “the whole kingdom of grace,” is wholly beside the purpose: see reff., esp. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:17">Colossians 1:17</span> , καὶ <strong> τὰ πάντα</strong> ἐν αὐτῷ συνέστηκεν : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="job+8:3">Job 8:3</span> , ὁ <strong> τὰ πάντα</strong> ποιήσας : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+4:11">Revelation 4:11</span> , ὅτι σὺ ἔκτισας <strong> τὰ πάντα</strong> ) <strong> by the word</strong> ( <em> expressed command</em> : cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:3">Hebrews 11:3</span> , πίστει νοοῦμεν κατηρτίσθαι τοὺς αἰῶνας <strong> ῥήματι</strong> θεοῦ ) <strong> of his</strong> (Whose? His own, or the Father’s? The latter is held by Cyrilalex. contra Julian. viii. vol. ix. p. 259 C, ὡς γὰρ ὁ πάνσοφος γράφει Παῦλος · φέρει τὰ π . ἐν τῷ ῥήματι τῆς δυν . αὐτοῦ , τοῦ πατρός . And so Grot., al. But Chrys., Thdrt., Thl., and the great body of Commentators understand αὐτοῦ to refer to the Son. That it may do so, it is not necessary to write αὑτοῦ , as is done in the cursive mss. (the uncial MSS. being mostly without accents) and in many modern editions. Bleek in his note (vol. i. p. 69) makes it probable that the abbreviated writing αὑτοῦ for ἑαυτοῦ had not been adopted in the days of the N. T. Even if it had, his rule seems a good one; that αὑτοῦ should never be written unless in cases where, if speaking in the 1st or 2nd person, we should use ἐμαυτοῦ or σεαυτοῦ , i. e. never except where emphatic. Now here, supposing the words <em> addressed to</em> the Son, σοῦ and not σεαυτοῦ would evidently be the word used: and consequently in expressing the same sentence in the 3rd person, αὐτοῦ , not αὑτοῦ ( ἑαυτοῦ ) ought to be written. The interpretation therefore is independent of this distinction. But the question recurs, which is the right one? The strict parallelism of the clauses would seem to require, that αὐτοῦ here should designate the same person, as it does before, after τῆς ὑποστάσεως . But such parallelism and consistency of reference of demonstrative pronouns is by no means observed in the N. T., e. g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:22">Ephesians 1:22</span> , καὶ καθίσας ἐν δεξιᾷ αὺτοῦ (of the Father), … καὶ πάντα ὑπέταξεν ὑπὸ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ (of the Son). In every such case the reference must be determined by the circumstances, and the things spoken of. And applying that test here, we find that in our former clause, ὢν ἀπαύγασμα τ . δόξης κ . χαρακτὴρ τῆς ὑποστάσεως αὐτοῦ , it is quite out of the question that αὐτοῦ should be reflective, referring, as it clearly does, to another than the subject of the sentence. But when we proceed to our second clause, φέρων τε τὰ πάντα τῷ ῥ . τ . δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ , we find no such bar to the ordinary reflective sense of αὐτοῦ , but every reason to adopt it as the most obvious. For we have here an action performed by the Son, who φέρει τὰ πάντα . Whereby? τῷ ῥήματι τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ : where we may certainly say, 1. that had another than the subject of the sentence been intended, such intention would have been expressed: and, 2. that the assertion would be after all a strange and unexampled one, that the Son upholds all things by the word of the Father’s power. So that, on all accounts, this second αὐτοῦ seems better to be referred to the Son) <strong> power</strong> (not to be weakened into the comparatively unmeaning τῷ ῥήματι αὐτοῦ τῷ δυνατῷ . His Power is an inherent attribute, whether uttered or not: the ῥῆμα is that utterance, which He has been pleased to give of it. It is a “powerful word,” but much more is here stated that it is the word of, proceeding from, giving utterance to, His power), <strong> having made</strong> (the vulg. “ <em> faciens</em> ” is an unfortunate mistranslation, tending to obscure the truth of the completion of the one Sacrifice of the Lord. The words δι ʼ ἑαυτοῦ can hardly be retained in the text, in the face of their omission in the three most ancient MSS., joined to their internal character as an explanatory gloss. Dr. Bloomfield’s strong argument in their favour, that they “are almost indispensable,” in fact, pronounces their condemnation. The hypothesis of homœoteleuton suggests itself: but it is hardly likely in so solemn an opening passage, and weighs little against the probability the other way. Meanwhile, the gloss is a good and true one. It was δι ʼ ἑαυτοῦ , in the fullest sense) <strong> purification of sins</strong> (as Bleek observes, there is no occasion to suppose the genitive here equivalent to ἀπὸ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν , seeing that we may say καθαρίζονται αἱ ἁμαρτίαι τοῦ ἀνθρώπου , as we read, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:3">Matthew 8:3</span> , ἐκα θαρίσθη αὐτοῦ ἡ λέπρα . Sin was the great uncleanness, of which He has effected the purgation: the disease of which He has wrought the cure. This καθαρισμός must be understood by the subsequent argument in the Epistle: for that which the Writer had it in his mind to expand in the course of his treatise, he must be supposed to have meant when he used without explanation a concise term, like this. And that we know to have been, the purifications and sacrifices of the Levitical law, by which man’s natural uncleanness in God’s sight was typically removed, and access to God laid open to him. Ebrard’s note here is so important that, though long, I cannot forbear inserting it: “ καθαρίζειν answers to the Heb. טִהַר , and its ideal explanation must be sought in the meaning which suits the Levitical cleansing in the O. T.cultus. Consequently, they are entirely wrong, who understand καθαρίζειν of moral amelioration, and would so take καθαρισμὸν ποιεῖν in this place, as if the author wished to set forth Christ here as a moral teacher, who by precept and example incited men to amendment. And we may pronounce those in error, who go so far indeed as to explain the καθαρισμός of the propitiatory removal of the guilt of sin, but only on account of later passages in our Epistle, as if the idea of scriptural καθαρισμός were not already sufficiently clear to establish this, the only true meaning. The whole law of purification, as given by God to Moses, rested on the assumption that our nature, as sinful and guilt-laden, is not capable of coming into immediate contact with our holy God and Judge. The mediation between man and God present in the most holy place, and in that most holy place separated from the people, was revealed in three forms; α . in sacrifices, β . in the Priesthood, and γ . in the Levitical laws of purity. Sacrifices were (typical) acts or means of propitiation for guilt; Priests were the agents for accomplishing these acts, but were not themselves accounted purer than the rest of the people, having consequently to bring offerings for their own sins before they offered for those of the people. Lastly, Levitical purity was the condition which was attained, positively by sacrifice and worship, negatively by avoidance of Levitical pollution, the condition in which the people was enabled, by means of the priests, to come into relation with God ‘without dying’ ( Deu 5:26 ); the result of the cultus which was past, and the postulate for that which was to come. So that that which purified, was sacrifice: and the purification was, the removal of guilt. This is most clearly seen in the ordinance concerning the great day of atonement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+16:0">Leviticus 16:0</span> . There we find those three leading features in the closest distinctive relation. First, the sacrifice must be prepared ( Lev 16:1-10 ): then, the high priest is to offer for his own sins ( Lev 16:11-14 ): lastly, he is to kill the sin-offering for the people ( Lev 16:15 ), and with its blood to sprinkle the mercy-seat and all the holy place, and cleanse it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel ( Lev 16:19 ); and then he is symbolically to lay the sins of the people on the head of a second victim, and send forth this animal, laden with the curse, into the wilderness. For ( Lev 16:30 ) ‘on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.’ In the atonement, in the gracious covering ( יְכַפֵּר , Lev 16:30 ) of the guilt of sin, consists <em> purification</em> in the scriptural sense. (And so also were those who had become levitically unclean, e. g. lepers, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+14:0">Leviticus 14:0</span> , cleansed by atoning sacrifices.) So that an Israelitish reader, a Christian Jew, would never, on reading the words <strong> καθαρισμὸν ποιεῖν</strong> , think on what we commonly call ‘moral amelioration,’ which, if not springing out of the living ground of a heart reconciled to God, is mere self-deceit, and only external avoidance of evident transgression: but the <strong> καθαρισμός</strong> which Christ brought in would, in the sense of our author and his readers, only be understood of that gracious atonement for all guilt of sin of all mankind, which Christ our Lord and Saviour has completed for us by His sinless sufferings and death: and out of which flows forth to us, as from a fountain, all power to love in return, all love to Him, our heavenly Pattern, and all hatred of sin, which caused His death. To speak these words of Scripture with the mouth, is easy: but he only can say Yea and Amen to them with the heart who, in simple truthfulness of the knowledge of himself, has looked down even to the darkest depths of his ruined state, natural to him, and intensified by innumerable sins of act, and, despairing of all help in himself, reaches forth his hand after the good tidings of heavenly deliverance.” It is truly refreshing, in the midst of so much unbelief, and misapprehension of the sense of Scripture, in the German Commentators, to meet with such a clear and full testimony to the truth and efficacy of the Lord’s great Sacrifice. And I am bound to say that Bleek, De Wette, Lünemann, and Delitzsch, recognize this just as fully: the two former however referring on further in the Epistle for the explanation of the expression, and holding it premature to specify or explain it here. Observe now again, before passing on, the mistake of the vulgate in rendering ποιησάμενος “ <em> faciens</em> .” The purification is <em> completed</em> , before the action next described takes place: this all seem to acknowledge here, and to find an exception to the ordinary rule that an aorist participle connected with an aorist verb, is contemporary with it. The reason seems to be principally pragmatic that such session could not well be brought in until such purification had been accomplished: see above), <strong> sat down</strong> ( καθίζω is always used intransitively in this Epistle, and always of this act of Christ. In fact it is always intransitive in the N. T., except in the two places, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:4">1 Corinthians 6:4</span> , τούτους καθίζετε , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span> , καθίσας ἐν δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ ) <strong> on the right hand</strong> (‘ <em> in the right hand</em> ,’ scil. <em> portion</em> or <em> side</em> . The expression comes doubtless originally from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1">Psalms 110:1</span> ( Psa 109:1 ), cited below. Bleek, in the course of a long and thorough discussion of its meaning as applied to our Lord, shews that it is never used of his præ-existent coequality with the Father, but always with reference to His exaltation in his humanity after his course of suffering and triumph. It is ever connected, not with the idea of His equality with the Father and share in the majesty of the Godhead, but with His state of waiting, in the immediate presence of the Father, and thus highly exalted by Him, till the purposes of his mediatorial office are accomplished. This his lofty state is, however, not one of quiescence; for ( Act 2:33 ) He shed down the gift of the Spirit, and ( Rom 8:34 ) He maketh intercession for us: and below (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1">Hebrews 8:1</span> ff.) He is, for all purposes belonging to that office, our High Priest in Heaven. This ‘ <em> sitting at the right hand of God</em> ’ is described as lasting until all enemies shall have been subdued unto Him, i. e. until the end of this state of time, and His own second coming: after which, properly and strictly speaking, the state of exaltation described by these words shall come to an end, and that mysterious completion of the supreme glory of the Son of God shall take place, which St. Paul describes, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:28">1 Corinthians 15:28</span> . On the more refined questions connected with the expression, see Delitzsch’s and Ebrard’s notes here) <strong> of majesty</strong> ( μεγαλωσύνη , said to belong to the Alexandrine dialect, is often found in the LXX, and principally as referring to the divine greatness: see reff.) <strong> on high</strong> ( <em> in high places</em> , i. e. <em> in heaven</em> . Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+92:4">Psalms 92:4</span> , θαυμαστὸς ἐν ὑψηλοῖς ὁ κύριος , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+112:5">Psalms 112:5</span> , ὁ ἐν ὑψηλοῖς κατοικῶν : and the singular ἐν ὑψηλῷ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+33:5">Isaiah 33:5</span> ; ἀφ ʼ ὑψηλοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+32:15">Isaiah 32:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+32:30">Jeremiah 32:30</span> ( Jer 25:30 ). In the same sense we have ἐν ὑψίστοις , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:14">Luke 2:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:38">Luke 19:38</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="job+16:20">Job 16:20</span> ; ἥλιος ἀνατέλλων ἐν ὑψίστοις κυρίου , Sir 26:16 ; and ἐν τοῖς ὑψ ., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:9">Matthew 21:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:10">Mark 11:10</span> . Cf. Ebrard: “HEAVEN, in Holy Scripture, signifies never unbounded space, nor omnipresence, but always either the starry firmament, or, more usually, that sphere of the created world of space and time, where the union of God with the personal creature is not severed by sin, where no Death reigns, where the glorification of the body is not a mere hope of the future. Into that sphere has the Firstling of risen and glorified manhood entered, as into a place, with visible glorified Body, visibly to return again from thence.” There is a question whether the word should be joined with ἐκάθισεν , or with τῆς μεγαλωσύνης : which again occurs at ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1">Hebrews 8:1</span> , where we have ὃς ἐκάθισεν ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ θρόνου τῆς μεγαλωσύνης ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς . The strict grammarians contend for the connexion with the verb, on account of the omission of the art. τῆς . But the order of the words in both places makes the other connexion the more natural; and no scholar versed in N. T. diction will object to it. Cf. τοῖς κυρίοις κατὰ σάρκα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5">Ephesians 6:5</span> , and note, also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:32">John 6:32</span> . The omission of the art. here gives majesty and solemnity its insertion would seem to hint at other μεγαλωσύναι in the background).</p>
