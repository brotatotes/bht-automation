<p><strong> 5</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (substantiation of διαφορώτερον κεκλ . ὄνομα ) <strong> to whom of</strong> (among) <strong> the angels did He</strong> (God, the subject of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1-2">Hebrews 1:1-2</span> ; as the subsequent citation shews) <strong> ever say</strong> (this citation from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:0">Psalms 2:0</span> , has brought up in recent German Commentators the whole question of the original reference of that Psalm, and (as in Bleek) of O. T. citations in the N. T. altogether. These discussions will be found in Bleek, De Wette, and Ebrard. The latter is by far the deepest and most satisfactory: seeing, as he does, the furthest into the truth of the peculiar standing of the Hebrew people, and the Messianic import of the theocracy. Those who entirely or partially deny this latter, seem to me to be without adequate means of discussing the question. Ebrard’s view is, that the Psalm belongs to the reign of David. The objection, that Heb 1:6 will not apply to David’s anointing, inasmuch as that took place at Bethlehem in his boyhood, he answers, by regarding that anointing as connected with his establishment on Mount Zion, not as having locally taken place there, but as the first of that series of divine mercies of which that other was the completion. (Even Hupfeld gives up this objection.) He further ascribes the Psalm to that portion of David’s reign when (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2sa+8:0">2 Samuel 8:0</span> .) Hada-dezer, and many neighbouring nations, were smitten by him: which victories he looked on as the fulfilment to him of Nathan’s prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:8-17">2 Samuel 7:8-17</span> . In that prophecy the offspring of David is mentioned in the very words quoted below in this verse, and in terms which, he contends, will not apply to Solomon, but must be referred to the great promised Seed of David. He regards this triumphant occasion as having been treated by the royal Psalmist as a type and foretaste of the ultimate ideal dominion of the ‘Son of David’ over the kings of the earth. But I must refer the reader to his long note, which is well worth reading: and to Bleek’s, in which are several suggestions, valuable as notices of the way in which the present and the future, the political and Messianic ideas, are intermingled in the Psalms. See also Delitzsch, h. l. Even Hupfeld, who denies Messianic reference wherever he can, is obliged to acknowledge that the Psalm “probably applies to no particular king, but is a glorification of the theocratic kingdom in general, with poetic reference to the universal dominion promised to it:” and confesses, that this is in fact the Messianic idea. He also connects the Psalm with the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2sa+7:0">2 Samuel 7:0</span> . We may observe, that the connexion here of the two, the triumphant expression of the Psalm, and the prophecy of Nathan, is a strong presumption in favour of Ebrard’s view), <strong> Thou</strong> (the seed of David, anointed in God’s counsels as king on His holy hill of Sion: see above) <strong> art my Son</strong> (according to the promise presently to be quoted, finding its partial fulfilment in Solomon, but its only entire one in the Son of David who is also the Son of God), <strong> I</strong> (emphatic: <strong> ‘I</strong> and no other:’ expressed also in the Hebrew) <strong> this day have begotten thee</strong> (First, what are we to understand by <strong> γεγέννηκα</strong> ? Bleek says, “As Sonship, in the proper sense, is dependent on the act of begetting, so may, especially by the Hebrews, ‘to beget’ be figuratively used to express the idea of ‘making any one a son,’ in which derived and figurative reference this also may be meant. And we get an additional confirmation of this meaning from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:27">Jeremiah 2:27</span> , where it is said of the foolish idolatrous Israelites, τῷ ξύλῳ εἶπαν ὅτι ὁ πατήρ μου εἶ σύ , καὶ τῷ λίθῳ Σὺ ἐγέννησάς με . Accordingly, the meaning here is, ‘I have made Thee my son’ (so <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:20">Psalms 89:20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:26-27">Psalms 89:26-27</span> ; ‘I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him: … He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father.… Also will I make him my first-born, higher than the kings of the earth’): namely, by setting Thee on the throne of my people: and the <strong> σήμερον</strong> will most naturally be referred to the time of the anointing of the King on Zion, as the act whereby he was manifested as Son of God in this sense.” And so Calvin, whom Bl. cites, in his comm. on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:0">Psalms 2:0</span> .: “David genitus a Deo fuit, dum clare apparuit ejus electio. Itaque adverbium <em> hodie</em> tempus illud demonstrationis notat, quia, postquam innotuit creatum divinitus regem, prodiit tanquam nuper ex Deo genitus.” The above remarks seem pertinent and unobjectionable, as long as we regard them as explaining the supposed immediate reference to David and present circumstances: but it is plain that, according to the above view of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:0">Psalms 2:0</span> , and indeed to the usage of the N. T., in applying this passage to our Lord, we want another and a higher sense in which both words, <strong> γεγέννηκα</strong> and <strong> σήμερον</strong> , may be applicable to Him: a sense in which I should be disposed to say that the words must in their fulness of meaning be taken, to the neglect and almost the obliteration of that their supposed lower reference. For, granting the application of such sayings to our Lord, then must the terms of them, suggested by the Holy Spirit of prophecy, which is His testimony, bear adequate interpretations as regards His person and office. It has not therefore been without reason that the Fathers, and so many modern divines, have found in this word <strong> γεγέννηκα</strong> the doctrine of the generation of the Son of God, and have endeavoured, in accordance with such reference, to assign a fitting sense to <strong> σήμερον</strong> . As the subject is exceedingly important, and has been generally passed over slightly by our English expositors, I shall need no apology for gathering from Bleek and Suicer the opinions and testimonies concerning it. 1. One view refers <strong> σήμερον</strong> to the eternal generation of the Son, and regards it as an expression of the “ <em> nunc stans</em> , as they call it” (Owen) of eternity. Thus Origen very grandly says, in Joann. tom. i. 32, vol. iv. p. 33: λέγεται πρὸς αὐτὸν ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ , ᾧ ἀεί ἐστι τὸ σήμερον · οὐκ ἔνι γὰρ ἑσπέρα θεοῦ , ἐγὼ δὲ ἡγοῦμαι , ὅτι οὐδὲ πρωΐα , ἀλλ ʼ ὁ συμπαρεκτείνων τῇ ἀγενήτῳ καὶ ἀϊδίῳ αὺτοῦ ζωῇ , ἵν ʼ οὕτως εἴπω , χρόνος ἡμέρα ἐστὶν αὐτῷ σήμερον , ἐν ᾗ γεγέννηται ὁ υἱός · ἀρχῆσγενέσεως αὐτοῦ οὕτως οὐχ εὑρισκομένης , ὡς οὐδὲ τῆς ἡμέρας . And so Athanasius (de Decret. Nicæn. Syn. § 13, vol. i. p. 172, adv. Arian. iv. § 24, vol. ii. (Migne) p. 503), Basil (contra Eunom. ii. 24, vol. i. p. 260), Aug [3] (on the Psalm: “Quanquam etiam possit ille dies in prophetia dictus videri, quo Jesus Christus secundum hominem natus est: tamen <em> hodie</em> quia præsentiam significat, atque in æternitate nec præteritum quidquam est, quasi esse desierit, nec futurum, quasi nondum sit, sed præsens tantum: quia quidquid æternum est, semper est: divinitus accipitur secundum id dictum <em> Ego hodie</em> genuite, quo sempiternam generationem virtutis et sapientiæ Dei, qui est unigenitus Filius, fides sincerissima et catholica prædicat”), Primasius, Thom. Aq.; of the Commentators on this place, Thl. ( οὐδὲν ἓτερον δηλοῖ ἢ ὃτι ἀπ ʼ ἀρχῆς , ἐξ οὗ ἐστιν ὁ πατήρ . ὥσπερ γὰρ <strong> ὢν</strong> λέγεται ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐνεστῶτος καιροῦ , οὗτος γὰρ μάλιστα ἁρμόζει αὐτῷ , οὕτω καὶ τὸ <strong> σήμερον</strong> ): and so Corn.-a-lap., Est., Calov., Seb.-Schmidt, Schöttg., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+2:0">Revelation 2:0</span> . A second, to the generation, <em> in time</em> , of the Incarnate Son of Man, when Jesus assumed the divine nature on the side of his <em> Manhood also</em> : so Chrys. (curiously enough using the illustration from <strong> ὤν</strong> , which Thl. afterwards, copying verbatim from him, turns to the opposite purpose: ὥσπερ δὲ <strong> ὤν</strong> λέγεται κ . τ . λ . as above under Thl. to ἁρμόζει αὐτῷ · οὕτω καὶ τὸ <strong> σήμερον</strong> ἐνταῦθά μοι δοκεῖ εἰς τὴν σάρκα εἰρῆσθαι ), Thdrt. ( οὐ τὴν αἰώνιον δηλοῖ γέννησιν , ἀλλὰ τὴν τῷ χρόνῳ συνεζευγμένην . And even more expressly on the Psalm: ταύτην δέ τὴν φωνὴν οὐκ ἄν τις τῇ τοῦ θείου πνεύματος διδασκαλίᾳ πειθόμενος , τῇ θεότητι προσάψοι τοῖ δεσπότου χριστοῦ ), Euseb., Cyr.-alex., Greg.-nyss. (see these in Suicer), Œc., Kuinoel, Stuart, &amp;c. 3. A third, to the period when Jesus was manifested to men as the Son of God, i. e. by most, to the time of the Resurrection, with reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:33">Acts 13:33</span> , where St. Paul alleges this citation as thus applying (so, recently, Delitzsch): by some, to that of the Ascension, when He was set at the right hand of God and entered on His heavenly High-priesthood (ch. Heb 5:5 ): so Hilary (on the Psalm, § 30, vol. i. p. 48, “Id quod nunc in psalmo est, Filius meus es tu, hodie genui te, non ad virginis partum, neque ad lavacri generationem, sed ad primogenitum ex mortuis pertinere apostolica autoritas est:” and again, “Vox ergo hæc Dei patris secundum Apostolum (Acts l. c.) in die resurrectionis exstitit”), Ambrose (de Sacr. iii. 3, vol. iii. p. 362: “Pulchre autem Pater dixit ad Filium: ‘Ego hodie genui te,’ hoc est, quando redemisti populum, quando ad cœli regnum vocasti, quando implesti voluntatem meam: probasti meum esse te Filium”), Calv. (“Frivola Augustini argutia est, qui <em> hodie</em> æternum et continuum fingit. Christus certe æternus est Dei filius, quia sapientia ejus est ante tempus genita. Sed hoc nihil ad præsentem locum, ubi respectus habetur ad homines, a quibus agnitus fuit Christus pro filio Dei postquam eum Pater manifestavit. Hæc igitur declaratio, cujus etiam Paulus meminit ad <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span> , species fuit æternæ (ut ita loquar) generationis. Nam arcana illa et interior quæ præcesserat, hominibus fuit incognita, nec in rationem venire poterat, nisi eam Pater visibili revelatione approbasset”), Grot. (the Resurrection is “initium gloriæ Christi”), al.: Schlichting and the Socinians generally, Storr, Sack, Hengstenberg, &amp;c. Owen also takes the same view (“The eternal generation of Christ, on which His filiation or sonship, both name and thing, doth depend, is to be taken only declaratively, and that declaration to be made in His resurrection, and exaltation over all, that ensued thereon”). Of these interpretations, I agree with Bleek that the <em> first</em> is that which best agrees with the context. The former verses represent to us the Son of God as standing in this relation to the Father before the worlds: and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6">Hebrews 1:6</span> , which plainly forms a contrast to this Heb 1:5 as to time, treats distinctly of the period of the Incarnation. It is natural then to suppose that this verse is to be referred to a time prior to that event. And he also remarks, that the sense of σήμερον thus adopted is by no means foreign to the Alexandrine theology: Philo, de Profugis, § 11, vol. i. p. 554, says, σήμερον δέ ἐστιν ὁ ὰπέραντος καὶ ἀδιεξίτητος αἰών . μηνῶν γὰρ καὶ ἐνιαυτῶν κ . συνόλως χρόνων περίοδοι δόγματα ἀνθρώπων εἰσὶν ἀριθμὸν ἐκτετιμηκότων , τὸ δὲ ἀψευδὲς ὄνομα αἰῶνος ἡ σήμερον . And in Leg. Allegor. iii. § 8, vol. i. p. 92, ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας , τουτέστιν ἀεί . ὁ γὰρ αἰών ἅπας τῷ σήμερον παραμετρεῖται · μέτρον γὰρ τοῦ παντὸς χρόνου ὁ ἡμέριος κύκλος ) <strong> ? and again</strong> (how is the ellipsis here to be supplied? Probably, καὶ ( τίνι εἶπεν ποτὲ τῶν ἀγγέλων ) πάλιν : or perhaps πάλιν (see below on Heb 1:6 ) merely serves to introduce a fresh citation), <strong> I will be to him as</strong> (‘for:’ so the LXX often for the Heb. הָיָה לְ : e. g. in the citation, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:10">Hebrews 8:10</span> . The more ordinary Greek construction would be as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+26:12">Leviticus 26:12</span> , κ . ἔσομαι ὑμῶν θεός , καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθέ μοι λαός ) <strong> a father, and he shall be to me as</strong> (for) <strong> a son</strong> (the citation is from the LXX, as usual. It occurs in the prophecy of Nathan to David, respecting David’s offspring who should come after him. The import of it has been above considered, and its connexion with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:0">Psalms 2:0</span> . shewn to be probable. The direct primary reference of the words to Solomon, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ch+22:7-10">1 Chronicles 22:7-10</span> , does not in any way preclude the view which I have there taken of their finding their higher and only worthy fulfilment in the greater Son of David, who should build the only temple in which God would really dwell. See Bleek in loc., who fully recognizes this further and Messianic reference)?
