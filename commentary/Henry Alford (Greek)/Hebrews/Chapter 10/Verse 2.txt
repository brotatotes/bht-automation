<p><strong> 2</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (if it were so, if the law were able to perfect the worshippers) <strong> would they</strong> ( αἱ αὐταὶ θυσίαι ) <strong> not have ceased being offered, on account of the worshippers</strong> (the servers in the service of the tabernacle, used here in a wide sense, including priests and people) <strong> having no longer any conscience of sins</strong> (for construction, see reff.: = guilt of sin on the conscience, consciousness of the guilt of sin), <strong> if once</strong> (for all) <strong> purified?

<p>That this sentence is to be read ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἄν , and as a question, is pretty universally agreed.

<p>Some, as Thdrt. (apparently: διὰ τοῦτο τέλος ἐκεῖνα λαμβάνει ), D-lat. (“nam nec cessassent offerri”), Beza (edd. 1, 2, “alioqui non desiissent offerri”), Whitby, Valcknaer, read οὐκ , and yet no question; understanding, “for then they would not have ceased to be offered,” viz. on the coming in of the N. T. dispensation. But this is surely hardly worth refutation. The rec. not reading οὐκ , might indeed be well thus rendered, “for in that case they would have ceased to be offered.” But then ἀλλά comes in awkwardly, which, when as here without any emphasis, more naturally follows a negative sentence. The taking our verse interrogatively is as old as Œc.: ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἂν ἐπαύσαντο κατ ʼ ἐρώτησιν ἀνάγνωθι . So also Thl.</p>
