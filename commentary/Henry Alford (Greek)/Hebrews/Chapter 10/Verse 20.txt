<p><strong> 20</strong> .] <strong> which</strong> (entrance: so Œc. (below), Thl. (below), and most Commentators. Some, as Est., Erasm., Calv., Beza, refer the relative to αἵματι , making it attracted into the fem. by ὁδόν . Some again, as Seb. Schmidt, Hammond, al., and D-lat., refer it to παῤῥησίαν . The vulg., “quam initiavit nobis viam novam,” will bear either) <strong> He initiated</strong> (first opened: better than E. V., “consecrated,” which seems as if it existed before: so Œc., ἢν εἴσοδον τῶν ἁγίων νῦν νεωστὶ ἔτεμε : and Thl., ἥντινα εἴσοδον τῶν ἁγίων αὐτὸς ἡμῖν ὁδὸν ἐνεκαίνισε , τουτέστι νέαν ὁδὸν ἐποίησεν , αὐτὸς ταύτης ἀρξάμενος , καὶ αὐτὸς ταύτην βαδίσας πρῶτος . On the word, see note, ch. Heb 9:18 ) <strong> for us</strong> (as) <strong> a way</strong> ( ὁδόν is predicative, ‘to be a way’) <strong> recent</strong> ( ὡς τότε πρῶτον φανεῖσαν , Thdrt.: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25-26">Romans 16:25-26</span> , μυστηρίου χρόνοις αἰωνίοις σεσιγημένου , φανερωθέντος δὲ νῦν κ . τ . λ ., and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:26">Hebrews 9:26</span> . “On the use of <strong> πρόσφατος</strong> , see esp. Wetst. h.l. and Lobeck on Phryn. p. 374 f. The original meaning is ‘slain before,’ from πρό and σφάζω or σφάττω ; and thus, <em> just before, recently, slain</em> or <em> killed</em> : so Il. ω . 757. According to usage, it means ‘fresh,’ <em> recens</em> , in contrast to παλαιός , old or antiquated: and is used not only of recently slain meat (Hippocr.), or a fresh corpse, νεκρὸς πρόσφατος (Herod. ii. 89, 121), but also ἰχθύς , αἷμα , πόμα , σταφυλή (Dioscorid. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:12">Hebrews 10:12</span> ; Num 6:3 ), ἄλφιτον , φῦκος , ἄνθος , ἔλαιον , ἕλκος , χιών (Polyb. iii. 55. 1), μάρτυρες (Aristot. Rhet. i. 15), νίκη (Plutarch), ἀτύχημα (Polyb. i. 21. 9), εὐεργεσίαι (id. ii. 46. 1), δίκαι (Æschyl. Choeph. 800), ὀργή (Lys. p. 151. 5: Jos. Antt. i. 18. 3), φθόνος (Plut. Themistocl. p. 124 a), Demosth. p. 551. 15, ἕκαστος , ἄν τι συμβῇ , πρόσφατος κρίνεται (see also reff.): and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ec+1:9">Ecclesiastes 1:9</span> , οὐκ ἔστι πᾶν πρόσφατον ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον .” Bleek. Others, as Passow, derive the word from πρό , and φένω . But πρόσφατος has not, as Ebrard would make it, the meaning of “ever fresh:” only that of <em> new</em> , ‘of late origin.’ “None before Him trod this way: no believer under the O. T. dared or could, though under a dispensation of preparatory grace, approach God so freely and openly, so fearlessly and joyfully, so closely and intimately, as we now, who come to the Father by the blood of Jesus, His Son.” Stier) <strong> and living</strong> (as contrasted with the mere dead ceremony of entrance into the earthly holy place. This entrance is a real, living and working entrance; the animated substance of what is imported, not the dead shadow. And so Lünemann and Delitzsch: and very nearly, Ebrard and Stier. Most Commentators make <strong> ζῶσαν</strong> = ζωοποιοῦσαν , producing, or leading to life: so Faber Stap., Schlichting, Grot., Peirce, Wetst., Böhme, Kuinoel, De Wette, Olshausen. Others, as Bl., interpret it, “everlasting:” and so Chrys., οὐκ εἶπε ζωῆς , ἀλλὰ ζῶσαν αὐτὴν ἐκάλεσε , τὴν μένουσαν οὕτω δηλῶν : Œc., εἰς ζωὴν ὄντως φέρει , ὅτι καὶ αὐτὴ ζῇ καὶ διαιωνίζει . πρόσφατον εἰπών , ἵνα μή τις εἴπῃ · οὐκοῦν εἰ πρόσφατος , καὶ παυθήσεται · γηράσκουσα γὰρ καὶ παλαιουμένη καὶ αὐτή , ὥσπερ καὶ ἡ τῆς παλαιᾶς διαθήκης καταλυθήσεται · οὐ μὲν οὖν , φησίν , ἀλλὰ πρόσφατος οὖσα ἀεὶ νεάζονσα καὶ ζῶσα ἔσται , οὐδέποτε ἐπιδεχομένη θάνατον καὶ κατάλυσιν ) <strong> through</strong> ( <strong> διὰ</strong> here in its primary local meaning, ‘through,’ not in its derived instrumental one. But no οὖσαν or ἄγουσαν need be supplied, as Bleek: διὰ follows directly upon ἐνεκαίνισεν ) <strong> the veil, that is, his flesh</strong> (on <strong> καταπέτασμα</strong> , see note, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:19">Hebrews 6:19</span> . The Flesh of Christ is here spoken of as the veil hung before the holiest place; that weak human mortal flesh was the state through which He had to pass before He could enter the holiest in heaven for us, and when He put off that flesh, the actual veil in the temple was rent from top to bottom, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:51">Matthew 27:51</span> . And so in the main, the great body of interpreters: the Greek Commentators however, not quite accurately: e. g. Chrys., ἡ γὰρ σὰρξ αὕτη ἔτεμε πρώτη τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῷ ἐκείνην , ἣν καὶ ἐγκαινίσαι λέγει , τῷ καὶ αὐτὸς ἀξιῶσαι διὰ ταύτης βαδίσαι · καταπέτασμα δὲ εἰκότως ἐκάλεσε τὴν σάρκα · ὅτε γὰρ ᾐρέθη εἰς ὕψος , τότε ἐφάνη τὰ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς . And similarly Thl. and Œc., the latter however giving an alternative, καὶ ὅτι ἔκρυπτεν ἐν ἑαυτῇ τὴν θεότητα · καὶ τοῦτο γὰρ ἴδιον καταπετάσματος . Thdrt. understands it of the body of the Lord partaken in the Holy Communion: no less strangely than erroneously: for it is <em> not</em> the <em> Body</em> , but the <em> Flesh</em> of Christ which is the veil: and what our Writer means by that expression is evident from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span> , where ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ points to the time of His suffering Humanity), </p>
