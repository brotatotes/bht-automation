<p><strong> 21</strong> .] <strong> and</strong> (‘having:’ τὸ <strong> ἔχοντες</strong> ἀπὸ κοινοῦ , Œc.) <strong> a great Priest</strong> (i. e. a great <em> High</em> Priest; but here his Priesthood, not his High-priesthood, is more brought into prominence. Do not suppose that <strong> μέγας ἱερεύς</strong> imports ‘High Priest,’ as ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας in the LXX and Philo: our Writer always uses ἀρχιερεύς for it, and in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14">Hebrews 4:14</span> , calls our Lord ἀρχιερέα μέγαν . He is ἱερεὺς μέγας , because He is a Priest on his throne, a “sacerdos regius et rex sacerdotalis,” as Delitzsch quotes from Seb. Schmidt) <strong> over the house of God</strong> (this substitution of the preposition of motion for that of rest, is indicative of a later phase of a language, and requires the supplying of τεταγμένον , or some similar word, to make it good Greek: so Ξενοκλέα ἔταξεν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἱππεῖς , Xen. Cyr. iv. 5. 19. The <strong> οἶκος θεοῦ</strong> here need not be more limited in meaning than in the similar passage ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:2">Hebrews 3:2</span> ; οἶκον δὲ θεοῦ τοὺς πιστοὺς προσηγόρευσεν , Thdrt., Œc., Estius, al. But it is alleged that the expression here must mean the heaven: Thl. having mentioned the other, says, ἤ , ὅπερ οἶμαι μᾶλλον , τὸν οὐρανόν · ἐκεῖνον γὰρ καὶ ἅγια καλεῖ , καὶ ἐν ἐκείνῳ λειτουργεῖν τὸν ἱερέα λέγει , ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἐντυγχάνοντα : and so many Commentators. But Delitzsch well observes that the one meaning, the narrower, need not exclude the other, the wider. It is hardly probable, to begin with, that our Writer should in two places describe Christ as set ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ , in meanings entirely different from each other. Clearly, the heavenly sanctuary is regarded by him as also including the earthly, the Church above as the home of the Church below: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:22">Hebrews 12:22</span> ff.),</p>
