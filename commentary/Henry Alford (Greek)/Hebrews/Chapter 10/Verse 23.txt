<p><strong> 23</strong> .] (First we must treat of the punctuation and connexion. I have stated above the ground for attaching καὶ λελουμένοι κ . τ . λ . to the foregoing, with Syr., Primas., Faber Stap., Luther, E. V., Estius, Seb. Schmidt, Cramer, Michaelis (paraphr.), Wolf, Baumgarten, Storr, Kuin., De Wette, Bleek, Delitzsch, not to κατέχωμεν with Erasm., Beza, Erasm. Schmid, Bengel, Peirce (and Michaelis as Peirce), Griesb., Knapp, Heinrichs, Schulz, Böhme, Lachmann, Tholuck, Tischdf. (edn. 2), Ebrard, Lünemann. Besides, 1. the ground there alleged, it may be further urged, 2. that the λελουμένοι has no imaginable connexion with κατέχωμεν κ . τ . λ ., whereas it continues to describe the condition in which we are to approach God: and, 3. that by joining this participial clause with what follows, the rhythm of the sentence (agst. Lünem.) is entirely broken up. Then, thus much being determined, our next question is, what stop to set after καθαρῷ . Bleek prefers a period, Delitzsch a comma only. I believe a colon, as after ἐπαγγειλάμενος , would best give the form of the sentence, in which the three verbs, προσερχώμεθα … κατέχωμεν … καὶ κατανοῶμεν , are correlative) <strong> let us hold fast</strong> (= κρατῶμεν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14">Hebrews 4:14</span> ; let us hold with full and conscious possession: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span> ; Heb 3:14 ) <strong> the confession</strong> (see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14">Hebrews 4:14</span> ; subjective, but in a pregnant sense, that which we confess, held in our confession of it) <strong> of our hope</strong> (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span> ; and bear in mind that <strong> ἐλπίς</strong> is used also for the object of hope subjectivized: our hope (subj.), as including that on which it is fixed) <strong> so that it may be without wavering</strong> (“Valcknaer compares ἔχειν ἀκλινῆ τὸν λογισμόν , 4Ma 6:7 ” Del. The adjective predicates that which the confession becomes by being held fast: = βεβαίαν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:14">Hebrews 3:14</span> . The word itself is late Greek, found in Ælian, V. H. xii. 64: Lucian, Encom. Demosth. 33: Philo, al): <strong> for He is faithful that promised</strong> (viz. God, see reff.: and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:13">Hebrews 6:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:11">Hebrews 11:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:26">Hebrews 12:26</span> , as referring to Him the title <strong> ὁ ἐπαγγειλάμενος</strong> . Thl. interprets it, ὁ χριστὸς ὁ εἰπών , ὅτι Ὅπου εἰμὶ ἐγώ , καὶ ὁ διάκονος ὁ ἐμὸς ἔσται , and similarly Œc., al., but not so accurately):</p>
