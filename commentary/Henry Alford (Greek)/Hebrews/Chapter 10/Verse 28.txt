The form of the sentence might be changed thus, ‘If Moses’ law could attach to violations of it the inexorable doom of death,’ &amp;c. For the logical purpose of the ‘a minori ad majus,’ the greater punishment includes the less. The reference is especially to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+17:2-7">Deuteronomy 17:2-7</span> , where the punishment of death is attached to the same sin as is here in question, viz. apostasy: ἐὰν εὑρεθῇ .… ἀνὴρ ἢ γυνὴ ὃς ποιήσει τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον κυρίου τ . θεοῦ σου , παρελθεῖν τὴν διαθήκην αὐτοῦ , καὶ <strong> ἐλθόντες</strong> ( ἀπελθόντες Α ) <strong> λατρεύσωσιν θεοῖς ἑτέροις</strong> κ . τ . λ .) <strong> dies</strong> (the normal present) <strong> without benefit of</strong> ( <strong> χωρίς</strong> , apart from: not implying that no one felt compassion for him, but that such compassion, be it what it might, could not affect his doom) <strong> mercies</strong> (the merciful feelings of any who might be interested for him. <strong> οἰκτιρμός</strong> , see on ref.

As to the sense, cf. Thl., τουτέστιν , ἐὰν ὁμολογηθῇ ὑπὸ δύο ἢ τρίων μαρτύρων ὅτι παρέβη τὸν νόμον . The allusion is to Deut. as above, where it is said, ἐπὶ δυσὶν μάρτυσιν ἢ ἐπὶ τρισὶν μάρτυσιν ἀποθανεῖται ):</p>
