<p><strong> 37</strong> .] <strong> For yet a little little while</strong> (this expression is not in Habakkuk, but is found in ref. Isa., ἀποκρύβηθι μικρὸν ὅσον ὅσον , ἕως ἂν παρέλθῃ ἡ ὀργὴ κυρίου , to which the Writer probably alludes. <strong> μικρόν</strong> is the accus. neut.: some (Lün., Del.) say, an independent nominative, referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:19">John 14:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:16">John 16:16</span> ; but neither of those places determines the case. <strong> ὅσον</strong> is often joined to adjectives and nouns, &amp;c., which denote size, to give a certain definiteness to the idea: so μικρὸν ὅσον , Lucian Hermot. 60; ὀλίγον ὅσον , ib. p. 62: and among other places in Wetst. and Loesner, we have the ὅσον repeated in ref.: in Arrian, Indic. 29, ὀλίγοι δὲ αὐτῶν σπείρουσιν ὅσον ὅσον τῆς γῆς : cf. Hermann on Viger, p. 726: Winer, § 36. 3, note. It gives the sense of very small, “aliquantillum” as Hermann expresses it: τὸ δὲ ὅσον ὅσον τὸ πάνυ μικρὸν δηλοῖ , Thl.), <strong> He that is coming</strong> (the solemn prophetical <strong> ὁ ἐρχόμενος</strong> , ‘He that is to come:’ see reff. There is no art. in the LXX, and ἐρχόμενος refers to the vision, or as αὐτόν and ἐρχόμενος in the masc. after ὅρασις , both are naturally referred to some one indicated by the ὅρασις ; and ἐρχόμενος ἥξει , “coming it will come,” is paraphrased into ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἥξει , ‘He that is coming shall come.’ So Bengel: “Apostolus, articulo addito, verba prophetæ eleganter flectit ad Christum”) <strong> shall come, and shall not tarry</strong> .</p>
