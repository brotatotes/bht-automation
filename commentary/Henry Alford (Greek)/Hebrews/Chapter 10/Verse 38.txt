<p><strong> 38</strong> .] <em> Continuation of the paraphrase</em> : the two clauses of Hab 2:4 being transposed. In the original it runs as in E. V.: “Behold his soul (which) is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith:” or, an ambiguity extending to all three places where the saying is quoted, here, and reff. Rom., Gal., “The just by his faith, shall live.” But the other is more probable: see, on all points regarding the Hebrew text, Delitzsch’s note. The transposition is apparently made on purpose, to prevent ὑποστείληται being understood to refer to ἐρχόμενος as its subject. <strong> But my just man</strong> (there is much controversy about <strong> μου</strong> , whether to insert it, and where to insert it. On the whole I agree with Bleek, that the position after δίκαιος , which is found in the LXX-A, was most probably that adopted by our Writer. This, being different from many copies of the LXX, would naturally be altered: and St. Paul’s citations not having μου , it would naturally be omitted from our copies here. Delitzsch’s reason for omitting it, that because our Writer quotes as St. Paul in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:30">Hebrews 10:30</span> , he probably does here also, is in fact a depriving of that fact of all its real interest. Placed as in our text, <strong> μου</strong> will point out that man who is just before God, who belongs to God’s people) <strong> shall live by faith: and</strong> (this <strong> καί</strong> has no place in the LXX, the first clause, here put last, being there asyndetous) <strong> if he</strong> (i. e. the δίκαιος , as Delitzsch very properly insists: not τις understood, nor ἄνθρωπος taken out of δίκαιος , but, in the true spirit of this whole cautionary passage, the very man himself who was justified, and partakes of the Christian life, by faith. The possibility of such a fall is, as he observes, among the principal things taught us by this Epistle) <strong> draw back</strong> (cf. ref. Gal., note. The middle and passive of <strong> ὑποστέλλω</strong> have usually an accus. of the object of fear: so Dinarchus contra Demosth. p. 11, τῆς ἐξ ἀρείου πάγου βουλῆς οὔτε τὴν Δημοσθένους οὔτε Δημάδου δύναμιν ὑποστειλαμένης : Demosth. p. 630, μηδὲν ὑποστελλόμενον μηδ ʼ αἰσχυνόμενον . But sometimes it is absolute, as here: so Eur. Orest. 606, ἐπεὶ θρασύνῃ κοὐχ ὑποστέλλῃ λόγῳ . See several more instances in Kypke), <strong> my soul</strong> ( τίνος ἡ ψυχή ; τοῦ θεοῦ , κατὰ τὸ ἰδίωμα τῆς γραφῆς , ὡς τό , τὰς ἑορτὰς ὑμῶν μισεῖ ἡ ψυχή μου ( Isa 1:14 ), ἢ τοῦ χριστοῦ . The former reference is doubtless right, not the latter, nor that given by Calvin, “Perinde accipiendum est, ac si ex suo sensu Apostolus proferret hanc sententiam”) <strong> hath not pleasure in him</strong> (for construction see reff.).</p>
