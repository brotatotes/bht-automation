<p><strong> 39</strong> .] Here again he returns from that which is threatening in appearance to that which is encouraging and reassuring. <strong> But we</strong> (emphatic; bringing with it, in its mention, all that we are as Christians and that God has made us: you and I, κλήσεως ἐπουρανίου μέτοχοι , ch. Heb 3:1 ) <strong> are not of backsliding</strong> (there is no ellipsis after ἐσμέν , as υἱοί , or τέκνα : the gen. of category is common enough: see Bernhardy, Syntax, p. 165, who gives many examples. ὑποστολή takes up ὑποστείληται above. The word is found in Josephus, in several places: Kypke quotes οὐδεμίαν ὑποστολὴν ποιοῦνται κακοηθείας , and λάθρα τὰ πολλὰ καὶ μεθ ʼ ὑποστολῆς ἐκακούργησε : but both his references, as well as those given by Bleek, are wrong. He also quotes from Plutarch, Moral. p. 501, ὅτε μάλιστα δεῖται ὑπομονῆς κ . σιωπῆς κ . ὑποστολῆς ὁ ἄνθρωπος ) <strong> unto</strong> (as its result: so Rom 6:19 bis, εἰς τὴν ἀνομίαν , εἰς ἁγιασμόν ) <strong> destruction</strong> (in St. Paul’s sense: see reff.: the verb <strong> ἀπόλλυμαι</strong> is equally foreign to this Epistle, only occurring in the citation, ch. Heb 1:11 ), <strong> but of faith unto (the) preservation of (the) soul</strong> (see on <strong> περιποίησις</strong> , note, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:9">1 Thessalonians 5:9</span> . But Delitzsch is right when he warns us against interpreting <strong> περιποίησιν ψυχῆς</strong> simply by περιπ . ζωῆς or σωτηρίας . “The soul ( ψυχή ) is the subject of life and salvation. Faith saves the soul, by linking it to God, the living One. The unbelieving man loses his soul: for not being God’s, neither is he his own: all that his personality has in itself and round itself, is fallen under wrath and the powers of wrath”).</p>
