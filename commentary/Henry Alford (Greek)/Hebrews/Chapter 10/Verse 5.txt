<p><strong> 5</strong> .] <strong> Wherefore</strong> (seeing that the animal sacrifices of the O. T. had no power to take away sin, and that for that end a nobler sacrifice was wanting) <strong> coming into the world he saith</strong> (first, on the citation from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:0">Psalms 40:0</span> . That Psalm, which is inscribed “A Psalm of David,” seems to be a general retrospect, in some time of trouble, of God’s former mercies to him, and of his own course of loving obedience as distinguished from mere expression of outward thankfulness by sacrifice and offering. Thus understood, there will be no difficulty in the direct application of its words to Him, of whose sufferings and of whose obedience all human experiences in suffering and obeying are but a faint resemblance. I have entered on this subject in speaking of the Messianic citation in ch. 2, and need not lay down again the principles there contended for, further than to say, that the more any son of man approaches, in position, or office, or individual spiritual experience, the incarnate Son of God, the more directly may his holy breathings in the power of Christ’s Spirit be taken as the utterances of Christ Himself. And of all men, the prophet-king of Israel thus resembled and out-shadowed Him the most. The Psalm itself seems to belong to the time of David’s persecution by Saul; and the sentiment of this portion of it is, as Delitzsch observes, an echo of Samuel’s saying to Saul in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:22">1 Samuel 15:22</span> , “Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord?”

<p>Next, what is <strong> εἰσερχόμενος εἰς τὸν κόσμον</strong> ? It expresses, I believe, the whole time during which the Lord, being ripened in human resolution, was in intent devoting himself to the doing of his Father’s will: the time of which that youthful question “Wist ye not that I must be ἐν τοῖς τοῦ πατρός μου ?” was one of the opening announcements. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+7:16">Isaiah 7:16</span> . To refer these words thus to his maturing purpose, seems far better than to understand them as Erasmus, “veluti mundum ingressurus,” from the O. T. point of time: or as Grot., with whom are Bleek and De W., “cum e vita privata egrediens nomine Dei agere cœpit cum populo,” for that would more naturally require εἰσελθών , besides being liable to the objection, that it is not of Christ’s declaration before the world, but of his purpose as regards the Father, that our text treats: or as Lünem., “in intent to enter into the world,” by becoming man: or “ <em> nascendo</em> ,” as Böhme, and similarly Hofmann: for thus it could hardly be said, σῶμα κατηρτίσω μοι ), <strong> Sacrifice</strong> (of slain animals) <strong> and offering</strong> (of any kind: see reff.) <strong> thou wouldest not</strong> (similar declarations are found frequently in the O. T., and mostly in the Prophets: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+50:7-15">Psalms 50:7-15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:16">Psalms 51:16</span> f.: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:11">Isaiah 1:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+6:20">Jeremiah 6:20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+7:21-23">Jeremiah 7:21-23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:6">Hosea 6:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="am+5:21">Amos 5:21</span> ff.: Mic 6:6-8 ), <strong> but a body didst thou prepare for me</strong> ( אָזְנַיִם כָּרִיתָ לִּי , “ <em> mine ears hast thou opened</em> ,” “fodisti,” “concavas reddidisti,” i. e. to hear and obey Thee. The idea of there being any allusion to the custom of boring through the ear of a slave who voluntarily remained subject to his master, Exo 21:6 and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+15:17">Deuteronomy 15:17</span> , seems to be a mistake. Neither the verb כָּרָה , nor the plural substantive אָזְנַיִם , will bear it without forcing: in Exod. l. c., the subst. is singular, and the verb is רָצַע . See Bleek, vol. ii. p. 633, note. The difficulty is, how such a clause can be rendered by <strong> σῶμα κατηρτίσω μοι</strong> , as it is in the LXX. Some (e. g. Bleek, Lünem., after Usher de LXX Int. Vers. p. 85 sq., Semler, Michaelis, Ernesti, al.) have supposed a <em> misreading</em> , owing to the last letter of the foregoing word ἠθέλησαΣ preceding ΩΤΙΑ , the ΤΙ being mistaken for M. The reading ὠτία is now found only in one ms. of the LXX (Holmes, 39), ὦτα in two (Holmes, 142, 156): it is the rendering of Theodotion, of the Quinta and Sexta in Origen, of Jerome (“aures autem perfecisti mihi”), of Eusebius (comm. in loc. Bleek, ii. p. 631, note, τὰ ὦτά μου καὶ τὴν ὑπακοὴν τῶν σῶν λογίων κατηρτίσω ), of the Psalterium San-Germanense (in Sabatier: “aures perfecisti mihi”), and Irenæus (Interp. iv. 17. 1, p. 248), which two last Delitzsch suspects, but apparently without ground, of being corrections from the vulgate. Over against this hypothesis, of the present LXX text having sprung from a misreading, we may set the idea that the LXX have <em> chosen this expression</em> <strong> σῶμα κατηρτίσω μοι</strong> <em> by which to render the Hebrew</em> , as being more inteligible to the reader. This is the hypothesis adopted by Delitzsch, and that which was maintained with slight variation by Jac. Cappellus (“quia rem, ut alias sæpe, spectarunt magis quam verba”), Wolf (whose note gives all the literature of the passage at his own time. His view is that the σῶμα of our Lord was the μορφὴ δούλου , and thus answers to the “perfossio auris”), Carpzov, Tholuck, Ebrard, al. Others again suppose that the Writer of this Epistle has altered the expression to suit better the prophetical purpose. So an old Scholiast in the Lond. edn. of the LXX, 1653: τὸ ὠτία δὲ κατηρτίσω μοι ὁ μακάριος Παῦλος εἰς τὸ σῶμα μεταβαλὼν εἴρηκεν , οὐκ ἀγνοῶν τὸ Ἑβραϊκόν , ἀλλὰ πρὸς τὸν οἰκεῖον σκοπὸν τούτῳ χρησάμενος . I would leave the difficulty an unsolved one, not being satisfied by either of the above views, and having no other to propound. As Christian believers, our course is plain. How the word <strong> σῶμα</strong> came into the LXX, we cannot say: but being there, it is now sanctioned for us by the citation here: not as the, or even a proper rendering of the Hebrew, but as a prophetic utterance, equivalent to and representing that other):</p>
