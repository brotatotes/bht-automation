<p><strong> 7</strong> .] <strong> then I said</strong> (viz. when Thou hadst prepared a body for me), <strong> Behold, I am come, in the volume of the book it is written concerning me, to do, O God, thy will</strong> (the connexion and construction are somewhat differently given from those in the LXX. There it stands, τότε εἶπον Ἰδοὺ ἥκω , ἐν κεφαλίδι βιβλίου γέγραπται περὶ ἐμοῦ , τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ θέλημά σου , ὁ θεός μου , ἠβουλήθην , καὶ τὸν νόμον σου ἐν μέσῳ τῆς καρδίας μου : where τοῦ ποιῆσαι depends on ἠβουλήθην . And so in the Hebrew: see E. V. As our text stands, <strong> τοῦ ποιῆσαι</strong> depends on <strong> ἥκω</strong> , and <strong> ἐν κεφ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> βιβ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γέγρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> περὶ ἐμοῦ</strong> is parenthetical: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:9">Hebrews 10:9</span> . <strong> κεφαλίς</strong> is the LXX rendering of מְנִלָּה , a roll, or volume, as also in reff. Suid., κεφαλὶς βιβλίου , ὅπερ τινὲς εἵλημά φασι . κεφαλίς appears to have got this meaning from signifying the heads or knobs which terminated the cylinder on which the mss. were rolled, and which were called in Latin <em> umbilici</em> . On <strong> ποιῆσαι τὸ θέλημά σου</strong> , Thl. says, θέλημα δὲ τοῦ θεοῦ πατρὸς τὸ τὸν υἱὸν ὑπὲρ τοῦ κόσμου τυθῆναι κ . δικαιωθῆναι τοὺς ἀνθρώπους οὐκ ἐν θυσίαις ἀλλ ʼ ἐν τῷ θανάτῳ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ : and Chrys., τοῦ ἐμαυτόν φησιν ἐκδοῦναι , τοῦτο τοῦ θεοῦ θέλημα ).</p>
