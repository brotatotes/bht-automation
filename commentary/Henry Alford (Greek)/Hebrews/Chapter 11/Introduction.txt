<p>CHAP. <strong> 11</strong> .] ‘We are of FAITH,’ concluded the last chapter. And now this great word comes before the mind of the Writer for its <em> definition</em> , its <em> exemplification</em> , its <em> triumphs</em> . By this, all the servants of God from the first have been upheld, and stimulated, and carried through their glorious course. By this exemplification the Writer evermore warmed and carried forward breaks out at last into a strain of sublime eloquence, in which he gathers together in one the many noble deeds of faith which time and space would not allow of his specifying severally.
