<p><strong> 1</strong> .] <strong> Now Faith is</strong> (the rec. text has a comma after πίστις , thus throwing the stress upon ἔστιν , and making it mean either, “Now there is a faith, which is” &amp;c., or “Now faith really exists, being” &amp;c. And the alleged ground for this arrangement is, that the ordinary rendering, “Now faith is,” would require πίστις δέ ἐστιν , or ἡ δὲ πίστις ἐστίν . But this argument is nugatory. <strong> ἔστιν</strong> at the opening of the sentence does, it is true, often indicate emphatically absolute existence, e. g. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:13">Hebrews 4:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:15">Acts 13:15</span> ; 1Co 8:5 ; 1Co 15:44 al. fr. (in Del.); but frequently it is the mere logical copula, with a certain emphasis on it, carrying a strong affirmation or negation of the truth of the subsequent predication. See Delitzsch here, and Winer, § 7. 3. So that our Writer does not say, ‘There is a faith, which is.…,’ nor ‘Faith has a real existence, being.…,’ but he describes that πίστις to which in ch. Heb 10:39 he had stated us to belong. And this word ‘describes’ is perhaps more strictly correct than ‘defines:’ for the words which follow are not a definition of that in which faith consists, but of that which faith serves as and secures to us. A <em> definition</em> would approach rather from the side of the subjective phænomena of faith. Yet when speaking broadly and not strictly, we may well call this the definition of faith: and nearly so Thomas Aquinas (in Del.), “Respondeo dicendum, quod licet quidam dicant prædicta Apostoli verba non esse fidei definitionem, quia definitio indicat rei quidditatem et essentiam, tamen, si quis recte consideret, omnia, ex quibus potest fides definiri, in prædicta descriptione tanguntur, licet verba non ordinentur sub forma definitionis.” Delitzsch compares several forms of similar definitions in Philo, e. g. ἔστι δὲ στεναγμὸς σφόδρα καὶ ἐντεταμένη λύπη (Leg. Alleg. iii. 75, vol. i. p. 129): ἔστι δὲ εὐχὴ αἴτησις ἀγαθῶν παρὰ θεοῦ (Quod Deus Immut. 19, p. 285): ἔστι γὰρ φιλοσοφία ἐπιτήδευσις σοφίας , σοφία δὲ ἐπιστήμη θείων κ . ἀνθρωπίνων καὶ τῶν τούτων αἰτιῶν (De Congr. Quær. Erud. Gr. 14, p. 530): and an appositional one of faith itself, De Conf. Ling. 9, p. 409, where it is said to be ἡ ὀχυρωτάτη καὶ βεβαιοτάτη διάθεσις , and, De Migr. Abr. 9, p. 442, he says of faith, ἀρτηθεῖσα γὰρ καὶ ἐκκρεμασθεῖσα ἐλπίδος χρηστῆς , καὶ ἀνενδοίαστα νομίσασα ἤδη παρεῖναι τὰ μὴ παρόντα , διὰ τὴν τοῦ ὑποσχομένου βεβαιοτάτην πίστιν , ἀγαθὸν τέλειον , ἆθλον εὕρηται . It was this passage apparently which led Jerome to make the remark which Grotius quotes in his note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:23">James 2:23</span> , “Quæ si quis recte consideret, inveniet optime concurrere cum eo quod Scriptor ad Hebræos, <em> Philoneum aliquid spirans</em> ut Hieronymo videtur, scripsit, ἔστι δὲ πίστις κ . τ . λ .” Notice that it is of <em> faith</em> in general, <em> all</em> faith, not here of faith in God in particular, that the Writer is speaking: and πίστις is anarthrous, as throughout the chapter) <strong> confidence</strong> (there has been much difference concerning the meaning of <strong> ὑπόστασις</strong> . The ancients for the most part understand it here as “substantia” (so vulg.), substance, the real and true essence: faith gives reality to things not yet seen, so that they are treated as veritably present. So e. g. Chrys., ἐπειδὴ γὰρ τὰ ἐν ἐλπίδι ἀνυπόστατα εἶναι δοκεῖ , ἡ πίστις ὑπόστασιν αὐτοῖς χαρίζεται · μᾶλλον δὲ οὐ χαρίζεται ἀλλ ʼ αὐτό ἐστιν οὐσία αὐτῶν · οἷον ἡ ἀνάστασις οὐ παραγέγονεν οὐδέ ἐστιν ἐν ὑποστάσει , ἀλλ ʼ ἡ ἐλπὶς ὑφίστησιν αὐτὴν ἐν τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ ψυχῇ : Thdrt., δείκνυσιν ὡς ὑφεστῶτα τὰ μηδέπω γεγενημένα : Œc., πίστις ἐστὶν αὐτὴ ἡ ὑπόστασις καὶ οὐσία τῶν ἐλπιζομένων πραγυάτων · ἐπειδὴ γὰρ τὰ ἐν ἐλπίσιν ἀνυπόστατά ἐστιν ὡς τέως μὴ παρόντα , ἡ πίστις οὐσία τις αὐτῶν καὶ ὑπόστασις γίνεται , εἶναι αὐτὰ καὶ παρεῖναι τρόπον τινὰ παρασκευάζουσα διὰ τοῦ πιστεύειν εἶναι : Thl., οὐσίωσις τῶν μήπω ὄντων καὶ ὑπόστασις τῶν μὴ ὑφεστώτων : Ambr [58] (De Pœnit. ii. 3 (15), vol. ii. p. 419), Aug [59] (In Joann. Tract. lxxix. 1, vol. iii. pt. ii.), Vatablus (“rerum quæ sperantur essentia”), H. Steph. (“illud quod facit ut jam exstent, quæ sperantur”), Schlichting, Bengel, Heinrichs, Bisping, al. Others have rendered it “ <em> fundamentum</em> :” so Faber Stap., Erasm. (paraphr.), Calvin, Beza (“illud quo subsistunt”), Clarius, Stein, Sykes, Carpzov, al. On the other hand the majority of modern Commentators have preferred the meaning which ὑπόστασις bears in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:14">Hebrews 3:14</span> , where see note: viz. “confidence.” So Luther, Camero, Grotius, Hammond, Wolf, Böhme, Bleek, De Wette, Tholuck, Stuart, Ebrard, Lünemann, Delitzsch, al. And there can be no reasonable doubt, that this is the true rendering here. Thus only do the two descriptions given correspond in nature and quality: and thus only does ὑπόστασις itself answer to what we might expect by ἐλπιζομένων being used and not some word like ἀνυποστάτων . The one being subjective in both these cases of parallel, it is but reasonable that the other should be also. Delitzsch, as usual when any psychological question arises, has gone into this matter at great length, and his note should by all means be read. He compares a very remarkable passage of Dante, Paradiso, xxiv. 52 81) <strong> of things hoped for</strong> (the old Latin versions were certainly wrong in rendering <strong> ἐλπιζομένων</strong> “ <em> sperantium</em> .” But, granting that it is neuter, a question arises as to the arrangement of the word πραγμάτων , whether it belongs to ἐλπιζομένων or to οὐ βλεπομένων . Chrys., Œc., the vulg., Calvin in his version, Estius, Böhme, al. join it with the former: Thl., Ambrose, Aug [60] , Faber Stap., most of the Commentators, and, as Bleek believes, all the editions, with the latter. And for two reasons, this seems to be the right connexion. It preserves the rhythm better, which otherwise would halt, by the second clause being so much shorter than the first, and it is more likely that πραγμάτων , indicating as it does rather material objective facts than objects of hope, should be joined with the objective οὐ βλεπομένων , than with the subjective ἐλπιζομένων ), <strong> demonstration</strong> (another dispute has arisen, about the meaning of <strong> ἔλεγχος</strong> . From ἐλέγχειν , to <em> convict</em> , or <em> convince</em> , of persons, to <em> prove</em> or <em> demonstrate</em> , of things, comes ἔλεγχος , <em> conviction</em> , or <em> proof</em> : Aristot. Rhet. ad Alex. c. 14, ἔλεγχος δέ ἐστιν ὁ μὲν μὴ δυνατὸς ἄλλως ἔχειν ἀλλ ʼ οὕτως ὡς ἡμεῖς λέγομεν . So the vulg. has rendered “ <em> argumentum</em> ,” Aug [61] , Prosper., Mutianus, “ <em> convictio</em> ,” Calvin, “ <em> demonstratio</em> ” or “ <em> evidentia</em> ” (“evidence,” E. V.), Hammond (and similarly Luther), “ <em> firma persuasio</em> .” Chrys. says, βαβαί οἵᾳ ἐχρήσατο λέξει εἰπὼν ἔλεγχος οὐ βλεπομένων · ἔλεγχος γὰρ λέγεται ἐπὶ τῶν λίαν ἀδήλων (but the reading of the best mss. and of the Benedictine edn. is δήλων )· ἡ πίστις τοίνυν ἐστὶν ὄψις τῶν ἀδήλων , φησί , καὶ εἰς τὴν αὐτὴν τοῖς ὁρωμένοις φέρει πληροφορίαν τὰ μὴ ὁρώμενα : Œc., ἀπόδειξις τῶν οὐ βλεπομένων · ἀποδείκνυσι δὲ ὁρατὰ τὰ ἀόρατα ἡ πίστις · πῶς ; τῷ νῷ καὶ ταῖς ἐλπίσιν ὁρῶσα τὰ μὴ φαινόμενα : Thl., ἔλεγχος , τουτέστι δεῖξις καὶ φανέρωσις ἀδήλων πραγμάτων · ποιεῖ γὰρ ταῦτα βλέπεσθαι τῷ νῷ ἡμῶν ὡς πορόντα . The old Latin version in D renders most strangely, “ <em> accusator non videntium</em> .” The modern Commentators are divided: some have taken the subjective sense of <em> conviction</em> , <em> inward persuasion of the truth of</em> : so Menken, Bleek, De W., Lünem. But, as Tholuck remarks, this sense of the word is hardly borne out by usage. And therefore we seem driven back on the objective meaning as referred to things, viz. <em> proof</em> , or <em> demonstration</em> . This is adopted by Bengel, Böhme, Stier, Ebrard, Hofmann, al. As far as the <em> sense</em> is concerned, both come to the same in the end. It is faith, an act of the mind, which <em> is</em> this demonstration: it is therefore necessarily subjective in its effect, is the demonstration <em> to him who believes</em> ) <strong> of matters</strong> (see above) <strong> not seen</strong> (this πράγματα οὐ βλεπόμενα is a much wider designation than ἐλπιζόμενα , embracing the whole realm of the spiritual and invisible, even to the being and essence of God Himself: see below, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:6">Hebrews 11:6</span> ; and cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:24">Romans 8:24</span> , where St. Paul’s expressions differ slightly in form from these. There is no ground whatever for saying that our Writer makes faith identical with hope. Faith is the ὑπόστασις of ἐλπιζόμενα : Hope <em> exists</em> independently of it, but derives its reality, and is ripened into confidence, by its means. And faith is the demonstration to us of that which we do not see: cf. the beautiful words of Calvin: “Nobis vita æterna promittitur, sed mortuis: nobis sermo fit de beata resurrectione, interea putredine sumus obvoluti: justi pronuntiamur, et habitat in nobis peccatum: audimus nos esse beatos, interea obruimur infinitis miseriis: promittitur bonorum omnium affluentia, prolixe vero esurimus et sitimus: clamat Deus statim se nobis adfuturum, sed videtur surdus esse ad clamores nostros. Quid fierit, nisi spei inniteremur, ac mens nostra prælucente Dei verbo ac spiritu per medias tenebras supra mundum emergeret?”).
