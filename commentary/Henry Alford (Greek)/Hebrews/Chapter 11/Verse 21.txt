<p><strong> 21</strong> .] <strong> By faith Jacob, when dying</strong> (reff.), <strong> blessed each of the sons of Joseph</strong> (the faith consisted in transposing his hands wittingly, laying the right hand on the head of the younger, Ephraim, who was to become the greater tribe): <strong> and he worshipped</strong> (this incident is not connected with the other, but took place before it, on another occasion, when Jacob made Joseph swear to him that he would bury him with his fathers, and not in Egypt, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:31">Genesis 47:31</span> . Perhaps the Writer inverts the order of the two, to bring the two acts of blessing, that of Isaac and that of Jacob, together. This act of worship was one of faith, inasmuch as it was connected with a command, the point of which was, God’s promise respecting the land of Canaan. And the faith was shewn by the turning of his aged and dying body in a posture of thankful adoration) <strong> on the top of his staff</strong> (an incalculable quantity of idolatrous non-sense has been written on these words by R.-Cath. Commentators, taking as their starting-point the rendering of the Vulg. “et adoravit fastigium virgæ ejus,” and thence deriving an argument for the worship of images, assuming that there was an image or symbol of power upon <em> Joseph’s</em> staff, to which they apply the words. But first, it must be <em> Jacob’s</em> , not Joseph’s staff, which is intended “virgæ <em> suæ</em> ,” not “ <em> ejus</em> ,” as Faber Stap. remarked, and Aug [63] notices, qu. 162, in Genesin, vol. iii. pt. i., “Quod habent Latini codices, <em> Et adoravit super caput virgæ ejus</em> , nonnulli codices emendatius habent, <em> Adoravit supra caput virgæ suæ, vel in capite virgæ suæ</em> , sive <em> in cacumine</em> , vel <em> super cacumen</em> (notice, there is nothing here about <em> adoravit fastigium</em> , of which see more below). Fallit eos enim verbum Græcum quod eisdem litteris scribitur sive <em> ejus</em> , sive <em> suæ</em> : sed accentus dispares sunt, et ab eis qui ista noverunt in codicibus non contemnuntur; valent enim ad magnam discretionem. Quamvis et unam plus literam habere posset, si esset <em> suæ</em> , ut non esset αὐτοῦ , sed ἑαυτοῦ .” Then what follows is well worth transcribing: “Ac per hoc merito quæritur, quid sit quod dictum est. Nam facile intelligitur senem qui virgam ferebat eo more quo illa ætas baculum solet, ut se inclinavit ad Deum adorandum, id utique fecisse super cacumen virgœ suæ, quam sic ferebat, ut super eum caput inclinando adoraret Deum. Quid est ergo, <em> Adoravit super cacumen virgæ ejus</em> , id est, filii sui Joseph? An forte tulerat ab eo virgam, quando ei jurabat idem filius, et dum cam tenet, post verba jurantis, nondum illa reddita mox adoravit Deum? Non enim pudebat eum ferre tantisper insigne potestatis filii sui, ubi figura magnæ rei futuræ præsignabatur: quamvis in Hebræo facillima hujus quæstionis absolutio esse dicatur, ubi scriptum perhibent, <em> Et adoravit Israel adcaputlecti</em> , in quo utique senex jacebat, et sic positum habebat, ut in eo sine labore, quando vellet, oraret. Nec ideo tamen quod septuaginta interpretati sunt, nullum vel levem sensum habere putandum est.” The reader will observe that there is nothing here of adoring the staff or the top of the staff. What Jerome thought of such an idea, is plainly seen, Quæst Heb. in Genesin, vol. iii. p. 371: “In hoc loco quidem frustra simulant adorasse Jacob summitatem seeptri Joseph, quod videlicet honorans filium, potestatem ejus adoraverit: cum in Hebræo multo aliter legatur, et adoravit, inquit, Israel ad caput lectuli: quod scilicet, postquam ei juraverat filius, securus de petitione quam rogaverat adoraverit Deum contra caput lectuli sui. Sanctus quippe et Deo deditus vir, oppressus senectute, sic habebat lectulum positum, ut ipse jacentis habitus absque difficultate ulla ad orationem esset paratus.” The idea itself is found in Chrys., but without the <em> image</em> : τουτέστι , καὶ γέρων ὢν ἤδη προσεκύνει τῷ Ἰωσήφ , τὴν παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ προσκύνησιν δηλῶν τὴν ἐσομένην αὐτῷ . And so Thl., Phot. in Œc., and apparently Thdrt.: so Erasm. (par.), “Longius etiam prospiciebat senis fides, cum exosculans virgam filii Joseph, veneraretur in eo Christum omnibus imperaturum, cujus ille delatus et proditus a fratribus imaginem gesserat.” I will only cite the inference from the above ancient data in Corn. a-Lapide, as most instructive regarding the grounds on which age after age the chief abominations of the church of Rome have been introduced: “Recte ergo <em> ex hac adoratione sceptri Josephi</em> Patres Concilii Niceni II. <em> probant adorationem et cultum imaginum</em> , eumque non in imagine hærere, sed ad prototypum suum referri et transire docent.” The real question with regard to the passage is confined within very narrow limits. The same Hebrew word מטה signifies a staff, or a bed, according as it is pointed מַטֶּה or מִטָּה . And, as there are no points in the ancient Heb. text, it is an open question, which meaning we are to take. The LXX have taken ῥάβδος , though as Jerome notices, in loc., they have rendered the same word κλίνη in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:2">Genesis 48:2</span> , two verses after. Our E. V. has taken this latter: “And Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head.” And so almost all the moderns agree in taking it. Stuart, it is true, has argued at some length for the meaning “staff,” on the ground that the eastern beds have no head properly so called, being merely a carpet or rug spread on the ground. But he has in his mind in thus objecting, a bed <em> stead</em> , not a bed. The head of a bed, be it where or what it may, is that part of it where the person’s head lies: and Delitzsch has made it probable from the Heb. verb, וַיִּשְׁתַּחוּ , “se prostravit,” that Jacob turned himself in his bed so as to lay his face to the pillow: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+38:2">Isaiah 38:2</span> .

<p>If the ‘staff’ is to be taken, then it must be his own, not Joseph’s staff, which is indicated, and the gesture might have had a meaning correspondent to the thought in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+32:10">Genesis 32:10</span> , ἐν τῇ ῥάβδῳ μου διέβην τὸν Ἰορδάνην τοῦτον : viz. the recognition of that God who had supported him through life, and declaration of his having done with all human supports. On the whole, see Suicer, vol. ii. p. 858. It is due to the better R.-C. Commentators, such as Estius and Justiniani, to say, that no such inference as that cited above is to be found in them.

<p>Some have expressed surprise that no mention is made of the far more important blessings of the twelve sons of Jacob in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:0">Genesis 49:0</span> ; and conjectures have even been made to amend the text: e. g. that of Böhme, ἕκαστον τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰωσήφ : but both without reason. Delitzsch says well, “He plucks, so to speak, only the flowers which stand by his way, and leaves the whole meadow-full to his readers”).</p>
