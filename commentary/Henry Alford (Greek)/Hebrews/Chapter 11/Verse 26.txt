<p><strong> 26</strong> .] <strong> esteeming</strong> (the second aor. part. is contemporary, not antecedent, to the first: it comes in with a slightly ratiocinative force “esteeming, as he did”) <strong> the reproach of Christ</strong> (what is the <strong> ὀνειδισμὸς τοῦ χριστοῦ</strong> ? Certainly not, with Thl. (so even Lünem.), merely reproach <em> similar to that of Christ</em> : ὥσπερ γὰρ ὕστερον τὸν χριστὸν ὠνείδιζον οἱ παρ ʼ αὐτοῦ εὐεργετούμενοι , καὶ τελευταῖον ἐσταύρωσαν · οὕτω καὶ πρότερον Μωσῆν οἱ παρ ʼ αὐτοῦ εὐεργετούμενοι : nor again does the more usual explanation, τὸ διὰ χριστὸν ὀνειδίζεσθαι (Chrys.), satisfy the genitive here; nor even the modification of it which makes Moses thus choose, from a principle of faith in the Messiah to come. Thdrt. is better, who explains it τὸ ἐν τύπῳ χριστοῦ : but then he generalizes it off into τὸ κατὰ τῆς εὐσεβείας ὑπὸ τῶν ἐναντίων τολμώμενον , as Thl. above. The typical sense is not excluded: but it is included in a higher one. Far better is Bleek, “reproach which Christ had to bear in his own person, and has to bear in his members.” And in this view, we may say, as Del. and Hofm., that all Israel’s reproach was Christ’s reproach: Israel typified Christ; all Israel’s sufferings as the people of God were Christ’s sufferings, not only by anticipation in type, but by that inclusion in Christ which they, His members before the Head was revealed, possessed in common with us. So Estius, “ <em> improperium Christi</em> , i. e. populi Dei Christum exspectantis, quatenus injuria membrorum in caput redundat.” Nay Christ was ever present in and among God’s people: and thus De Wette well and finely says here, “The Writer calls the reproach which Moses suffered, the reproach of Christ, as Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:5">2 Corinthians 1:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span> , calls the sufferings of Christians the sufferings of Christ, i. e. of Christ dwelling, striving, suffering, in his Church as in His body; to which this reproach is referred according to the idea of the unity of the Old and New Testaments, and of the eternal Christ (the Logos) already living and reigning in the former.” And so Tholuck. See the whole well discussed in Delitzsch’s note: and in Bleek. Cf. ch. Heb 13:13 ) <strong> greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he looked</strong> ( <strong> ἀποβλέπειν εἰς</strong> is well defined by Bl., “so to look at any thing, as to be by waiting for it, or generally by the regard of it, determined or strengthened in a course of action.” So Demosth. Mid. p. 515, οὐδ ʼ ἀπέβλεψεν εἰς τὰς οὐσίας τὰς τούτων : Isocr. ad Nicocl., ὅταν μὲν γὰρ ἀποβλέψωσιν εἰς τὰς τιμὰς κ . τοὺς πλούτους κ . τὰς δυναστείας : and often in Plato, e. g. Gorgias, p. 474 D, 503 D: Alcib. (2) 145 A: Legg. iv. 707 C) <strong> to the recompense of reward</strong> (reff.: viz. the great eternal reward spoken of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:39">Hebrews 11:39</span> f.: not the possession of Canaan merely, as Grot.).</p>
