<p><strong> 29</strong> .] <strong> By faith, they</strong> (see above) <strong> crossed</strong> (the verb <strong> διαβαίνω</strong> is used of crossing water, whether in boats, or on a bridge, or swimming or wading: e. g. Herod. i. 75, of the river Halys, Κροῖσος , … κατὰ τὰς ἐούσας γεφύρας <strong> διεβίβασε</strong> τὸν στρατόν : … ἀπορέοντος ὅκως οἱ <strong> διαβήσεται</strong> τ . ποταμὸν ὁ στρατός : … ἐπεί τε καὶ ἐσχίσθη τάχιστα ὁ ποταμός , ἀμφοτέρῃ <strong> διαβατὸς</strong> ἐγένετο . Here it is used of a <em> bridge</em> , of <em> crossing, generally</em> , and of a <em> ford</em> . See other examples in Bl.) <strong> the red sea</strong> (so the LXX always for יַם־סוּף , the sea of (red) weeds) <strong> as through dry land</strong> (we should rather expect ὡς ξηρὰν γῆν ; but the unusual expression is apparently borrowed from the narrative in Exodus (ref.), οἱ δὲ νἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπορεύθησαν διὰ ξηρᾶς ἐν μέσῳ τῆς θαλάσσης ): <strong> of which</strong> (viz. of the <em> red sea</em> , not, of the <em> dry land</em> , as Böhme, Kuinoel, and Klee. For as Lün. observes, the idea of the sea is necessarily called up again by κατεπόθησαν , shewing that it, and not the dry land, is the leading idea) <strong> the Egyptians making experiment</strong> (here, πεῖραν λαμβάνειν is in an active sense: in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:36">Hebrews 11:36</span> , in a passive. Both are sufficiently common: e. g. for the active, Plato, Protag. p. 342 A, εἰ βούλει λαβεῖν μου πεῖραν ὅπως ἔχω : ib. 348 A: Gorg. 448 A: Polyb. ii. 32. 5, ἔκριναν τῆς τύχης λαβεῖν πεῖραν . See many others in Bleek: and for the other sense, on Heb 11:36 ) <strong> were swallowed up</strong> (by the sea. The verb is a general one, qualified by the particular mode of καταπίνεσθαι . So in reff. Exod. and Num.: Diod. Sic. i. 32, τῶν δ ʼ ἀποσχιζομένων μερῶν τὸ μὲν .… ὑπ ʼ ἄμμου καταπίνεται . And Polyb. ii. 41. 7, using the word of drowning, qualifies it: Ἑλίκης , τῆς .… ὑπὸ τῆς θαλάττης καταποθείσης . There is something to be said for the reading κατεποντίσθησαν , though it is weakly supported by mss., as being the Alex. reading of the LXX in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:4">Exodus 15:4</span> , and found in Chrys. and Thdrt. Bleek inclines to think that our Writer may have had it in his Alexandrine LXX).</p>
