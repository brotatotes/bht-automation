<p><strong> 32</strong> .] <strong> And what say I</strong> ( <strong> λέγω</strong> is most probably indicative, not subjunctive: cf. ref.: and see Winer, 41. <em> a.</em> 3: Bernhardy, p. 396. The sense is the same: ‘What am I saying, going to say, more,’ is tantamount to ‘what shall I say more’) <strong> yet</strong> (more, any further)? <strong> for the time</strong> ( ὁ χρόνος ὁ τῇ ἐπιστολῇ , φησίν , ἁρμόδιος καὶ οἷον ἡ συμμετρία , Œc.: ποῖος ; ἢ ὁ πᾶς · εἴρηται δὲ τοῦτο , ὡς συνηθὲς ἡμῖν λέγειν , ὑπερβολικῶς · ἤ , ὁ τῇ ἐπιστολῇ σύμμετρος , Thl. The latter is the more probable) <strong> will fail me</strong> ( ἐπιλίποι ἄν με would imply, <em> if I undertook it</em> , the hypothesis affecting the whole clause: the ind. future states the failure of the time as a positive certainty, the hypothesis now lying in the pres. part. διηγούμενον . The phrase is a common one, and the construction regular: cf. Demosth. p. 324. 17, ἐπιλείψει με λέγοντα ἡ ἡμέρα τὰ τῶν προδοτῶν ὀνόματα : Julian, Orat. i. p. 341 B, ἐπιλείψει με τἀκείνου διηγούμενον ὁ χρόνος : Philo de Merc. Meretr. § 3, vol. ii. p. 167, ἐπιλείψει με ἡ ἡμέρα λέγοντα τὰ τῶν κατ ʼ εἶδος ἀρετῶν ὀνόματα : and many other examples, Greek and Latin, in Wetst. and Bleek) <strong> narrating</strong> (if I narrate) <strong> concerning</strong> (so we have in Plato, Euthyd. p. 6 C, πολλὰ περὶ τῶν θείων διηγήσομαι ) <strong> Gideon</strong> (it is almost impossible to determine satisfactorily the arrangement of the copula from the manuscript evidence: and if once we allow subjectivities to creep in, there is no end to the varieties which different men may find suitable. I have left the rec. text, which though against [64] [65] , has the great body of manuscripts with it. And thus standing, the names form two groups: 1. Γεδεών , Βαράκ τε καὶ Σάμψων , καὶ Ἰεφθάε , … 2. Δαυείδ τε καὶ Σαμουὴλ καὶ τῶν προφητῶν : the former, the Judges: the latter, the Prophets, David and Samuel at the head of them, the former as a king, the latter as a judge, being exceptional and transitional. The order is not chronological: Gideon, the first mentioned, is posterior in time to Barak, the second; Samson, the third, to Jephthah, the fourth; and David, the first of the second group, posterior to Samuel, the second. The reason for this may be the greater celebrity of Gideon as a champion of the faith than of Barak, and of Samson than of Jephthah: and in the second group, it is natural to put David, for his eminence, first, and besides, Samuel thus becomes the first in the rank of the Prophets properly so called, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:24">Acts 3:24</span> . Delitzsch’s arrangement, which makes Γεδεὼν Βαράκ τε καὶ Σάμψων the first group, Ἰεφθάε , Δαυείδ τε καὶ Σαμουὴλ the second, and the Prophets a third, suits indeed the strictly pressing of the τε καί in the two places, which is a trifling matter, but by placing Jephthah with David, and separating Samuel from the Prophets, breaks up the real and far more important classification. The <strong> τε καί</strong> is in fact no more than the simple copula in sense, but a little varied: and as De Wette has remarked, Gideon and Barak, David and Jephthah are not more nearly connected by it, than the other names by καί . On Gideon, see Judges 6-8) <strong> and Barak</strong> ( Jdg 4:5 Barak was not so strong in faith as he might have been, though he did believe, and go to the fight, and triumph: see Jdg 4:8-9 ) <strong> and Samson</strong> (Judges 13-16) <strong> and Jephthah</strong> ( Jdg 11:1 to Jdg 12:7 ) <strong> and David and Samuel and the prophets;

<p style="margin-left:3em;"><strong> [64]</strong> The MS. referred to by this symbol is that commonly called the Alexandrine, or CODEX ALEXANDRINUS. It once belonged to Cyrillus Lucaris, patriarch of Alexandria and then of Constantinople, who in the year 1628 presented it to our King Charles I. It is now in the British Museum. It is on parchment in four volumes, of which three contain the Old, and one the New Testament, with the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians. This fourth volume is exhibited open in a glass case. It will be seen by the letters in the inner margin of this edition, that the first 24 chapters of Matthew are wanting in it, its first leaf commencing ὁ νυμφίος , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span> : as also the leaves containing ἵνα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:50">John 6:50</span> , to καὶ σύ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:52">John 8:52</span> . It is generally agreed that it was written at Alexandria; it does not, however, <em> in the Gospels</em> , represent that commonly known as the Alexandrine text, but approaches much more nearly to the Constantinopolitan, or generally received text. The New Testament, according to its text, was edited, in uncial types cast to imitate those of the MS., by Woide, London, 1786, the Old Testament by Baber, London, 1819: and its N.T. text has now been edited in common type by Mr. B. H. Cowper, London, 1861. The date of this MS. has been variously assigned, but it is now pretty generally agreed to be the <em> fifth century</em> .

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [65] The CODEX SINAITICUS. Procured by Tischendorf, in 1859, from the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai. The Codex Frederico-Augustanus (now at Leipsic), obtained in 1844 from the same monastery, is a portion of the same copy of the Greek Bible, the 148 leaves of which, containing the entire New Testament, the Ep. of Barnabas, parts of Hermas, and 199 more leaves of the Septuagint, have now been edited by the discoverer. A magnificent edition prepared at the expense of the Emperor of Russia appeared in January, 1863, and a smaller edition containing the N.T. &amp;c., has been published by Dr. Tischendorf. The MS. has four columns on a page, and has been altered by several different correctors, one or more of whom Tischendorf considers to have lived in the sixth century. The work of the original scribe has been examined, not only by Tischendorf, but by Tregelles and other competent judges, and is by them assigned to the <em> fourth</em> <em> century</em> . The internal character of the text agrees with the external, as the student may judge for himself from the readings given in the digest. The principal correctors as distinguished by Tischendorf are: A, of the same age with the MS. itself, probably the corrector who revised the book, before it left the hands of the scribe, denoted therefore by us א -corr 1 ; B (cited as א 2 ), who in the first page of Matt. began inserting breathings, accents, &amp;c., but did not carry out his design, and touched only a few later passages; C a (cited as א 3a ) has corrected very largely throughout the book. Wherever in our digest a reading is cited as found in א 1 , it is to be understood, if no further statement is given, that C a altered it to that which is found in our text; C b (cited as א 3b ) lived about the same time as C a , i.e. some centuries later than the original scribe. These are all that we need notice here 6 .</p>
