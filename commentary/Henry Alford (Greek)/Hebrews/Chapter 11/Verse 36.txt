<p><strong> 36</strong> .] <strong> others again</strong> (no further contrast need be brought out; ἄλλοι μέν , ἕτεροι δέ , is common enough in recounting various classes) <strong> had trial</strong> (the passive sense of πεῖραν λαμβάνειν , as we had the active before, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:29">Hebrews 11:29</span> , where see examples of that use. The passive signification is found Polyb. xxviii. 9. 7, πολλοὺς ἄν ἐποίησε τῆς αὐτῆς τύχης πεῖραν αὐτῷ λαβεῖν : Diod. Sic. xii. 24, τὴν θυγατέρα ἀπέκτεινεν , ἵνα μὴ τῆς ὕβρεως λάβῃ πεῖραν : Jos. Antt. ii. 5. 1, οὗ ( τοῦ θεοῦ ) πεῖραν τῆς προνοίας εὐθὺς ἐλάμβανον . See more in Bleek on Heb 11:29 ) <strong> of cruel mockings</strong> (so the E. V. well: for the word must mean insult accompanied with cruelty, judging from its use in the place here referred to, viz. 2Ma 7:7 , τὸν δεύτερον ἦγον ἐπὶ τὸν ἐμπαιγμόν : and 10, μετὰ δὲ τοῦτον ὁ τρίτος ἐνεπαίζετο . See also 1Ma 9:26 ) <strong> and of scourgings</strong> (see reff. 2 Macc.), <strong> yea moreover</strong> ( <strong> ἔτι δέ</strong> rises in climax: so out of many examples in Bleek, Xen. Œcon. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:12">Hebrews 11:12</span> , ἔτι δὲ ἡ γῆ θέλουσα … διδάσκει , “and moreover the earth of herself teaches,” &amp;c.) <strong> of bonds and prison</strong> (so Jonathan, 1Ma 13:12 . But perhaps he now speaks more generally, e. g. of Hanani, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ch+16:10">2 Chronicles 16:10</span> , Micaiah, the son of Imlah, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:26">1 Kings 22:26</span> , and Jeremiah, Jer 32:2-3 al.):</p>
