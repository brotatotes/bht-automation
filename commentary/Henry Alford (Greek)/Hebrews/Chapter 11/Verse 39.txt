<p><strong> 39</strong> .] <strong> And these all</strong> (‘these, every one of them.’ πάντες οὗτοι would be ‘all these.’ All, viz. all that have been named or referred to throughout the chapter: not only, as Hammond, al., those ἄλλοι since Heb 11:35 ), <strong> borne witness to by their faith</strong> (the emphasis is on <strong> μαρτυρηθέντες</strong> , not on διὰ τῆς πίστεως : and the sense is rather ‘ <em> though</em> borne witness to,’ than ‘ <em> being</em> ’ or ‘ <em> because</em> , borne witness to.’ On the word and its import see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:2">Hebrews 11:2</span> ; Heb 11:4-5 ), <strong> did not receive the promise</strong> (many promises indeed they did receive, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:33">Hebrews 11:33</span> ; but not THE PROMISE κατ ʼ ἐξοχήν , the promise of final salvation, or as it is called ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span> , τὴν ἐπαγγ . τῆς αἰωνίου κληρονομίας : the perfection, to which without us they were not to attain. “But,” says Delitzsch, “do we not read ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:15">Hebrews 6:15</span> , of Abraham, ἐπέτυχεν τῆς ἐπαγγελίας ? Certainly, he has obtained the promise, yet not this side the grave, but, as we there maintained, in his life on the other side the grave: the general and actual salvation of the N. T. is, in their heavenly estate, the joy of the patriarchs. And this view is confirmed by looking forward to ch. 12, where the O. T. believers translated into heaven are called the πνεύματα δικαίων τετελειωμένων , or at all events are included in that designation. And another question arises. It is said of the O. T. saints, that they did not obtain the promise: but is it not plain, from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:36">Hebrews 10:36</span> , that κομίζεσθαι τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν is for us also a thing future? Doubtless, but with a significant difference. For them, final salvation was a thing purely future: for us, it is a thing present as well as future: present, in that it is once for all brought about by Christ’s offering of Himself, future, inasmuch as the unfolding of all the fulness of that which we possess, and the taking possession of it, when unfolded in its fulness, is for us yet to come: cf. ch. Heb 9:28 with Heb 10:14 ”),</p>
