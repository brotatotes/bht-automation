<p><strong> 4</strong> .] <strong> By faith</strong> (see above) <strong> Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain</strong> (not elliptic, for παρὰ τὴν τοῦ Κάϊν : but as in reff., ‘than Cain did.’ But how <strong> πλείονα</strong> θυσίαν ? First, there can be no doubt that the adj. must be taken not of quantity, but of quality. So Chrys., τὴν ἐντιμοτέραν λέγει , τὴν λαμπροτέραν , τὴν ἀναγκαιοτέραν : and Thdrt. and Thl., τὴν τιμιωτέραν . But how was it so? Our text answers us, πίστει . The more excellence must be looked for then rather in the disposition with which the sacrifice was offered than in the nature of the sacrifice itself. Gregory the Great (cited by Del.) says well, “Omne quod datur Deo, ex dantis mente pensatur; unde scriptum est, ‘Respexit Deus ad Abel et ad munera ejus, ad Cain autem et ad munera ejus non respexit.’ Neque enim sacrum eloquium dicit, respexit ad munera Abel et ad Cain munera non respexit, sed prius ait quia respexit ad Abel, ac deinde subjunxit, ‘et ad munera ejus.’ Idcirco non Abel ex muneribus, sed ex Abel munera oblata placuerunt.” This beyond doubt is the principal ground of the πλείονα . With regard to the sacrifices themselves; with our present knowledge of type and sacrifice, many reasons might be alleged why that of Abel should be more according to God’s will than that of Cain; but none of those reasons can be safely or decisively applied here. That Abel’s consisted of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof the <em> first and the best</em> , whereas Cain’s was merely an offering of the fruit of the ground, perfunctory and common-place, may be a circumstance not without weight in appreciating the term πίστει . That Abel’s was an offering of slain animals, God’s own appointed way, so soon after, of the sinner’s approach to Him, whereas Cain’s was only a gift, as if he could approach God without shedding of blood, this may also be an important element in the term πίστει . But it would not be safe here to insist on either of these. The difference alleged by Hofmann, Schriftb. ii. 1. 141, that Abel brought the flesh of those beasts whose skin had covered his bodily nakedness, in faith, as an offering imputing the covering of his soul’s nakedness by God’s grace, is too far-fetched, and too alien from any subsequent typology of sacrifice, to be entertained for a moment), <strong> by means of</strong> <strong> which</strong> (viz. which <em> faith</em> , not, which <em> sacrifice</em> , as Cramer: <strong> δι</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἧς</strong> must apply to the same as δι ʼ αὐτῆς below, and that surely can refer to nothing but the πίστις which is the great leading idea of the chapter) <strong> he was testified</strong> (see above, Heb 11:2 ) <strong> to be righteous</strong> (when? by whom? not, by our Saviour, nor by St. John (reff.), though in both places such testimony is borne to him: but as explained in the next clause, at the time of his sacrifice, and by God Himself), <strong> God bearing testimony upon</strong> (in regard to: the same prep. and case, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:4">Genesis 4:4</span> , καὶ ἐπεῖδεν ὁ θεὸς ἐπὶ Ἀβὲλ καὶ <strong> ἐπὶ τοῖς δώροις</strong> αὐτοῦ ) <strong> his gifts</strong> (of what kind this testimony was, there can be little doubt. Theodotion’s rendering, καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν αὐτὰ ὁ θεός , though wrong as a rendering, is probably right in fact. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:24">Exodus 14:24</span> ; 1Ki 18:24 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:38">1 Kings 18:38</span> . Chrys. refers to this rendering, but erroneously attributes it to the Syr.: Thl. says, λέγεται δὲ ὅτι καὶ πῦρ κατελθὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἀνήλωσε τὴν θυσίαν , καὶ ἐκ τούτου καὶ ὁ Κάϊν ἐπέγνω ὅτι προετιμήθη ὁ Ἀβέλ . πῶς γὰρ ἂν ἄλλως ; διὸ καί τις τῶν μεταθεμένων τὴν Ἑβραΐδα εἶς τὴν Ἑλλάδα γλῶτταν οὕτως ἔθηκεν , Ἐπέβλεπεν ἐπὶ τὰς θυσίας Ἀβὲλ ὁ κύριος καὶ ἐνέπρησε . Œc. also mentions the report); <strong> and by means of it</strong> (his faith, again, not, as Œc., al., his sacrifice: see above) <strong> having died</strong> (join together, not δι ʼ αὐτῆς ἀποθανών , as Œc., πρόφασις γὰρ αὐτῷ γέγονεν ἡ θυσία σφαγῆς , but δι ʼ αὐτῆς λαλεῖ : see below) <strong> he yet speaketh</strong> (viz. as interpreted by the parallel place, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:24">Hebrews 12:24</span> , where it is said of the αἷμα ῥαντισμοῦ , that it κρεῖττον λαλεῖ παρὰ τὸν Ἀβέλ , by means of his blood, of which it is said by God in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:10">Genesis 4:10</span> , φωνὴ αἵματος τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου βοᾷ πρός με ἐκ τῆς γῆς . So Th. Aquinas, Galen, Ribera, Jac. Cappell., Grot., Erasm., al., Bleek, De Wette, Lünem., Ebrard, Delitzsch. The interpretation of <strong> λαλεῖ</strong> (and of <strong> λαλεῖται</strong> , so that no safe inference can be gathered as to the reading from the fact of this interpretation) has usually been as in Chrys., πῶς ἔτι λαλεῖ ; τοῦτο καὶ τοῦ ζῆν σημεῖόν ἐστιν καὶ τοῦ παρὰ πάντων ᾄδεσθαι θαυμάζεσθαι καὶ μακαρίζεσθαι (see also below): Thdrt., τὸ δὲ ἔτι λαλεῖ , ἀντὶ τοῦ ἀοίδιμός ἐστι μέχρι τοῦ παρόντος καὶ πολυθρύλλητος , καὶ παρὰ πάντων εὐφημεῖται τῶν εὐσεβῶν : Œc., λαλεῖ δὲ τῇ φήμῃ , τῇ δόξῃ , τῇ μνήμῃ : Thl., δοξαζόμενος , μνημονευόμενος λαλεῖ , ὡς καὶ ὁ οὐρανὸς λαλεῖ ὁρώμενος μόνον . Probably the change to the passive has been due to this interpretation, that voice seeming more naturally to express it. Some of those who read λαλεῖ , have taken it in the sense of “speaks to us to follow his example.” So Chrys. in the next words to those quoted above: ὁ γὰρ παραινῶν τοῖς ἄλλοις δικαίοις εἶναι , λαλεῖ : Thl., ἡ πίστις αὐτὸν ἐποίησεν ἔτι ζῆν καὶ διδάσκαλον καθίστασθαι πᾶσι , λαλοῦντα μονονουχὶ Μιμήσασθέ με κ . τ . λ .: Corn. a-Lapide, joining however the two, “Pietas, martyrium et memoria adhuc recens est et celebratur apud omnes fideles eosque ad sui imitationem exhortatur melius quam si Abel mille linguis eos exhortaretur:” Valcknaer, Kuinoel, al. And perhaps Stuart may be partly right, who, recognizing the allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:10">Genesis 4:10</span> , says, “The form of expression only in our verse seems to be borrowed from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:10">Genesis 4:10</span> ; for here it is the <em> faith</em> of Abel which makes him speak after his death; viz. to those who should come after him, exhorting and encouraging them to follow his example.” I say <em> partly</em> right, for however this may be in the background, the cry of his blood is obviously primary in the Writer’s thought, from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:24">Hebrews 12:24</span> , where the voice of Abel is contrasted with that of the Christian blood of sprinkling. Calvin and Delitzsch appear to have exactly hit the right point, in saying, “Porro singulare divini erga eum amoris hoc testimonium fuit, quod Deus curam habuit mortui: atque inde patet reputari inter Dei sanctos, quorum mors illi pretiosa est”).</p>
