<p><strong> 6</strong> .] <strong> but apart from faith it is impossible</strong> (it is a general axiom, not a mere assertion regarding Enoch; if it were, we should expect ἀδύνατον ( ἦν ) αὐτῷ ) <strong> to please</strong> (Him, as is evident) <strong> at all</strong> (this sense of doing a single act well pleasing to God, is given by the aorist: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:8">Romans 8:8</span> , οἱ δὲ ἐν σαρκὶ ὄντες θεῷ ἀρέσαι οὐ δύνανται . The aor. expresses simply the verbal idea without reference to time; and therefore when in a negative sentence gives the exclusive meaning ‘at any time,’ ‘at all’): <strong> for it behoves him that cometh to God</strong> (Luther, al. render, “him that will come:” but it is much more probable that <strong> ὁ προσερχόμενος</strong> is the habitual, official present ‘the comer to God.’ For the expression, see reff. It is that approach which is elsewhere designated ἐγγίζειν τῷ θ ., ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:19">Hebrews 7:19</span> , for the purposes of worship or of communion, or of trust, or service generally) <strong> to believe</strong> (aor., not πιστεύειν , because it is not here the state in which the comer is at his coming, but the state which has originated his coming, of which that coming is the fruit, which is insisted on) <strong> that He is</strong> (exists: his faith being to him thus a πράγματος ἔλεγχος οὐ βλεπομένου ), <strong> and becomes</strong> (is eventually: ‘evadit’) <strong> a renderer of reward</strong> (ch. Heb 2:2 ) <strong> to them that seek Him out</strong> ( <strong> ἐκζητέω</strong> , more than ζητέω , as ‘exoro’ than ‘oro.’ Thus his faith is also to him an ἐλπιζομένων ὑπόστασις : God’s existence is realized to him by it, and by it his future reward assured).</p>
