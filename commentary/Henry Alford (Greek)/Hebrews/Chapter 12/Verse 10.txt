<p><strong> 10</strong> .] The a fortiori is strengthened, by bringing out the difference between the two chastisements as to their <em> character</em> . <strong> For they indeed</strong> (our earthly parents) <strong> for a few days</strong> (see the meaning below. <strong> πρός</strong> as in reff. mainly temporal, but also indicating reference: ‘during, and with a view to.’ See below) <strong> chastised us</strong> (imperf. as above, Heb 12:9 ) <strong> after their own pleasure</strong> (according to that which seemed good to them: their standard and rule of action in the matter was at best their own view of what was right, and too often their own caprice or temper, ἡδονὴν πληροῦντες πολλάκις , Chrys.), <strong> but He in order to</strong> ( <strong> ἐπί</strong> , of the contemplated direction of the result) <strong> that which is profitable, in order to our partaking of His holiness</strong> ( <strong> ἁγιότης</strong> , except in the two places in reff., no where found in Greek literature. It is a more complete abstract than ἁγιωσύνη , which is rather inherent and attributive. The becoming partakers of God’s holiness is manifestly to be taken subjectively: becoming holy like Him. So Thl. partly after Chrys.: τῆς ἁγ ., τουτέστι , τῆς καθαρότητος αὐτοῦ · ὥστε , φησί , γενέσθαι ἡμᾶς δεκτικοὺς τῶν αὐτοῦ ἀγαθῶν · ἄρα οὖν ἡ παιδεία μετάληψις ἁγιότητός ἐστι , καὶ εἰκότως · συστρέφει γὰρ τὴν ψυχὴν πρὸς τὸν ἅγιον θεόν , μὴ ἐῶσα αὐτὴν πρὸς ἀνθρώπινόν τι ῥέμβεσθαι ). Two questions arise regarding this verse: 1. what is the intended reference of <strong> πρὸς ὀλίγας ἡμέρας</strong> ? 2. what are the clauses opposed to one another? The former of these questions in fact involves the latter. <strong> πρὸς ὀλίγας ἡμέρας</strong> has been understood by many of the <em> duration of our natural life</em> , as the term to which the chastisement of our natural parents had reference, whereas that of our Heavenly Father regarded eternity. So Calv., Estius, Justiniani, Corn. a-Lap., Calmet, Schlichting, Limborch, Bengel, Tholuck, Ebrard, al. But this cannot be the meaning of the Writer. For in the first place it is not true that all earthly correction had regard only to the present life. And in the next, there is not one word in the latter clause expressing the eternal nature of God’s purpose, which surely there would have been. The other interpretation, ‘during and in reference to the time of our being subject to their chastisement,’ is certainly the right one. So Œc. ( ἢ γὰρ θάνατος τοῦ πατρός , ἢ αὔξησις τοῦ παιδός , ἵστησι τὴν παιδείαν ), Thl., Schol.-Matthæi, vulg. (“in tempore paucorum dierum”). D-lat., Erasm.(par.), Luth, Jac. Cappell., Grot., Wetst., Böhme, Kuinoel, Bleek, Lünem., Delitzsch, al. Then we come to the second question, how the antitheses are to be arranged. Some, as Wetst., Storr, Böhme, Kuinoel, and Bleek, have thought that πρὸς ὀλίγας ἡμέρας is to be supplied in the second member of the sentence also: seeing that the divine chastisement, like the human, lasts for a few days only, i. e. for the term of this time of trial. Others again would supply in the second member some <em> contrast</em> to πρὸς ὀλ . ἡμ . So Œc. ( ὁ δὲ θεὸς ἀεὶ παιδεύων τελείους ποιεῖ ), Thl., Jac. Cappell., al. Delitzsch takes the antithesis thus: The second pair of contrasts, with which he begins, is κατὰ τὸ δοκοῦν αὐτοῖς and ἐπὶ τὸ συμφέρον . The other is, πρὸς ὀλίγας ἡμέρας , and εἰς τὸ μεταλ . τ . ἁγιότητος αὐτοῦ . As in πρός the meanings of duration and intention are mingled, so in εἰς the meanings of intention and result. But I cannot think that Delitzsch is right. Both order of words, and correspondence of meaning, are against him. Surely the true antithesis is that pointed out by the order of the clauses themselves, and by their correspondence: 1. πρὸς ὀλίγας ἡμέρας and ἐπὶ τὸ συμφέρον : 2. κατὰ τὸ δοκοῦν αὐτοῖς and εἰς τὸ μεταλ . τ . ἁγ . αὐτοῦ . In (1), we have set over against one another, the short time during which, the temporary reference with which, their chastisement was inflicted, and the great purpose, implied as eternal from its very expression as τὸ συμφέρον for an immortal being, for which He chastises us: and in (2), are opposed, their purpose and standard of action, to satisfy their own seeming, be it good or bad, and His purpose, to make us partakers of His holiness, which holiness, absolute and pure, is His rule of acting, and no mere δοκοῦν αὐτῷ . Thus all is straightforward, and no clause need be supplied.</p>
