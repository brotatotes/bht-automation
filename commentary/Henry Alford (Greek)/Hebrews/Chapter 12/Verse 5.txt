See in reff.: Il. π . 602, οὐδ ʼ ἄρ ʼ Ἀχαιοὶ ἀλκῆς ἐξελάθοντο . It is perhaps chosen here, as Del. suggests, not without some reference to the sound of ἐκλυόμενοι before and ἐκλύου following. See var. readd.

<p>There is a great difference among Commentators as to whether these words are to be read affirmatively or interrogatively. The former view is taken by all the ancient expositors, and many moderns, among whom are Wittich, Surenbusius, Wolf, Bengel, Kuinoel, Klee, Tholuck, De Wette, Ebrard. The interrogative view is taken by Calvin, Beza (b), Braun, Böhme, Lachmann, Bleek, De Wette, Bisping, Lünemann, Delitzsch. The ground on which this latter is defended is that, if declarative, the words would be too severe for the general tenor of the passage. I own I cannot see this. The fact of their having thus forgotten the exhortation is surely assumed below, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:7-11">Hebrews 12:7-11</span> ; and from this point forward the Writer takes up the tone of reproof, which comes to its height in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:16-17">Hebrews 12:16-17</span> . And not only this. The interrogative form would surely be most unnatural, coupled closely as it would be with an assertion of fact, οὔπω .… ἀντικατέστητε ) <strong> the exhortation</strong> ( <strong> παράκλησις</strong> , as elsewhere in N. T. and especially in St. Luke (reff.), unites the ideas of exhortation and consolation. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:18">Hebrews 6:18</span> , and on παρακαλεῖν , ch. Heb 3:13 ), <strong> the which</strong> (that kind of exhortation, of which the following is a specimen: such seems to be the force of ἥτις instead of ἥ ) <strong> discourses with you</strong> (so <strong> διαλέγεσθαι</strong> in the Acts, of opening a discourse with any one: see reff.) <strong> as with sons, My son</strong> ( υἱέ in LXX: see digest), <strong> despise not</strong> ( <strong> ὀλιγωρέω</strong> is not uncommon in the classics, and with a genitive, as here) <strong> the chastening of the Lord, nor faint, when corrected by Him</strong> (Heb., “and have no aversion to His correction”):</p>
