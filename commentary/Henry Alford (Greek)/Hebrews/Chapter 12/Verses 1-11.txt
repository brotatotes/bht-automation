<p><strong> 1 11</strong> .] EXHORTATION, <em> mixed with reproof, on looking back at all these witnesses, and looking also to Jesus, who has come to glory through suffering, not to faint in the conflict with sin; nor to forget the love of our Father, who visits us with chastisement that we may bring forth the fruit of righteousness</em> . This exhortation was begun at ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19">Hebrews 10:19</span> , and broken off by the insertion of all those examples of the nature and triumphs of faith. It is now resumed, having, so to speak, accumulated new momentum by the interruption, and is pressed home directly on the readers.</p>
