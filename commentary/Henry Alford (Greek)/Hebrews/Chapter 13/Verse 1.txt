<p><strong> 1</strong> .] <strong> Let brotherly love</strong> ( <strong> φιλαδελφία</strong> in the classics, the love of brothers and sisters for one another: in the N. T., the love of the Christian brethren. In ref. 2 Pet. it is expressly distinguished from ἀγάπη , the more general word) <strong> remain</strong> (we learn from the Acts, on the hypothesis of this Epistle being addressed to the church at Jerusalem (on which, however see Prolegg.), how eminent this brotherly love had been in that church, and, without any hypothesis as to the readers, we see from our ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:32">Hebrews 10:32</span> ff. that the persons here addressed had exercised it aforetime, and from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:10">Hebrews 6:10</span> , that they still continued to exercise it. Let it then remain, not die out. And it is put first, as being the first of the fruits of faith. The exhortations in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span> f.; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:24">Hebrews 10:24</span> f.; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:12">Hebrews 12:12</span> ff., point the same way).</p>
