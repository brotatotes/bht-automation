<p><strong> 11</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (reason why this exclusion has place: because our great Sacrifice is not one of those in which the servants of the tabernacle had any share, but answers to one which was wholly taken out and burnt: see below) <strong> of the animals of which the blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest, of these the bodies are consumed by fire outside the camp</strong> (there was a distinction in the sacrifices as to the subsequent participation of certain parts of them by the priests. Those of which they <em> did partake</em> (I take these particulars mainly from Delitzsch) were: 1. the sin-offering of the rulers (a male kid), and the sin-offering of the common people (a female kid or lamb), <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+4:22">Leviticus 4:22</span> ff., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+4:27">Leviticus 4:27</span> ff. (compare the rules ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+6:0">Leviticus 6:0</span> about eating and not eating the sacrifices): 2. the dove of the poor man, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+5:9">Leviticus 5:9</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+5:3">Leviticus 5:3</span> . the trespass-offering, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+7:7">Leviticus 7:7</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+7:4">Leviticus 7:4</span> . the skin of the whole burnt-offering, ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+7:8">Leviticus 7:8</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+7:5">Leviticus 7:5</span> . the wave-breast and heave-shoulder of the peace-offerings. 6. the wave-offerings on the feast of weeks, entire. But those of which they <em> did not partake</em> were, 1. the sin-offering of the high priest for himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+4:5-7">Leviticus 4:5-7</span> , esp. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+4:12">Leviticus 4:12</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+4:2">Leviticus 4:2</span> . the sin-offerings for sins of ignorance of the congregation, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+4:16-21">Leviticus 4:16-21</span> , cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+15:24">Numbers 15:24</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+15:3">Numbers 15:3</span> . the sin-offering for high priest and people combined, on the great day of atonement, the blood of which was brought not only into the holy but into the holiest place, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+16:27">Leviticus 16:27</span> . Besides which we have a general rule, to which doubtless the Writer here alludes, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+6:30">Leviticus 6:30</span> , “No sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.” As regards particular expressions: <strong> τὰ ἅγια</strong> here, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:8">Hebrews 9:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:24-25">Hebrews 9:24-25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19">Hebrews 10:19</span> , probably means not the holy place commonly so called, but the holy of holies, into which the blood of the sin-offering was brought on the day of atonement, and which only typified heaven, whither Christ as High Priest is entered with His Blood. <strong> ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς</strong> refers to the time when Israel was encamped in the wilderness: the enclosure of the camp was afterwards replaced by the walls of Jerusalem, so that ἔξω τῆς πύλης below answers to it).</p>
