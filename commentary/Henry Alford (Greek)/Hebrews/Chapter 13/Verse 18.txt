<p><strong> 18</strong> .] <strong> Pray for us</strong> (here, as elsewhere, it is probably a mistake to suppose that the first person plural indicates the Writer alone. As Del. observes, the passage from the ἡγούμενοι to the Writer individually would be harsh. And when Bleek finds in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:19">Hebrews 13:19</span> a proof that the Writer only is meant, he misses the point, that this ἡμῶν , including the Writer and his companions, is in fact a transition note between Heb 13:17 and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:19">Hebrews 13:19</span> .
