The expression λόγος παρακλήσεως applies without doubt to the whole Epistle, from what follows: not as Beza, Calov., al., to the few exhortations preceding, nor as Grot. to ch. 10 13 only: nor as Kuinoel, al., to the exhortations scattered up and down in the Epistle.

T., see reff.) <strong> to you</strong> .</p>
