<p><strong> 3</strong> .] <strong> Remember</strong> (cf. ch. Heb 2:6 ) <strong> them that are in bonds, as if bound with them</strong> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:26">1 Corinthians 12:26</span> ; as fully sympathizing with them in their captivity: not, as Böhme, al., “quippe ejus naturæ et conditionis homines, qui ipsi quoque pro captivis sint, nimirum in ecclesia pressa degentes,” which is travelling too far from the context): <strong> those in distress</strong> ( <strong> κακουχουμένων</strong> is the general idea, including captives and any other classes of distressed persons: as Œc. and Thl., ἢ ἐν φυλακαῖς ἢ ἐν λιμῷ ἢ ἐν ἑτέρᾳ θλίψει ), <strong> as also yourselves being in the body</strong> (i. e. as in reff., bound up with a body which has the same capacity of suffering. The words have been differently rendered. Calvin says, “Refero ad ecclesiæ corpus, ut sit sensus, Quandoquidem estis ejusdem corporis membra, communiter vos affici decet alios aliorum malis:” and so Braun, al. But this cannot be extracted from the words <strong> ἐν σώματι</strong> , without the article. Beza renders, “ac si ipsi quoque corpore adflicti essetis:” and says, “ ἐν σώματι prorsus videtur illud declarare quod in vernaculo sermone dicimus <em> en personne</em> :” in other words, says Bleek, as Philo expresses it, De Spec. Legg. ad 6. 7, § 30, vol. ii. p. 326, ὡς ἐν τοῖς ἑτέρων σώμασιν αὐτοὶ κακούμενοι . But this is equally out of the question: and there can be no doubt that the simple meaning is the true one. So Œc. ( εἰ γάρ τις ἀναλογίσαιτο , ὅτι καὶ αὐτὸς περίκειται ὁμοιοπαθὲς ἐκείνοις σῶμα , ἐλεήσει μᾶλλον αὐτοὺς διά τε τὴν συμπάθειαν καὶ διὰ τὸν φόβον μὴ τὰ ὅμοια ἐκ τῆς ἀπανθρωπίας πάθῃ ), Thl., and most Commentators).</p>
