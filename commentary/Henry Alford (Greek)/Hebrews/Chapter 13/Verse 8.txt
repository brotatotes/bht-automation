<p><strong> 8</strong> .] <strong> Jesus Christ is yesterday and to-day the same, and for ever</strong> (as to the <em> construction</em> , <strong> ὁ αὐτός</strong> is the predicate to all three times, not as vulg. (not Syr., if at least Etheridge’s version of it is to be trusted), “Jesus Christus heri et hodie: ipse et in sæcula;” Ambr [78] (passim), Calvin, al. As to the <em> connexion</em> , the verse stands as a transition from what has passed to what follows. ‘It was Christ whom these ἡγούμενοι preached, ἐλάλησαν τὸν λόγον τοῦ θεοῦ : Christ who supported them to the end, being the author and finisher of their faith; and He remains still with regard to you ( ὥσπερ τοὺς ἡγουμένους ὑμῶν οὐ κατέλιπεν , ἀλλ ʼ ἐν πᾶσιν ἀντελαμβάνετο αὐτῶν , οὕτω καὶ ὑμῶν ἀντιλήψεται · ὁ αὐτὸς γάρ ἐστι , altern. in Thl. Similarly Chrys. alt.) <em> the same</em> : be not then carried away’ &amp;c. As to the <em> meaning</em> of the words, <strong> ἐχθές</strong> (the common and also Attic form, whereas χθές is Epic, Ionic, and Attic) refers to the time past, when their ἡγούμενοι passed away from them; <strong> σήμερον</strong> to the time present, when the Writer and the readers were living.

<p>In our E. V., this verse, by the omission of the copula ‘is,’ appears as if it were in apposition with “the end of whose conversation:” and in the carelessly printed polyglott of Bagster, the matter is made worse, by a <em> colon</em> being substituted for the <em> period</em> after “conversation.” Observe <strong> Ἰησοῦς χριστός</strong> , not common with our Writer: only e. g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:21">Hebrews 13:21</span> , where he wishes to give a solemn fulness to the mention of the Lord: Jesus, the Person, of whom we have been proving, that He is χριστός , the Anointed of God. Cf. also ch. Heb 10:10 ).</p>
