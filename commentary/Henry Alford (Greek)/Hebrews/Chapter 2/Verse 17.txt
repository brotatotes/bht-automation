<p><strong> 17</strong> .] Because then He had this work to do for the seed of Abraham (sons of men, in the wider reference), viz. to deliver them from <em> fear</em> of death, He must be made like them in all things, that He may be a merciful and faithful High Priest. Then Heb 2:18 gives the reason of this necessity. <strong> Whence</strong> ( <strong> ὅθεν</strong> is a favourite inferential particle with our Writer. It never occurs in the Epistles of Paul. On ref. Acts, see Prolegg. to Acts, § ii. 17 δ . It is = δι ʼ ἣν αἰτίαν , Heb 2:11 ) <strong> it behoved Him</strong> (not = ἔδει , used of the eternal purpose of God ( Luk 24:26 ): but implying a moral necessity in the carrying out of His mediatorial work. Compare ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:3">Hebrews 5:3</span> , and especially ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span> , ὀφείλοντες εἶναι διδάσκαλοι διὰ τὸν χρόνον ) <strong> in all things</strong> (i. e. all things wherewith the present argument is concerned: all things which constitute real humanity, and introduce to its sufferings and temptations and sympathies. The exception, χωρις ἁμαρτίας , brought out in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span> , is not in view here. τί ἐστι κατὰ πάντα ; ἐτεχθη φησίν , ἐτράφη , ηὐξήθη , ἔπαθε πὰντα ἅπερ ἔχρην , τέλος ἀπέθανε . Chrys.) <strong> to be like</strong> (not, ‘made like:’ see reff., and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:8">Matthew 6:8</span> ; Mat 7:26 al. The aor. expresses that this resemblance was brought about by a definite act, other than His former state: an important distinction, which however we must rather lose in the English than introduce an irrelevant idea by the word ‘made’) <strong> to his brethren</strong> (the children of Israel, as above: but obviously also, his brethren in the flesh all mankind), <strong> that He might become</strong> ( <strong> γένηται</strong> , not simply ᾖ , because the High Priesthood of Christ in all its fulness, and especially in its work of mercy and compassion and succour, was not inaugurated, till He entered into the heavenly place: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:9">Hebrews 5:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:19-20">Hebrews 6:19-20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26">Hebrews 7:26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1">Hebrews 8:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:4">Hebrews 8:4</span> . His being in all things like his brethren, sufferings and death included, was <em> necessary</em> for Him, in order to his becoming, through those sufferings and death, our High Priest. It was not the death (though that was of previous necessity, and therefore is often spoken of as involving the whole), but the bringing the blood into the holy place, in which the work of sacerdotal expiation consisted: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+4:13-20">Leviticus 4:13-20</span> , and passim: and below, on εἰς τὸ ἱλάσκ . κ . τ . λ .) <strong> a merciful</strong> (Luther, Grot., Böhme, Bleek, De W., Tholuck, take <strong> ἐλεήμων</strong> (formed as τλήμων , αἰδήμων , νοήμων ) alone, and not as an epithet to ἀρχιερεύς , and Bl. maintains that grammar requires such a rendering, on account of the order of the words and the interposition of the verb γένηται . On the other hand, Bengel, Cramer, Storr, Ebrard, Hofmann, Delitzsch, take ἐλεήμων with ἀρχ ., and Ebrard asserts that, had it been otherwise, πιστός would have followed ἀρχιερεύς . There does not seem to me to be much weight in either argument: and the words might be rendered either way, were it not for the scope and object of our epistle, which is rather to bring out the facts and accessories of Christ’s High Priesthood, and all His attributes as subordinate to it, than to place them, abstractedly, by the side of it, as would be the case if ἐλεήμων were to be taken independently here. Cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26">Hebrews 7:26</span> , where many attributes of the Lord’s High Priesthood are accumulated. And especially here, where the first mention of ἀρχιερεύς occurs, would it be unnatural to find a mere attribute contemplated abstractedly and made co-ordinate with the office on which the Writer has so much to say hereafter. I therefore adopt the latter view, joining ἐλεήμων with ἀρχιερεύς . Bengel, with his usual fine tact, accounts for the inversion of the words thus: “De tribus momentis unum, ἐλεήμων , <em> misericors</em> , ante γένηται , <em> fieret</em> , ponitur, quia ex ante dictis deducitur. Reliqua duo commode innectuntur, quia cum primo illo postmodum tractanda veniunt.” Calvin has a beautiful note here: “In sacerdote, cujus partes sunt iram Dei placare, opitulari miseris, erigere lapsos, sublevare laborantes, misericordia inprimis requiritur, quam in nobis generat communis sensus. Rarum enim est ut tangantur aliorum ærumnis qui perpetuo beati fuerunt. Certe hoc Virgilianum ex quotidiana hominum consuetudine sumptum est: ‘Non ignara mali miseris succurrere disco.’ Non quod experimentis necesse habuerit Filius Dei formari ad misericordiæ affectum, sed quia non aliter persuaderi nobis posset, ipsum esse clementem et propensum ad nos juvandos, nisi exercitatus fuisset in nostris miseriis; hoc enim ut alia nobis datum est. Itaque quoties nos urgent quævis malorum genera, mox succurrat nihil nobis accidere quod non in se expertus sit Filius Dei ut nobis condolescat: nec dubitemus ipsum nobis perinde adesse ac si nobiscum angeretur”) <strong> and faithful</strong> (true to His office, not only (Delitzsch) as regards God (ch. Heb 3:5-6 ), but as regards men also; to be trusted without fail: see ref., and cf. μαντεῖα πιστά , Soph. Trach. 77: also Philo, Quis Rer. Div. Hæres, § 18, vol. i. p. 486, ἀπιστῆσαι γενέσει τῇ πάντα ἐξ ἑαυτῆς ἀπίστῳ , μόνῳ δὲ πιστεῦσαι θεῷ τῷ καὶ πρὸς ἀλήθειαν μόνῳ πιστῷ , μεγάλης κ . ὀλυμπίου διανοίας ἔργον ἐστίν : and De Sacr. Abel et Cain, § 28, vol. i. p. 181, τοῦ … πιστευθῆναι χάριν ἀπιστούμενοι καταφεύγομεν ἐφ ʼ ὅρκον ἄνθρωποι · ὁ δὲ θεὸς καὶ λέγων πιστός ἐστιν ) <strong> High Priest</strong> (this is the first mention of the sacerdotal office of Christ, of which so much is afterwards said in the Epistle, and which recurs again so soon, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span> ; see note on <strong> γένηται</strong> above, and that on <strong> εἰς τὸ ἱλάσκ</strong> <strong> .</strong> below) <strong> in matters relating to God</strong> (so in reff., and in many other examples in Bleek, Elsner, and Kypke: e. g. Xen. Rep. Lac. xiii. 11, βασιλεῖ οὐδὲν ἄλλο ἔργον καταλείπεται … ἢ ἱερεῖ μὲν τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς εἶναι , στρατηγῷ δὲ τὰ πρὸς τοὺς ἀνθρώπους : Soph. Philoct. 1441, εὐσεβεῖν τὰ πρὸς θεούς : &amp;c. The words must not be referred to πιστός , but to ἀρχιερεύς , as in the example from Xenophon; or rather to the whole idea, ἐλεήμων καὶ πιστὸς ἀρχιερεύς ), <strong> to expiate the sins</strong> (from ἵλαος , propitious, comes ἱλάσκεσθαι , properly used passively of the person to be rendered propitious, see ref. Luke , 2 (4) <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:18">2 Kings 5:18</span> . The expression here and in ref. Ps. is not a strict one: but is thus to be accounted for: God ἱλάσκεται (pass.), is rendered propitious to the sinner, who has forfeited His favour and incurred His wrath. But (see Delitzsch’s long and able note here) we never find in Scripture, O. T. or N. T., any such expression as ἱλάσθη ὁ πατὴρ περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν διὰ τὸν θάνατον τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ , or as χριστὸς ἱλάσατο (or ἐξιλάσατο ) τὸν θεὸν (or τὴν ὀργὴν τοῦ θεοῦ ) διὰ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτοῦ : never κατηλλάγη (or ἀποκατηλλάγη ) ὁ θεός . “As the O. T. no where says, that sacrifice propitiated God’s wrath, lest it should be thought that sacrifice was an act, by which, as such, man influenced God to shew him grace, so also the N. T. never says that the sacrifice of Christ propitiated God’s wrath, lest it may be thought that it was an act anticipatory of God’s gracious purpose, which obtained, and so to speak, forced from God previously reluctant, without His own concurrence, grace instead of wrath.” Del. To understand this rightly, is all-important to any right holding of the doctrine of the Atonement. This then is not said: but the sinner is (improperly, as far as the use of the word is concerned) said on his part, ἱλάσκεσθαι , to be brought into God’s favour; and if the sinner, then that on account of which he is a sinner, viz. his sin. The word here is middle, used of Him who, by His <em> propitiation</em> , brings the sinner into God’s favour, = makes propitiation for, expiates, the sin. The Death of Christ being the necessary opening and condition of this propitiation, the propitiation being once for all consummated by the sacrifice of His death, and all sin by that sacrifice expiated, we must of necessity determine (against the Socinian view of Christ’s High Priesthood, which will again and again come before us in this commentary) that His High Priesthood was, strictly speaking, begun, as its one chief work in substance was accomplished, here below, during his time of suffering. That it is still continued in heaven, and indeed finds its highest and noblest employ there, is no reason against this view. The high priest had accomplished his sacrifice, before he went within the veil to sprinkle the blood: though it was that sprinkling of the blood (see on γένηται above) by which the atonement was actually made, as it is by the Spirit’s application of Christ’s atoning blood to the heart of each individual sinner that he is brought into reconciliation with God) <strong> of the people</strong> (again, the Jewish people, cf. ref. Matt. διὰ τί δὲ οὐκ εἰπε , τὰς ἁμαρτίας τῆς οἰκουμένης , ἀλλά , τοῦ λαοῦ ; ὅτι τέως περὶ τῶν Ἰονδαίων ἦν ὁ λόγος τῷ κυρίῳ , καὶ διὰ τούτους ἦλθε προηγουμένως , ἵνα τούτων σωθέντων καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι σωθῶσιν , εἰ καὶ τοὐναντίον γέγονε .
