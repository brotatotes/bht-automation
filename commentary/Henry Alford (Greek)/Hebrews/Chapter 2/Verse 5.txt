<p><strong> 5</strong> .] The proposition stated. <strong> For</strong> (the connexion is with the sentence immediately preceding, i. e. with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2-4">Hebrews 2:2-4</span> . That former λόγος was spoken by angels: it carried its punishment for neglect of it: much more shall this σωτηρία , spoken by … &amp;c., confirmed by … &amp;c. FOR this whole state of things, induced by the proclamation of that salvation, is not subjected to angels, but to Christ, the Son of God. Then the fact that it is to MAN, and to Him AS MAN, that it is subjected, is brought in, and a new subject thus grafted on the old one of His superiority to the angels. See Bleek and Ebrard) <strong> not to angels</strong> ( ἀγγέλοις stands in the place of emphasis, as contrasted with ἄνθρωπος below) <strong> did He subject</strong> (aor.: at the date of His arrangement and laying out of the same. The subjection of this present natural world to the holy angels, as its administrators, is in several places attested in Scripture, and was a very general matter of belief among the Jews. In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+32:8">Deuteronomy 32:8</span> , we read in the LXX, ὅτε διεμέριζεν ὁ ὕψιστος ἔθνη , ὡς διέσπειρεν υἱοὺς Ἀδάμ , ἔστησεν ὅρια ἐθνῶν κατὰ ἀριθμὸν ἀγγέλων θεοῦ . There, it is true, the Heb. text has, as E. V., “according to the number of the children (more properly, <em> the sons</em> , in the stricter sense) of Israel.” Origen, on Numbers, Hom. xxviii. 4, vol. ii. p. 385, says, “Secundum numerum angelorum ejus, vel ut in aliis exemplaribus legimus, secundum numerum filiorum Israel:” but perhaps, as Bleek suggests, it was not Origen that was pointing to a various reading in the Heb. text, but only his translator that was noticing that the Latin versions differed from the LXX. But the doctrine rests on passages about which there can be no such doubt. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+10:13">Daniel 10:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+10:20-21">Daniel 10:20-21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1">Daniel 12:1</span> , for this committal of kingdoms to the superintendence of angels: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+9:11">Revelation 9:11</span> ; Rev 16:5 al., for the same as regards the natural elements: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:10">Matthew 18:10</span> , as regards the guardianship of individuals: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span> &amp;c., for that of churches (for so, and not of chief bishops, is the name to be understood: see note there). See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+4:13">Daniel 4:13</span> . In the apocryphal and Rabbinical writings we find the same idea asserted, and indeed carried out into minute details. So in Sir 17:17 , ἑκάστῳ ἔθνει κατέστησεν ἡγούμενον , κ . μερὶς κυρίου Ἰσραήλ ἐστιν . The Rabbinical authorities may be found in Bleek and Eisenmenger. See also a very elaborate article “Engel” by Böhme in Herzog’s Encyclopädie: and testimonies to the view of the early church from Eusebius (Demonstr. Evang. iv. 2, vol. iv. p. 146), Justin Martyr (Apol. ii. 5, p. 92), Irenæus (iii. 12. 11, p. 197), Athenagoras (Legat. 24, p. 302), and Clement of Alexandria (Strom. vii. 2, p. 831 P) in Whitby’s note. The idea then of subjection of the world to angels was one with which the readers of this Epistle were familiar) <strong> the world to come</strong> (the reference of this expression has been variously given by expositors. 1. Many imagine it to refer to the world which is, strictly speaking, <em> to come</em> , as distinguished from this present world. So Thdrt. ( οἰκουμ . μέλλ . τὸν μέλλοντα βίον ἐκάλεσεν ), Œc. ( μέλλ . οἰκ . φησὶ τὸν ἐσόμενον κόσμον , περὶ οὗ φησὶν ὁ ἅπας λόγος ἡμῖν · αὐτὸς γὰρ κριτὴς ὁ χριστὸς ἐκείνης καθεδεῖται οἰκουμένης , οἱ δὲ ἄγγελοιώς λειτουργοὶ κ . δοῦλοι παρίστανται ), Cajetan, Estius, a-Lapide, al. This meaning, as Bl. remarks, will hardly tally with the <strong> γάρ</strong> , nor with <strong> περὶ ἧς λαλοῦμεν</strong> : though it might be said that the future life, being the <em> completion</em> of the state of salvation by Christ, might very well here be spoken of as the subject of the present discourse. 2. Some have supposed a direct allusion to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6">Hebrews 1:6</span> . So Thl. ( περὶ ἧς λαλοῦμεν , τουτέστι περὶ ἧς ἀνωτέρω εἴπομεν ὅτι ὅταν εἰσαγάγῃ τὸν πρωτότοκον εἰς τὴν οἰκουμένην ), Schlichting, Grot. (“ λαλοῦμεν , id est ἐλαλήσαμεν … Respicitur enim id quod præcessit Heb 1:6 ”), Böhme, al. But certainly in this case the verb would have been past; and besides, the addition of the epithet μέλλουσαν sufficiently distinguishes it from the mere οἰκουμένη , the inhabited world, in the other place. 3. Others again have thought of the heaven, which is to us future, because we are not yet admitted to its joys. So Cameron (“Mundus ecclesiæ desertum est, οἰκουμένη ecclesiæ est in cœlo, sicut Israelitarum in terra Canaan”), Calov., Limborch, Grot. (“In regione illa superætherea sunt quidem angeli, sed non illi imperant ut Christus. Vocat hanc οἰκ . μέλλ ., non quia jam non exstat; sed quia nobis ea non plene nota est, nec adhuc contigit”), al. But this again would not agree with the γάρ and λαλοῦμεν . 4. The most probable account to be given is that the phrase represents the Heb. הָעוֹלָם הַבָּא (see note on ch. Heb 1:1 ), and imports the whole new order of things brought in by Christ, taking its rise in His life on earth, and having its completion in his reign in glory. So Calvin (“Nunc apparet non vocari orbem futurum duntaxat qualem e resurrectione speramus, sed qui cœpit ab exordio regni Christi: complementum vero suum habebit in ultima redemptione”), Beza, Cappellus (adding a remark, “Sed nec contemnendum discrimen illud quod videmus inter veteris et novi testamenti sæcula, sub vetere Abraham, Josue, Daniel coram angelis procumbentes non reprehenduntur: sub novo Johannes idem bis faciens bis reprehenditur, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+19:0">Revelation 19:0</span> et 22”). Chrys. and Thl. are commonly quoted for this view even by Bleek: but if I understand Chrys., he means, as Thl. certainly does, that the οἰκουμένη here is identical with that in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6">Hebrews 1:6</span> , and that the Writer calls it μέλλουσαν , because at the time of the divine decree here spoken of, it was not yet created: μέλλουσαν δὲ αὐτὴν φησί , διότι ὁ μὲν υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ ἧν ἀεί , αὕτη δὲ ἔμελλε γίνεσθαι , μὴ οὖσα πρότερον δηλαδή . ὅσον οὖν πρὸς τὴν ἀΐδιον ὕπαρξιν τοῦ υἱοῦ , μέλλουσα ἦν ἡ οἰκουμένη . And nearly so Chrys., but not so plainly.
	</p>
<p>This last-mentioned view is by far the best, agreeing as it does with the connexion, for he has been speaking of the gospel above, with the usus loquendi, with the whole subject of the Epistle.
	</p>
<p>The word μέλλουσαν has by some been supposed to be used “ex prospectu veteris Test prophetico in Novum Test.,” as Bengel, who again says, “ <em> Futurus</em> dicitur, non quin jam sit, sed quia olim prædictus.” And so Bleek (as an additional reason why the word was used, besides that the completion of the state is yet to come), al. I should be disposed, standing as the expression does here without emphasis, to regard μέλλουσαν rather as a well-known and well-understood designation of the latter dispensation, here technically adjoined, than as requiring minute explanation in this place. <em> All</em> reference to the future need not be excluded: we Christians are so eminently “prisoners of hope,” that the very mention of such a designation would naturally awaken a thought of the glories to come: but this reference must not be pressed as having any prominence. With this latter view agrees in the main that of Delitzsch, which I have seen since this note was first written. He concurs with Hofmann, Weissag. u. Erf. ii. 23, in requiring a more concrete sense for the words, and understands them to point to the new world of Redemption, as distinguished from the old world of Creation, which by reason of sin is subject to death and decay. So that μέλλουσα is not used from the O. T. standing-point, but from the N. T. also, and points to the times of the Messiah in their ideal perfection which shall one day be realized), <strong> of which we are speaking</strong> (which forms the subject of our present argument: viz. that urged in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:1-4">Hebrews 2:1-4</span> . The sense is strictly <em> present</em> ; not past (see Grot. above), nor future (“enallage temporis; de quo in sequenti testimonio loquemur,” as Vatablus). Bleek has here some excellent remarks: “As regards the whole thought, the non-subjection of the new order of the world to angels, it respects partly what is already present, partly what we have yet to wait for. Certainly, here and there in the N. T. history angels are mentioned: but they come in only as transitory appearances, to announce or to execute some matter which is specially entrusted to them: they never appear as essential agents in the introduction of the kingdom of God, either in general, or in particular: they do not descend on earth as preaching repentance, or preparing men to be received into God’s kingdom. This is done by <em> men</em> , first and chiefly by Him who is Son of Man κατ ʼ ἐξοχήν , and after Him by the disciples whom He prepared for the work. Even the miraculous conversion of Paul is brought about not by angels, but by the appearing of the Lord Himself. Our author has indeed in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span> , designated the angels as fellow-workers in the salvation of men: but only in a serving capacity, never as working or imparting salvation by independent agency, as does the Son of Man in the first place, and then in a certain degree his disciples also. So that we cannot speak with any truth of a subjection of this new order of things to the angels. Rather, even by what we see at present, does it appear to be subjected to the Redeemer Himself. And this will ever more and more be the case; for, according to the prophetic declaration of the Psalm, the whole world shall be put under His feet ( Heb 2:8 ). Thus, by reminding them of the will of God declared in the holy Scriptures, does the Writer meet at the same time the objections of those of his readers and countrymen, to whom perhaps this withdrawal of the agency of the angels with the introduction and growing realization of the new order of things might appear an important defect”).</p>
