<p><strong> 13</strong> .] <strong> and there is not a creature</strong> (for the concrete <strong> κτίσμα</strong> , as so often, see reff. The term embraces all created things, visible and invisible, cf. Col 1:16 ) <strong> unseen</strong> (a classical word: see Palm. and Rost’s references) <strong> in his presence</strong> (first as to the gen. pron. <strong> αὐτοῦ</strong> : to what does it refer? to ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ , or to τοῦ θεοῦ itself? The idea of its referring to <em> Christ</em> falls with the untenableness of the personal meaning of λόγος : although Calov., Schöttgen, al., abandoning that, yet hold it. Then of the two other, it seems much the more obvious to refer it to τοῦ θεοῦ , especially in the presence of τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ , and πρὸς ὃν ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος below. Nor is there any harshness in this; from speaking of the uttered word of God, whose powers are not its own but His, the transition to Himself, with Whom that word is so nearly identified, is simple and obvious. The expression <strong> ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ</strong> , common in the N. T. and especially in St. Luke, is apparently Alexandrine, and borrowed from the LXX, where it answers to the Heb. לִפְנֵי ): <strong> but</strong> ( <strong> δέ</strong> , in the strongly adversative sense which it several times has in our Epistle: cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:6">Hebrews 2:6</span> , and note there, also Heb 4:15 below; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:27">Hebrews 10:27</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:13">Hebrews 12:13</span> . This it gains by its force of passing altogether to a new subject, excluding entirely from view that which is last treated: q. d. “tantum absit, ut.… ut.…”) <strong> all things are naked</strong> (it had been said by Böhme, that this metaphorical meaning of <strong> γυμνός</strong> was unknown to the Greeks: but see Herod. viii. 19, ταῦτα μὲν εἰς τοσοῦτο παρεγύμνου : also i. 126; ix. 44: and γυμνῶν τῶν πραγμάτων θεωρουμένων , Diod. Sic. i. p. 69. The herald in the Areopagus forbade the witnesses ληρεῖν πρὸς τὴν βουλὴν καὶ περιπέττειν τὸ πρᾶγμα ἐν τοῖς λόγοις , ὡς γυμνὰ τὰ γεγενημένα οἱ Ἀρεοπαγῖται βλέποιεν , Lucian, Gymnas. p. 401. And Marc. Antonin. xii. 2, says, in language very similar to this, ὁ θεὸς πάντα τὰ ἡγεμονικὰ γυμνὰ τῶν ὑλικῶν αγγείων καὶ φλοίων καὶ καθαρμάτων ὁρᾷ ) <strong> and prostrate</strong> (see at the end of this note: <em> resupinata, manifesta</em> ; πεφανερωμένα , Hesych. The various meanings given to this difficult word <strong> τραχηλίζειν</strong> , form a curious chapter in the history of exegesis. Its first and most common classical acceptation seems to be, to <em> take by the throat</em> , as an adversary in a struggle, or an athlete in wrestling might do, for the purpose of overthrowing. So (to give merely one example among many which will be found in Wetstein, and better arranged in Bleek) ὁρᾶτε τὸν ἀθλητὴν ὑπὸ παιδισκαρίου τραχηλιζόμενον , Plut. de Curiositate, p. 521 b. And thus some have interpreted it here: “ <em> laid open</em> ,” as an athlete, caught by the neck and overthrown, lies for all to see. But as Bl. remarks, this last particular, which does in fact carry the whole weight of the comparison, comes in far too accidentally and subordinately. Another meaning has been proposed by Perizonius (on Ælian, Var. Hist. xii. 58) derived from the practice of stripping and bending back the necks of malefactors, that all might see their faces and shame, so producing the very opposite of the privacy which a man seeks when ashamed, by bowing down his head and covering his face. Thus Sueton. Vitel. 17: “(Vitellius) relegatis post terga manibus, injecto cervicibus laqueo, veste discissa, seminudus in forum tractus est reducto coma capite ceu noxii solent, atque etiam mento mucrone gladii subrecto, ut visendam præberet faciem, neve submitteret.” And Pliny, Panegyr. 34. 3: “Nihil tamen gratius, nihil sæculo dignius, quam quod contigit desuper intueri delatorum supina ora retortasque cervices, agnoscebamus et fruebamur, quum velut piaculares publicæ sollicitudinis victimæ supra sanguinem noxiorum ad lenta supplicia gravioresque pœnas ducerentur.” And this is the interpretation followed by Elsner, Wolf, Baumgarten, Kuinoel, Bretschneider, Bleek, De Wette, al. But here again, though the <em> meaning</em> is apposite enough, we have no precedent for the Greek word being thus used, or for any such custom being familiar to Greeks. So that this interpretation can hardly be the true one. The ancients give very various renderings. Chrys. says: τετραχηλισμένα εἶπεν ἀπὸ μεταφορᾶς τῶν δερμάτων τῶν ἀπὸ τῶν σφαζομένων ἱερείων ἐξελκομένων : but does not justify such an application of the word. Œc.: τετραχηλισμένα δὲ φησὶ τὰ γυμνά , ἀπὸ μεταφορᾶς τῶν προβάτων τῶν ἐκ τοῦ τραχήλου ἠρτημένων κ . γεγυμνωμένων τῆς δορᾶς · ἢ … ἀντὶ τοῦ κάτω κύπτοντα κ . τὸν τράχηλον ἐπικλίνοντα , διὰ τὸ μὴ ἰσχύειν ἀτενίσαι τῇ δόξῃ ἐκείνῃ τοῦ κριτοῦ καὶ θεοῦ ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ . Thdrt.: ἐκ μεταφορᾶς τέθεικε τῶν θυομένων ζώων , ἃ παντελῶς ἄφωνα κεῖται , τῆς σφαγῆς τὴν ζωὴν ἀφελομένης , καὶ μετὰ τῆς ζωῆς τὴν φωνήν . οὕτω , φησί , καὶ ἡμεῖς κρινόμενοι θεώμεθα μὲν ἅπαντα τὰ δυσσεβῶς παρ ʼ ἡμῶν ἢ παρανόμως γεγενημένα · σιγῶντες δὲ τὴν τῆς τιμωρίας δεχόμεθα ψῆφον , ἅτε δὴ τὸ δίκαιον αὐτῆς ἐπιστάμενοι . Thl.: ἀπὸ μεταφορᾶς τῶν ἐκδερομένων προβάτων . ὥσπερ γὰρ ἐκείνων τραχηλισθέντων , ἤτοι κατὰ τοῦ τραχήλου τὴν μάχαιραν δεξαμένων καὶ σφαγέντων , μετὰ τὸ καθελκυσθῆναι τὸ δέρμα πάντα καὶ τὰ ἔνδον ἐκκαλύπτεται · οὕτω καὶ τῷ θεῷ πάντα δῆλα . τινὲς δέ , τετραχηλισμένα , τὰ ἐκ τοῦ τραχήλου , ἢ μᾶλλον κατὰ τοῦ τραχήλου κρεμάμενα ἐνόησαν . He then mentions the second alternative of Œc. above, and ends, σὺ δὲ τὸ πρῶτον δέξαι . I have given all these to shew how various have been the renderings, and how universally acknowledged the difficulty of the word. The objection to the <em> sacrificial</em> rendering is, that the word never seems to have been used of any such process: see all the meanings given in Palm and Rost sub voce. In seeking for a way out of the difficulty, it seems to me that the frequent use of the word by Philo, ought, in a passage cast so much, as we have seen, in Philo’s mode of rhetorical expression, to enter as a considerable element into our decision. Wetst. gives us twenty passages in which the word and its compound ἐκτραχηλίζω occur in that writer: and the uniform meaning is, to <em> lay prostrate</em> , generally in a metaphorical sense: e. g. De Cherub. § 24, vol. i. p. 153, μηδ ʼ ὅσον ἀνακύψαι δυνάμενος , ἀλλὰ πᾶσι τοῖς ἐπιτρέχουσι καὶ τραχηλίζουσι δεινοῖς ὑποβεβλημένος : De Vita Mos. i. 54, vol. ii. p. 127, τραχηλιζόμενοι δὲ ταῖς ἐπιθυμίαις πάντ ʼ ὑπομένουσι δρᾶν τε καὶ πάσχειν : Quod Omnis Probus Liber, § 22, p. 470, ὑφ ʼ ἡδονῆς δελεάζεται , ἢ φόβῳ ἐκλύει , ἢ λύπῃ συστέλλεται , ἢ ὑπ ʼ ἀπορίας τραχηλίζεται . And as we have seen in the beginning of this note, this is the simplest and most frequent sense in the classical writers. See also very numerous examples in Wetstein. I would therefore accept this metaphorical sense here, and regard the word as signifying entire prostration and subjugation under the eye of God: not only naked, stripped of all covering and concealment, but also laid prostrate in their exposure, before His eye. I own myself not thoroughly satisfied with this, but I am unable to find a better rendering which shall at the same time be philologically justified) <strong> to His eyes</strong> (dat. commodi: for His eyes to see); <strong> with Whom we have to do</strong> (there could not be a happier rendering than this of the E. V., expressing our whole concern and relation with God, One who is not to be trifled with, considering that His word is so powerful, and His eye so discerning. And so Calv., Beza, Bengel, Kuin., Bleek, De W., Lünem., Ebrard, Delitzsch, al. The ancients, without exception, confined this relation to one solemn particular of it, and rendered, “ <em> to whom our account must be given</em> :” so Chrys.: ἀντὶ τοῦ · αὐτῷ μέλλομεν δοῦναι εὐθύνας τῶν πεπραγμένων . And many of the moderns also take this view: e. g. Erasm. (par.), Michaelis, Bretschneider, Stuart, al. Others suppose it to mean, “concerning whom is our discourse,” referring to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:11">Hebrews 5:11</span> , περὶ οὗ πολὺς ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος . So Luther, a-Lapide, Schlichting, Grot., Wolf, al. But, even conceding that <strong> πρός</strong> may well bear this meaning, which has not been shewn (see Bleek, p. 591 note), the meaning itself is far too vapid here, and finds no fit representation in the Epistle itself, which cannot be said to be, in any such sense, πρὸς θεόν or περὶ θεοῦ .
	</p>
<p>As regards the punctuation, and emphasis, it seems better to make πρὸς ὃν ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος an independent clause and to set a colon at αὐτοῦ , than as commonly done, to join αὐτοῦ , πρὸς ὅν . For by so doing, we weaken very much the force of the sentence, in which, after the predicative clause, the stress is on ἡμῖν : and besides, we violate the strict propriety of αὐτοῦ , making it = ἐκείνου ).</p>
