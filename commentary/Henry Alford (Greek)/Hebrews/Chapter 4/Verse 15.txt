<p><strong> 15</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (how connected? certainly not as grounding the facts just stated; but as furnishing a motive for κρατεῖν τῆς ὁμολογίας . The effort is not hopeless, notwithstanding the majesty of our High Priest, and the power of the Word of our God: <em> for</em> we are sympathized with and helped by Him. As Schlichting, “Occupat objectionem. Poterat enim aliquis dicere: quid me magnus iste Pontifex dura confessionis nostræ causa patientem juvabit, qui quanto major est, quanto a nobis remotior, tanto minore fortassis nostri cura tangetur?” To suppose, as some have done, that a contrast to the Jewish high priests is intended, is to contradict directly ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:2">Hebrews 5:2</span> . Rather is our great High Priest in this respect expressly identified with them) <strong> we have not a high priest unable</strong> (thus better than “who is not able,” τὸν μὴ δυνάμενον ) <strong> to sympathize with</strong> (“The verb <strong> συμπαθέω</strong> , immediately from συμπαθής , as by the same analogy ἀντιπαθέω , δυσπαθέω , εὐπαθέω , ἡδυπαθέω , μετριοπαθέω , ὁμοιοπαθέω , is like all these derivative forms, good Greek. Stephanus states it is to be found in Isocrates: ὥστε καὶ ταῖς μικραῖς ἀτυχίαις ἕκαστος ἡμῶν πολλοὺς εἶχε συμπαθήσοντας . Philo de Septenar. § 13, vol. ii. p. 290: τῷ δὲ ἀπόρως ἔχοντι συνεπάθησε καὶ μετέδωκεν ἐλέους κ . τ . λ . In St. Paul, we have συμπάσχειν (reff.) which our Epistle has not, but in a somewhat different meaning, that of actual community in suffering with another, whereas our word is spoken of one <em> sympathizing</em> , taking part in heart with the sufferings of another. Erasmus (annot.): ‘Est affici moverique sensu alieni mali.’ συμπάσχειν might indeed be used in this sense, but hardly συμπαθεῖν in the other.” Bleek) <strong> our infirmities</strong> (not <em> sufferings</em> , as Chrys., Thdrt., al. For the idea would be here out of place, and the word cannot have this meaning. Bleek has well examined its region of significance; and shewn that it can only betoken primarily the inner and a priori weakness, be that <em> physical</em> , and thereby leading to exposure to suffering and disease, which itself is sometimes called by this name (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:4">John 11:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:15">Luke 5:15</span> ; Luk 8:2 al.: ch. Heb 11:34 ), or <em> spiritual</em> and moral, whereby misery arises, and sin finds entrance, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:2">Hebrews 5:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:8">Hebrews 7:8</span> . Both these, indeed <em> all</em> human infirmities, are here included. With all does the Son of God sympathize, and for the reason now to be given), <strong> nay rather</strong> (on <strong> δέ</strong> being a stronger adversative than ἀλλά , see on Heb 4:13 above), ( <strong> one</strong> ) <strong> tempted</strong> (Ebrard has a good note on the subject of our Lord’s temptations) <strong> in all things</strong> (see on ch. Heb 2:17 ) <strong> according to (our) similitude</strong> ( <strong> ἡμῶν</strong> is the natural word to supply. So in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:15">Hebrews 7:15</span> , κατὰ τὴν ὁμοιότητα Μελχισεδέκ . It might be πρὸς ἡμᾶς : so Aristot. de Mundo (Bl.), κατὰ τὴν πρὸς ταῦτα ὁμοιότητα : Philo de Profugis, § 9, vol. i. p. 553, κατὰ τὴν πρὸς ἄλλα ὁμοιότητα , see ref. Gen. St. Paul uses ὁμοίωμα , not ὁμοιότης : cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:23">Romans 1:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:14">Romans 5:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:5">Romans 6:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span> ; Php 2:7 ) <strong> apart from sin</strong> (so that throughout these temptations, in their origin, in their process, in their result, sin had nothing in Him: He was free and separate from it. This general reference is the only one which fully gives the general predication, χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας . And so it has been usually taken. But there are considerable divergences. Œc.: ὅτι οὐχ ἁμαρτιῶν ἐτίννυε δίκην ταῦτα , φησί , πάσχων . So Thl. altern.: Schlichting, “Ut ostendat, Christum innoxium prorsus fuisse, nec ullo modo hæc mala quæ passus est commeritum:” al. But this would require πεπειρασμένον to be confined in its meaning to such sufferings as might be inflicted on account of sin: and would altogether deprive it of the meaning ‘ <em> tempted</em> ,’ ‘solicited towards, but short of sin.’ Again, very many Commentators take the words to imply, that He was tempted in all other points, but not in sin: “ <em> sin only excepted</em> .” So Jac. Cappellus, Storr, Ernesti, Heinrichs, Kuinoel, Schleusner, Wahl, and Bretschneider, and al. But the words certainly do not lead to any such interpretation. They would rather in this case be, εἰ μὴ καθ ʼ ἁμαρτίαν , or χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας would stand before καθ ʼ ὁμοιότητα . The Commentators refer to passages of Philo in which he states the High Priesthood and the sinlessness of the λόγος in a manner very similar: e. g. De Profugis, § 20, p. 562: λέγομεν γάρ , τὸν ἀρχιερέα οὐκ ἄνθρωπον ἀλλὰ λόγον θεῖον εἶναι , πάντων οὐχ ἑκουσίων μόνον ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀκουσίων ἀδικημάτων ἀμέτοχον ).</p>
