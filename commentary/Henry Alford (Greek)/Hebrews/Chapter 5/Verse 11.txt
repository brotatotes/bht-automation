<p><strong> 11</strong> .] <strong> Concerning whom</strong> (i. e. <em> Melchisedek</em> , as Syr. (which expresses Melchisedek after the relative), Calv., a-Lap., al., Bleek, De W., Tholuck, al.: not as Œc., Prim., al., and Lünem., <em> Christ</em> , of whom such an expression as this would hardly here be used, seeing that the whole Epistle hitherto has been concerning Him: nor is οὗ neuter, as Schlichting, Grot., Storr, Kuinoel, al.: and more recently, Delitzsch ( περὶ τοῦ εἶναι χριστὸν ἀρχ . κατὰ τ . ταξ . Μ .): for the Writer <em> returns to Melchisedek</em> , ch. Heb 7:1 ) <strong> our discourse</strong> (that which we have to say. The plural pronoun, not with any definite reference to Timothy or other companions of the Writer, nor intended to include the readers, which is here impossible: but as in some other places of the Epistle, see reff., merely indicating the Writer himself, as so frequently in the Epistles of St. Paul) <strong> is</strong> (not, as Erasm., Luther, a-Lap., al., “ <em> would be</em> :” for we may safely say that in that case εἴη or ἂν εἴη would be supplied, as in the passage of Lysias cited below, and Dion. Hal. i. 23, περὶ ὧν πολὺς ἂν εἴη λόγος , εἰ βουλοίμην τὴν ἀκρίβειαν γράφειν ) <strong> much, and difficult of interpretation to speak</strong> (the connexion of <strong> δυσερμήνευτος</strong> with λέγειν is somewhat dubious. Who is the ἑρμηνευτής ? the <em> Writer</em> , so that it should be difficult <em> for him</em> to explain what he has to say to his readers, or the <em> readers</em> , so that it should be difficult <em> for them</em> to understand it for themselves? This latter alternative is taken by Grot. (“quem si eloquerer, ægre intelligeretis”), Jac. Cappel., Peirce, Valcknaer, al. But surely this would be inadmissible as matter of construction, and would require ἐν τῷ λέγειν or ἐν τῷ λέγεσθαι . And in consequence, some who take this view connect λέγειν with λόγος , πολ . ἡμ . ὁ λ . κ . δυσερμ . λέγειν , referring, as Wetst., to Lysias adv. Pancleon. p. 167. 25, ὅσα μὲν οὖν αὐτόθι ἐῤῥήθη , πολὺς ἂν εἴη μοι λόγος διηγεῖσθαι . But, as Bleek has noticed, there is this difference between the passages: that in ours, the adjectives are almost necessarily predicates, whereas in Lysias they are epithets: and, in consequence, here the verb must depend on δυσερμήνευτος . We are driven then to the other alternative, of making the <em> Writer</em> the subject to be supplied: so Chrys. ( ὅταν γάρ τις πρὸς ἀνθρώπους ἔχῃ μὴ παρακολου · θοῦντας , μηδὲ τὰ λεγόμενα νοοῦντας , ἑρμηνεῦσαι καλῶς αὐτοῖς οὐ δύναται ), and Thl. ( διὰ τὴν ὑμετέραν οὖν νωθρείαν , φησί , δυσερμήνευτός ἐστιν ὁ λόγος ὁ περὶ τοῦ πῶς ἐστιν ὁ χριστὸς ἀρχιερεὺς κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισεδέκ , καὶ διότι οὐ συνίετε ὑμεῖς , διὰ τοῦτο ἐγὼ καλῶς ἑρμηνεῦσαι οὐ δύναμαι ), Erasm. (“sed omnia perdifficile fuerit enarrare vobis, eo quod” &amp;c.), Schlichting (“sermo difficilis ad eloquendum sic ut facile ab audientibus percipi et intelligi queat”), al.: Bleek, De W., Lünem., al. Then the infin. follows, as ὅπως ἂν ὦσιν ( οἱ λόγοι ) ὡς πιθανώτατοι λέγειν , Plato, Gorg. p. 479 G σῆμα ταυρόπουν ὁρᾶν , Eur. Iph. Aul. 275: Γαλάτεια … λευκοτέρα πακτᾶς ποτιδεῖν , Theocr. xi. 20: and as in our phrase ‘beautiful to look upon,’ ‘hard to work upon,’ &amp;c. Bleek (after Storr) and Lünemann have supposed that a kind of zeugma is necessary to connect λόγος with both predicates, πολύς regarding more the discourse itself and the explanation of the subject given by the Writer, δυσερμήνευτος , the contents of the λόγος , as thus explained. But it does not seem to me that such a supposition is needed: our λόγος , that which we have to say, is both πολύς , abundant in quantity, and δυσερμήνευτος , difficult to state perspicuously to <em> you</em> , in quality. And so also Delitzsch), <strong> since</strong> (probably renders a reason only for the δυσερμήνευτος λέγειν , not belonging also to πολύς ) <strong> ye are become</strong> (not, “ <em> are</em> ,” as E. V., Luther (not De W.), al. Chrys. says well, δηλοῦντος ἦν , ὅτι πάλαι ὑγίαινον καὶ ἦσαν ἰσχυροί , τῇ προθυμίᾳ ζέοντες , καὶ ὕστερον αὐτοὺς τοῦτο παθεῖν μαρτυρεῖ ) <strong> dull</strong> ( <strong> νωθρός</strong> , a lengthened and later form of νωθής . It is found as early as Plato, Theætet. p. 144 B, but more commonly in the later writers, Aristid., Plut., Polyb., al. See Elsn. and Wetst. Bleek thinks the most probable formation of it is from the negative νη and ὠθέω , as νωδός toothless, νώδυνος painless, νώνυμος nameless, νήπιος from ἔπω , = ‘in-fans.’ Thus the two words mean, ‘ <em> difficult to move</em> :’ so ὄνος νωθής , II. β . 559: ὄνων νωθρὸν δέμας , Oppian, Halieut. iii. 140. And so likewise as applied to the soul, Plut. Lycurg. 51 e: νωθρᾶς .… κ . πρὸς ἀρετὴν ἀφιλοτίμου ψυχῆς σημεῖον : and to the senses, Heliodor. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:10">Hebrews 5:10</span> , ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν οὐκ ᾐσθόμην .… τάχα μέν που καὶ δι ʼ ἡλικίαν νωθρότερος ὢν τὴν ἀκοήν · νόσος γὰρ ἄλλων τε καὶ ὤτων τὸ γῆρας . See many more examples in Bleek and Wetst.) <strong> in your hearing</strong> (more usually the accus., as in the last citation: but frequently in the (local or referential) dative, as e. g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:20">1 Corinthians 14:20</span> , μὴ παιδία γίνεσθε ταϊς φρεσίν , ἀλλὰ τῇ κακίᾳ νηπιάζετε . See examples in Winer, edn. 6, § 31. 6. <strong> ἀκοή</strong> is used in good Greek writers of the <em> ear</em> , with however this distinction, that it is of the ear with reference to the act of hearing, not merely as a member of the body. Philo draws the distinction, in ref. It is related to οὖς as ὄψις to ὀφθαλμός : cf. Xen. Mem. i. 4. 11, καὶ ὄψιν κ . ἀκοὴν κ . στόμα ἐνεποίησαν : Herod. i. 38, διεφθαρμένος τὴν ἀκοήν : and other examples in Bleek. The plur. here denotes not only the plurality of persons addressed, but also, as in ref. Mark, the double organ of hearing in each person).</p>
