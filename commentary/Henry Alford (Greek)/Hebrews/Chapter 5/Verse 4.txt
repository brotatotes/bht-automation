<p><strong> 4</strong> .] <strong> And</strong> (couples to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:1">Hebrews 5:1</span> , of which the subsequent verses have been epexegetical) <strong> none taketh</strong> ( <strong> λαμβάνει</strong> , not altogether perhaps without an allusion to λαμβανόμενος above, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:1">Hebrews 5:1</span> . So in Xiphilinus Galb. p. 187, νομίζων οὐκ εἰληφέναι τὴν ἀρχήν , ἀλλὰ δεδόσθαι αὐτῷ ) <strong> the office</strong> (of the high priesthood: so τιμή , Herod. ii. 59, οὔτε τιμὰς τὰς ἐούσας συνταράξας ( Πεισίστρατος ), οὔτε θέσμια μεταλλάξας : see other examples in Bleek. Josephus uses it frequently of the high-priestly office: e. g Antt. iii. 8. 1, αὐτὸς ὁ θεὸς Ἀαρῶνα τῆς τιμῆς ταύτης ἄξιον ἔκρινε ) <strong> to himself</strong> (dat. commodi: and carrying the stress of the sentence, although the construction of λαμβάνει with both clauses must be somewhat zeugmatic: it must have rather a more active sense in the case where he takes it to himself, than in that where he only receives it, being called by God. This is denied by Delitzsch, but I see not how we can altogether escape it. The construction with ἑαυτῷ in the one case necessarily throws a different tinge over the verb than when it is understood with καλούμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ ) <strong> but</strong> ( <strong> only when</strong> ) <strong> called by God</strong> (with the <strong> ὁ</strong> of the rec. text, it would be, ‘ <em> but only he who is called by God</em> ’), <strong> as indeed was Aaron</strong> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:1">Exodus 28:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:4">Exodus 29:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+8:1">Leviticus 8:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+3:10">Numbers 3:10</span> ; but especially Numbers 16-18. Schöttgen quotes from the Rabbinical Bammidbar Rabba, § 18, fol. 234, “Moses ad Corachum ejusque socios dixit: Si Aaron frater meus sibimetipsi sacerdotium sumsit ( נטל לעצמו = λαμβάνειν ἑαυτῷ ) recte egistis, quod contra ipsum insurrexistis: jam vero Deus id ipsi dedit,” &amp;c.

<p>This divine ordinance of Aaron and his sons to be high priests endured long in the Jewish polity: but long before this time the rule had been disturbed: Jos. Antt. xx. 10. 5, relates, τὴν δὲ βασιλείαν Ἡρώδης παρὰ Ῥωμαίων ἐγχειρισθείς , οὐκέτι τοὺς ἐκ τοῦ Ἀσαμωναίου γένους καθίστησιν ἀρχιερεῖς , ἀλλὰ τισὶν ἀσήμοις , καὶ μόνον ἐξ ἱερέων οὖσι , πλὴν ἑνὸς Ἀριστοβούλου , τὴν τιμὴν ἀπένεμε . Some of the early Commentators, e. g. Œc., Thl., Primas., imagine that an allusion to this irregularity is here intended: αἰνίττεται δὲ ἐνταῦθα τοὺς τότε ἀρχιερεῖς τῶν Ἰουδαίων , οἳ ἐπεπήδων τῇ τιμῇ , ὠνητὴν ταύτην κτώμενοι καὶ τὸν νόμον διαφθείροντες , Œc. But, though even Bleek imagines such an allusion may have been in the Writer’s mind, it seems I own to me very improbable).</p>
