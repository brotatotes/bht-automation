<p><strong> 5</strong> .] <strong> Thus Christ also</strong> (as well as those others) <strong> did not glorify</strong> HIMSELF <strong> to be made High Priest</strong> (i. e. did not raise <em> Himself</em> to the office of High Priest. <strong> δοξάζειν</strong> is here used in its most general sense, of all those steps of elevation by which the dignity might be attained: see especially ref. John, which is exceedingly useful to the right understanding here. De Wette (so also Hofmann, Schrb. ii. 1. 182. See Delitzsch’s note) is certainly very far wrong, in taking ἐδόξασεν of the ultimate well-known glorification of Christ, properly so called (ch. Heb 2:9 ), for thus confusion is introduced into the members of the parallel, seeing that this sentence, οὐχ ἑαυτὸν ἐδόξασεν γενηθ . ἀρχ ., ought to correspond to οὐχ ἑαυτῷ λαμβάνει τὴν τιμήν above. In the construction, the inf. <strong> γενηθῆναι</strong> contains rather the result than the definite purpose: ‘did not exalt himself so as to be made,’ i. e. ‘did not use that self-exaltation which might make him’), <strong> but He</strong> (i. e. the Father) <strong> who spake to Him, Thou art my son, I have this day begotten thee</strong> (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5">Hebrews 1:5</span> , where this same saying is similarly adduced as spoken by the Heavenly Father to the Son.

<p>It must be carefully observed, that the Writer does not adduce this text as containing a direct proof of Christ’s divine appointment to the High Priesthood: that follows in the next verse: nor again, does it merely assert, without any close connexion (cf. <strong> καθὼς καὶ</strong> ἐν ἑτέρῳ λέγει ), that the same Divine Person appointed Him High Priest, who said to Him “Thou art my Son:” but it asserts, that such divine appointment was wrapped up and already involved in that eternal generation to the Sonship which was declared in these words. So Thl.: δοκεῖ δὲ ἀνάρμοστος εἶναι ἡ ἐκ τοῦ δευτέρου ψαλμοῦ προφητεία πρὸς τὸ προκείμενον · προὔκειτο μὲν γὰρ δήπουθεν ἀποδειχθῆναι ἀρχιερέα τὸν χριστόν , αὕτη δὲ ἡ μαρτυρία τὸ ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς γεννηθῆναι δηλοῖ . μάλιστα μὲν οὖν καὶ τὸ ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ γεγεννῆσθαι προκατασκευή ἐστι τοῦ ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ χειροτονηθῆναι . And similarly Chrys. Then again, we must beware of imagining that <strong> ὁ λαλήσας</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> γεγέννηκά σε</strong> is a mere periphrasis of ὁ πατήρ , as some have done. The true account seems to be this: the word <strong> ἐδόξασεν</strong> contains in it the whole process of exaltation (through suffering) by which the Lord Jesus has attained the heavenly High Priesthood. This whole process was not <em> his own work</em> , but the Father’s, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:54">John 8:54</span> . And in saying this, we involve every step of it, from the very beginning. Of these, unquestionably the first was His eternal generation by the Father. He did not constitute <em> himself</em> the Son of God, in virtue ultimately of which sonship He ἐγενήθη ἀρχιερεύς . And therefore in proving this, the sacred Writer adduces first the declaration of the Father which sets forth this His generation as Son of God, on which all His δοξασθῆναι depended, and then, when He was completed by sufferings, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7-10">Hebrews 5:7-10</span> , the direct declaration of his High Priesthood, also by the Father. This class of interpretations has been much impugned, principally by the Socinian interpreters, and those who lean that way. Schlichting, Grot., Hammond, Limborch, Peirce, Storr, De Wette, and even Tholuck, refer the saying to the time of Christ’s exaltation through death: and therein the more directly Socinian of them (e. g. Schlichtg.) see a disproof of the eternal generation of the Son. To take one of the arguments by which even such Commentators as Tholuck support this view; he alleges that it best agrees with the τελείωσις spoken of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span> ff., in which Christ by obedience became perfect as our High Priest. How fallacious this is, may readily be seen from the words καίπερ <strong> ὢν υἱός</strong> , which according to this view He was not, in the present sense, till those sufferings were ended. Delitzsch also would understand the words entirely of His triumphant glorified state, beginning with the Resurrection: on the ground that there is no connexion in the proposition that He who designated Him as His Eternal Son, also appointed Him to the High Priesthood. But surely this is not so: see above. On the whole question of the interpretation of the words themselves, as cited from the Psalm, see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5">Hebrews 1:5</span> , where I have fully discussed it),</p>
