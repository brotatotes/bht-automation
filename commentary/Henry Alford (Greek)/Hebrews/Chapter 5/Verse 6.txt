<p><strong> 6</strong> .] <strong> even as also he saith in another</strong> ( <strong> place</strong> ) (see on ref., ἐν τούτῳ ), <strong> Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek</strong> (on the relation of this Psalm to Christ, see generally on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:13">Hebrews 1:13</span> . I may add to what was there said, that it is thus declared, that He, in whom all the theocratic promises find their fulfilment, in whom the true Kingdom of God comes and is summed up, was to be, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:12">Zechariah 6:12</span> ff., “a priest upon His throne,” and such a priest (i. e. necessarily <em> High</em> Priest, if a King; as indeed the word is given in Heb 5:10 and ch. Heb 6:20 ) as should be after the order of Melchisedek. In examining this last predication, we find that <strong> κατὰ τὴν τάξιν</strong> , according to the ordinary meaning of τάξις , imports, <em> according to the office or order</em> , the rank which Melchisedek held. So Jos. Antt. vii. 11. 6, David appointed Amasa commander, καὶ τὴν τάξιν αὐτῷ ἐφ ʼ ἧς Ἰωάβος ἦν , δίδωσιν : Polyb. ii. 24. 9, ἐφεδρείας ἔχοντες τάξιν : Demosth. 313. 13, οἰκέτου τάξιν , οὐκ ἐλευθέρου παιδός , ἔχων . See many other examples in Bleek. So that <strong> κατὰ τὴν τάξιν</strong> will be very nearly the same as κατὰ τὴν ὁμοιότητα , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:15">Hebrews 7:15</span> ; and the Peschito has this latter expression both in the Psalm, and throughout our Epistle. On <strong> εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα</strong> , as indeed on the detailed application of the several expressions to Christ, see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:20">Hebrews 7:20</span> ff.).</p>
