<p>CHAP. Heb 5:1 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:18">Hebrews 10:18</span> .] THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD OF CHRIST: and this in several points of view. That which has before been twice by anticipation hinted at, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14-15">Hebrews 4:14-15</span> , is now taken up and thoroughly discussed. First of all, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:1-10">Hebrews 5:1-10</span> , two necessary qualifications of a high priest are stated, and Christ is proved to have fulfilled both: α . Heb 5:1-3 , <em> he must be taken from among men, capable, in respect of infirmity, of feeling for men</em> , and, β . Heb 5:4-10 , <em> he must not have taken</em> <em> the dignity upon himself, but have been appointed by God</em> .</p>
