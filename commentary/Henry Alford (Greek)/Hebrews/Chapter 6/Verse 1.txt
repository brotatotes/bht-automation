<p><strong> 1</strong> .] <strong> Therefore</strong> (on the connexion, see below) <strong> leaving</strong> (as behind, and done with; in order to go on to another thing. “Jubet omitti ejusmodi elementa, non quod eorum oblivisci unquam debeant fideles, sed quia in illis minime est hærendum. Quod melius patet ex fundamenti similitudine quæ mox sequitur. Nam in exstruenda domo, nunquam a fundamento discedere oportet: in eo tamen jaciendo semper laborare ridiculum.” Calvin) <strong> the word of the beginning of Christ</strong> (= ἡ ἀρχὴ τῶν λογίων τοῦ θεοῦ above, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span> ; that word, or discourse, which has respect to the fundamental and elementary things mentioned below), <strong> let us press on to maturity</strong> ( <strong> φέρομαι</strong> in this sense is not uncommon: see Lycurg. in reff.: Xen. Venat. 3. 10, ἄν ποθεν ἀκούσωσι κραυγῆς , καταλείπουσαι τὰ αὐτῶν ἔργα ἀπρονοήτως ἐπὶ τοῦτο φέρονται : Polyb. v. 26. 6, πᾶσιν ἄδηλος ἦν, ἐπὶ τί φέρεται, καὶ ἐπὶ ποίας ὑπάρχει γνώμης . Bleek cites on Valcknaer’s authority φέρεσθαι ἐπὶ τὴν φιλοσοφίαν : and in the Pythagorean school our very expression, φέρεσθαι ἐπὶ τὴν τελειότητα , was current. A question of some difficulty has divided the Commentators here: whether this sentence be meant as expressing the resolution of the Writer, as we say, ‘let us now proceed’ to this or that, or as conveying an exhortation to the readers. Each view has a formidable array of supporters. On the side of the former are Primasius, Erasmus, Luther, a-Lapide, Grot., Limborch, Wolf, Bengel, Michaelis, al., and Storr, Heinrichs, Abresch, Wahl, Bretschn., Kuinoel, Baumg. Crus., De Wette, Tholuck, Conybeare, al. The latter is adopted by Chrys., Thdrt., Phot., and Gennadius (in Œc.), Thl. (not decidedly), Calvin, Justiniani, Estius, Jac. Cappellus, Böhme, Stuart, Bleek, Ebrard, Lünemann, Hofm. (Schrb. i. 553). Owen tries (and so also Delitzsch) to comprehend both meanings: giving, however, the alternative very lucidly: “The Apostle either assumes the Hebrews unto himself, as to his work, or joins himself with them as to their duty. For if the words be taken the first way, they declare his resolution in teaching: if in the latter, their duty in learning.” Between these two, both equally legitimate, the context must decide. And in seeking for elements of decision, I own that the alternative seems to me to have been put too exclusively. What I mean will be plain, when we consider on the one hand that θεμέλιον καταβαλλόμενοι can hardly be properly said of any but a <em> teacher</em> : and on the other, that <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:4">Hebrews 6:4</span> ff., ἀδύνατον γὰρ κ . τ . λ ., must necessarily have a general reference of warning to the hearers. It seems to me that the fact may be best stated thus: The whole is a συγκατάβασις of the Writer to his readers: he with his work of teaching comes down to their level of learning, and regards that teaching and learning as all one work, going on together: himself and them as bound up in one progress. Thus best may we explain the expressions, which seem to oscillate alternately between writer and readers. And thus will <strong> διό</strong> retain all its proper meaning, which on the first hypothesis was obliged to be wrested: so Schlichting, its advocate, confesses, and joins διό to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:11">Hebrews 5:11</span> . But now it will mean, ‘Wherefore, seeing that we (you and I, by communication) are in so low a state, babes, instead of grown men, let us,’ &amp;c.): <strong> not again laying the foundation</strong> ( <strong> θεμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> καταβάλλεσθαι</strong> is a phrase of common occurrence in later writers. Dion. Hal. iii. 69, Ταρκύνιος .… τούς τε θεμελίους ( τοῦ νεῶ ) κατεβάλετο : Porphyr. de Abstin. viii. 10, οἰκίας θεμέλια καταβάλλεσθαι : Galen, Rat. Medendi ix., χρὴ γὰρ οἶμαι τὰ θεμέλια τοῖς οἰκοδομήμασιν ἰσχυρὰ προκαταβεβλῆσθαι : Jos. Antt. xi. 4. 4, εὐθὺς τοὺς θεμελίους κατεβάλετο : ib. xv. 11. 3, ἀνελὼν δὲ τοὺς ἀρχαίους θεμελίους , καὶ καταβαλόμενος ἑτέρους . Cf. 2Ma 2:29 , ἀρχιτέκτονι τῆς ὅλης καταβολῆς , and see examples also of βάλλεσθαι , in Bleek. It is a curious instance of the occasional singularity and perversity of Ebrard’s exposition, that he insists here on καταβαλλόμενοι meaning “ <em> pulling down</em> :” (which however, as Delitzsch remarks, partakes of the infirmity of all would-be original interpretations, falling under the proverb, “There is nothing new under the sun:” for the old Latin has “non iterum fundamenta <em> diruentes</em> .”) Not to dwell on the entire inconsistency with the context, how can one be said <strong> κατα</strong> βάλλεσθαι θεμέλιον , which is in the ground already?

<p>The <em> subjects</em> to be supplied to καταβαλλόμενοι are the readers, with whom the Writer unites himself, as above explained) <strong> of</strong> (the genitives here indicate the materials of which the foundation consists. They are all matters belonging to the λόγος τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦ χριστοῦ : extending indeed in their influence over the whole Christian life, just as the shape of the foundation is that of the building: but to be laid down once for all and not afterwards repeated) <strong> repentance from dead works, and faith on God</strong> (so in the opening of the Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:15">Mark 1:15</span> , μετανοεῖτε κ . πιστεύετε ἐν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ : and in its progress, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:21">Acts 20:21</span> , διαμαρτυρόμενος Ἰουδαίοις τε καὶ Ἕλλησιν τὴν εἰς θεὸν μετάνοιαν καὶ πίστιν εἰς τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦν . These were the common conditions on which all mankind were invited to embrace the Gospel. And as the readers here were Jews, so would these words especially remind them of the form in which they were first invited by Christ’s messengers. But we have to notice the qualifications which here follow each term μετάνοια <strong> ἀπὸ νεκρῶν ἔργων</strong> πίστις <strong> ἐπὶ θεόν</strong> . The νεκρὰ ἔργα are taken by all the patristic expositors to mean <em> sinful</em> works: so Chrys., τὰ ἡμαρτημένα : Thdrt., τὴν πονηρίαν : Thl., τουτέστι , τὴν ἀποταγὴν τῶν ἔργων τοῦ σατανᾶ : Primas., “Pœnitentiam ab operibus mortuis agere, est ipsa opera mala per pœnitentiam delere, quæ animum mortificabant: opera namque mortis sunt peccata.” And so the great majority of modern Commentators also. And the justification of such an expression as νεκρὰ ἔργα for <em> sins</em> is variously given: as <em> causing death eternal</em> , Schlichting, J. Cappell., Limb., Peirce, Stuart, al.: as <em> polluting, like the touch of a dead body</em> , Chrys. (on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span> , καλῶς εἶπεν , ἀπὸ νεκρῶν ἔργων . εἴ τις γὰρ ἥψατο τότε νεκροῦ , ἐμιαίνετο · καὶ ἐνταῦθα εἴ τις ἅψαιτο νεκροῦ ἔργου , μολύνεται διὰ τῆς συνειδήσεως ), Œc. (ibid.), Storr, al. But neither of these meanings is borne out: the former being contrary to usage, the latter far-fetched and unlikely. It is much better to take <strong> νεκρός</strong> in its common and obvious meaning; <em> dead, devoid of life</em> and power: cf. νεκρὰ πίστις , and νεκρὰ ἁμαρτία in the reff. St. Paul speaks, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:11">Ephesians 5:11</span> , in nearly the same sense: cf. τὰ ἔργα τὰ ἄκαρπα τοῦ σκότους . And Tholuck cites from Epict. Dissert. iii. 23, 29, νεκρὸς λόγος , in the sense of discourse without convincing power. But such dead or lifeless works again may be variously understood: either of the works of the flesh in the unconverted man, or of the Jewish works of the law which could not give life. Considering the readers and object of the Epistle, it is much more likely that the latter are here meant: those works by which they sought to set up a righteousness of their own, before they submitted themselves to God’s righteousness. And so, nearly, Delitzsch, and Hofm. Weiss. u. Erf. ii. 166. The best explanation of <strong> πίστις ἐπὶ θεόν</strong> is found in St. Paul’s language, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:5">Romans 4:5</span> , τῷ δὲ μὴ ἐργαζομένῳ , πιστεύοντι δὲ ἐπὶ τὸν δικαιοῦντα τὸν ἀσεβῆ , λογίζεται ἡ πίστις αὐτοῦ εἰς δικαιοσύνην . And by this, our expression is defined to mean, <em> full trust, rested on God, that He has fulfilled his promises in Christ</em> : so Wittich, cited in Bleek: “Fides evangelio adhibita, hæc fides dicitur ἐπὶ θεόν , quia dum evangelio creditur, creditur præstitisse Deum promissa facta patribus eaque in Christo implevisse.” We may observe, that the genitives arrange themselves in groups of pairs, of which this is the first),</p>
