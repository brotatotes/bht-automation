<p><strong> 14</strong> .] <strong> saying, Surely</strong> (in reff., the editions vary between εἰ μήν and ἦ μήν , but the greater MSS. have εἰ μήν : in fact, ει and η are constantly interchanged by the copyists. The expression occurs in formulæ jurandi in several places in the LXX (as e. g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+33:27">Ezekiel 33:27</span> , ζῶ ἐγώ , εἰ μὴν οἱ ἐν ταῖς ἠρημωμέναις μαχαίραις πεσοῦνται : see also ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:8">Ezekiel 34:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+35:6">Ezekiel 35:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:5">Ezekiel 36:5</span> ; Eze 38:19 ), so that it could not be an unmeaning expression to the Hellenistic ear. Bleek thinks it came from the Hebraistic formula εἰ μή , which has sometimes been written and edited for it) <strong> blessing I will bless</strong> (thus frequently the LXX, for the Heb. idiomatic conjuction of the absolute infinitive with the finite verb: but sometimes they have it where the Heb. has no such conjunction, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ki+2:25">1 Kings 2:25</span> ; and something like it is found even in Greek writers, as e. g. Herod. v. 95, φεύγων ἐκφεύγει : Xen. Cyr. viii. 4. 9, ὑπακούων σχολῇ ὑπήκουσα : Lucian, Parasit. 43, φεύγων … κατέφυγε (none of which however are quite analogous, the second verb in all being coupled with some additional predicate, as in φεύγων ἐκφεύγει ‘flying, he escapes, gets clear off’). See Winer, § 45.8, edn. 6. At first the participle seems to have had a certain emphasis: but afterwards this was lost, and the expression became a mere formula) <strong> thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee</strong> (the LXX has for σε , τὸ σπέρμα σου . This the Writer alters, not from a wish to abbreviate (Jac. Cappell.) nor because he quoted from memory (Abresch), nor because he was unwilling to introduce Abraham’s bodily descendants, but wished to direct his readers’ thoughts to his spiritual seed (Böhme, Bisping, al.), but, as Bleek, De W., Lünem., al., because his concern here was with Abraham alone, and his spiritual example: or perhaps, as Delitzsch, seeing that πληθ . <strong> σε</strong> could only be understood of <em> posterity</em> , because he wished to concentrate the promise as much as possible):</p>
