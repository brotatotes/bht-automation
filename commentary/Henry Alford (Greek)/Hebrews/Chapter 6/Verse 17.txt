<p><strong> 17</strong> .] <strong> In which</strong> behalf (nearly equivalent to ‘wherefore.’ This seems the best rendering, and not, with some, to take <strong> ἐν ᾧ</strong> , as agreeing with ὅρκῳ “ <em> in which</em> ,” or “ <em> by which oath</em> :” cf. Thl. (alt.), Primas., al. It belongs, not exclusively to ἐμεσίτευσεν , nor to βουλόμενος , but to the whole sentence, as Delitzsch) <strong> God, willing</strong> (“ βουλόμενος … βουλῆς , conjugata. Summa hic exprimitur benignitas,” Bengel) <strong> to shew more abundantly</strong> (“quam sine juramento factum videretur,” Beng. The word can hardly mean as Thl., ἐκ περιουσίας , Beza, “amplius etiam quam necesse esset.” The Commentators cite a very apposite passage of Philo, de Abr. § 46, vol. ii. p. 39: θεὸς ἐν οὐρανῷ , ὃς τῆς πρὸς αὐτὸν πίστεως ἀγάμενος τὸν ἄνδρα πίστιν ἀντιδίδωσιν αὐτῷ , τὴν δι ʼ ὅρκου βεβαίωσιν ὧν ὑπέσχετο δωρεῶν , οὐκ ἔτι μόνον ὡς ἀνθρώπῳ θεός , ἀλλὰ καὶ ὡς φίλος γνωρίμῳ διαλεγόμενος . φησὶ γάρ · “ κατ ʼ ἐμαυτοῦ ὤμοσα ,” παρ ʼ ᾧ ὁ λόγος ὅρκος ἐστίν , ἕνεκα τοῦ τὴν διάνοιαν ἀκλινῶς κ . παγίως ἔτι μᾶλλον ἢ πρότερον ἐρηρεῖσθαι ) <strong> to the heirs of the promise</strong> (from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9">Hebrews 9:9</span> , Isaac and Jacob were συγκληρονόμοι τῆς ἐπαγγελίας τῆς αὐτῆς with Abraham. But there is no need to confine the title to them: as Œc. (Chrys.), ἦλθε δὲ καὶ εἰς ἡμᾶς . ἡμεῖς γὰρ οἱ κληρονόμοι τῆς ἐπαγγελίας , οἱ κατ ʼ ἐπαγγελίαν σπέρμα ὄντες τῷ Ἀβραάμ · εἰ δὲ σπέρμα , καὶ κληρονόμοι ) <strong> the unchangeableness</strong> (see reff. Beware of supposing the words equivalent to τὴν βουλὴν αὐτοῦ τὴν ἀμετάθετον . It was not “His unchangeable counsel” that He would shew, but the fact that His counsel was unchangeable) <strong> of His counsel, interposed</strong> ( <strong> μεσιτεύω</strong> , like μεσίτης , belongs to later Greek: and in its usage it is generally transitive. Thus Diod. Sic. xix. 71, μεσιτεύσαντος τὰς συνθήκας Ἀμίλκου : Polyb. ix. 34. 3, μεσιτεῦσαι τὴν διάλυσιν εὐνοϊκῶς , and other examples in Bleek: and thus some have rendered it here: ἐμεσίτευσεν ὅρκῳ τὴν ὑπόσχεσιν , Œc.: scil., τὴν βουλήν , Böhme: Thdrt. Eran. Dial. i. vol. iii. p. 34, ὁ γὰρ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἀπαγορεύων ὀμνύναι , τὸ ἀμετάθετον τῆς βουλῆς αὐτοῦ , καθά φησι καὶ ὁ ἀπόστολος , ἐμεσίτευσεν ὅρκῳ . But it is also found with an intransitive sense, as in ref.; and thus we may best interpret it here: God came in as a middle person between Himself and Abraham. Men swear by God, as greater than themselves. So God becomes for men, when swearing, the third and higher person concerned, the Mediator between them: cf. Jos. Antt. iv. 6. 7, ταῦτα δὲ ὀμνύοντες ἔλεγον καὶ θεὸν <strong> μεσίτην</strong> ὧν ὑπισχνοῦντο ποιούμενοι . And thus when He Himself swears, having no greater to swear by, He swears by Himself, so making Himself as it were a third person between the parties to the oath: so, in the intransitive sense, μεσιτεύων . It is strange that Bleek quotes the E. V. as having here “ <em> interposed himself by an oath</em> ,” whereas it has “ <em> confirmed it by an oath</em> ,” taking the transitive sense. We may note, that this word <strong> ἐμεσίτευσεν</strong> has led the Greek expositors, Chrys., Œc., Thl., to fancy that the Son was the person swearing and sworn by. Thus Œc.: καλῶς δὲ ἔχει ἡ ἔννοια τῆς ἑρμηνείας , ἵνα οὕτως ῃ · ὁ θεὸς τουτέστιν ὁ λόγος , ἐπιδεῖξαι βουλόμενος τὸ ἀμετάθετον τῶν τῷ πατρὶ δοξάντων , ἐμεσίτευσε τῷ πατρὶ κ . τῷ Ἀβραὰμ ὅρκῳ , τουτέστι μεσίτης ἐν τῷ ὅρκῳ γέγονε · δι ʼ αὐτοῦ γὰρ ὡς λόγου ὤμνυεν ὁ θεός ) <strong> with an oath</strong> (dat. of the instrument: it was by means of the oath that He exercised the office of μεσίτης ),</p>
