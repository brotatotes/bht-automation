<p><strong> 12</strong> .] <strong> For if the priesthood is changed</strong> (better thus than E. V., “ <em> the priesthood being changed</em> ,” which gives the reader the idea of μετατιθείσης ), <strong> there takes place of necessity a change of the law</strong> (not ‘ <em> of law</em> ,’ which would be decidedly wrong, and would require <strong> τοῦ</strong> νόμου , as in a general sentence, implying ‘the law’ of the particular case in view; <strong> νόμου</strong> , anarthrous, means that law, which had already begun to be used as a proper name, the well-known law of Moses) <strong> also</strong> (viz. of that law, which, as above, is legislated upon the ground of that priesthood: not, as Beza, Grot., al., of the <em> law of the priesthood</em> only, nor as Calvin, a-Lapide, Jac. Cappell., Böhme, Kuinoel, al., of the <em> ceremonial law</em> only. Chrys. says rightly: εἰ δὲ ἕτερον δεῖ ἱερέα εἶναι , μᾶλλον δὲ ἑτέραν ἱερωσύνην , ἀνάγκη καὶ νόμον ἕτερον εἶναι · τοῦτο δὲ πρὸς τοὺς λέγοντας · τί ἔδει καινῆς διαθήκης ; The connexion is with the parenthesis in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:11">Hebrews 7:11</span> , which was inserted to prepare the way for our verse. Bleek, De Wette, al. deny the reference to the parenthetical clause in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:11">Hebrews 7:11</span> , and regard our verse as preparing the way for what follows: “It lays down the ground, why not without urgent cause a change of the priesthood took place” (De W.), that cause being that the law itself was to be abrogated. The Writer as yet expresses himself mildly and cautiously: the <strong> μετάθεσις</strong> here in fact amounts to the ἀθέτησις in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:18">Hebrews 7:18</span> , but is not yet so expressed).</p>
