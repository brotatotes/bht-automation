<p><strong> 15</strong> .] <strong> And it</strong> (viz. the change of the law; the proposition of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:12">Hebrews 7:12</span> .: so Œc., οὐ μόνον ἔνθεν δῆλόν ἐστιν , ὅτι ἐνηλλάγη ἥ τε λατρεία καὶ ἡ διαθήκη … ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐξ ἐκείνου περισσῶς δῆλόν ἐστιν … καὶ ἐκ τούτου κατάδηλός ἐστιν ἥ τε ἐναλλαγὴ καὶ ἡ μετάθεσις τῆς παλαιᾶς διαθήκης . Chrys. takes ‘ <em> it</em> ’ to mean the distinction between the Levitical and the N. T. High Priesthood: τί ἐστι κατάδηλον ; τὸ μέσον τῆς ἱερωσύνης . Jac. Cappellus, and Bengel “illud quod in Heb 7:11 asseritur, nullam consummationem factam esse per sacerdotium Leviticum,” and so Delitzsch. Primasius, Hammond, al., that the <em> priesthood</em> is altered: Ebrard strangely supplies, “that our Lord sprung from Judah:” indeed his whole comment on this verse is one of those curiosities of exegesis which unhappily abound in his otherwise valuable commentary. But the alteration of the <em> law</em> is the proposition here: and so Estius, Schlichting, Seb. Schmidt, Kuinoel, Tholuck, Bleek, Lünem., al.) <strong> is yet more abundantly</strong> (see for περισσότερον , on ch. Heb 2:1 ) <strong> manifest</strong> ( <strong> κατάδηλος</strong> is another stronger form of δῆλος , common in the classics (reff.), but found only here in LXX and N. T.), <strong> if</strong> (i. e. <em> siquidem</em> , seeing that: τὸ <strong> εἰ</strong> ἀντὶ τοῦ <strong> ὅτι</strong> νοήσεις , ἤγουν <strong> ἐπειδή</strong> , Œc.: “ <em> si</em> … rem dubitative loquitur, sed affirmative, quasi diceret … quia” &amp;c., Primasius, in Bleek. See reff. ὅτι could not well have been used here, as the reader would have connected it with κατάδηλον , ‘it is evident, that’ &amp;c.) <strong> according to the similitude of</strong> (= κατὰ τὴν τάξιν before) <strong> Melchisedek ariseth a different priest</strong> (it is best to take <strong> ἱερεὺς ἕτερος</strong> as the subject, ἕτερος being a mere epithet: not, as Schulz (also in Heb 7:11 ), ἱερεύς predicatively, “ <em> another ariseth as priest</em> ,” nor as some (?) mentioned by Lünem., to take ἱερεύς and ἕτερος both predicatively, “ <em> He ariseth as another priest</em> ,” viz. our Lord).</p>
