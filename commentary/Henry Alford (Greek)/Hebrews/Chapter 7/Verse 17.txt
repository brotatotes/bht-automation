<p><strong> 17</strong> .] <em> Proof of the last clause</em> : κατασκευάζει πῶς εἶπε τὸ <strong> ἀκαταλύτου ζωῆς</strong> , καί φησιν ὅτι ἡ γραφὴ λέγει αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα εἶναι ἱερέα . Thl. The stress of the citation is on <strong> εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα</strong> . <strong> For he</strong> (the ἱερεὺς ἓτερος ) <strong> is borne witness of that</strong> (just as in μαρτυρούμενος ὅτι ζῇ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:8">Hebrews 7:8</span> . The <strong> ὅτι</strong> belongs, not to the citation, but to the verb. If the rec. μαρτυρεῖ be taken, ὁ θεός must be supplied, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6">Hebrews 1:6</span> , and passim in this Epistle. And then also the ὅτι belongs to the verb) <strong> Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek</strong> .</p>
