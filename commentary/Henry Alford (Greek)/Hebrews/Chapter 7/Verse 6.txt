<p><strong> 6</strong> .] <strong> But</strong> (apodosis to μέν , Heb 7:5 ), <strong> he whose pedigree is never</strong> (see below) <strong> reckoned from them</strong> (contrast οἱ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Λευεί , ὁ μὴ γενεαλογούμενος ἐξ αὐτῶν : also speaking for the connexion above advocated in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:5">Hebrews 7:5</span> . The present part. gives the sense, ‘ <em> who is not in the habit of having his genealogy made out</em> ’ …, whose descent no one thinks of deducing. This is also indicated by the subjective <strong> μή</strong> . Had it been οὐ (as οἱ οὐκ ἠλεημένοι , 1Pe 2:10 ) it would denote the mere matter of fact, ‘of whom no such genealogy exists.’ This is better than with Winer, edn. 6, § 55. 5, to regard the μή as only a stronger form of negation. The verb is good Greek: the Egyptian priests in Herodotus, Ἑκαταίῳ γενεηλογήσαντι ἑωϋτὸν .… ἀντεγενεηλόγησαν κ . τ . λ ., ii. 143, see also ib. 146; and in Xen. Symp. iv. 51, we have γενεαλογοῦσι τὴν συγγένειαν .

<p><strong> ἐξ αὐτῶν</strong> , viz. τῶν υἱῶν Λευεί : not as Epiphan. Hær. lxvii. 7, p. 716, a-Lapide, al., τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ , nor as Grot., from <em> Levi and Abraham</em> : and it means ‘ <em> from</em> them,’ i. e. their line of descent) <strong> hath taken tithes of Abraham</strong> (not <em> took</em> , aor. The sentence is cast into this form, because of the <em> enduring nature</em> of the office and priesthood of Melchisedek, which is given by the perfect tense. Doubtless the perfect might be used without any such reference, meaning, ‘as the fact now stands:’ indicating, as Winer, § 40. 4, that the fact endures in its significance: see below, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:9">Hebrews 7:9</span> ; but considering the connexion here, I prefer supposing it to have been intended) <strong> and hath blessed the possessor of the promises</strong> (Klee would urge the present sense of the participle; “ <em> him who now possesses the promises</em> ;” but there seems to be no necessity for this. I should rather take <strong> ὁ ἔχων τὰς ἐπαγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> for a quasi-official designation of Abraham (see on ch. Heb 6:12 ) as the <em> possessor of</em> the promises. As to the sense, Œc. has well expressed it: ἐξῆρε τὸν Ἀβραάμ , ἵνα πλεῖον ἐξάρῃ τὸν Μελχισεδέκ ):</p>
