<p><strong> 7</strong> .] <strong> and</strong> (our English ‘ <em> and</em> ’ is the nearest to this use of <strong> δέ</strong> , which is a faint ‘ <em> but</em> ,’ introducing merely a new proposition. Were it not in the middle of a sentence, ‘ <em> now</em> ’ after a period would best give its sense) <strong> without all controversy</strong> ( πάντες δὲ κοινῶς καὶ ἀναντιῤῥήτως οἴδαμεν . Thl. See on ch. Heb 6:16 ), <strong> the less is blessed by the better</strong> (the neuters here serve entirely to generalize, as in τὸ κατέχον οἴδατε , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:6">2 Thessalonians 2:6</span> , taken up by ὁ κατέχων , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:7">Hebrews 7:7</span> ; see reff.; and Winer, § 27. 5. So Thuc. iii. 11, τὰ κράτιστα ἐπὶ τοὺς ὑποδεεστέρους ξυνεπῆγον : Xen. Anab. vii. 3. 11. On κρείττων , see note, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span> . It is obvious that the axiom here laid down only holds good where the blessing is a solemn and official one, as of a father, or a priest: as was the case here. In such cases the blesser stands in the place of God, and as so standing is of superior dignity).</p>
