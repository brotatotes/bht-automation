The LXX use the verb and subst. to express the Heb. שֵׁרֵת and מְשָׁרֵת , in reference to the sacerdotal service in the sanctuary: see, for the verb, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:31">Exodus 28:31</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:39">Exodus 28:39</span> ( Exo 28:35; Exo 28:43 ); <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:30">Exodus 29:30</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+35:18">Exodus 35:18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+3:0">Deuteronomy 3:0</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+3:0">Deuteronomy 3:0</span> Kings 8:11; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ch+6:32">1 Chronicles 6:32</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ch+13:10">2 Chronicles 13:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+44:27">Ezekiel 44:27</span> , where we have λειτουργεῖν ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ : Eze 45:4 al.: and for the subst., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ne+10:39">Nehemiah 10:39</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:6">Isaiah 61:6</span> ; Sir 7:30 ) <strong> of the holy places</strong> ( <strong> τῶν ἁγίων</strong> is taken as <em> mase</em> by τινες in Thl., and by Œc., τῶν ἡγιασμένων παρ ʼ αὐτοῦ ἀνθρώπων · ἡμῶν γάρ ἐστιν ἀρχιερεύς . But ἡμῶν <strong> ἀρχιερεύς</strong> and ἡμῶν <strong> λειτουργός</strong> are very different things. The λειτουργός is <em> subordinate</em> to those whose minister he is, as in Jos 1:1 Λ , τῷ Ἰησοῦ … τῷ λειτουργῷ Μωυσῆ : see also 2Ki 13:18; 2 Kings 3 Kings 10:5; 4 Kings 4:43; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:15">Hebrews 6:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ch+9:4">2 Chronicles 9:4</span> . See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+3:6">Numbers 3:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+18:2">Numbers 18:2</span> . It is taken by Luther ( <em> und ist ein pfleger der heiligen Guter</em> ) as importing <em> holy things</em> , as it seems to be in Philo, Leg. Alleg. iii. 46, vol. i. p. 114, τοιοῦτος δὲ ὁ θεραπευτὴς κ . λειτουργὸς τῶν ἁγίων , and De Profug. 17, p. 560, ἡ Λευϊτικὴ φυλὴ νεωκόρων κ . ἱερέων ἐστίν , οἷς ἡ τῶν ἁγίων ἀνάκειται λειτουργία . But this does not seem to answer to the usage of <strong> τὰ ἅγια</strong> in our Epistle. Cf. reff., in which <strong> τὰ ἅγια</strong> imports the holy place, i. e. the holy of holies. It does not seem necessary to supply any thing after <strong> τῶν ἁγίων</strong> , as τῶν ἁληθινῶν , or τῶν ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς : this distinction is brought out by what follows. As yet Christ is spoken of as being in common with the Levitical priests τῶν ἁγίων λειτουργός . See below), <strong> and of the true</strong> (archetypal, <em> only true</em> , as so often in St. John, and in one passage of St. Luke, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:11">Luke 16:11</span> ; see reff. The difference between <strong> ἀληθινός</strong> and ἀληθής is well sketched by Kahnis, Abendmahl, p. 119, cited in Delitzsch: “ <strong> ἀληθής</strong> excludes the untrue and unreal, <strong> ἀληθινός</strong> that which does not fulfil its idea. The measure of <strong> ἀληθής</strong> is reality, that of <strong> ἀληθινός</strong> ideality. In <strong> ἀληθής</strong> , the idea corresponds to the thing, in <strong> ἀληθινός</strong> , the thing to the idea”) <strong> tabernacle, which the Lord</strong> (here evidently the Father: see note on ch. Heb 12:14 ) <strong> pitched</strong> (the usual LXX word of fixing the tabernacle, or a tent: see reff. And so m the classics: e. g. Herod. vi. 12, and many examples in Bleek and Wetst. It is used similarly of the heaven in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:5">Isaiah 42:5</span> , ὁ ποιήσας τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ πήξας αὐτόν ), <strong> not</strong> (any) <strong> man</strong> (not οὐχ ὁ ἄνθρωπος , which would be the literal way of expressing ‘not man,’ generically: because by the indefinite ἄνθρωπος , anarthrons, every individual man is excluded. It is an important question, symbolically considered, whether any and what distinction is intended by the Writer, between <strong> τῶν ἁγίων</strong> and <strong> τῆς σκηνῆς</strong> . Delitzsch, in loc., has gone into it at length, and Hofmann has treated of it in two places especially, Weiss. u. Erf. ii. 188 ff. and Schriftb. ii. 1. 405 f. Both are agreed that <strong> τὰ ἅγια</strong> betokens the immediate, immaterial presence of God, the veritable Holy of Holies, beyond, and approached through, the heavens, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14">Hebrews 4:14</span> . But as regards <strong> σκηνή</strong> , they differ. Hofmann maintains it to be the glorified body of Christ, and argues that it alone will satisfy such expressions as that in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11">Hebrews 9:11</span> , οὐ ταύτης τῆς κτίσεως : in order to satisfying which, this σκηνή must belong to the new creation, the παλιγγενεσία , which commences with the glorification of Christ. This glorified body of His is the new and abiding temple of God, in which He dwells and meets with us who are united to and have put on that glorified body, our house, eternal in the heavens: for so Hofmann interprets <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span> ff. On the other hand, Delitzsch controverts this view as inconsistent with the symbolism in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11-12">Hebrews 9:11-12</span> , where Christ διὰ τῆς μείζονος κ . τελειοτέρας σκηνῆς … εἰσῆλθεν … εἰς τὰ ἅγια , taking this connexion of the words: and also with our <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span> , where the Mosaic tabernacle is set forth as the representation and shadow of the heavenly. Accordingly, he believes the σκηνή , here to be the heavenly Jerusalem, the worship-place ( <em> Anbetungsstätte</em> ) of blessed spirits ( Psa 29:9 ) and of those men who have been rapt in vision thither (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:0">Isaiah 6:0</span> ), the ναὸς τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+15:5">Revelation 15:5</span> , the place where God’s <em> visible</em> presence (in contradistinction to His personal and invisible presence in the ἅγια ) is manifested to His creatures angelic and human. See much more, well worth studying, in his note here.

<p>In weighing these two opinions, I own they seem to me to run into one, and of that one by far the larger component is on Hofmann’s side. For what is the heavenly Jerusalem? What, but the aggregate, in their persons and their glorious abiding-place, of the triumphant saints and servants of God? And what is this aggregate, but the mystical body, of which Christ is the Head and they are the members, in its fulfilment and perfection? That glorified body of His, in which they are accepted before God, and in which as a heavenly temple, they serve God, and God dwells, He has passed through, not by passing out of it, but by finally establishing it as an accomplished thing in God’s sight, and in and as proceeding forth from it carrying on his intercession and λειτουργία τῆς σκηνῆς τῆς ἀληθινῆς in the ἅγια itself. See more on this subject, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11">Hebrews 9:11</span> ; and the views of Bleek, Tholuck, al.: also a sermon of Schleiermacher’s on the text, vol. ii. of his Predigten, p. 504. The idea of the σκηνή being the body of Christ is found in Joh. Philoponus (Cent. vii.) on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:0">Genesis 1:0</span> (in Bleek): τὸ δὲ τοῦ ἀποστόλου , “ καὶ τῆς σκηνῆς .… ἄνθρωπος ,” οὐχ οὕτω περὶ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ λελέχθαι μοι δοκεῖ , καθά τινες ἔφρασαν , ὡς περὶ τοῦ κυριακοῦ σώματος , εἰ ἐπιστήσει τις ἀκριβῶν τῷ τόπῳ , κατὰ τὸ εἰρημένον , καὶ ὁ λόγος σὰρξ ἐγένετο , καὶ ἐσκήνωσεν ἐν ἡμῖν . It is also the view of Beza, Gerhard, Owen, Bengel, al.).</p>
