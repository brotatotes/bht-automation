<p><strong> 3</strong> .] <strong> For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices</strong> (see the very similar passage, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:1">Hebrews 5:1</span> , and note there): <strong> whence it is necessary that this</strong> ( <strong> High Priest</strong> ) <strong> also have somewhat which he may offer</strong> (there is here considerable difficulty. For the Writer is evidently, from what follows, laying the stress on the <em> heavenly</em> λειτουργία of Christ: and this <strong> ὃ προσενέγκῃ</strong> applies therefore to His work not on earth, but in heaven. If so, how comes it to be said that He has somewhat to offer in heaven, seeing that His offering, of Himself, was made once for all, in contradistinction to those of the Levitical priests which were being constantly offered? See especially ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:11-12">Hebrews 10:11-12</span> , which, on this view, brings the Writer here into direct contradiction to himself. In order to avoid this, Lünemann and Hofmann (Schriftb. ii. 1. 288) attempt to make the aor. <strong> προσενέγκῃ</strong> retrospective: “it is necessary for Him to have (there, in heaven) somewhat (viz. His body) which he may have offered.” But surely this is a view of the aorist which cannot be admitted. In such sentences, the uses of the aor. and pres. seem to regard not the time, objectively, of the act expressed, but its nature, subjectively, as an act rapidly passing in each case, or enduring. The straightforward construction of our sentence makes it necessary that <strong> προσενέγκῃ</strong> should refer to an act done in the state pointed out by the ἔχειν , however the nature of that act may be, in each case of its being done, such as to be accomplished at the moment, and not enduring onwards: which latter, expressed by ὃ προσφέρῃ , would certainly involve the contradiction above spoken of. Thus regarded then, what is it which our High Priest in heaven has to offer? In ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span> , He is described as προσενέγκας prayers and supplications in the days of His flesh: and it might be thought that His ἐντυγχάνειν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span> , might be here meant, the offering being those intercessions. But this would hardly satisfactorily give the <strong> τι</strong> , which as Delitzsch remarks, is too concrete for such an interpretation. It must be something with which and by virtue of which, and as offering and applying which, our High Priest enters and ministers in the Holy of Holies above. Now if we look to the analogy of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:7">Hebrews 9:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span> , we see, 1. that the high priest entered the holy place οὺ χωρὶς <strong> αἵματος</strong> , ὃ προσφέρει ὑπὲρ ἑαυτοῦ κ . τῶν τοῦ λαοῦ ἀγνοημάτων , 2. that Christ is entered into the ἅγια of heaven οὐ δι ʼ <strong> αἵματος</strong> τράγων καὶ μόσχων , διὰ δὲ τοῦ <strong> ἰδίου αἵματος</strong> : see also ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:25">Hebrews 9:25</span> . This BLOOD of the one offering, Christ is represented as bearing into the Holy Place, and its application is ever set forth to us as a continuing and constantly repeated one. Thus this <em> blood of sprinkling</em> is regarded as being <em> in heaven</em> , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:24">Hebrews 12:24</span> ; <em> as being sprinkled on the believer as the end of his election</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span> ; as <em> cleansing us from all sin</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span> ; as <em> that wherein the saints wash their robes and make them white</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+7:14">Revelation 7:14</span> . Still, as Delitzsch also remarks, this is not the place to enlarge on this matter, seeing that it is merely incidentally introduced here, the present object being to shew that it is in heaven, and not on earth, that our High Priest ministers. The Roman Catholic interpretation of this place, as represented by Corn. a-Lapide, is worth noticing, if only to remark how absolutely inconsistent it is with the argument of the Epistle: “Ergo Christus in cœlo suas hostias et munera offert, scilicet suum in cruce sacrificium, quod olim in monte Calvariæ obtulit, nunc quoque id ipsum per continuam commemorationem Patri in cœlo offert. Secundo, <em> et proprie</em> , Christus in cœlo offert sacrificia missæ, quæ toto orbe quotidie celebrantur; in his enim primus et primarius sacerdos qui consecrat, offert, et transubstantiationem peragit, est Christus.” Estius, more cautiously, “Probabile est apostolum loqui de ea oblatione qua se ipsum quondam in cruce passum et oblatum, continuo nunc repræsentat Patri in cœlis. Nam de altera (Christum, etsi in cœlo regnantem, offerre quotidie se ipsum adhuc in terris per ministros et vicarios suos sacerdotes) apostolus prorsus tacet, quia mysterium est, quod intelligendum relinquit fidelibus mysteriorum consciis.” This last would make a curious canon of interpretation).</p>
