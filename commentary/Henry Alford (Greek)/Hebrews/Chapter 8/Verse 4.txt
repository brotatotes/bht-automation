Hofmann, as above, laying all the stress on the aor. προσενέγκῃ , takes the <strong> γάρ</strong> as justifying that aorist: <em> Er muss ein nicht erst darzubringendes, sondern, dargebrachtes Opfer haben: denn wäre er auf Erden</em> … But see on this above. The connexion is obvious: ‘our High Priest must have somewhat to offer. But <em> on earth</em> this could not be: <strong> for</strong> ’ &amp;c.) <strong> he were</strong> (not, “ <em> had been</em> ,” though grammatically it might be so: the pres. part. ὄντων , which follows, and λατρεύουσι , continuing it, shew that this ἧν is spoken of a continuing, not of a past hypothesis) <strong> on earth</strong> (some, as Grot., Wolf, al., supply μόνον after γῆς and something in the same view Œc., τοῦτο δὲ ἦν εἰ μὴ ἐτεθνήκει , μηδὲ ἐγερθεὶς ἀνελήφη : and Thdrt., περιττὸν ἦν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ γῇ διαιτώμενον ἱερέα καλεῖν : others, as Gerhard, Heinrichs, al., supply ἀρχιερεύς or ἱερεύς : but this it seems to me would stultify the argument.
