The other reading here, τετύχηκεν , is the true Attic form) <strong> a more excellent ministry</strong> (than that of any earthly priests), <strong> in proportion as</strong> (there is an ellipsis in the earlier clause of τοσούτῳ , which now lurks under the comparative: so in ch.

The meaning of <strong> μεσίτης</strong> , a later Greek word, is not far from that of ἔγγυος , one who becomes a goer between two persons, assuring to each the consent of the other to some point agreed on in common. The Atticists give us the Attic Greek for it, μεσέγγυος . Philo uses the title of Moses, οἷα μεσίτης κ . διαλλακτὴς … τὰς ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἔθνους ἐποιεῖτο . And so St. Paul, in ref. Gal. The genitive after μεσίτης may either be of the <em> persons between whom</em> , as in ref. 1 Tim., εἷς καὶ μεσίτης θεοῦ κ . ἀνθρώπων : or of <em> one of the parties concerned</em> , as in Jos. Antt. xvi. 2. 2, τῶν παρ ʼ Ἀγρίππα τινῶν ἐπιζητουμένων μεσίτης ἦν : or of the <em> object of the mediation</em> , the agreement or covenant, as Diod. Sic. iv. 54, μεσίτην γεγονότα τῶν ὁμολογιῶν ἐν Κόλχοις : Jos. Antt. iv. 6. 7, ταῦτα ὀμνύοντες ἔλεγον καὶ θεὸν μεσίτην ὧν ὑπισχνοῦντο ποιούμενοι . And in this last sense is the gen. here. Jesus is the mediator, between God and us) <strong> of a better covenant, of one which</strong> ( <strong> ἥτις</strong> , ‘ <em> quippe quæ</em> ,’ as always. This specific relative brings the thing referred to into its category, not only identifying it as ἡ would do, but classing it, and educing its property as belonging to the matter in hand: and thus having a ratiocinative force) <strong> has been laid down</strong> (see on ref. The word <strong> νόμος</strong> is also used of the new covenant by St. James, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:25">James 1:25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:12">James 2:12</span> ; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:12">James 4:12</span> , and St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:27">Romans 3:27</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:2">Romans 8:2</span> ; Rom 9:31 ) <strong> upon</strong> (on the condition of …: so Xen.

Theodoret says, ἡ μὲν γὰρ παλαιὰ διαθήκη σωματικὰς ἐπαγγελίας εἶχε συνεζευγμένας , γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα κ . μέλι … καὶ παίδων πλῆθος , κ . τὰ τούτοις προσόμοια · ἡ δὲ καινὴ ζωὴν αἰώνιον κ . οὐρανῶν βασιλείαν . And so Œc., Thl., Primas., Bengel, al. But as Bleek objects, it would be very improbable that the Writer should intend to refer the promises, on which the old covenant was based, to mere earthly blessings, in the face of such a designation of the hope of Abraham and the patriarchs as we find in ch. Heb 11:10-19 ).</p>
