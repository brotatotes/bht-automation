<p><strong> 20</strong> .] <strong> This is the blood of the testament</strong> (LXX, ἰδοὺ τὸ αἷμα τῆς διαθήκης . It has been suggested, first it would appear by Böhme, that the change has been made by the Writer after the tenor of the N. T. inauguration of the testament by our Lord, τοῦτο τὸ ποτήριον ἡ καινὴ διαθήκη ἐν τῷ αἵματί μου , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:20">Luke 22:20</span> , the only Gospel in which ἐστιν fails) <strong> which God</strong> (LXX, κύριος : changed apparently to preserve more completely the O. T. character of the saying) <strong> commanded</strong> (LXX διέθετο , which would seem at first sight more appropriate to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:16">Hebrews 9:16</span> . But ἐντέλλεσθαι διαθήκην is a common LXX expression elsewhere, see besides reff. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+4:13">Deuteronomy 4:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+29:1">Deuteronomy 29:1</span> ; Ps. 110:9; Jer 11:3 ) <strong> in regard to you</strong> (it is much disputed, how the logic of this passage can cohere: seeing that, how properly soever the latter διαθήκη may be spoken of and argued on as being a testament, the former one could have no such character, and consequently cannot be thus argued on. And the question is very variously answered according to the standing-point of different Commentators. Even such as Tholuck, Lünemann, and Bleek, question the applicability of the Writer’s argument. But, I believe, wrongly. The matter seems to stand thus. The word διαθήκη has the double sense of a covenant and a testament. Both these senses may be applied to both διαθῆκαι : to the latter more properly belongs the testamentary sense, but to the former also in as far as it was typical of and foreshadowed the other. In the latter, all is clear. Christ, the heir of all things, has bequeathed to us His people an everlasting inheritance; has died, sealing the testament with His blood. In the former all this is formally, though inadequately represented. The κληρονομία , faintly shadowed forth by temporal possessions, had yet a recognized blessed meaning far beyond those possessions: the testator was imperfectly, but still was formally represented by the animals slain in sacrifice: <em> there</em> was a death, <em> there</em> was a sprinkling of and sealing by blood: and surely it requires no more stretch of concession to acknowledge the victim in sacrifice to represent the Lamb of God in his sonship and his heritorship, than it does in his innocence and propitiatory power. The one idea is just as poorly and inadequately set forth by it as the other. But in both cases there is an inheritance, and in both it is the same. In both it is bequeathed: in the latter actually by One who has come in person and died: in the former, only typically, by the same One ceremonially present. So that, if our <strong> ὅθεν</strong> in Heb 9:18 were to be filled up, it would be, ‘Whence, i. e. since the former covenant also had its testamentary side, and thus was analogous to as well as typical of the latter.’

<p>The charge brought against the Writer on account of his transition of meaning in διαθήκη , is equally without foundation. He is thinking in Greek. In Greek, διαθήκη has these two meanings: not divided off from one another by any such line of demarcation as when expressed by two separate words, but both lying under one and the same word. What more common, or more ordinarily accepted, than to educe out of some one word its various shades of meaning, and argue on each separately as regards the matter in hand? Take the very word ‘Testament’ as an example. In our common parlance it now means a <em> book</em> : the <em> Old Testament</em> , the book of the former covenant, the <em> New Testament</em> , the book of the latter. But we do not therefore sink the other and deeper meaning; nay we rather insist on it, that it may not become lost in that other and more familiar one. I cannot see how the Writer’s method of procedure here differs essentially from this).</p>
