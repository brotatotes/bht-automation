The combination is not a rhetorical figure in the mind of the Writer, but a deep truth in the verity of God. The same Death which purifies us from guilt, makes us partakers of the kingdom of glory: the same Blood which cleanses us from sin, seals the testament of our inheritance.

<p>The fact that <em> almost</em> in all cases the law purified by blood, provides for such exceptions as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:10">Exodus 19:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+15:5">Leviticus 15:5</span> ff; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+16:26">Leviticus 16:26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+16:28">Leviticus 16:28</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+22:6">Leviticus 22:6</span> ; Num 31:22-24 ) <strong> according to the law</strong> (i. e. receive legal purification), <strong> and</strong> ( σχεδόν still rules the sentence: see above) <strong> apart from shedding of blood</strong> ( <strong> αἱματεκχυσία</strong> seems to be a word coined by the sacred Writer to express his meaning. There has been a question, whether it imports the shedding of blood in the slaughter of the victims, or the pouring out of the blood at the foot of the altar, so often enjoined in the ordinances of legal sacrifice. On this question I give the substance of Delitzsch’s remarks. “For the second of these meanings it may be alleged, 1. that the mere <em> shedding</em> of blood ( שְׁחִיטָה ) is an expression in the O. T. ritual by no means confined to sacrificial rites properly so called, in which the catching of the blood by the priest is the first step: 2. that ἐκχέειν τὸ αἷμα ( παρὰ or ἐπὶ τὴν βάσιν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου ) is the ordinary LXX expression for the usual שְׁפִיכָה (pouring out of the blood) in sin-offerings, while for the usual זְרִיקָה (sprinkling) in expiatory, peace, and whole burnt-offerings we have usually προσχέειν τὸ αἷμα ( ἐπὶ or πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον ), once περιχέειν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ch+29:22">2 Chronicles 29:22</span> , once at least ἐκχέειν , 4 Kings 16:15, Ed-vat. ( προσχ . [49] [50] ), and once προσεκχέειν , Exo 29:16 Ald. ( προσχ . [51] [52] ).… But still it is to me more probable that the Writer here has the <em> shedding of blood</em> in mind. It would not by any means follow, that he treats this blood-shedding as a propitiation. He does not directly call it the <em> medium</em> of forgiveness, he says only, that apart from it there was no remission, that it is the indispensable means to obtain the expiatory דַּם הַנֶּפֶשׁ , life’s blood.… That however which determines me to refer the αἱματεκχυσία to the <em> shedding</em> of blood, is not entirely the usage, as Bl., but the τὸ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ἐκχυνόμενον of the institution of the Lord’s Supper in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:20">Luke 22:20</span> (cf. Luk 11:50 ), at all events the close parallel in word and in thought to that. It is hardly probable that the Writer would mean an ἐκχέειν (- χύνειν ) αἷμα of which that so called on Christ’s part is not the antitype; not to say that since <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13">Hebrews 9:13</span> , αἷμα and θάνατος have been ideas most closely connected.” See this followed out much further in Delitzsch’s note) <strong> there cometh not</strong> (taketh not place) <strong> remission</strong> (viz. ἁμαρτιῶν : an expression occurring eight times in St. Luke and the Acts to once in St. Matt. and twice in St. Mark. As to the fact, Lev 17:11 sufficiently proves it: and the Rabbis deduced from that passage an axiom almost verbatim the same as our text: אֵין כַּפָּרָה אֶלָּא בַדָּם , “non est expiatio nisi per sanguinem.” The case of the poor man, who cannot afford the animal victim, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+5:11-13">Leviticus 5:11-13</span> , which seems to present an exception and to justify the application of the σχεδόν to this clause, is not counted as one by Delitzsch, but as merely a negative expression of the need of reconciliation. But I do not see how this can be said: see Heb 9:13 there).

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [49] The MS. referred to by this symbol is that commonly called the Alexandrine, or CODEX ALEXANDRINUS. It once belonged to Cyrillus Lucaris, patriarch of Alexandria and then of Constantinople, who in the year 1628 presented it to our King Charles I. It is now in the British Museum. It is on parchment in four volumes, of which three contain the Old, and one the New Testament, with the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians. This fourth volume is exhibited open in a glass case. It will be seen by the letters in the inner margin of this edition, that the first 24 chapters of Matthew are wanting in it, its first leaf commencing ὁ νυμφίος , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span> : as also the leaves containing ἵνα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:50">John 6:50</span> , to καὶ σύ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:52">John 8:52</span> . It is generally agreed that it was written at Alexandria; it does not, however, <em> in the Gospels</em> , represent that commonly known as the Alexandrine text, but approaches much more nearly to the Constantinopolitan, or generally received text. The New Testament, according to its text, was edited, in uncial types cast to imitate those of the MS., by Woide, London, 1786, the Old Testament by Baber, London, 1819: and its N.T. text has now been edited in common type by Mr. B. H. Cowper, London, 1861. The date of this MS. has been variously assigned, but it is now pretty generally agreed to be the <em> fifth century</em> .

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [50] The CODEX VATICANUS, No. 1209 in the Vatican Library at Rome; and proved, by the old catalogues, to have been there from the foundation of the library in the 16th century. It was apparently, from internal evidence, copied in Egypt. It is on vellum, and contains the Old and New Testaments. In the latter, it is deficient from Heb 9:14 to the end of the Epistle; it does not contain the Epistles to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon; nor the Apocalypse. An edition of this celebrated codex, undertaken as long ago as 1828 by Cardinal Angelo Mai, has since his death been published at Rome. The defects of this edition are such, that it can hardly be ranked higher in usefulness than a tolerably complete collation, entirely untrustworthy in those places where it differs from former collations in representing the MS. as <em> agreeing with</em> the received text. An 8vo edition of the N.T. portion, newly revised by Vercellone, was published at Rome in 1859 (referred to as ‘Verc’): and of course superseded the English reprint of the 1st edition. Even in this 2nd edition there were imperfections which rendered it necessary to have recourse to the MS. itself, and to the partial collations made in former times. These are (1) that of Bartolocci (under the name of Giulio de St. Anastasia), once librarian at the Vatican, made in 1669, and preserved in manuscript in the Imperial Library (MSS. Gr. Suppl. 53) at Paris (referred to as ‘Blc’); (2) that of Birch (‘Bch’), published in various readings to the Acts and Epistles, Copenhagen, 1798, Apocalypse, 1800, Gospels, 1801; (3) that made for the great Bentley (‘Btly’), by the Abbate Mico, published in Ford’s Appendix to Woide’s edition of the Codex Alexandrinus, 1799 (it was made on the margin of a copy of Cephalæus’ Greek Testament, Argentorati, 1524, still amongst Bentley’s books in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge); (4) notes of alterations by the original scribe and other correctors. These notes were procured for Bentley by the Abbé de Stosch, and were till lately supposed to be lost. They were made by the Abbate Rulotta (‘Rl’), and are preserved amongst Bentley’s papers in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge (B. 17. 20) 1 . The Codex has been occasionally consulted for the verification of certain readings by Tregelles, Tischendorf, and others. A list of readings examined at Rome by the present editor (Feb. 1861), and by the Rev. E. C. Cure, Fellow of Merton College, Oxford (April 1862), will be found at the end of these prolegomena. A description, with an engraving from a photograph of a portion of a page, is given in Burgon’s “Letters from Rome,” London 1861. This most important MS. was probably written in the <em> fourth century</em> (Hug, Tischendorf, al.).
