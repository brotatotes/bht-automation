<p><strong> 13</strong> .] <strong> Let no one when tempted</strong> (in the manner hitherto spoken of through the chapter. There is no warrant for changing in the slightest degree the reference of the word. The ‘tentatio’ is a trying of the man by the solicitation of evil: whether that evil be the terror of external danger, or whatever it be, all πειράζεσθαι by means of it arises not from God, but from ourselves our own ἐπιθυμία . God ordains the temptation, overrules the temptation, but does not tempt, is not the spring of the solicitation to sin) <strong> say that</strong> ( ὅτι recitantis) <strong> I am tempted from God</strong> (by agency proceeding out and coming from God: very different from <strong> ὑπὸ</strong> θεοῦ , which would represent God as the agent: as indeed He is in πειράζει δὲ αὐτὸς οὐδένα below. See Winer, § 47 <em> b. b</em> note. Thus the man would transfer his own responsibility to God. There does not seem to be any allusion to the fatalism of the Pharisees, as Schnecken-burger, al. seem to think: the fault is one of common life, and is alluded to Sir 15:11 , μὴ εἴπῃς ὅτι διὰ κύριον ἀπέστην ): <strong> for God is unversed in things evil</strong> (the meaning usually given, “ <em> untempted</em> ,” or “ <em> not able to be tempted</em> ,” is against the usage of the word. It occurs in four forms, ἀπείρᾶτος , ἀπείρᾶτος , ἀπείρητος (Ion.), and ἀπείραστος ; and in all of them seems to have but two meanings: 1. <em> that has not been tried</em> : so οὐδὲν ἀπείρατόν ἐστί τινι , Dem. p. 310; πόντος ἀπείρατος ὢν τοῖς Ἕλλησι , Luc. Tox. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:2">James 3:2</span> . <em> that has not tried</em> : so οὐκ ἀπείρατος καλῶν , Pind. Ol. 10 (11). 18; ἀλλοδαπῶν οὐκ ἀπείρατοι δόμοι , id. Nem. 1. 33; κακῶν ἀπείρατος (that has never experienced adversity), Plut. παῤῥησίας , ἔρωτος ἀπείρατος , unversed in free speaking, in love, Lucian, Plut. See Palm and Rost’s Lex., and numerous other examples in Wetstein. And even if we chose here to depart from usage, and suppose that ἀπείραστος is not a later form of ἀπείρατος , but a verbal from πειράζω , to be interpreted by the meaning of that verb in the context, we should get a meaning for ἀπείραστος entirely foreign from the context: viz. that God is not tempted of evil, whereas there is no question here of God <em> being tempted</em> , but or God <em> tempting</em> . Some have endeavoured to escape this by giving ἀπείραστος an active sense “God is not one who tempteth to evil.” So Schol. in Cramer’s Catena: ὅτι ὁ θεὸς πειράζων ἐπ ʼ ὠφελείᾳ , οὐκ ἐπὶ τῷ κακοποιῆσαι · διὸ καὶ ἐλέχθη ὅτι ὁ θεὸς ἀπείραστός ἐστι κακῶν : so the Æthiopic version: the vulg., “Deus intentator malorum est:” Luther, al. This doubtless it <em> may have</em> : we find μηροὶ καλυπτῆς ἐξέκειντο πιμελῆς , Soph. Ant. 1011: τὠμῷ τἀνδρὶ μεμπτός , id. Trach. 446: ὕποπτος Τρωϊκῆς ἁλώσεως , Eur. Hec. 1117. But there are two objections: 1. that this sense would be tautological, the succeeding clause only repeating the assertion: 2. that thus the gen. κακῶν can only mean ‘of evil men:’ ‘God is no tempter of evil men,’ which is out of the question. It seems then that we must take refuge in the ordinary meaning of the word, and render it ‘ <em> unversed in</em> ,’ ‘having no experience of.’ And thus De Wette and Huther. Œc. takes the words as in the citation from Plutarch above: τὸ θεῖόν τε καὶ μακάριον οὔτε αὐτὸ πράγματα ἔχει , οὔτε ἑτέροις παρέχει : which is decidedly wrong. Taken as above, ἀπείραστος does not carry a negation of πειράζει , but forms a paronomasia with it: and the sentiment is just as in the passage of Sir. above quoted, which goes on πᾶν βδέλυγμα ἐμίσησεν κύριος ), <strong> but</strong> (the <strong> δέ</strong> takes up the contrast again from πειράζομαι : ‘not so, but.’ I may observe that the <strong> δέ</strong> is against the ordinary acceptation of ἀπείραστος , on which it ought to be καί ) <strong> HE tempteth no man</strong> (the <strong> αὐτός</strong> does not, as commonly supposed, bring out God’s action in distinction to His not being tempted ‘as He is not tempted, so neither does He himself tempt any man’ (see this urged in Wiesinger): but brings out this, that the temptation indeed takes place, but from another cause. Huther gives the sense well: “Let none say when he is tempted to evil, From God am I tempted: for God hath no part in evil: but as to the temptation, He tempteth no man” &amp;c.):</p>
