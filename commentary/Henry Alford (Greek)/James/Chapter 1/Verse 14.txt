<p><strong> 14</strong> .] <strong> but each man is tempted, being</strong> (slightly causal, ‘in that he is’) <strong> drawn out and enticed by his own lust</strong> (the image, if we are justified in supposing that a fixed one was contemplated from the first, seems to be, as Pott observes (in Huther), “ ἐπιθυμία , ἁμαρτία , et θάνατος personarum vim habent: imaginem meretricis suppeditant voces συλλαβεῖν , τίκτειν , ἀποκύειν , necnon et ἐξέλκειν atque δελεάζειν .” The participles <strong> ἐξελκόμενος</strong> and <strong> δελεαζόμενος</strong> are abundantly illustrated by the Commentators, e. g. in Wetst. by Xen. Mem. ii. 1. 4, τὰ … ζῶα .… τούτων γὰρ δήπου τὰ μὲν γαστρὶ δελεαζόμενα … τῇ ἐπιθυμίᾳ τοῦ φαγεῖν ἀγόμενα πρὸς τὸ δέλεαρ , ἁλίσκεται . And Herod. ii. 70, of taking the crocodile, ἐπεὰν νῶτον ὑὸς δελεάσῃ περὶ ἄγκιστρον κ . τ . λ .… ὁ κροκόδειλος … ἐπεὰν ἐξελκυσθῇ ἐς γῆν κ . τ . λ . Schneckenburger says, “ ἐξέλκειν et δελεάζειν sunt verba e re venatoria et piscatoria in rem amatoriam et inde in nostrum tropum translata:” only we must not here interpret ἐξέλκειν which precedes δελεαζ ., as in Herod. above, “to draw to land,” but rather as Schulthess, “elicere bestias ex tuto, ubi latent, in locum hamis retibusque expositum.” But, as Huther observes, it is hardly likely that the original reference of the words would be distinctly before the Apostle as he used them. Cf. Aristot. Polit. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:10">James 1:10</span> , παρὰ τῆς γυναικὸς ἐξελκυσθείς , “ab uxore sollicitatus.” In the Test. XII. Patrum, p. 702 (Kypke), Joseph says of Potiphar’s wife, εἰς πορνείαν με ἐφελκύσατο . And cf. Homer’s αὐτὸς γὰρ ἐφέλκεται ἄνδρα σίδηρος , Od. π . 294: and, which is the nearest correspondence of all, Plut. de Sera Numinis Vindicta (in Huther), τὸ γλυκὺ τῆς ἐπιθυμίας ὥσπερ δέλεαρ ἐξέλκειν ( ἀνθρώπους ). With regard to the matter treated, and the proper sense of <strong> ἐπιθυμία</strong> here, it seems to me that Huther is right in setting aside the difficulties which Hofmann (Schriftb. i. p. 415) and after him Wiesinger, have found in this passage as compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span> . St. James is not here speaking of the <em> original</em> source of sin in man, but of the actual source of temptation to sin, when it occurs. The ἁμαρτία of St. Paul, the sinful principle in man, is not here in question: we take up the matter, so to speak, lower down the stream: and the ἐπιθυμία here is the ἐπιθυμία there, itself the effect of sin (abstr.) in the members, and leading to sin (concrete) in the conduct):</p>
