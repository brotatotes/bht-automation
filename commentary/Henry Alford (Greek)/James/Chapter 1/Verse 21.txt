<p><strong> 21</strong> .] <strong> Wherefore</strong> (consequence from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:20">James 1:20</span> ; seeing that ὀργή excludes you from having a share in the righteous work of God) <strong> putting off</strong> (reff.: aor., because it must be done as a single act, antecedently to that which follows. The previous putting off is the condition of the subsequent reception) <strong> all filthiness</strong> ( <strong> ῥυπαρία</strong> is here figurative, as ῥυπαρός and ῥυπαρεύω in ref. Rev.: in the other reff. the word occurs in its literal sense. Some Commentators take it here as standing alone: Others join it with καὶ περισσείαν , as belonging to the genitive κακίας , which seems better for the context, which concerns not the putting away of moral pollution of all kinds, but only of that kind which belongs to κακία : see below. And thus taken it will mean that κακία pollutes the soul, and renders it unfit to receive the ἔμφυτος λόγος . It is very possible that the agricultural similitude in ἔμφυτος may have influenced the choice of both these words, ῥυπαρία and περισσεία . The ground must be ridded of all that pollutes and chokes it, before the seed can sink in and come to maturity: must be cleaned and cleared) <strong> and abundance</strong> (“ <em> superfluity</em> ” is perhaps too strong; it is, if the above figure be allowed, the rank growth, the abundant crop. Beza, Erasm. Schmid, al. take it as = περίσσωμα , “excrementum;” Pott, Schneckenb., De Wette, al., as “ <em> efflorescence</em> ,” as Lösner, “ramos in vite vel arbore abundantes, falceque resecandos;” Michaelis, al. take it as the remnant of κακία surviving from old times = περίσσευμα <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:8">Mark 8:8</span> . But the usual meaning seems preferable, as being both philologically correct, and suiting in its simplicity the solemn character of the exhortation) <strong> of malignity</strong> (evil disposition towards one another, as in reff. The word carries on the ὀργή above: which springs from (see note on ref. Eph.) <strong> κακία</strong> , evil disposition, which is inherent in our hearts, and requires putting off before we can receive the word of God. That this is so, is evident from ἐν πραΰτητι which follows. However the exhortation may apply in the wider sense, it is not its sense here, as the context plainly shews), <strong> in mildness</strong> (towards one another, reff.: not “modestia et facilitas mentis ad discendum composita,” Calv., nor “docili animo,” Grot., al.: see above on κακία ) <strong> receive</strong> (cf. reff. and παραδέχονται , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:20">Mark 4:20</span> , of the good ground) <strong> the implanted word</strong> (the word spoken of is beyond doubt the same as the λόγος ἀληθείας above i. e. the gospel, in its fulness. But the epithet makes some little difficulty. First of all, it clearly is not, as Œc. seems to take it, “innate:” τὸν διακριτικὸν τοῦ βελτίονος καὶ τοῦ χείρονος , δι ʼ ὃ καὶ λογικοὶ ἐσμὲν καὶ λεγόμεθα : and so in the Apostolical Constt. viii. 12, νόμον δέδωκας ἔμφυτον , for this would stultify δέξασθε , we having it already. Nor must ἔμφυτος be taken as proleptic, “ita ut inseratur,” as Calvin, Semler, De Wette (but doubtfully), al. Nor again can it mean ‘the word which has been planted in the whole of Christendom,’ seeing that individuals are here being dealt with: but the allusion is apparently to the parable of the sower, and it is the word implanted (= which has been sown), the word whose attribute and ἀρετή it is to be ἔμφυτος , and which is ἔμφυτος , awaiting your reception of it to spring up and take up your being into it and make you new plants), <strong> which is able to save your souls</strong> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span> , where the εὐαγγέλιον is said to be δύναμις θεοῦ εἰς σωτηρίαν παντὶ τῷ πιστεύοντι . “Magnificum cœlestis doctrinæ encomium, quod certam ex ea salutem consequimur. Est autem additum, ut sermonem illum instar thesauri incomparabilis et expetere et amare et magnificare discamus. Est ergo acris ad castigandam nostram ignaviam stimulus, sermonem cui solemus tam negligenter aures præbere, salutis nostræ esse causam. Tametsi non in hunc finem servandi vis sermoni adscribitur, quasi aut salus in externo vocis sonitu inclusa foret, aut servandi munus Deo ablatum alio transferretur. Nam de sermone tractat Jacobus, qui fide in corda hominum penetravit: et tantum indicat, Deum salutis auctorem evangelio suo eam peragere.” Calvin. Observe <strong> ψυχάς</strong> . It is the ψυχή which carries the personality of the man: which is between the πνεῦμα drawing it upwards, and the σάρξ drawing it downwards, and is saved or lost, passes into life or death, according to the choice between these two. And the λόγος ἔμφυτος , working through the πνεῦμα and by the divine πνεῦμα , is a spiritual agency, able to save the ψυχή . And <strong> σῶσαι</strong> , the aor., because the power is to complete the work and to have done it for ever).</p>
