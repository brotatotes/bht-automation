These asyndeta are found in our Epistle especially, where various particulars are enumerated which go to make up a whole, or apply to the description of one thing: as e. g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:19">James 1:19</span> , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:6">James 3:6</span> ; cf. also ch.

They, by their new birth unto God, are taken out of the world; but at the same time, by sin still dwelling in them, are ever liable to be enticed and polluted by it: and therefore must keep themselves (cf. 1Ti 6:14 ), for fear of such pollution. This keeping is indeed in the higher sense God’s work: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span> ; but it is also our work, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:22">1 Timothy 5:22</span> .
