<p><strong> 8</strong> .] <strong> He is a man with two minds, unstable</strong> (cf. Dio Chrys. above. Hippocrates uses it of fevers which observe no fixed periods: Demosth. p. 303, of the wind, ἀκατάστατον ὥσπερ ἐν θαλάττῃ πνεῦμα . We have, ἀκαταστασία ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:16">James 3:16</span> , and in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:9">Luke 21:9</span> ; 1Co 14:33 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:5">2 Corinthians 6:5</span> ; 2Co 12:20 ) <strong> in all his ways</strong> (such is the best way of taking this sentence, making it all predicate and all to apply to ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος as its subject. The common way, to take ἀνὴρ δίψυχος as a new subject, as E. V., “a double-minded man is unstable,” has this against it, that it makes the very unusual word δίψυχος , found here and in ch. Jam 4:8 for the first time in Greek literature, to be a mere usual epithet and word of passage. Another way, taken by Beza, al., is to make ἀνὴρ δίψυχος , ἀκατάστ . κ . τ . λ ., <em> all subject</em> , and in apposition with ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος , “ut qui sit animo duplici,” &amp;c. There is no objection to this, but that it does not so well suit the abrupt and predicative style of St. James. How De Wette can say that it would require the article, I cannot imagine: the art. would be only admissible in two cases: 1. if ( ὁ ) ἀνήρ were subject, and δίψυχος , ἀκατάστ .… predicate; 2. on the rendering of the E. V., “The (a) double-minded man (generic) is,” &amp;c. But then we should surely not have ἀνήρ , but ἄνθρωπος . From this passage the use of <strong> δίψυχος</strong> spread onwards in the Fathers: we have very early, in the Apostol. Constt. vii. 11, μὴ γίνου δίψυχος ἐν προσευχῇ εἰ ἔσται ἢ οὔ : in Clem.-rom. i. 23, p. 260, ταλαίπωροί εἰσιν οἱ δίψυχοι , οἱ διστάζοντες τὴν ψυχήν . The διακρίνεσθαι arises out of the διψυχία : this causes him, as Sir 2:12 , ἐπιβαίνειν ἐπὶ δύο τρίβους . Cf. also Sir 1:27 , μὴ ἀπειθήσῃς φόβῳ κυρίου , καὶ μὴ προσέλθῃς αὐτῷ ἐν καρδίᾳ δισσῇ , and Tanchuma Rabba in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+26:17">Deuteronomy 26:17</span> , “Ne habeant (qui preces ad Deum facere velint) duo corda, unum ad Deum, aliud vero ad aliam rem directum”).</p>
