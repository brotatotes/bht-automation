<p><strong> 10</strong> .] <em> The fact of transgression of this law is proved</em> by its <em> solidarity</em> , not admitting of being broken in one point and yet kept in the whole. “Hoc tantum sibi vult,” says Calvin, “Deum nolle cum exceptione coli, neque ita partiri nobiscum, ut nobis liceat si quid minus allubescit, ex ejus lege resecare.” <strong> For whosoever shall have kept</strong> (reff.) <strong> the whole law, but shall have offended</strong> (stumbled) <strong> in</strong> (the matter of: as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:2">James 3:2</span> ; see there) <strong> one thing</strong> (one thing enjoined, one commandment, as by and by explained: not as Schulthess, ἑνὶ ἀνθρώπῳ ; nor as Œc., al., τοῦτο περὶ ἀγάπης εἴρηκε (so the Schol.-Matthæi, ἐν ἑνὶ πταίσειν ἐστί , τὸ μὴ τελείαν ἔχειν ἀγάπην ): nor is it to be limited to commandments carrying capital punishment, as Grot., al. It is better to understand ἐντάλματι than νόμῳ (as De W., Wies., Huther, al.), seeing that νόμος here is evidently used collectively for the sum of the commandments, and so πάντων τῶν νόμων could not be said), <strong> has become guilty</strong> (brought into the condemning power of, involved in, see reff. The more usual construction is to put the <em> punishment</em> , in which a man is involved, in the genitive, as in reff. Matt. and Mark: sometimes in the dative, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:21">Matthew 5:21</span> f. The classical construction is to put both the crime and the punishment in the dative: so ἔνοχος τῇ προδοσίᾳ , Demosth.: τῇ γραφῇ , δίκαις , ὀνείδει , &amp;c., Plato, Xen. Sometimes however we have the gen.: as ἔνοχος λειποταξίου , Demosth.
