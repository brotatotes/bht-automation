T., in conjurations or vituperations: e. g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:1">Romans 2:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:3">Romans 2:3</span> ; Rom 9:20 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:20">1 Timothy 6:20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:1">Galatians 3:1</span> ; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:25">Luke 24:25</span> ; Act 13:10 ) <strong> empty</strong> (void of knowledge and seriousness: content with a dead and bootless notion: κενὸν ἐκάλεσεν ἄνθρωπον τὸν ψιλῇ τῇ πίστει αὐχοῦντα , μηδὲν τῆς διὰ τῶν ἔργων ὑποστάσεως κεκτημένον εἰς πλήρωσιν , Œc.) <strong> man</strong> (so in Rom 9:20 ), <strong> that faith</strong> (here abstract: all faith, faith αὐτὸ καθ ʼ αὑτό : not merely πίστις , faith, in any supposed case) <strong> separate from works</strong> (here again, <strong> τὰ ἔργα</strong> , abstract; and therefore, in subordination to the former abstract noun, the works which belong to it, which might be expected from it) <strong> is idle</strong> (bootless, without result: see reff.

The idea is much the same if we read νεκρά ; but seeing that none read ἀργή in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:17">James 2:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:26">James 2:26</span> , and it was hardly likely that the easy νεκρά here would be changed into the difficult ἀργή , this latter is beyond reasonable doubt the genuine reading) <strong> ?</strong></p>
