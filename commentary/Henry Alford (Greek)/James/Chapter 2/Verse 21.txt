No other meaning will satisfy the connexion, inevitable to any intelligent reader, between this <strong> ἐδικαιώθη</strong> and the σῶσαι of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:14">James 2:14</span> ; which again is connected with the μέλλοντες κρίνεσθαι of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:12">James 2:12</span> . Commentators have endeavoured to evade this full meaning, in various ways. Thus e. g. Calvin, “Notanda est hæc amphibologia; justificandi verbum Paulo esse gratuitam justitiæ imputationem apud Dei tribunal: Jacobo autem esse demonstrationem justitiæ ab effectis, idque apud homines, quemadmodum ex superioribus verbis colligere licet: ostende mihi fidem tuam” &amp;c. It is manifest, that by such “amphibology,” any difficulties whatever may be explained away. On the difficulty itself, see in the Prolegomena) <strong> by</strong> (out of, as the ground of the justification: precisely as St. Paul so constantly uses the phrase δικαιοῦσθαι ἐκπίστεως ) <strong> works</strong> (the category to which the ground of his justification belonged. It was one especial work, in matter of fact: and that work, itself springing out of preeminent faith) <strong> when he offered</strong> (not, as E.V., al., “ <em> had</em> offered:” the aor. part., as so often, is synchronous with the aor. itself in the same sentence. <strong> ἀναφέρω</strong> in this reference with <strong> ἐπί</strong> is not ‘to offer up in sacrifice,’ but simply to offer, to bring as a sacrifice to the altar: whether the entire ‘offering up’ takes place or not. Where it did take place, the general meaning may be given: where it did not, as here, the particular one must be kept. Cf. 1Pe 2:24 ) <strong> Isaac his son at the altar?</strong></p>
