<p><strong> 22</strong> .] <strong> Thou seest</strong> (better not a question: in which case the καί of Jam 2:23 does not follow so naturally as when we couple the direct verb βλέπεις with the direct verb ἐπληρώθη ) <strong> that</strong> (not, “ <em> how</em> ,” as E.V.: it is not the manner in which, nor even “how” in the sense of ‘ <em> how that</em> ,’ which is meant. The assertion is, that the inference is indubitable, that the fact was as stated) <strong> faith</strong> (the art. is abstract here, not possessive, as αὐτοῦ being expressed below shews) <strong> wrought</strong> (at the time, ‘was working,’ imperf.) <strong> with his works</strong> ( <strong> τοῖς ἕργοις</strong> again categorical, the work in the example being but one), <strong> and by</strong> ( <em> out of</em> , as the ground and source) <strong> works</strong> (again categorical; the general proposition proved by the particular case. Doubtless this second time it <em> might be</em> ‘by his works, his faith,’ &amp;c.: but the other is more like St. James, who is singularly given to introduce abstract propositions as applicable to particular cases) <strong> faith</strong> (see above) <strong> was made complete</strong> (in one act, once for all: not imperf. as συνήργει , but aor.: not, as again many Commentators, even Bengel and De Wette, and so Calvin, “quod vera esse inde comprobetur;” an impossible meaning, and very far from the context of the Apostle’s argument; which is, that faith is developed and brought to perfection by obedience: see below on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:26">James 2:26</span> . And hence also is it evident, how faith συνήργει τοῖς ἔργοις ἀυτοῦ . By the Apostle’s own comparison, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:26">James 2:26</span> , faith is the body, obedience the spirit: faith without obedience is dead, until obedience, the spirit, sets faith in motion: then faith, like the limbs of the body, moves with and works with the acts of obedience. Which is prior in time, which the ground of the other, is a point not touched by St. James at all. Pool collects well in his Synops. ad loc., the opinions of others: “Opera autem fidem perficiunt ratione operationis et consummationis, quum per opera fides ad maturitatem pervenit, quomodo arbor perfecta sit quum ita excrevit ut fructum ferat, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+17:8">Numbers 17:8</span> ; et peccatum perficitur, Jac. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:15">James 1:15</span> , quum in habitum evasit … Fides tum demum consummata redditur, postquam bonos fructus protulit.” But when he goes on to say, “Fides est causa: opera, effectus. Causa autem non perficitur a suo effectu, sed perfecta declaratur: ut fructus boni arborem bonum non efficiunt, sed indicant,” he is travelling out of the record, and giving meanings unknown to this passage):</p>
