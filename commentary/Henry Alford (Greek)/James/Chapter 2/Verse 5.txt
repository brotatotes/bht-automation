<p><strong> 5</strong> .] <strong> Listen, my beloved brethren</strong> (bespeaking attention to that which follows, as shewing them in a marked manner the sin of their προσωπολημψία ), <strong> Did not God choose out</strong> (in His proceeding, namely, in the promulgation of the gospel by Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span> ff.: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:20">Luke 6:20</span> . See also 1Co 1:27 ) <strong> the poor</strong> ( <strong> τούς</strong> , as a class, set against <strong> οἱ</strong> πλούσιοι as a class, below) <strong> as regards the world</strong> (reff.: or, those who in the world’s estimation are accounted poor; but the dative of reference is most likely here, as in παιδία ταῖς φρεσίν , and the like) <strong> rich in faith</strong> (i. e. to be rich in faith, or so that they are rich in faith: the words are not in apposition with τοὺς πτωχούς , as Erasmus, al., but form a predicatory specification of them. <strong> ἐν πίστει</strong> , as the element, <em> the world</em> , so to speak, <em> in which they pass for rich</em> , as in ref. 1 Tim.: not as the material of which their riches consist, as in ref. Eph. Wiesinger well says, “Not the measure of <em> faith</em> , in virtue of which one man is richer than another, is before the Writer’s mind, but the <em> substance</em> of the faith, by virtue of which substance every believer is rich. The riches are the treasures of salvation, and especially, owing to the following κληρονόμους , the sonship in God’s family.” And similarly Calvin, “Non qui fidei magnitudine abundant, sed quos Deus variis Spiritus sui donis locupletavit, quæ fide percipimus”), <strong> and heirs of the kingdom which He promised</strong> ( Luk 12:31-32 al.) <strong> to them that love Him?</strong></p>
