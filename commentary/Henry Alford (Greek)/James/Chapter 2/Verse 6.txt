This is his first argument. Now, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:6-7">James 2:6-7</span> , he brings in another, deduced from the conduct of rich men towards Christians and towards Christ Himself). <strong> Do not the rich</strong> (opposed as a class, to τοὺς πτωχούς above. This serves to shew that ὁ πλούσιος , when generally spoken of in the Epistle, as e. g. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:10">James 1:10</span> , is not the Christian rich man, but the rich man as such, in his worldliness and enmity to God) <strong> oppress you</strong> (see ref.

The term implies violence) <strong> to courts of judgment</strong> (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:6">James 5:6</span> , κατεδικάσατε , ἐφονεύσατε τὸν δίκαιον . The words may refer either to persecutions, or to oppressive law-suits; or perhaps to both, as Apollinarius in the Catena, τοῦτο μὲν οἱ τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἄρχοντες , ἐκ τῶν καρποφοριῶν πλουτοῦντες · τοῦτο δὲ καὶ οἱ τὰ Ῥωμαίων διοικοῦντες πράγματα , εἰδωλολατροῦντες τότε .
