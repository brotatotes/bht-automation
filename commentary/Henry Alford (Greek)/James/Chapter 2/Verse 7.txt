<p><strong> 7</strong> .] <strong> Is it not they that</strong> (on <strong> αὐτοί</strong> , see above) <strong> blaspheme</strong> (actually and literally, in words, it being, as we have maintained throughout, ungodly and heathens who are pointed at. Those who maintain them to be Christian rich men, would understand <strong> βλασφημεῖν</strong> , to disgrace by their lives: but apart from other objections, Huther has remarked well, that when the verb is thus used, it is ordinarily in the passive with διὰ , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:24">Romans 2:24</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:5">Titus 2:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:2">2 Peter 2:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:5">Isaiah 52:5</span> , not as a direct active governing a case, which is far more naturally taken in its literal sense) <strong> the goodly name which was called on you</strong> (i. e. which when you were admitted into Christ’s Church by baptism was made yours, so that you are called χριστοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:23">1 Corinthians 3:23</span> (not necessarily χριστιανοί : no particular form of the appropriation of the name is alluded to, but only the fact of the name being called over them. The appellation may or may not have been in use at this time, for aught that this shews). The name is of course that of <em> Christ</em> : not that of “God,” as Storr and Schulthess, nor that of “brethren,” as some. On the phrase ἐπικληθὲν ἐφ ʼ, see, besides reff., Deu 28:10 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ch+7:14">2 Chronicles 7:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:1">Isaiah 4:1</span> ; also Gen 48:16 )? So that if ye thus dishonour the poor in comparison with the rich, you are, 1. contravening the standard of honour which God sets up in His dealings: 2. opposing your own interest: 3. helping to blaspheme the name of Christ.</p>
