Keen, Schneckenburger, al. try to make μέντοι mean “ <em> igitur</em> ,” which it never can: see reff.) <strong> if ye fulfil</strong> (emphasis on <strong> τελεῖτε</strong> , as put before the epithet; if ye really choose to <em> fulfil</em> in its completeness that law) <strong> the royal law</strong> (the law which is the king of all laws, as the old saying makes law itself king of all: νόμος πάντων βασιλεύς .
