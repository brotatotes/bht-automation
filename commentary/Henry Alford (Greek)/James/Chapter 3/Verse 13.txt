<p><strong> 13</strong> .] <strong> Who is</strong> (cf. the similar question in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+33:12">Psalms 33:12</span> , τίς ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος ὁ θέλων ζωὴν κ . τ . λ .; παῦσον τὴν γλῶσσάν σου ἀπὸ κακοῦ κ . τ . λ .) <strong> wise and a man of knowledge</strong> (the same adjectives are joined in reff. It is not easy to mark the difference, if any is here intended. Wiesinger says, “ <strong> σοφός</strong> is a general term for the normal habit as regards intelligence, cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:5">James 1:5</span> ; while <strong> ἐπιστήμων</strong> denotes the practical insight which in any given case judges rightly and teaches the right way to put σοφία in practice.” Rather would it follow the general analogy of the words to regard σοφία as denoting general ability backed by knowledge, ἐπιστήμη as acquaintance with particular facts and departments of knowledge. The <strong> σοφός</strong> is an able man, the <strong> ἐπιστήμων</strong> a well-informed man. But the distinction must be very uncertain: for while Plato says, Rep. 5. p. 477 B, ἐπιστήμη ἐπὶ τῷ ὄντι πέφυκε γνῶναι ὡς ἔστι τὸ ὄν , in the Phædrus, p. 96 B, he says again, οἱ σοφοὶ ἐπιστήμῃ σοφοί εἰσιν … ἐπιστήμη ἄρα σοφία ἐστίν ) <strong> among you? Let him shew</strong> (aor. because referring to each individual ἔργον when performed, rather than to his general habit) <strong> out of</strong> (ref.: to which passage and its reasoning the Apostle seems again to be referring. The σοφία and ἐπιστήμη would be dead without this exhibition, as faith without works) <strong> his good conduct</strong> (in life: see reff.) <strong> his works</strong> (the good conduct is the general manifestation: the works, the particular results of that general manifestation. The sum of both makes up the ἔργα in the former case, ch. 2.) <strong> in meekness of wisdom</strong> (an adverbial clause belonging to δειξάτω : not to be tamed down into πραεία σοφία as Beza, Grot., al., nor into πραΰτης σοφή as Laurentius: meekness is the attribute, σοφία the character to which it belongs: ‘in that meekness which is the proper attribute of wisdom’).</p>
