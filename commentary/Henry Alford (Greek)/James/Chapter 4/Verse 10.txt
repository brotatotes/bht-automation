Jam 1:7 ), <strong> and He shall exalt you</strong> (both here and hereafter: by His grace and counsel here (not exactly as Grot., who is too external throughout this passage, “Sublimes facie <em> donis suis</em> ”) to the hidden glory of His waiting children, and by His fruition and presence hereafter ( <strong> ἐν καιρῷ</strong> as 1Pe 5:6 ) to the ineffable glory of His manifested children.
