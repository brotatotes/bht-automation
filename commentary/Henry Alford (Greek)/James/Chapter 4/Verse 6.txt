<p><strong> 6</strong> .] <strong> But He</strong> (God, by His Holy Spirit dwelling in us, the same subject as in the previous sentence) <strong> gives the more grace</strong> (the more and greater, for this longing and jealous desire): <strong> wherefore he saith</strong> (the Spirit, again: for it is the same Spirit who is implanted in us that speaks in Scripture. This is better than to supply ‘the Scripture;’ far better than to take λέγει impersonally, “it is written,” as Kern), <strong> God</strong> ( <strong> κύριος</strong> , LXX: and the same variation is found where the words are again cited in 1Pe 5:5 ) <strong> is set against the proud</strong> (reff.), <strong> but giveth grace to the lowly</strong> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:16">Romans 12:16</span> . This is a proof that the ambitious and restless after worldly honours and riches, are God’s enemies, whereas the humble and lowly are the objects of His gifts of ever-increasing grace. The inference follows in the shape of <em> solemn exhortation</em> ( Jam 4:7-10 )).</p>
