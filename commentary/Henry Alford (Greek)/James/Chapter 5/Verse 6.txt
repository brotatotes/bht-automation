<p><strong> 6</strong> .] <em> Third class of sins: condemning the innocent</em> . <strong> Ye condemned, ye murdered the just man</strong> (these words are probably spoken generally, the singular being collective. τὸν <strong> δίκαιον</strong> , not merely τὸν ἀθῷον ; it is his justice itself which provokes the enmity and cruelty of the πλούσιοι . It has been usual to refer these words to the condemnation and execution of Christ. So Œc., ἀναντιῤῥήτως τό , ἐφονεύσατε τὸν δίκαιον , ἐπὶ τὸν χριστὸν ἀναφέρεται . τῇ μέντοι ἐπιφορᾷ , τῇ , οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται ὑμῖν , ἐκοίνωσε τὸν λόγον καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἄλλους τοὺς τὰ ὅμοια παρὰ τῶν Ἰουδαίων παθόντας . ἴσως δὲ καὶ προφητικῶς τὸ περὶ ἑαυτὸν ὑπεμφαίνει πάθος . So Bed [15] , at some length; Grot., al. But there is surely nothing in the context to indicate this, further than that such a particular case may be included in the general charge, as its most notorious example. I cannot see, with Huther, how the <em> present</em> <strong> ἀντιτάσσεται</strong> makes against this: for anyhow we must suppose a change of sense before the <em> present</em> can be introduced: and then it may as well be a description of Christ’s patient endurance, or of His present long-suffering, as of the present meekness of the (generic) δίκαιος . But I prefer the latter, and with it the other reference throughout): <strong> he</strong> (the δίκαιος ; Bentley more ingeniously than happily conjectured ὁ κύριος , as an emendation for οὐκ ) <strong> doth not resist you</strong> (the behaviour of the just under your persecutions is ever that of meekness and submission. “ <strong> οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται</strong> sine copula et pronomine ponderose additur.” Schneckenb.).

<p>This last clause serves as a note of transition to what follows. So Herder remarks, as cited by Wiesinger: “And thus we have as it were standing before us the slain and unresisting righteous man, when lo the curtain falls: Be patient, brethren, wait!” See, on the whole sense, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="am+2:6-7">Amos 2:6-7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="am+5:12">Amos 5:12</span> ; and the description in Wis 2:6-20 .</p>
