<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] The <strong> κόσμος</strong> is the created <strong> world,</strong> into which He came ( Joh 1:9 ), which was made by Him ( Joh 1:3 ), which nevertheless (i.e. as here represented by <em> man</em> , the only creature who γινώσκει ) knew, recognized Him not.

<p><strong> καί</strong> is as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:5">John 1:5</span> .

<p><strong> αὐτόν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> not αὐτό , because though τὸ φῶς has been the subject, yet the <strong> δι</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο</strong> brings in again the creative λόγος , Who <em> is</em> the Light. The three members of the sentence form a climax; <strong> He was in the world</strong> (and therefore the world should have known Him), <strong> and the world was made by Him</strong> (much more then should it have known Him), <strong> and the world knew Him not.</strong></p>
