<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] The <strong> ὅσοι</strong> <strong> …</strong> primarily refers to the ἐκλογή <em> among the Jews</em> who have just been spoken of: but also, by implication, being opposed to both <strong> ὁ κόσμος</strong> and <strong> οἱ ἴδιοι</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the ἐκλογή in all the world.

<p><strong> ἔλαβον</strong> <strong> = </strong> <strong> παρέλαβον</strong> above as many as recognized Him as that which He was the Word of God and Light of men.

<p><strong> ἔδωκεν αὐτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐξουσ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] ἐξουσ . is not merely <em> capability</em> = δύναμιν (Lücke), still less <em> privilege</em> or <em> prerogative</em> (Chrysost. and others), but <strong> power</strong> (De Wette); involving all the actions and states needful to their so becoming, and removing all the obstacles in their way (e.g. the wrath of God, and the guilt of sin).

<p><strong> τέκνα θ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γενέσθαι</strong> ] The spiritual life owes its beginning to a <em> birth from above</em> , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:3-7">John 3:3-7</span> . And this birth is owing to the Holy Spirit of God; so that this is equivalent to saying, ‘As many as received Him, to them gave He His Holy Spirit.’ And we find that it was so: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:44">Acts 10:44</span> .

<p><strong> τέκνα θ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is a more comprehensive expression than υἱοὶ τ . θ ., which brings out rather our <em> adoption</em> , and hope of inheritance (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:14">Romans 8:14</span> ff.), whereas the other involves the <em> whole generation and process</em> of our life in the Spirit, as being from and of God, and consequently our <em> likeness</em> to God, walking in light as He is in light ( 1Jn 1:5-7 ) free from sin (ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:9">1 John 3:9</span> ; Joh 5:18 ) and death (ch. Joh 8:51 ).
