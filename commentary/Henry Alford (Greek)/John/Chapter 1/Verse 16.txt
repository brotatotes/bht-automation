<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] Origen (in Evang. Johan. tom. vi. 2, vol. iv. p. 102) blames Heracleon for terminating the testimony of John at the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span> , and makes it continue to the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span> . But it can hardly be that his testimony extends beyond <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span> , for ἡμεῖς πάντες would bear no very definite meaning, and the assertions in Joh 1:17 would be alien from the character of the Baptist, belonging as they do to the more mature development of Christian doctrines. I cannot doubt that this and the following verses <em> belong to the Evangelist</em> , and are a carrying onwards of his declarations concerning the divine Word.
	</p>
<p>Joh 1:15 is not parenthetical, but confirmatory of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span> , and this verse <em> grounds itself on the fact</em> of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span> , <em> corroborated by the testimony</em> of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:15">John 1:15</span> , <em> that He dwelt among us, and that we saw His glory, full of grace and truth</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> τὸ πλήρωμα</strong> is <em> that of which He was</em> <strong> πλήρης</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span> , and is not connected with the Gnostic <em> pleroma</em> at all. See reff.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἡμεῖς πάντες</strong> ] All who believe on Him: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:12">John 1:12</span> .

<p><strong> ἐλάβομεν</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> καί</strong> ] <strong> received, and that …</strong> ‘our relation to Him has been that of recipients out of His fulness, and the thing received has been’.… So Herod. i. 102, ἔχων δύο ταῦτα ἔθνεα , καὶ ἀμφότερα ἰσχυρά .
	</p>
<p><strong> χάριν ἀντὶ χάριτος</strong> ] The ancient interpretation, τὴν καινὴν διαθήκην ἀντὶ τῆς παλαιᾶς (Euthym [19] ), is certainly wrong, for the ἐλάβομεν is spoken entirely of <em> the times of the Incarnate Word:</em> and besides, ὁ νόμος and χάρις are distinctly <em> opposed</em> to one another in the next verse.

<p>The prep. <strong> ἀντί</strong> is properly used of any thing which <em> supersedes</em> another, or occupies its place. This is in fact its ordinary usage when <em> exchange</em> is spoken of: the possession of the thing gotten succeeds to, supersedes, the possession of the thing given in exchange, and I possess τοῦτο ἀντὶ ἐκείνου . Thus also we have received χάριν ἀντὶ χάριτος <em> continual accessions of grace;</em> new grace coining upon and superseding the former. Thus in Theognis, Sentt. 343 ff. (Lücke), τεθναίην δ ʼ εἰ μή τι κακῶν ἄμπαυμα μεριμνέων | εὑροίμην , δοίης δ ʼ <strong> ἀντ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἀνιῶν ἀνίας</strong> <strong> .</strong> And Chrysostom, de Sacerdotio, 6. 13, vol. i. p. 435, σὺ δέ με ἐκπέμπεις , <strong> ἑτέραν ἀνθ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἑτέρας</strong> φροντίδα ἐνθείς . Also Philo, i. 254, speaking of this very word χάρις : τὰς πρώτας ἀεὶ χάριτας … ἐπισχὼν καὶ ταμιευσάμενος εἰσαῦθις <strong> ἑτέρας ἀντὶ ἐκείνων</strong> καὶ <strong> τρίτας ἀντὶ δευτέρων</strong> <strong> ,</strong> καὶ ἀεὶ <strong> νέας ἀντὶ παλαιοτέρων</strong> <strong> ,</strong> τότε μὲν διαφορούσας , τότε δ ʼ αὖ καὶ τὰς αὐτὰς ἐπιδίδωσι .</p>
