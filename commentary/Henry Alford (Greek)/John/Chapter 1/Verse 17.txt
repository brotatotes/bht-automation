<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] The connexion of this verse with the foregoing lies in the words τοῦ πληρώμ . αὐτοῦ ( Joh 1:16 ), and in χάρις κ . ἀλ . ( Joh 1:14 ). ‘We received from His fulness continual additions of grace, <em> because that fulness is not, like the law, a positive enactment, finite and circumscribed</em> , of which it could be said that it <strong> ἐδόθη</strong> <strong> ,</strong> but the <em> bringing in of grace and truth</em> , which <strong> ἐγένετο</strong> by Jesus Christ.’
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐδόθη</strong> and <strong> ἐγένετο</strong> have been variously distinguished, αὐθεντικὸν μὲν τὸ <strong> ἐγένετο</strong> <strong> ,</strong> δουλικὸν δὲ τὸ <strong> ἐδόθη</strong> <strong> ,</strong> Theophyl. Similarly Bengel, “Mosis non sua est lex; Christi sua est gratia et veritas.” Clem. Alex [20] Pæd. i. 7, p. 134 [21] , says: διὸ καί φησιν ἡ γραφὴ “ ὁ νόμος <strong> διὰ</strong> Μωυσέως ἐδόθη ,” οὐχὶ <strong> ὑπὸ</strong> Μωυσέως , ἀλλὰ ὑπὸ μὲν τοῦ λόγου , διὰ Μωυσέως δὲ τοῦ θεράποντος αὐτοῦ · διὸ καὶ πρόσκαιρος ἐγίνετο , ἡ δὲ ἀΐδιος χάρις καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια διὰ Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ ἐγένετο , κ . τ . λ . Origen (in Joan. tom. vi. c. 3, vol. iv. p. 107) speaks very similarly. But the distinction laid down above, which is hinted at by De Wette, seems to me to be the most obvious, and best suited to the context, where the <strong> πλήρωμα</strong> of Christ is set against the <em> narrowness of positive enactment</em> in the law. Certainly, the distinction must not be lost sight of, nor denied, as Lücke attempts to do: for Bengel truly observes: “Nullus philosophus tam accurate verba ponit, differentiamque eorum observat, quam Johannes, in hoc præsertim capite.”

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [21] By these symbols are designated the portions of two ancient MSS., discernible (as also are fragments of Ulphilas’ gothic version) under the later writing of a volume known as the Codex Carolinus in the Ducal Library at Wolfenbüttel. P (GUELPHERBYTANUS A) contains fragments of each of the Gospels. Q (GUELPH. B) fragments of Luke and John. Both are probably of the <em> sixth century</em> . They were edited by F. A. Knittel in 1762; and, more thoroughly, by Tischendorf in 1860 [1869], Monumenta Sacra, vol. iii. [vi.]

<p><strong> χάρις κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] I must again caution the student against any such wholly inadequate explanations as that these words are put ‘per hendiadyn’ for χάρις ἀληθινή . It is in this way that the depths of Scripture have been covered over by the rubbish of expositors. Such was not the method of investigation pursued by the great men of former centuries: witness Origen in loc.: εἰ γὰρ Ἰησοῦς ἐστιν ὁ φάσκων “ ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ ἀλήθεια ,” πῶς ἡ ἀλήθεια διὰ Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ γίνεται ; αὐτὸς γάρ τις δι ʼ ἑαυτοῦ οὐ γίνεται . ἀλλὰ νοητέον ὅτι ἡ αὐτοαλήθεια ἡ οὐσιώδης καὶ ἵν ʼ οὕτως εἴπω πρωτότυπος τῆς ἐν ταῖς λογικαῖς ψυχαῖς ἀληθείας … οὐχὶ διὰ Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ ἐγένετο , οὐδ ʼ ὅλως διά τινος , ἀλλ ʼ ὑπὸ θεοῦ ἐγένετο · ὡς καὶ ὁ λόγος οὐ διά τινος , ὁ ἐν ἀρχῇ πρὸς τὸν θεόν , καὶ ἡ σοφία , ἣν ἔκτισεν ἀρχὴν ὁδῶν αὐτοῦ ὁ θεός , οὐ διά τινος , οὕτως οὐδὲ ἡ ἀλήθεια διά τινος . ἡ δὲ παρ ʼ ἀνθρώποις ἀλήθεια διὰ Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ ἐγένετο · οἷον ἡ ἐν Παύλῳ ἀλ . καὶ τοῖς ἀποστόλοις διὰ Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ ἐγένετο (vol. iv. p. 107).</p>
