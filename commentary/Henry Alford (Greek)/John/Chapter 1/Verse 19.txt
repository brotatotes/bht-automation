<p><strong> 19.</strong> ] <strong> αὕτη</strong> is the predicate, <strong> ἡ μαρτυρία</strong> the subject, in the present form of the sentence. So very frequently in St. John, where commonly the mistake is made of supposing the demonstrative pronoun to be the subject, whereas it is ever the predicate of identification.

<p><strong> οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι</strong> ] John alone of the Evangelists uses this expression; principally as designating <em> the chiefs of the Jewish people</em> , the members of the Sanhedrim. It is an interesting enquiry, what this usage denotes as to the author or date of our Gospel. Prof. Bleek, Beiträge, pp. 245 249, has satisfactorily shewn that no inference can be deduced from it <em> against the Jewish origin</em> of the author, as Bretschneider and Fischer endeavoured to do: but it is rather confirmatory of the belief that the Gospel was written after the Jews had ceased to be politically a nation, and among Gentiles; the author himself contemplating these last as his readers.

<p><strong> ἱερ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> .</strong> Λ .] This was a <em> formal deputation;</em> priests and Levites, constituting the two classes of persons employed about the service of the temple (see Jos 3:3 ), are sent ( Mat 21:23 ) officially to enquire into the pretensions of the new Teacher ( Joh 1:25 ), who had collected about him such multitudes ( Mat 3:5 ), and had awakened popular expectation that he was the Messiah ( Luk 3:5 ).
