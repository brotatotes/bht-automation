<p><strong> Ἡλίας εἶ</strong> <strong> ;</strong> ] The whole appearance of John reminded them of Elias: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:4">Matthew 3:4</span> , and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+1:8">2 Kings 1:8</span> . Besides, his announcement that <em> the Kingdom of God was at hand</em> , naturally led them to the prophecy <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:5">Malachi 4:5</span> , Lightfoot cites from the Rabbinical books testimonies that the Jews expected a general purification or baptism before the coming of the Messiah (from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:25-26">Ezekiel 36:25-26</span> , and Zec 13:1 ), and that it would be administered by Elias.

<p><strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Οὐκ εἰμί</strong> ] The right explanation of this answer seems to be the usual one, that the deputation asked the question in a mistaken and superstitious sense, meaning Elias bodily come down from heaven, who was expected to forerun and anoint the Messias. (Our Lord seems to refer to the same extravagant notion in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:14">Matthew 11:14</span> , <strong> εἰ θέλετε δέξασθαι</strong> <strong> ,</strong> αὐτός ἐστιν Ἡλ . ὁ μέλλων ἔρχεσθαι .) <em> In this sense</em> , John was not Elias; nor indeed in any other sense, <em> was</em> he Elias: but only ( Luk 1:17 ) ἐν πνεύματι καὶ δυνάμει Ἡλίου .

<p><strong> ὁ προφ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εἶ σύ</strong> <strong> ;</strong> ] From the prophecy of Moses, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+18:18">Deuteronomy 18:18</span> , the Jews expected some particular prophet to arise, distinct from the Messiah (this distinction however was not held by all, see ch. Joh 6:14 ), whose coming was, like that of Elias, intimately connected with that of the Messiah Himself: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:40-41">John 7:40-41</span> . In Mat 16:14 we have ‘Jeremiah, or one of the prophets’ apparently = this expected prophet. There seem to have been various opinions about him; all however agreeing in this, that he was to be <em> one of the old prophets raised from the dead</em> (see also 2Ma 2:1-8 ). This John <em> was not:</em> and he therefore answers this also in the negative.</p>
