<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] As <em> light</em> and <em> life</em> are closely connected ideas, so are <em> death</em> and <em> darkness</em> . The whole world, lying in death and in darkness, is the <strong> σκοτία</strong> here spoken of: not merely the ἐσκοτωμένοι (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:18">Ephesians 4:18</span> ; see ib. Eph 5:7-8 ), but the <em> whole mass</em> , with the sole exception (see below, Joh 1:12 ) of ὅσοι ἔλαβον αὐτόν (compare ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span> : 1Jn 5:19 ).
	</p>
<p>This <strong> φαίνει</strong> is not merely the historical present, but describes the whole process of the light of life in the Eternal Word shining in this evil and dark world; both by the O.T. revelations, and (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:16">John 10:16</span> ; Joh 11:52 ) by all the scattered fragments of light glittering among the thick darkness of heathendom.
	</p>
<p><strong> καὶ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> κατέλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> and the darkness comprehended</strong> (understood, apprehended) <strong> it not</strong> . That this is the meaning, will be clear from the context. John states here as a <em> general</em> fact, what he afterwards states of the appearance of the Incarnate Word to the chosen people, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span> . The sentences are strictly parallel. τὸ φ . ἐν τῇ σκ . φαίνει [7] εἰς τὰ ἴδια ἦλθεν , and κ . ἡ σκ . αὐτὸ οὐ κατέλ . [8] καὶ οἱ ἴδιοι αὐτὸν οὐ παρέλαβον . In the first, he is speaking of the <em> whole shining of this light over the world;</em> in the second, of its <em> historical manifestation to the Jews</em> . In both cases, <em> the Divine Word was rejected</em> . παρέλαβον is used in the second case as expressing the personal assumption to oneself as a friend or companion: see reff.

<p>Lücke observes (i. 313), that the almost tragic tone of this verse is prevalent through the Gospel of John and his First Epistle, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:37">John 12:37</span> ff. alli [9] .: and is occasionally found in Paul also, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18">Romans 1:18</span> ff.

<p>The other interpretation of κατέλαβεν , ‘ <em> overtook</em> ,’ ‘ <em> came upon</em> ’ (for that of ‘ <em> overcame</em> ’ (Orig [10] , Theophyl., Euthym [11] ) is not admissible, the word never importing this), is unobjectionable as far as the <em> usage</em> of the word is concerned (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:35">John 12:35</span> : Mar 9:18 ); but yields no sense in the context.

<p>The connexion of the two members of our verse by <strong> καί</strong> is not, ‘The Light shineth in the darkness, <em> and therefore</em> (i.e. because darkness is the opposition to light, and they exclude one another) the darkness comprehended it not;’ but, ‘The Light shineth in the darkness, <em> and yet</em> (notwithstanding that the effect of light in darkness is so great and immediate in the physical world) the darkness comprehended it not:’ see καί below, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span> .</p>
