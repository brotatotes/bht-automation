<p>The occurrence related by John happened <em> at the baptism</em> of Jesus, which is therefore here <em> pre-supposed as known</em> . Although this has been questioned (Usteri, Nachrichten über den Täufer J. u.s.w., cited by Lücke, i. 423), I cannot see how it can be reasonably doubted. We cannot surely suppose that such a sign was <em> twice</em> shewn. On the appearance itself, see note <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span> . The account here given confirms the view which I have there maintained, that the appearance was confined to our Lord and the Baptist: <em> he</em> was to receive the sign, and then to testify to the others, who were not themselves yet the bearers, but the recipients of testimony: κατά τινα πνευματικὴν θεωρίαν ὤφθη μόνῳ τῷ Ἰωάννῃ . Theod. Mops [32] p. 736.

<p><strong> τεθέαμαι</strong> <strong> ,</strong> perf. <strong> I have seen,</strong> in reference to the sign divinely intimated to him, in the abiding fulfilment of which he now stood. So again below, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:34">John 1:34</span> .

<p><strong> ἔμεινεν ἐπ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] By some appearance which is not described, the Holy Spirit was manifested to John as <em> not removing from Jesus again, but abiding on Him</em> . But we are not to understand that he had seen the Spirit descending on <em> others</em> , and <em> not abiding;</em> for (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:5">Acts 1:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:2">Acts 19:2</span> ff.) the gift of the Holy Spirit did not ordinarily accompany John’s baptism, but only in this one case; and its occurrence was to point out to him the Messiah.
