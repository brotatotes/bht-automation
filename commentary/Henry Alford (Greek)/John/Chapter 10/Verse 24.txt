<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] <strong> ψυχὴν αἴρεις</strong> is generally explained, ‘ <em> keep us in doubt</em> ,’ αἰωρεῖς , ἀναρτᾷς μεταξὺ πίστεως κ . ἀπιστίας , Euthym [150] But there is some question whether ψ . αἴρ . is ever so used. In Josephus, it signifies ‘ <em> to uplift the soul</em> ,’ ‘ <em> raise the courage;</em> ’ ἐπὶ τὸν κίνδ . τὰς ψ . ἠρμένοι , Antt. iii. 2. 3; 5. 1. So also Aquila, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="pr+19:18">Proverbs 19:18</span> , πρὸς τὸ θανατῶσαι αὐτὸν μὴ ἄρῃς ψ . σου . See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+85:4">Psalms 85:4</span> ; 142:8 (LXX). These usages, however, as all the examples adduced in the com [151] ., are confined to the act of a man on <em> his own</em> soul: when the term applies to effects produced on <em> another</em> , it seems to imply any strong excitement of mind, whether for hope or fear. <strong> How long dost thou excite our minds?
