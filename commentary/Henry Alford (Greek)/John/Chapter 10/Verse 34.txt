<p><strong> 34.</strong> ] <strong> νόμος</strong> here is in its widest acceptation, the whole O.T., as ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:34">John 12:34</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:25">John 15:25</span> . The Psalm (82) is directed against the injustice and tyranny of judges (not, the <em> Gentile rulers</em> of the world (De Wette), nor, the <em> angels</em> (Bleek)) in Israel. And in the Psalm reference is made by <strong> εἶπα</strong> to previous places of Scripture where judges are so called, viz. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:6">Exodus 21:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:9">Exodus 22:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:28">Exodus 22:28</span> .</p>
