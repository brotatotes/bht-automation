<p><strong> 22 39.</strong> ] <em> Discourse at the Feast of Dedication</em> . It may be, that Jesus remained at, or in the neighbourhood of, Jerusalem during the interval (two months) between the Feast of Tabernacles and that of the Dedication. Had He <em> returned to Galilee</em> , we should have expected some mention of it. Still, by the words ἐν τοῖς Ἱεροσολύμοις , it would seem as if a fresh period and a new visit began; for why should such a specification be made, if the narrative proceeded continuously?
