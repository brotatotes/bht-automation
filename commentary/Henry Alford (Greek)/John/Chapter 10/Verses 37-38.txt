<p><strong> γνῶτε κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γινώσκητε</strong> ] The distinction lies in the force of the present as denoting the continuance of a state, whereas the aorist implies an act of a moment. The nearest approach to it in English would perhaps be, <strong> that ye may perceive</strong> (the introductory act) <strong> and know</strong> (the abiding state). This distinction between the tenses not being appreciated, γινώσκητε has been awkwardly changed to πιστεύσητε . Cf. Plato, Legg. viii. p. 849 Α , τῶν δὲ ἐν ἄστει κατὰ τὰ αὐτὰ ἐπιμεληθῆναι καὶ ἐπιμελεῖσθαι τὴν τῶν ἀστυνόμων ἀρχήν .</p>
