<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] “Notice that Jesus rejoices not over the sad event itself, but that <em> He was not there</em> , which might prove salutary to the disciples’ faith.” Meyer. The <strong> ἵνα πιστ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is not to be taken as the <em> great end</em> of the miracle (expressed in Joh 11:4 ), but the end as regarded <em> them</em> . Beware of the imaginary <em> ecbatic</em> ἵνα , which does not exist.
