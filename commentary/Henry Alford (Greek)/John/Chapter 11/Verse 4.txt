<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] The only right understanding of this answer, and our Lord’s whole proceeding here is, that <em> He knew and foresaw all from the first</em> , as well the termination of Lazarus’s sickness and his being raised again, as the part which this miracle would bear in bringing about the close of His own ministry.

<p><strong> αὕτη ἡ ἀσθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] “Ostendit Christus, notum sibi, quod tanquam nescienti indicabatur.” Grot. <strong> οὐκ ἔστ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πρὸς θάν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Its <em> result</em> as regards Lazarus will not be <em> death</em> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:24">Matthew 9:24</span> [153] , and notes): but (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span> ; Joh 9:3 ) it has a higher purpose, the glory of God; the glorification, by its means, of the Son of God. And this <strong> δοξασθῇ</strong> how was it accomplished? By <em> this miracle leading to his death</em> , which in John’s diction is so frequently implied in that word. (It need hardly be remarked, with Olsh. and Trench, that the glorifying of the Son of God in Lazarus <em> himself</em> is subordinately implied. Men are not mere tools, but temples, of God.)

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [153] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt.

<p>It is doubtful whether these words were the answer sent back to the sisters, or were said to the disciples. In either case, they evidently carried a double meaning, as again those in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:11">John 11:11</span> .
