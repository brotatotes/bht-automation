<p><strong> 46.</strong> ] Meyer, with his usual philological acumen, takes pains to set right the understanding of this. In the last verse, it is not πολλοὶ … τῶν ἐλθόντων , but πολλοὶ … <strong> οἱ ἐλθόντες</strong> : thus identifying the πολλοί with those that came: ‘many … to wit, <em> those that came</em> .’ All these ἐπίστευσαν εἰς αὐτόν (see a similar case in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:30">John 8:30</span> ff.). Then, τινὲς ἐξ αὐτῶν , viz. the ἐλθόντων , and πιστευόντων , went, &amp;c. The <strong> δέ</strong> (see on Joh 11:37 ) certainly shews that this was done with a hostile intent: not in <em> doubt</em> as to the miracle, any more than in the case of the blind man, ch. 9, but with a view to stir up the rulers yet more against Him. This Evangelist is very simple, and at the same time very consistent, in his use of <em> particles:</em> almost throughout his Gospel the great subject, the manifestation of the Glory of Christ, is carried onward by <strong> οὖν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> whereas <strong> δέ</strong> as generally prefaces the development of the antagonist manifestation of hatred and rejection of Him. If it seem strange that this hostile step should be taken by πιστεύοντες εἰς αὐτόν , we at least find a parallel in the passage above cited, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:30">John 8:30</span> ff.</p>
