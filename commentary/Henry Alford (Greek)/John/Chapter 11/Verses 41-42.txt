<p><strong> 41, 42.</strong> ] In the filial relation of the Lord Jesus to the Father, all power is <em> given</em> to Him: the Son can do nothing of Himself: and during His humiliation on earth, these acts of power were done by Him, not by that glory of His own which He had laid aside, but by the mighty working of the Father <em> in Him</em> , and in answer to His prayer: the difference between Him and us in this respect being, that His prayer <em> was always heard</em> , even ( Heb 5:7 ) that in Gethsemane. And this <strong> ἤκουσάς μου</strong> He states here for the benefit of the standers-by, that they might know the truth of His repeated assertions of His mission from the Father. At the same time He guards this, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:42">John 11:42</span> , from future misconstruction, as though He had no more power than <em> men</em> who pray, by ἐγὼ δὲ ᾔδειν ὅτι πάντοτέ μου ἀκούεις , ‘because Thou and I are One.’

<p><em> When</em> He prayed, does not appear. Probably in Peræa, before the declaration in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:4">John 11:4</span> .</p>
