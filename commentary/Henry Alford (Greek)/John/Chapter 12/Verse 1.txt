<p><strong> 1.</strong> ] On <strong> πρὸ ἓξ ἡμ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> see reff. It is an expression frequent in later Greek; so μετὰ τριάκοντα ἡμ . τῶν γάμων , Dio lix. 20; μετὰ δέκα ἔτη τοῦ οἰκῆσαι Ἀβραὰμ ἐν γῇ Χαναάν , Philo de Congressu, 14, vol. i. p. 529. See numerous instances in Greswell, vol. iii. Diss. 1, where he defines the expression to be <em> exclusive</em> of the period named as the limit <em> ad quem</em> or <em> a quo</em> (according as πρό or μετά is used), but <em> inclusive</em> of the day or month or year of the occurrence specified. Thus the arrival, and anointing, at Bethany, will be on the eighth of Nisan, if the passover was on the fourteenth. That day was a Sabbath; but this makes no difficulty, as we know not from what point our Lord came, or whether He arrived at the commencement of the Sabbath, i.e. sunset, or a little after, on Friday evening, from Jericho.</p>
