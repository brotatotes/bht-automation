We have had no account of any multitude <em> coming from Bethany with Him</em> , nor does this narrative imply it: and surely <strong> ὁ ὄχλος</strong> in the two verses must mean the same persons. The <strong> καί</strong> here does not imply another ὄχλος , but <strong> And on this account the multitude also went out to meet Him:</strong> i.e. their coming out to meet Him and their μαρτυρία on the Mount of Olives, had one and the same cause, the raising of Lazarus.</p>
