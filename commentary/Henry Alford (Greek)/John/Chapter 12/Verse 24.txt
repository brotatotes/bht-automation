<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] Meyer thinks, that our Lord begins His declaration with the double asseveration <strong> ἀμὴν ἀμήν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> on account of the unreceptivity of the mind of the disciples for the announcements of His Death. But St. John <em> always</em> uses ἀμὴν ἀμήν . The <em> grain of wheat</em> perishes, and is <em> not apparent</em> (as the seeds of dicotyledonous plants <em> are</em> ) <em> in the new plant:</em> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:36">1 Corinthians 15:36</span> . The saying is more than a mere parabolic similitude: the divine Will, which has fixed the law of the springing up of the wheat-corn, has also determined the law of the glorification of the Son of Man, and the one in analogy with the other: i.e. both <em> through Death</em> . The symbolism here lies at the root of that in ch. 6, where Christ is <strong> ὁ ἄρτος</strong> τῆς ζωῆς .
