<p><strong> 7.</strong> ] See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:12">Matthew 26:12</span> . To suppose that it was a remnant from that used at the burial of Lazarus, is not only fanciful, but at variance with the character of the deed as apparent in the narrative. The rec [163] . reading, εἰς τ . ἡμ . τ . ἐντ . μου τετήρηκεν αὐτό , seems to be an adaptation to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:8">Mark 14:8</span> , in order to escape from the difficulty of understanding how she could <em> keep for His burial</em> , what she <em> poured out now</em> . Meyer understands the text of the <em> remnant:</em> but Luthardt rightly observes that the history clearly excludes the idea of a remnant: cf. ἐπράθη and ἐδόθη . He himself, with Baumg.-Crusius, takes τηρήοῃ as past, “ <em> Let her have kept it</em> ,” i.e. blame her not for having kept it: but this is vapid in sense, and ungrammatical. I understand the words, which, like all our Lord’s proleptical expressions, have something enigmatical in them, of her whole act, not regarded as a thing past, but spoken of in the abstract as to be allowed or disallowed: <strong> Let her keep it for the day of my burial:</strong> not meaning a <em> future</em> day or act, but the present one, as one to be allowed.
