<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] “ <em> Post</em> offulam, non <em> cum</em> offula.” Bengel. Observe the <strong> ψωμίον</strong> stands for the act in which it played a principal part. This giving the sop was one of the closest testimonies of friendly affection.

<p><strong> τότε</strong> carries a graphic power and pathos with it: <strong> at that moment.

<p><strong> εἰσῆλθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εἰς ἐκ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὁ σ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] See Joh 13:2 and note. Satan <em> entered fully</em> into him, took full possession of him, so that his will was not only bent upon doing the deed of treachery, but fixed and determined to do it <em> then and there</em> . The words must be understood literally, not as Theod. Mops [176] , as merely betokening τὴν κύρωσιν τῶν καταθυμίων τῷ διαβόλῳ λογισμῶν .

<p><strong> ὃ ποιεῖς</strong> <strong> …</strong> ] These words are not to be evaded, as being <em> permissive</em> (Grot.) or <em> dismissive</em> ( οὐδὲ προστάττοντος οὐδὲ συμβουλεύοντος , ἀλλ ʼ ὀνειδίζοντος καὶ δεικνύοντος ὅτι αὐτὸς μὲν ἐβούλετο διορθώσασθαι , ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἀδιορθώτως εἶχεν , <strong> ἀφίησιν</strong> αὐτόν . Chrys. Hom, in Joan. lxx. 1. 2). They are like the saying of God to Balaam, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:20">Numbers 22:20</span> , and of our Lord to the Pharisees, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:32">Matthew 23:32</span> . The <em> course of sinful action is presupposed</em> , and the command to go on is but the echo of that mysterious appointment by which the sinner in the exercise of his own corrupted will becomes the instrument of the purposes of God. Thus it is not ὅ , or εἴ τι , <strong> ποιήσεις</strong> <strong> ,</strong> but <strong> ὃ ποιεῖς</strong> <strong> :</strong> <strong> that which thou art doing,</strong> hast just now fully determined to put in present action, <strong> do more quickly</strong> ‘than thou seemest willing:’ or perhaps better ‘than thou wouldst otherwise have done,’ which seems the account to be ordinarily given of this use of the comparative: reproving his lingering, and his pretending ( Mat 26:25 ) to share in the general doubt.</p>
