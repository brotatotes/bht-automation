<p><strong> 30.</strong> ] The remark <strong> ἧν δὲ νύξ</strong> (which certainly concludes this period, see ὅτε οὖν , Joh 13:12 ) seems to be added to bring the whole narrative from ch. Joh 13:1 to ch. Joh 18:3 into precision, as happening on one and the same night. It is perhaps fanciful to see, as Orig [177] , Olsh., Stier, &amp;c. have done, an allusion to the σκοτία in Judas’s soul, or to ὑμῶν … ἡ ὥρα καὶ ἡ ἐξουσία τοῦ σκότου , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:53">Luke 22:53</span> ; though doubtless <em> there</em> the Lord alludes to its being <em> also night:</em> but I quite feel, with Meyer, that there is something awful in this termination <strong> it was night.
