<p><strong> πιστεύετε</strong> <em> both times</em> is <em> imperative</em> . So Cyr [182] , Nonn., Thl., Euth., Aug [183] , Hil [184] , Lampe, Lücke, De Wette, Stier, Tholuck (edn. 6), and A.V.R. Many (Erasmus, Beza, Grot., Olsh., also E. V.) take the first as indic., the second as imper., ‘ <em> Ye believe in God: believe also in me</em> .’ But this is inconsistent with the whole tenour of the discourse, which presupposes a want of belief in God in its full and true sense, as begetting <em> trust</em> in Him. Luther takes <em> both</em> as indicative. The command is intimately connected with ch. Joh 13:31-32 <em> faith in the glorification of Christ in the Father</em> , and <em> of the Father in Him</em> .
