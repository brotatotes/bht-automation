<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] I have retained the period after <strong> πορεύομαι</strong> (Grot., Griesb., Lachm., Knapp, Lücke, Meyer, Stier place a comma only and connect this verse with the <strong> ὅτι</strong> ), because the sense remains much the same, and the style is better preserved.

<p><strong> αἰτήσητε</strong> <strong> ,</strong> scil. τὸν πατέρα : so ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:16">John 15:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:23">John 16:23</span> . But this does not exclude, but <em> distinctly includes</em> , prayer to Christ; so blended are these two (as the ὁρᾶν , Joh 14:9 ), that we have not ποιήσει , but <strong> ποιήσω</strong> <strong> ,</strong> and, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:14">John 14:14</span> , emphatically <strong> ἐγὼ</strong> ποιήσω . He who prays to the Father, prays to the Son.
	</p>
<p>This ποιήσω answers to the ποιήσει in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:12">John 14:12</span> ; <em> the reason why you shall do these greater works, is, on account of the all-powerful Spirit of grace and supplication which My going to the Father shall bring down upon the Church; in answer to which Spirit, I will do by you whatever in My Name</em> (i.e. in union with Me, as being Mine, manifesting forth Jesus <em> as the Son of God</em> ) <em> ye shall ask. And the end of this is, that by these</em> <strong> μείζονα τούτων</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <em> the wonders of grace and triumphs of the Spirit, the Father may be glorified</em> (His glory shewn forth) <em> in and by the Son</em> .
	</p>
<p>Joh 14:14 solemnly repeats <em> as a promise</em> , what was incidentally asserted before: ‘For this is a truth, that whatever’ &amp;c. And besides, adds the <strong> ἐγώ</strong> <strong> : it is I that will do it:</strong> shewing that the use of the first person before was emphatic. “ ἐγώ hoc jam indicat gloriam.” Bengel.
	</p>
<p>Joh 14:15 is a following out of the ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου : ‘That <em> way of prayer</em> is the way of <em> loving obedience</em> , in which the Spirit is ever found, and which is only trodden by His help:’ and also of ἵνα δοξ . ὁ π . ἐν τῷ νἱ ., ‘As the Father is honoured in the Son, so must the Son be honoured in you:’ see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:10">John 15:10</span> .</p>
