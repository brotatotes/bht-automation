<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [196] Margin. ‘marg-eccles’ denotes that the reading cited is given on the margin as an alteration to be made in reading the passage in church, e.g. the name of our Lord, where the pronoun would otherwise stand at the beginning of a ‘Gospel for the day.’

<p>The office of the παράκλ . is to connect the disciples with the Father: if therefore they had Him not, they would be <em> fatherless</em> . The expression connects with τεκνία ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:33">John 13:33</span> , and as Euthym [197] , springs from πατρικὴ εὐσπλαγχνία . This makes ἔρχομαι , <strong> I am coming,</strong> plain, as applying to the coming by the Spirit, who is one with Christ; not only the ultimate personal coming, which is but the last step of the ἔρχομαι , nor only the bodily coming again to them and not to the world at the Resurrection, which was but a pledge of His lasting presence in the Spirit: see on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:3">John 14:3</span> . ἔρχομαι is (as there) the complex of these the <em> great Revisitation</em> , in all its blessed progress. The absence of any connecting particle as γάρ , with ἔρχομαι , arises (Meyer) from the depth of affection in the Lord’s heart.
