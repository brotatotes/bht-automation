<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] On <strong> ἐάν</strong> (not ‘ <em> when</em> ,’ here or any where), see note, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:32">John 12:32</span> . Here there is no translation of feeling: only in the extract from Hermann there, we may read ‘experientiâ (vestrâ) cognos <em> cetur</em> .’

<p>In order to understand this, we must bear in mind what Stier well calls the ‘perspective’ of prophecy. The <em> coming again of the Lord</em> is not one single act, as His resurrection, or the descent of the Spirit, or His second personal advent, or the final coming to judgment; but the <em> great complex</em> of all these, the result of which shall be, His taking His people to Himself to be where He is. This <strong> ἔρχομαι</strong> <strong> ,</strong> is <em> begun</em> ( Joh 14:18 ) in His Resurrection <em> carried on</em> ( Joh 14:23 ) in the <em> spiritual life</em> (see also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:22">John 16:22</span> f.), the making <em> them</em> ready for the place prepared; - <em> further advanced</em> when each by death is fetched away to be with Him ( Php 1:23 ); <em> fully completed</em> at His coming in glory, when they shall for ever be with Him ( 1Th 4:17 ) in the perfected resurrection state.</p>
