<p><strong> 31.</strong> ] ‘But my Death is an act of voluntary obedience, that it may be known that I love and obey the Father that the glory of the Father in and by Me may be manifested.’

<p>The construction is elliptic: supply, ‘But (his power over Me for death will be permitted by Me) that,’ &amp;c. And set a period at ποιῶ , as usually done.

<p>Meyer, alli [205] ., and Luthardt, would carry on the sense from ποιῶ , “ <em> But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, thus I do, arise, let us go hence</em> .” I need only put it to the inner feeling of any who have learned to appreciate the majesty and calmness of our Lord’s discourses, whether a sentence so savouring of theatrical effect is likely to have been spoken by Him. We may notwithstanding safely believe that the ἐγ . ἄγ . ἐντ ., <em> without this connexion</em> , does undoubtedly express the holy boldness of the Lord in going to meet that which was to come upon Him, and is for that reason inserted by St. John.

<p><strong> ἐγείρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , <strong> ἄγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐντ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] These words imply a movement from the table to depart. Probably the rest of the discourse, and the prayer, ch. 17, were delivered when now all were standing ready to depart. There would be some little pause, in which the preparations for departure would be made. But the <em> place</em> is clearly the same, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:1">John 18:1</span> , ταῦτα εἰπὼν ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐξῆλθεν : besides which, we can hardly suppose (Grot., &amp;c.) discourses of a character like those in ch. 15, 16 to have been delivered to as many as eleven persons, while <em> walking by the way</em> , and in a time of such publicity as that of the Paschal Feast. Still less is the supposition of Bengel and Beausobre probable, that ch. 13, 14 happened outside the city, and that between ch. 14 and 15 the paschal meal takes place. Compare also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:30">John 13:30</span> , which is decisive against this idea.</p>
