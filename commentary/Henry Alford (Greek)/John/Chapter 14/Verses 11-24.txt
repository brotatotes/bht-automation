<p><strong> 11 24.</strong> ] <em> Jesus will make proof of His abiding union with the Father, in His union with His own:</em> and this, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:12-14">John 14:12-14</span> , <em> in answering prayer:</em> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:15-17">John 14:15-17</span> , <em> in the sending of the Spirit:</em> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:18">John 14:18</span> ff., <em> as a pledge of the completion of this union in His personal return</em> . The Lord now unfolds out of this <strong> ποιεῖ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the great promise of the Paraclete.
	</p>
<p><strong> διὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτά</strong> ] See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:38">John 10:38</span> . The object here seems to be, to fix their attention on the <em> works</em> as a plain testimony even to such as could not simply believe so deep a thing on His assertion ( <strong> πιστ</strong> <strong> .</strong> μοι ), and one which ( Joh 14:12 ) should become subjective in themselves hereafter, by virtue of their living union with Him who is gone to the Father, and become the dispenser and channel of the Spirit. “Qui Christo de se loquenti credit, in Christum credit.” Bengel.

<p><strong> μείζ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τούτων</strong> ] This word <strong> μείζ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is not to be evaded (so as to = πλείονα , Lampe), but taken in its full strict sense. And the keys to its meaning will be found ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:51">John 1:51</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:20">John 5:20</span> . <em> The</em> works which Jesus did, His Apostles also did, scil., raising the dead, &amp;c. <em> greater works than those</em> , they did, not in <em> degree</em> , but <em> in kind: spiritual</em> works, under the dispensation of the Spirit, which <em> had not yet come in</em> . But they did them, <em> not as separate from</em> Him: but <em> in</em> Him, and <em> by</em> Him; and so (ch. Joh 5:21 ) <em> He</em> is said to do them. The work which He did by Peter’s sermon, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:0">Acts 2:0</span> , was one of these μείζονα τούτων , the first-fruits of the unspeakable gift.

<p>This union of them with and in Him is expressed here by τὰ ἔρ . <strong> ἃ ἐγὼ</strong> ποιῶ , <strong> κἀκεῖνος</strong> ποιήσει .
