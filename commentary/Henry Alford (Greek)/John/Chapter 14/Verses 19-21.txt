<p><strong> 19 21.</strong> ] This ἔρχομαι is explained to consist in His presence among them by the life of His Resurrection, which is theirs; by ( Joh 14:20 ) the witness of the Spirit in their hearts; and ( Joh 14:21 ) their sanctification by the Spirit in love, and the consequent manifestation of Jesus to them.

<p>Luthardt (ii. p. 309 f.) attempts to confine ἔρχομαι (and this whole passage) to the παρουσία , in spite of the plain sense of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:19-20">John 14:19-20</span> , relying on the analogy of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+22:17">Revelation 22:17</span> , and saying that on the common interpretation, the Church would have no cause to long for her Lord: and so Aug [198] , Maldon., Hofm., alli [199] . But manifestly the context is against him: and he must thus explain away many other passages (e.g. Mat 18:20 ). The presence of Christ by the Spirit is none the less <em> real</em> , for being <em> incomplete</em> .
