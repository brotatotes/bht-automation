<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] A difficulty has been unnecessarily found in this verse, because St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6">Romans 5:6</span> ff., cites it as a nobler instance of love, that Christ died for us <em> when we were enemies</em> . But manifestly <em> here</em> the example is from common life, in which if a man did lay down his life it would naturally be for his friends; and would be, and is cited as, the greatest example of love. Nor again is there any doctrinal difficulty: our Lord does not assert of himself, that He laid down his life <em> only</em> for his friends (as defined in the next verse), but puts forward <em> this side</em> of his Love as a great and a practical example for his followers. His own great Sacrifice of Himself lies in the background of this verse; but only in the background, and with but one side of it seen, viz. his Love to <em> them</em> . See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:10">1 Timothy 4:10</span> , and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:16">1 John 3:16</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἵνα</strong> <strong> ,</strong> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:8">John 15:8</span> , depends on αὕτη , not on any <em> will</em> implied in ἀγάπη (De Wette), nor used ἐκβατικῶς (Olsh.), and answers to ‘scilicet, ut:’ see on this use of ἵνα , note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:13">1 Corinthians 14:13</span> .
	</p>
<p>Joh 15:14 parallel to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:10">John 15:10</span> , and, like it, guarded, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:15-17">John 15:15-17</span> , from legal misinterpretation.
	</p>
<p><span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:15">John 15:15</span> <em> proleptically</em> spoken, of the state in which He would place them under the Spirit. Nor is there any discrepancy with ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:13">John 13:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:16">John 13:16</span> , and Joh 15:20 here, which are also spoken of their future condition: for in that sense both relations subsist together. It is the <em> lower sense</em> of δοῦλος which is brought out in this verse. The proleptical character of the saying is clearly shewn in the οὐκ οἶδεν τί ποιεῖ ὁ κ ., for this was precisely their <em> present</em> condition, but was after His Ascension changed into light and knowledge.

<p><strong> ἐγνώρισα ὑμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Here again the allusion must be (see ch. Joh 16:12 ) to their future state under the dispensation of the Spirit: nay, even to the fulness and completion of <em> it</em> , as Aug [214] remarks, Tract. lxxxvi. 1, vol. iii. pt. ii.: compare the confession of one of the greatest Apostles, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:10">1 Corinthians 13:10</span> . “Sicut immortalitatem carnis et salutem animarum futuram exspectamus, quamvis jam pignore accepto salvi facti esse dicamur: ita omnium notitiam quæcumque Unigenitus audivit a Patre, futuram sperare debemus, quamvis hoc jam se fecisse dixerit Christus.” Aug [215] ut supra.
