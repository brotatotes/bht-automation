<p><strong> ἔθηκα</strong> ] <strong> appointed:</strong> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:47">Acts 13:47</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:9">1 Thessalonians 5:9</span> , and reff. Euth., Chrys., Thl. explain it ἐφύτευσα , in the parabolic sense. But the parable seems to be no further returned to than in the allusion implied in καρπός . ‘ <em> Ordained</em> ,’ in E. V., is objectionable, as conveying a wrong idea.

<p><strong> ὑπάγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> καρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> φέρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] ὑπ . probably merely expresses (see ref. and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:15">Matthew 18:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:21">Matthew 19:21</span> , and πορευόμενοι , Luk 8:14 ) the activity of living and developing principle; not the missionary journeys of the Apostles (Grot., Lampe, Meyer). The καρπός is not the Church, to be founded by the Apostles, and endure; this is evident, for <em> here</em> the fruit is spoken of with reference to <em> themselves</em> , and their ripening into the full stature of Christ. Much of their fruit will be necessarily the winning of others to Christ: but that is not <em> the prominent</em> idea here.

<p><strong> ἵνα ὅ τι ἂν</strong> <strong> …</strong> ] This ἵνα is parallel with the former one, not the result of it; the two, the bringing forth of fruit and the obtaining answer to prayer, being co-ordinate with each other; but ( Joh 15:7-8 ) the bearing fruit to God’s glory is of these the greater, being the result and aim of the other.</p>
