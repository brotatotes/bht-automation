<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [217] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .

<p>Joh 15:19 not only explains this hatred, but derives additional comfort from it, as a sign that they were not (any longer) <em> of the world;</em> but chosen out of it by Him, and endued with a new life from above.

<p>In <strong> τὸ ἴδιον</strong> ἐφίλει , not ὑμᾶς ἐφ ., we have the true practice of the world hinted at, and the false character of the world’s love, as a mere φιλαυτία , set forth. “ <em> Suum</em> dicitur pro <em> vos</em> , atque sic notatur <em> Interesse</em> mundi,” Bengel. In this ‘loving their own,’ the children of this world fall into hating one another.

<p>Meyer remarks the solemnity of κόσμος thus repeated five times.</p>
