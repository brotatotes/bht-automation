<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] The disciples are not, as some have supposed, here mentioned as witnesses <em> separate from</em> and <em> working with</em> the Holy Spirit. The witness is <em> one and the same</em> the Spirit will witness in and by them; the ὃταν ἔλθῃ ὁ παρ . belongs to the whole: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:48-49">Luke 24:48-49</span> , where this is strongly expressed. This verse alludes to the historical witness which the Holy Ghost in the ministers and eye-witnesses of the word, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:2">Luke 1:2</span> , should enable them to give, which forms the <em> human side</em> ( <strong> καὶ ὑμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> δέ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> “quin et vos,” Erasm.) of this great testimony of the Spirit of truth, and OF WHICH OUR INSPIRED GOSPELS ARE THE SUMMARY: the <em> divine side</em> being, His own indwelling testimony in the life and heart of every believer in all time. But both the one and the other are given <em> by the self-same</em> SPIRIT; neither of them inconsistent with, or superseding the other.

<p>The present tenses set forth the connexion between the being (continuing to be) witnesses, and the being (having been throughout) companions of the Lord in His ministry. Cf. ἀπ ʼ ἀρχῆς ὁ διάβολος ἀμαρτάνει , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:8">1 John 3:8</span> .</p>
