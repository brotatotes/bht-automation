<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] This verse is a most important testimony against supra-lapsarian error, shewing us that <em> falling from grace is possible</em> , and pointing out the steps of the fall. Observe this is <em> not said of the unfruitful branch</em> , which the Father <em> takes away</em> (in judgment): but of one who <em> will not abide</em> in Christ, becomes separate from Him: (1) is <em> cast out</em> (of the vineyard, or of the Vine) like a ( <strong> τὸ κλῆμα</strong> <strong> ,</strong> scil. τὸ ἄχρηστον , Euth.) branch in such a case: (2) becomes <em> dried up</em> , having lost the supply of life-giving sap (“quenched the Spirit,” 1Th 5:19 ): (3) is gathered up with other such ( Mat 13:40 ) by the angels at the great day: (4) is cast into the fire, as the result of that judgment; and finally (5) ‘ <em> burneth;</em> ’ not ‘is burned,’ in any sense of being <em> consumed;</em> <em> und muss brennen</em> , Luther.

<p>The aorists I take with Meyer as a consequence of the whole being spoken by our Lord as if the great day were come: hence also the presents, βάλλουσιν and καίεται .</p>
