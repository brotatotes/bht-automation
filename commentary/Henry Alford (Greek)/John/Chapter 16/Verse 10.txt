<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] <strong> δικαιοσ</strong> <strong> .</strong> cannot be <em> only</em> the righteousness <em> of Christ</em> , the mere conviction of which would only bring condemnation to that world which rejected and crucified Him: but, as Stier remarks rightly (v. 312, edn. 2), τοῦ κόσμου must be supplied after each of the three ἁμαρτία , δικαιοσύνη , κρίσις : the conviction being of a sin that is <em> theirs</em> , a righteousness that is (or, in the case of condemnation, might have been) <em> theirs</em> , a judgment which is <em> theirs</em> (see below). Then, <em> what is the world’s righteousness?</em> Not their own, but that of the accepted Man Christ Jesus standing at the right hand of God (seen by us no more, but by that very withdrawal testified to be the Son of God, THE RIGHTEOUS ONE), manifested in the hearts of men by the Spirit to be <em> their only</em> righteousness; and thereby that righteousness, which they had of their own before, is demonstrated to be worthless and as filthy rags. It is the ὑπάγειν πρὸς τὸν πατέρα by which this righteousness is assured to us, and by the effect of which, the Spirit, the conviction respecting it is wrought in our hearts (see Hare, as above, note T). The <em> condemnatory</em> side of this part of the ἔλεγχος is, that <em> remorse</em> , wherewith they whose day of grace is past shall look on the perfect righteousness which might have been theirs, and on the miserable substitute with which they contented themselves.</p>
