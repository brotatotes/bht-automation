<p><strong> τὴν ἀλήθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πᾶσαν</strong> ] <strong> all the truth,</strong> viz. on those points alluded to in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:12">John 16:12</span> . Lücke observes that the re [223] . reading connects πᾶσαν more with ὁδηγήσει , the other with ἀλήθ . The Lord had ever told them <em> the truth</em> , and <em> nothing but the truth</em> , in spiritual things, but not yet <em> the whole truth</em> , because they could not bear it. This the Spirit should lead them into, open the way to it, and unfold it by degrees.

<p>No promise of universal knowledge, nor of infallibility, is hereby conveyed; but a promise to them and us, that the Holy Spirit shall teach and lead us, not as children, under the tutors and governors of legal and imperfect knowledge, but as sons ( Gal 4:6 ), making known to us the whole truth of God. This was in an especial manner fulfilled to <em> them</em> , as set to be the founders and teachers of the Churches.

<p><strong> οὐ γὰρ λαλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀφ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἑαυτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The Spirit does not, any more than the Son, work or speak <em> of Himself:</em> both are sent, the one from the Father, the other from the Father and Son: the one to testify ὅσα ἀκούσει of the Father, the other of the Father and the Son. <strong> ὅσα ἀκ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> from God, the Father and the Son.

<p><strong> τὰ ἐρχ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀναγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὑμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] As the <em> direct</em> fulfilment <em> to the Apostles</em> of the leading into the whole truth was the unfolding before them those truths which they have delivered down to us in their Epistles, so, though scattered traces of the fulfilment of <em> this part</em> of the promise are found in the Acts and those Epistles, its complete fulfilment was the giving of the Apocalypse, in which τὰ ἐρχόμενα are distinctly the subject of the Spirit’s revelation, and with which His <em> direct</em> testimony closes: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+22:20">Revelation 22:20</span> . On the whole of this verse, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:7-16">Ephesians 4:7-16</span> .</p>
