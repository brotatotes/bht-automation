<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] Here we have given us a glimpse into the essential relations of the Blessed Trinity. The Father hath given the Son to have life and all things in Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:19">Colossians 1:19</span> ; Col 2:2-3 ), the relation being, that the Son glorifies not Himself but the Father, by revealing the Father, whom He alone knows ( Mat 11:27 ). And this Revelation, the Revelation of the Father by Christ is carried on by the blessed Spirit in the hearts of the disciples of Christ; Who takes ( <strong> λαμβάνει</strong> <strong> ,</strong> indefinite, of the <em> office</em> of the Spirit) of the things of Christ, and declares, proclaims, to them.
	</p>
<p><strong> διὰ τοῦτο</strong> ] <strong> For this cause I</strong> (rightly) <strong> said.…</strong> i.e. ‘this was the ground of My asserting:’ not the reason <em> why it was said</em> , but the justification of it when said.
	</p>
<p>This verse contains the plainest proof by inference of the orthodox doctrine of the Holy Trinity.</p>
