<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] The ‘tertium comparationis’ is ἡ λύπη εἰς χαρὰν γενήσεται : but the comparison itself goes far beyond this mere similitude.

<p><strong> ἡ γυνή</strong> is not merely generic, but allusive to the frequent use and notoriety of the comparison. We often have it in the O.T., see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+21:3">Isaiah 21:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+26:17-18">Isaiah 26:17-18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+37:3">Isaiah 37:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:7-8">Isaiah 66:7-8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ho+13:13-14">Hosea 13:13-14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mic+4:9-10">Micah 4:9-10</span> .

<p>The deeper reference of the comparison has been well described by Olshausen: “Here arises the question, how are we to understand this similitude? We might perhaps think that the suffering Manhood of Christ was <em> the woman in her pangs</em> , and the same Christ glorified in the Resurrection, <em> the Man born;</em> but the Redeemer ( Joh 16:22 ) applies the pangs to the <em> disciples:</em> how then will the ἄνθρωπος who is born apply to them?” Then, after condemning the shallow and unsatisfactory method of avoiding deep research by asserting that the details of parables are not to be interpreted, he proceeds: “Hence the proper import of the figure seems to be, that the Death of Jesus Christ was as it were an anguish of birth belonging to all Humanity ( <em> ein schmerzvoller Geburtsact der ganzen Menschheit</em> ) in which the perfect Man was born into the world; and in this very birth of the new man lies the spring of eternal joy, never to be lost, for all, inasmuch as through Him and His power the renovation of the whole is rendered possible” (ii. 379). And indeed the same is true of every Christian who is planted in the likeness of Christ. His passing from sorrow to joy till “Christ be formed in him,” is this birth of pain. And the whole Church, the Spouse of Christ, nay, even the whole Creation, συνωδίνει , till the number of the elect be accomplished, and the eternal joy brought in. And thus the meaning which Luthardt insists on as against the above remarks of Olshausen, viz. <em> the new birth of the Church</em> , is in inner truth the same as his.</p>
