<p><strong> 7.</strong> ] <strong> ἀλλά</strong> refers to the last clause ( <strong> notwithstanding,</strong> or <strong> nevertheless,</strong> as E. V.): <strong> ἐγώ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> to οὐδεὶς ἐξ ὑμ . κ . τ . λ . I <em> Myself</em> tell you the real state of the case.
	</p>
<p><strong> συμφέρει ὑμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> implies that the dispensation of the Spirit is a more blessed manifestation of God than was even the bodily presence of the risen Saviour.

<p>Every rendering of this verse ought to keep the distinction between ἀπέλθω and πορευθῶ , which is not sufficiently done in E. V. by ‘ <em> go away</em> ’ and ‘ <em> depart</em> .’ <strong> Depart</strong> and <strong> go</strong> would be better: the first expressing merely the <em> leaving them</em> , the second, the <em> going up</em> to the Father.
	</p>
<p>The <strong> ἐγώ</strong> before ἀπέλθω is again emphatic: ‘that I, for my part, should leave you.’
	</p>
<p>This οὐκ ἐλεύσεται … is a convincing proof, if one more were needed, that <em> the gift of the Spirit at and since the day of Pentecost, was and is something</em> TOTALLY DISTINCT <em> from any thing before that time: a new and loftier dispensation</em> .</p>
