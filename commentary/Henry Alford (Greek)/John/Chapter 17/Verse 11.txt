<p><strong> οὐκ ἔτι εἰμὶ ἐν τῷ κ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] This shews us that ὁ κόσμ . is not said of <em> place</em> alone, for the Lord Jesus is still <em> here;</em> but of <em> state</em> , the <em> state of men in the flesh;</em> sometimes viewed on its darker side, as overcoming men and bringing in spiritual death, sometimes, as here, used in the most general sense.

<p><strong> καί</strong> <strong> ,</strong> not <em> but;</em> it expresses the simultaneous state of the Lord and His, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:32">John 16:32</span> , and note.

<p><strong> ἅγιε</strong> ] <em> Holy</em> , as applied to God, peculiarly expresses that <em> penetration of all His attributes by</em> LOVE, which He only who here uttered it sees through in its length, breadth, and height: which angels (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:3">Isaiah 6:3</span> ; Rev 4:8 ) feel and express: which men are privileged to utter, but can never worthily feel: but which devils can neither feel nor worthily utter (see Mar 1:24 ). They know His Power and His Justice only. But His Holiness is especially employed in this work of <strong> τηρεῖν</strong> now spoken of.

<p>This Name, not the essential God-head, but the covenant name, JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS, the Father hath <em> given to Christ</em> , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9">Philippians 2:9</span> ; and it is the being kept in this, the truth and confession of this, for which He here prays. “That which the Son has given to His disciples is no other than that which He himself has received from the Father, viz. the essential revelation of the Father.” Luthardt.

<p><strong> ἵνα ὦσιν ἓν καθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡμεῖς</strong> ] The oneness here is not merely harmony of will or of love, as some have interpreted it, and then tried to weaken the Oneness of the Godhead by the καθώς , but oneness by the indwelling of the Spirit of Christ, the gift of the covenant ( 1Co 6:17 ), and ultimately [as the close union implied by καθώς requires] oneness of nature, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span> , where the ἐπαγγέλματα δεδώρηται answers to the ὄνομα ὃ δέδωκάς μοι here. “Non ait, ut <em> nobiscum</em> sint <em> unum</em> , aut <em> simus unum</em> ipsi et nos, sicut unum sumus nos, sed ait, ut sint unum sicut et nos.” Aug [235] Tract, cvii. 5.
