<p><strong> 19.</strong> ] See above on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:17">John 17:17</span> . Notice, says Meyer, the emphatic correlation of <strong> αὐτῶν</strong> <strong> </strong> <strong> ἐγὼ ἐμαυτόν</strong> <strong> </strong> <strong> καὶ αὐτοί</strong> <strong> .

<p>It is clear against all Socinian inferences from this verse, that all that part of ἁγιάζειν implied in ch. Joh 10:36 is here excluded: and only that intended which is expressed Heb 2:10 by διὰ παθημάτων τελειῶσαι . Of this, His death was the crowning act, and was also the one to which the ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν most directly applies; but the whole is included. The confining the meaning to <em> His sacrifice</em> (Chrys., Euthym [236] ), and the ἵνα καὶ αὐτοὶ .… to <em> their martyrdom</em> , or their spiritual <em> self-offering</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span> (Euthym [237] ), is insufficient for the depth of the words.

<p><strong> ἐν ἀληθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> in truth:</strong> <em> what</em> truth, is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:17">John 17:17</span> , where, in the repetition, ὁ λόγ . ὁ σὸς ἀλήθειά ἐστιν , the article is also wanting: see also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:24">John 4:24</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:3">3 John 1:3</span> , for ἀλήθ , without the article. But the distinction is perhaps somewhat obscured after a preposition.</p>
