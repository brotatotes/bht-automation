<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] The <strong> ἵνα</strong> here hardly can regard the subject-matter of the <strong> ἐρωτῶ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:20">John 17:20</span> , but rather we should supply after that word ταῦτα , and understand this ἵνα as expressing the <em> object of the prayer</em> respecting both. The subject-matter of the prayer is, that they may be kept in God’s name and sanctified in God’s truth; and if this be so, their unity with the Son and the Father follows, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span> . But here it is not merely ‘with,’ but <strong> in,</strong> the Son and the Father; because the Spirit proceeds from <em> the Father and the Son</em> , and ‘He that is joined to the Lord, is one Spirit:’ see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:11">John 17:11</span> . This unity has its true and only <em> ground</em> in faith in Christ through the Word of God as delivered by the Apostles; and is therefore not mere outward uniformity, nor can such uniformity produce it. At the same time its effects are to be real and visible, such that the world may see them.

<p><strong> ἵνα πιστ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Not parallel with the former ἵνα , as if πιστ . ὁ κόσμος meant the same as πάντες ἓν ὦσι , that all may be brought to believe. Nor again can the words mean that the <em> unbelieving and condemned world, at the end</em> , may be persuaded ‘that Thou hast sent Me.’ Such a rendering would surely be repugnant to the spirit of the prayer, and the use of the word πιστεύω in our Gospel. Rather is it, ‘that this their testimony, being borne by them all, and in all ages, may continue to convince the world, so that many in the world may believe,’ &amp;c.

<p>The <strong> ὅτι σύ με ἀπέστειλας</strong> implies belief in the whole Work and Office of Christ. Here our Lord certainly <em> prays for the world</em> , see above on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:9">John 17:9</span> .

<p>See a remarkable parallel, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span> , where, as Stier truly remarks, the persons spoken of are <em> penitents</em> .</p>
