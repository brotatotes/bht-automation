<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] The past tenses are proleptical. In the rendering of this whole chapter they should be kept indefinite, not made into <em> perfects</em> as in E. V., which destroys this proleptical character. <strong> I glorified Thee … I finished</strong> … What view of the aorist has led to Bp. Wordsworth’s explanation here, “the aorist is used, not the perfect, masmuch as the work of glorification was still going on, and not to be completed before His Passion, when He would say τετέλεσται ,” I am quite unable to imagine. That the aorist implies <em> present continuance</em> , is at least a startling doctrine. The force of it here surely is, that our Lord stands by anticipation at the end of His accomplished course, and looks back on it all as past, as historically gathered up in one act: which is the very sense and propriety of the aorist.

<p><strong> τὸ ἔργον</strong> is not only the ministerial life of our Lord, but the <em> whole</em> Life, with all its appointed manifestations of humility and purity, the perfect righteousness which by that life He has planted in our nature, and His prophetic and declarative office, terminated by His Passion and Death.</p>
