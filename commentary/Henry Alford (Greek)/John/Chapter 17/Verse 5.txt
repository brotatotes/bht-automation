<p><strong> 5. </strong> <strong> δόξασόν με</strong> ] Notice the correlation, which Meyer has pointed out, between <strong> ἐγώ σε</strong> before and <strong> με σύ</strong> now. The same Person ( ἐγώ ) who had with the Father glory before the world, also glorified the Father in the world, and prays to be again received into that glory. <em> A decisive proof of the unity of the Person of Christ</em> , in His three estates of eternal præ-existence in glory, humiliation in the flesh, and glorification in the Resurrection Body.

<p>This direct testimony to the eternal præ-existence of the Son of God has been evaded by the Socinian and also the Arminian interpreters, by rendering <strong> εἶχον</strong> <strong> ,</strong> “habebam <em> destinatione tua</em> ,” Grot., Wets [232] . On the identity of the δόξα in Joh 17:22 with this δόξα , see note there.
