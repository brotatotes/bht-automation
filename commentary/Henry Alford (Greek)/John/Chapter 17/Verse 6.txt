<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] This verse particularizes <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:4">John 17:4</span> , and forms the transition to the intercessory prayer.
	</p>
<p><strong> σου τὸ ὄνομα</strong> ] Thy Name of FATHER, which was so constantly on the lips of our Lord; and which derived its living meaning and power from His teaching: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:21">Exodus 23:21</span> . No especial emphasis on σου : it carries on the strain of address, and points to the emphatic <strong> σοί</strong> which follows, and the equally emphatic <strong> παρὰ σοῦ</strong> in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:7">John 17:7</span> <strong> .
	</strong></p>
<p><strong> οὓς δέδ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The Father gave them to Christ, by <em> leading</em> them to Christ, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:37">John 6:37</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44-45">John 6:44-45</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> σοὶ ἦσαν</strong> ] <strong> Thine</strong> ( <strong> σοί</strong> <strong> ,</strong> from σός ) <strong> they were</strong> <em> Israelites</em> <em> Thy people, before:</em> not only outwardly, but Israelites indeed, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:48">John 1:48</span> , and thus prepared to receive Christ (so Stier, v. 411 ff., edn. 2). And thus the <strong> ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου</strong> answers to λαβεῖν ἑαυτῷ ἔθνος ἐκ μέσου ἔθνους , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+4:34">Deuteronomy 4:34</span> . But see the fuller sense below, on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:9">John 17:9</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> τὸν λ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σου τετήρηκαν</strong> ] <strong> They have observed Thy word</strong> walked in the path of Thy commandments; for so λόγον τηρεῖν means: see ch. Joh 14:23 and reff.
	</p>
<p>Stier understands their walking in the O.T. ordinances blameless, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:6">Luke 1:6</span> , and thus (compare ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:42">John 1:42</span> ; Joh 1:46 ) recognizing Christ as the Messiah when He came. But this is perhaps hardly likely to have been set at the <em> end</em> of the sentence, <em> after</em> ἐμοὶ αὐτοὺς δέδωκας . It is more likely that τὸν λόγον σου = τὰ ῥήματα ἃ δέδωκάς μοι , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:8">John 17:8</span> , and is proleptically spoken.</p>
