<p><strong> τὰ ῥ</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> δέδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτοῖς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> and the similar sayings ch. Joh 15:15 alli [233] ., seem to be a reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+18:18-19">Deuteronomy 18:18-19</span> , where it is said that the Prophet “shall speak unto them all that I shall command Him.” The imparting to them of these ῥήματα was the efficient cause of their faith: see their confession ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:68-69">John 6:68-69</span> , where πεπιστεύκαμεν and ἐγνώκαμεν are connected as here.

<p>On the two last clauses we may notice that <strong> παρὰ σοῦ ἐξῆλθον</strong> is more a matter of <em> conviction from inference</em> (see ch. Joh 3:2 ), <strong> ἔγνωσαν</strong> <strong> :</strong> whereas the other side of the same truth, <strong> σύ με ἀπέστειλας</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the act of the Father unseen by us, is more a matter of <em> pure faith</em> , <strong> ἐπίστευσαν</strong> <strong> .</strong> In the first, the ἔγνωσαν <strong> ἀληθῶς</strong> stamps our Lord’s approval on <em> their</em> knowledge, and distinguishes it from such knowledge as the bare οἴδαμεν [ch. Joh 3:2 ] of Nicodemus and his colleagues.</p>
