<p><strong> 9.</strong> ] Stier remarks, that the Lord <em> here begins to fulfil His promise</em> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:32">Matthew 10:32</span> .

<p><strong> οὐ περὶ τ. κόσμου ἐρ.</strong> ] The misconceptions which have been made of this verse (Calvin, Lampe, and even Luther, who elsewhere corrects himself, see Tholuck on John, edn. 6, p. 352) as implying a decree of exclusion for the vessels of wrath, may be at once removed by considering the usage of <strong> ὁ κόσμος</strong> in this Prayer. The Lord <em> does pray</em> distinctly for ὁ κόσμος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21">John 17:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:23">John 17:23</span> , that they may believe and know that the Father hath sent Him. He cannot therefore mean here that He does not pray (absolutely) for the world, but that He is not <em> now</em> asking for the world, does not pray <em> this thing</em> for the world. <em> These</em> ( οὓς δέδωκάς μοι ) <em> have already</em> believed and known; the prayer for them is therefore a different one, viz. that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:11">John 17:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span> . The mistake would be at once precluded for English readers by the paraphrase, <strong> I am praying for them; I am not praying for the world.

<p><strong> ὅτι σοί εἰσιν</strong> in a fuller sense than σοὶ ἦσαν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:6">John 17:6</span> . That was their <em> preparation for</em> Christ; this is their <em> abiding in</em> Him, which is abiding in the Father, see next verse.</p>
