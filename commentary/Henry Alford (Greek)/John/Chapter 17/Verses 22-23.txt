<p><strong> 22, 23.</strong> ] Grotius and others interpret this <strong> δόξα</strong> <strong> ,</strong> “potestas faciendi miracula,” and refer to ch. Joh 2:11 and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:40">John 11:40</span> ; but wrongly: for if so, the αὐτοῖς must mean the Apostles only, whereas it is distinctly referred to the believers <em> of all time</em> . The δόξα is (Lücke, De Wette, Stier: Meyer understands it of the heavenly glory, Rom 8:17 ) <em> the glory of Christ as the only-begotten Son</em> (ch. Joh 1:14 ), full of grace and truth (see Joh 17:5 and note), which by virtue of His exaltation and the unity of all believers in Him through the Spirit, has become (not, <em> shall be</em> ) theirs, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:6">Ephesians 2:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:30">Romans 8:30</span> ; not yet fully, nor <em> as it is His</em> , but as each can receive and shew it forth. The perfection of it is spoken of, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span> .
	</p>
<p>We have the same recurrences of ἵνα as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21">John 17:21</span> , and the same dependence (see var. readd.). The second of them here expresses not merely the similarity of their unity to that of the Son and Father, but the <em> actuality of its subsistence</em> , in Christ abiding in them and the Father in Christ.

<p><strong> γινώσκῃ</strong> here, parallel as it is to <strong> πιστεύσῃ</strong> above, cannot be interpreted of a bare recognition, or of a recognition at the final judgment, but must be taken to mean that salutary knowledge by which from time to time the children of the world are by God called to become the children of light. See the same words, and note, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:31">John 14:31</span> , also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:35">John 13:35</span> , and observe that in all three places the recognition is that of <em> love;</em> in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:35">John 13:35</span> , of the disciples one to another; in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:31">John 14:31</span> , of Jesus to the Father; here, of the Father to believers, as perfected into unity in the Son of His love.

<p>“Observe,” says Meyer, “how the glance of the Intercessor reaches in these verses even to the highest aim of His work on earth, when the <em> world</em> shall be believing, and Christ Himself actually the Saviour <em> of the world</em> , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:42">John 4:42</span> , cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:16">John 10:16</span> .”</p>
