<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] On Annas, see note <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2">Luke 3:2</span> . The influence of Annas appears to have been very great, and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:6">Acts 4:6</span> , he is called <em> the High Priest</em> , in the year following this. The whole matter is discussed in Friedlieb, Arch. der Leid. § 22. He ends by saying that the narrative evidently rests upon some arrangement with regard to the High Priesthood now unknown to us, but accountable enough by foreign influence and the deterioration of the priestly class through bribes and intrigues, to which Josephus and the Talmud sufficiently testify. This <em> hearing</em> is entirely distinct from that in the other Gospels. <em> There</em> , no questions are asked of Jesus about His disciples or doctrine ( Joh 18:19 ): <em> there</em> witnesses are produced, and the whole proceedings are after a legal form. That hearing was in a public court of justice, before the assembled Sanhedrim; this was a private and informal questioning. That Annas should be so often called ‘the High Priest,’ is no objection to this view: see on Luke as above: see also note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:24">John 18:24</span> . The <em> two</em> hearings are maintained to be <em> one and the same</em> by Luther, Grot., Bengel, Lampe, Tholuck, Lücke, De Wette, Friedlieb, Wordsworth, &amp;c. the view here taken is maintained by Chrys., Aug [243] , Euthym [244] , Olsh., Neander, Baumgarten-Crusius, Meyer, Ebrard, Wieseler, Hase, Lange, Hess, von Meyer, von Gerlach, Luthardt, and Stier (vi. 284, edn. 2).
