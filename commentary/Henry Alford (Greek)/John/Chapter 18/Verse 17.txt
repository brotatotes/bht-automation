<p>This first denial was to all appearance rashly and almost inadvertently made, from a mere feeling of shame. Lücke suggests that Peter may have set himself among the servants of the High Priest <em> to bear out his denial</em> . The μὴ <strong> καὶ σύ</strong> ( Joh 18:25 ), as Luthardt remarks, implies that the other disciple had already been recognized as a follower of Jesus, and had escaped annoyance.</p>
