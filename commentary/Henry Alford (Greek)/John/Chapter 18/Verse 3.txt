<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] See, on this band of men, note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:47">Matthew 26:47</span> . Lücke refers to Dion. Hal. ix. ( ἐξέτρεχον ἅπαντες ἐκ τῶν σκηνῶν ἀθρόοι , φανοὺς ἔχοντες κ . λαμπάδας ) to shew that lanterns and torches were part of the utensils of military on a night march.
	</p>
<p><strong> φανοί</strong> appear to be strictly <strong> torches,</strong> any blazing substance held in the hand; and <strong> λαμπάδες</strong> <strong> , lights,</strong> fed with oil.
	</p>
<p>The weapons were swords and staves, Matt., Mark. The fact of its being full moon did not make the lights unnecessary, as, in searching for a prisoner, they might have to enter dark places.</p>
