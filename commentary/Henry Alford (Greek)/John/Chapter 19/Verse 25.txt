<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:55-56">Matthew 27:55-56</span> [250] , we learn that two of these were looking on afar off, after Jesus had expired, with Salome. Considering then that John’s habit of not naming himself, might extend to his mother (he names his father, ch. Joh 21:2 ), we may well believe that ἡ ἀδελφὴ τ . μητρὸς αὐτοῦ here represents <em> Salome</em> , and that <em> four</em> women are designated by this description. So Wieseler and Meyer, Luthardt opposing them. So also Ewald: and, which is no mean evidence, the Peschito, inserting a καί between αὐτοῦ and Μαρία .

When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .
