<p><strong> 42.</strong> ] <strong> τὴν παρασκ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἰουδ</strong> <strong> .</strong> seems to indicate clearly the παρασκ . <em> of the Passover</em> , as I have before maintained that the words mean; not the mere day of the week so called, which, as it was by the Christians also in the Apostles’ time named παρασκευή , <em> would not be qualified</em> by τῶν Ἰουδ .

<p>The words <strong> ὅτι ἐγγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἦν τὸ μν</strong> <strong> .</strong> certainly at first sight appear as if John were not aware that the tomb belonged to Joseph; but it is more likely that the thought of asking for the body may have been originally suggested to Joseph by his possessing a tomb close to the place of crucifixion, and so ὅτι ἐγγ . ἦν τὸ μν . may have been the real original reason of the whole proceeding: and John, not anxious to record every particular, may have given it as such.</p>
