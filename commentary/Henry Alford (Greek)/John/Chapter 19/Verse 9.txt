<p><strong> πόθεν</strong> i.e. not ‘from what province?’ for he knew this, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:6-7">Luke 23:6-7</span> ; nor, ‘of what parents?’ but <strong> whence?</strong> in reference to υἱὸς θεοῦ : cf. πόθεν γένος εὔχεται εἶναι , Hom. Od. <em> ρ</em> . 373. Observe that the fear of Pilate is not mere superstition, nor does it enter into the Jewish meaning of υἱὸς θ .: but arises from an indefinite impression made on him by the Person and bearing of our Lord. We must not therefore imagine any fear of Him as being a ‘son of the gods,’ in Pilate’s mind (so even Luthardt): this gives a wrong direction to his conduct, and misses the fine psychological truth of the narrative.

<p>Our Lord, in His silence, was acting according to His own precept, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:6">Matthew 7:6</span> . Notwithstanding Pilate’s fear of Him, he was not in earnest; not determined to be led by his conscience, but had already given way to the unjust demands of the people; and He who saw his heart, knew how unworthy he was of an answer to so momentous a question. Besides, this silence was the most emphatic answer to all who had ears to hear it; was a reference to what He had said before, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:37">John 18:37</span> , and so a witness to His divine origin. Would any <em> mere man</em> , of true and upright character, have refused an answer to such a question, so put? Let the modern rationalist consider this.</p>
