<p><strong> 23, 24.</strong> ] <strong> οὖν</strong> goes back to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:18">John 19:18</span> . There were four soldiers, a τετράδιον , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:4">Acts 12:4</span> , <em> and</em> a centurion? “centurio supplicio præpositus,” Seneca de Ira, 16 (Friedlieb).
	</p>
<p>The garments of the executed were by law the perquisite of the soldiers on duty. Dig. xlviii. 20. 6 (Friedlieb).
	</p>
<p>The tunic was the so-called ‘toga ocellata,’ or ‘byssina.’ It reached from the neck to the feet, and was fastened round the throat with a clasp. It was properly a priest’s garment (see Jos. Antt. iii. 7. 4), and was woven of linen, or perhaps of wool (Friedlieb).

<p>The citation is verbatim from the LXX. In it, ἱμάτια = the upper garments, ἱματισμός the tunic. Again, beware of any evasion of ἵνα .</p>
