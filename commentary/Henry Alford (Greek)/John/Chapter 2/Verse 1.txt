<p><strong> Κανᾷ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Γ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:46">John 4:46</span> ; not far from Capernaum. Josephus (Life, § 16) calls it κώμη τῆς Γαλιλαίας . There is a Kanah in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jos+19:28">Joshua 19:28</span> , in the tribe of Asher, which must be distinct from this. Jerome however in his Onomasticon believes it to have been the same. It was the residence, and probably birth-place, of Nathanael. If his calling took place in its neighbourhood, our Lord may have gone on and spent the intervening day at Nazareth.

<p>Dr. Robinson, Bib. Res. iii. 204 ff., satisfactorily establishes that Kâna-el-Jelîl, about 3 hours N. ½ E. from Nazareth, is the site of this miracle. The name is identical, and so stands in the Arabic version of the N.T. He shews this to have been recognized in early tradition, and its honour to have been only recently usurped by Kefr Kenna, a village 1½ hour N.E. from Nazareth, on one of the roads to Tiberias. [See a very interesting description of Kâna-el-Jelîl in “The Land and the Book,” pp. 426, 427.]

He never names either himself, or his own brother, James.</p>
