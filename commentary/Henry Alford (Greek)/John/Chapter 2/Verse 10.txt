<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] The saying of the ἀρχ . is a general one, not applicable to the company then present. We may be sure that the Lord would not have sanctioned, nor ministered to, <em> actual drunkenness</em> . Only those who can conceive <em> this</em> , will find any difficulty here; and they will find difficulties every where.

<p>The account of the practice referred to is, that the palates of men become after a while dull, and cannot distinguish between good wine and bad. Pliny (Nat. Hist. xiv. 13) speaks of persons “qui etiam convivis (vina) alia quam sibimetipsis ministrant, <em> aut procedente mensa subjiciunt</em> .” But the practice <em> here</em> described is not precisely that of which Pliny speaks, nor is there any meanness to be charged on it: it is only that, when a man has some kinds of wine choicer than others, he naturally produces the choicest, to suit the most discriminating taste. With regard to the word <strong> μεθυσθῶσιν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> while there is no reason here to <em> press</em> its ordinary meaning, so neither is there any to shrink from it, as uttered by the ἀρχιτρίκλινος . The safest rendering is that of Tyndall and Cranmer, “ <em> when men be dronke;</em> ” “ <em> cum inebriati fuerint</em> ,” Vulg.</p>
