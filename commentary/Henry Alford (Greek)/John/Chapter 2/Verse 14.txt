<p><strong> ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ</strong> ] In the court of the Gentiles, the ἔξωθεν ἱερόν , as distinguished from the ναός , the inner temple. This market appears to have sprung up since the captivity, with a view to the convenience of those Jews who came from a distance, to provide them with the beasts for offering, and to change their foreign money into the sacred shekel, which alone was allowed to be paid in for the temple capitation-tax (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:24">Matthew 17:24</span> ff.). This tax was sometimes, as in Matt. l. c., paid elsewhere than in Jerusalem; but generally there, and in the temple. The very fact of the market being held there would produce an unseemly mixture of sacred and profane transactions, even setting aside the abuses which would be certain to be mingled with the traffic. It is to the <em> former</em> of these evils that our Lord makes reference in this <em> first</em> cleansing; in the <em> second</em> , to the <em> latter</em> .</p>
