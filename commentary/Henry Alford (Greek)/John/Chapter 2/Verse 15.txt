<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] The <strong> σχοινία</strong> were probably <em> the rushes</em> which were littered down for the cattle to lie on. That our Lord used the scourge on the beasts only, not on the sellers of them, is almost necessarily contained in the form of the sentence here: the τά τε πρόβατα κ . τ . βόας being as it stands with τε and καί , merely epexegetical of πάντας , not conveying new particulars. So that it should be rendered as in A.V.R., “He drove all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen.” ( <strong> ἐξέχεεν</strong> is the aor., not the resolved form of the imperfect: cf. Aristoph. Nub. 75, and see Lobeck’s note on Phryn. p. 222.) It has been imagined, that He dealt more mildly with those who sold the doves, which were for the offerings <em> of the poor</em> . But this was not so: He dealt alike with all. No other way was open with regard to them, than to order them to take their birds away.

<p>This cleansing of the temple was in the direct course of His manifestation as the Messiah. Immediately after the prophetic announcement of the Forerunner, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:1">Malachi 3:1</span> , is that of the Lord’s <em> coming suddenly to His temple, and purifying it</em> . This act also answers (but like the fulfilment last mentioned, only in an <em> imperfect</em> and <em> still prophetic</em> sense) to the declaration of the Baptist “Whose fan is in His hand,” &amp;c., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:12">Matthew 3:12</span> .

<p>His proceeding was not altogether unexampled nor unauthorized, even in an uncommissioned person: for all had the right to reform an abuse of this sort, and the zealots put this right in practice. The disciples by their allusion in Joh 2:17 seem to refer the action to this latter class.</p>
