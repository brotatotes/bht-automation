John himself was most likely present. He does not relate so circumstantially any thing which he had not witnessed.

<p>In this case, there must have been some other reason for the invitation, besides mere previous acquaintance. This would be the probable reason for <em> Jesus Himself</em> being invited; but the <em> disciples</em> , being from various places in the district, can hardly <em> all have been</em> (De Wette) <em> friends of the family</em> . The fact of Jesus having attached disciples to Himself must have been known, and they were doubtless invited <em> from consideration to Him</em> .

<p>Our Lord at once opens His ministry with the character which He gives of himself <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:18-19">Matthew 11:18-19</span> , as distinguished from the asceticism of John. He also, as Trench admirably remarks (Miracles, edn. 2, p. 98, note), gives us his own testimony against the tendency which our indolence ever favours, of giving up those things and occasions to the world and the devil, which we have not Christian boldness to mingle in and purify. Even Cyprian, for instance, proscribes such festivals, “nuptiarum festa improba et convivia lasciva vitentur, quorum periculosa contagio est.” De Habitu Virginum, ch. 21. p. 460. And such is the general verdict of modern religionism, which would keep the leaven distinct from the lump, for fear <em> it</em> should become <em> unleavened</em> . The especial honour conferred upon <em> marriage</em> by the Lord should also be noticed. “He here adorned and beautified it with his presence, and first miracle that He wrought.”</p>
