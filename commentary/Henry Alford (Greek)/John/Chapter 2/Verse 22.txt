<p><strong> 22.</strong> ] <strong> τῇ γραφῇ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> by all analogy, must mean <em> the O.T. scriptures</em> . That the resurrection of the Lord is the subject of O.T. prophecy, we find in several passages of the N.T., see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:9">John 20:9</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:26-27">Luke 24:26-27</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:4">1 Corinthians 15:4</span> . At first sight it appears difficult to fix on any passage in which it is directly announced: but with the deeper understanding of the Scriptures which the Holy Spirit gave the Apostles and still gives the Christian Church, such prophecies as that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:0">Psalms 16:0</span> are recognized as belonging to Him in Whom alone they are properly fulfilled: see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:2">Hosea 6:2</span> .</p>
