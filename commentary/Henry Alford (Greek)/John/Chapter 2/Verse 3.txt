<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] There is no necessity to suppose that the feast had lasted several days, as De Wette and Lücke do. It has been suggested that the unexpected presence of the disciples may have occasioned a failure in the previously sufficient supply: a gloss in the old latin cod. Rhedigerianus has, “ <em> et factum est per multam turbam vocatorum vinum consummari</em> .”

<p>The mother of Jesus evidently is <em> in a position of authority</em> (see Joh 2:5 ) in the house, which was probably that of a near relative. The conjectures and traditions on the subject are many, but wholly unsatisfactory.

<p>A graver question arises as to the intent with which this <strong> οἶνον οὐκ ἔχ</strong> <strong> .</strong> was said. She cannot have had <em> from experience</em> any reason to suppose that her Son would work a miracle, for this ( Joh 2:11 ) <em> was His first</em> . Chrysostom suggests (so also Theophyl., Euthym [38] , and Neander, L. J. p. 271) that, knowing Him to be Who He was, she had been by the recent divine acknowledgment of Him and His calling disciples to Himself, led to expect the manifestation of his Messianic power about this time; and here seemed an occasion for it. Some of the other explanations are: “that she had always found Him a wise counsellor, and mentioned the want to Him merely that He might suggest some way of remedying it.” Cocceius, cited by Trench. “Velim discedas, ut ceteri item discedant, antequam penuria patefiat.” Bengel. “Ut pia aliqua exhortatione convivis tædium eximeret, ac simul levaret pudorem sponsi.” Calvin, cited by Lücke. “Jesus had wrought miracles, but in secret, before this.” Tholuck.

<p>On the whole, the most probable explanation is that of Lücke, which somewhat modifies the first here mentioned, that our Lord Himself had recently given some reason to expect that He would shew forth His glory by wonderful works. So, very nearly, Stier, R. J. i. 38, edn. 2.</p>
