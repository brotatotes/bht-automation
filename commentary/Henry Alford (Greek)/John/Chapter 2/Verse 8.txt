<p><strong> 8.</strong> ] The <strong> ἀρχιτρίκλινος</strong> ( συμποσίαρχος , ἐπιμελητὴς τοῦ συμποσίου , Euthym [39] ) seems to be the same with the ἡγούμενος spoken of, Sirach 35 (32:) 1, and with the Latin <em> rex</em> , or <em> magister, convivii</em> . It would seem (from Sir. l. c.) that he was <em> one of the guests</em> raised to the post of presiding over the arrangements of the feast. This is however doubted by the older Commentators (Severus in the Catena, Lücke, i. 472), who make him not one of the guests, but a person <em> holding this especial office, and attending on feasts</em> . Here, he <em> tastes the wine;</em> and therefore probably was a guest himself. Lücke quotes from Petronius “triclinarches.”
