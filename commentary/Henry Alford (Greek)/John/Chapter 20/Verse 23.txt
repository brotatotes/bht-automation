<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] The <em> present</em> meaning of these words has been spoken of above. They reach forward however beyond that, and extend the grant which they re-assure to all ages of the Church. The words, closely considered, amount to this: that with the gift and real participation of the Holy Spirit, comes the conviction, and therefore the <em> knowledge</em> , of <em> sin</em> , of <em> righteousness</em> , and <em> judgment;</em> and this knowledge becomes more perfect, the more men are filled with the Holy Ghost. Since this is so, they who are pre-eminently filled with His presence are pre-eminently gifted with the discernment of sin and repentance in others, and hence by the Lord’s appointment authorized to pronounce pardon of sin and the contrary. The Apostles had this in an especial manner, and by the full indwelling of the Spirit were enabled to discern the hearts of men, and to give sentence on that discernment: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:1-11">Acts 5:1-11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:21">Acts 8:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:9">Acts 13:9</span> . And this gift belongs to the Church in all ages, and especially to those who by legitimate appointment are set to minister in the Churches of Christ: not <em> by successive delegation</em> from the Apostles, <em> of which fiction I find in the N.T. no trace</em> , but by their mission from Christ, the Bestower of the Spirit for their office, when <em> orderly and legitimately conferred upon them by the various Churches</em> . Not however to them exclusively, though for decency and order it is expedient that the outward and formal declaration should be so: but in proportion as <em> any disciple</em> shall have been filled with the Holy Spirit of wisdom, is the inner discernment, the κρίσις , his.
