<p>The words imply that the marks were no <em> scars</em> , but <em> the veritable wounds themselves;</em> that in His side being large enough for a hand to be thrust into it. This of itself would shew that the resurrection Body was <em> bloodless</em> . It is φέρε κ . ἴδε in the case of the <em> hands</em> , which were exposed but merely φέρε κ . βάλε in the case of the <em> side</em> , which was clothed. So Meyer: but query?

<p><strong> μὴ γ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἄπιστ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> not merely, ‘Do not any longer disbelieve in my Resurrection;’ but <strong> Be not</strong> (do not become) as applied generally to the spiritual life, and the reception of God’s truth <strong> faithless, but believing.</strong> The E. V. is excellent.
