<p><strong> 28.</strong> ] The Socinian view, that these words, ὁ κύρ . μου κ . ὁ θεός μου , are <em> merely an exclamation</em> , is refuted (1) By the fact that no such exclamations were in use among the Jews. (2) By the εἶπεν <strong> αὐτῷ</strong> . (3) By the impossibility of referring ὁ κύριός μου to another than Jesus: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:13">John 20:13</span> . (4) By the N.T. usage of expressing the vocative by the nom. with an article. (5) By the utter psychological absurdity of such a supposition: that one just convinced of the presence of Him whom he deeply loved, should, instead of addressing Him, break out into an irrelevant cry. (6) By the further absurdity of supposing that <em> if such were</em> the case, the Apostle John, who of all the sacred writers most constantly keeps in mind the object for which he is writing, should have recorded any thing so <em> beside that object</em> . (7) By the intimate conjunction of πεπίστευκας see below. Dismissing it therefore, we observe that this is <em> the highest confession of faith which has yet been made;</em> and that it shews that (though not yet <em> fully</em> ) the meaning of the previous confessions of His being ‘ <em> the Son of God</em> ’ was understood. Thus John, in the very close of his Gospel (see on Joh 20:30-31 ) iterates the testimony with which he began it to the Godhead of the Word who became flesh: and by this closing confession, shews how the testimony of Jesus to Himself had gradually deepened and exalted the Apostles’ conviction, from the time when they knew Him only as ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ Ἰωσήφ (ch. Joh 1:46 ), till now when He is acknowledged as their LORD and their GOD.</p>
