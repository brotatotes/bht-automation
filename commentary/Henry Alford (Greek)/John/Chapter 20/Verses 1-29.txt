<p><strong> 1 29.</strong> ] JESUS ALIVE FROM THE DEAD. COMPLETION OF THE DISCIPLESâ€™ FAITH WROUGHT THEREBY. And herein, <strong> 1 18</strong> ] <em> Contrast between His former life, within the conditions of the flesh, and His present, in which His communion with His own partakes of His new relation to the Father</em> . Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:1">Matthew 28:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:1">Mark 16:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:1">Luke 24:1</span> .

<p>On the chronology of the events of the Resurrection, see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:1">Matthew 28:1</span> . <em> I attempt no harmony of the accounts: I</em> <em> believe all such attempts to be fruitless;</em> and <em> I see in their failure strong corroboration of the truth of the evangelic narratives</em> . It is quite impossible that so astounding an event, coming upon various portions of the body of disciples from various quarters and in various forms, should not have been related, by four independent witnesses, in the scattered and fragmentary way in which we now find it. In the depth beneath this varied surface of narration rests the great central fact of the Resurrection itself, unmoved and immoveable. As it was THIS above all other things to which the Apostles bore their testimony, so, in their testimony to this, we have the most remarkable proof of each having faithfully elaborated into narrative those particular facts which came under his own eye or were reported to himself by those concerned. Hence the great diversity in this portion of the narrative: and hence I believe much that is now dark might be explained, were the facts themselves, in their order of occurrence, before us. Till that is the case, (and I am willing to believe that it will be one of our delightful employments hereafter, to trace the <em> true</em> harmony of the Holy Gospels, under His teaching of whom they are the record,) we must be content to walk by faith, and not by sight. We must also remember in this case, that our Evangelist is selecting his points of narration with a special purpose, to shew us how the belief of the disciples was brought out and completed, after the unbelief of Israel: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:30-31">John 20:30-31</span> .</p>
