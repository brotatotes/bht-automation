<p><strong> 4 8.</strong> ] Full of most interesting and characteristic detail. John, probably the younger, outruns Peter; but when there, reverently (not “ <em> ne pollueretur</em> ,” as Wetstein [251] .) abstains from entering the sepulchre. The ardent and impetuous Peter goes directly in John follows and <em> believes</em> . What can exceed the inner truth of this description? And what is <em> not</em> related, is as full of truth as that which is. For, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:6-7">John 20:6-7</span> , we seem to hear the very voice of Peter describing to his companion the inner state of the tomb.

<p>Notice <strong> βλέπει</strong> <strong> ,</strong> of the cursory glance of John, who did not go in, <strong> θεωρεῖ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> of the exhaustive gaze of Peter who did. Notice also that John when he stooped and looked in saw only the ὀθόνια , which seem to have been lying where the Feet were, nearer the entrance, whereas Peter, on going in, saw the σουδάριον which was perhaps deposited further in, near the place of the Head. Nor should, as Meyer observes, the minute distinction of κείμενα τὰ ὀθόνια in Joh 20:5 and τὰ ὀθόνια κείμενα in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:6">John 20:6</span> , be altogether overlooked.</p>
