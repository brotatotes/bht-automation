<p><strong> 1. </strong> <strong> μετὰ ταῦτα</strong> ] Compare ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1">John 5:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:1">John 6:1</span> : <strong> at a subsequent time.

<p><strong> ἐφαν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἑαυτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] This expression is no where else used by John of the Lord’s appearances, but only in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:12">Mark 16:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:14">Mark 16:14</span> . We have however φανέρωσον σεαυτόν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:4">John 7:4</span> ; and ἐφ . τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span> ; and the passive of φανερόω is very usual with him. The use of the verb here indicates that the usual state of the Lord at this time was not manifestation, but invisibility to them.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐπὶ τῆς θ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> elsewhere, see reff., used by John with a <em> dative</em> in this sense.
	</p>
<p>The expression indicates the <em> locality</em> , not the <em> manner</em> , of the appearance; <em> on</em> , i.e. on the shore of the sea of Galilee: see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:25">Matthew 14:25</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐφαν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> δὲ οὕτως</strong> must not be too rashly cited as unlike John’s style. We must remember that, in adding an appendix, expressions of this kind would occur, which the narrative itself would not contain.</p>
