<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] The end of his pastoral office is announced to him: a proof of the πάντα οἶδας which he had just confessed; a contrast to the denial of which he had just been reminded; a proof to be hereafter given of the here recognized genuineness of that love which he had been professing. There is no implied <em> question</em> , as Lücke thinks: the futures are prophetic.

Scorp. 15, vol. ii. p. 151). Such is the traditionary account of the death of Peter, Euseb. ii. 25; iii. 1, where see notes in Heinichen’s edn. Cf. also Prolegg. to 1 Pet. § ii. 9 ff.

<p>Prof. Bleek (Beiträge zur Evangelien-kritik, p. 235, note) suggests an interpretation of this prophecy which is surely contrary to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:19">John 21:19</span> : that the former part, ὅτε ἦς ν .… applies to the life of Peter before his calling, the latter ἐκτενεῖς … to his life in the service of the Lord, who is the ἄλλος who was to strengthen him for his work ( ζώσει ), that he was to stretch out his hands in the sense of his own weakness, not merely in the feebleness of old age (in prayer?), and finally this ἄλλος , the Lord whom he served, would carry him whither he would not, i.e. to a death of martyrdom. But this says nothing of <strong> ποίῳ</strong> θανάτῳ , on which the stress evidently is, and which Bleek, while he recognizes, endeavours to get rid of by strangely supposing the idea to have arisen after the death of Peter.</p>
