<p><strong> 19.</strong> ] This remark is entirely in John’s manner, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:21">John 2:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:6">John 6:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:33">John 12:33</span> ; as may be also the δοξάζειν τ . θ . used of such a death, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:31">John 13:31</span> f.; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span> .

<p><strong> ἀκολούθει μοι</strong> ] Not to be understood I think of any present gesture of the Lord calling Peter aside; but, from the next verse, followed perhaps by a motion of Peter towards Him, in which John joined. The words seem to be a plain reference to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:36">John 13:36</span> ; and the <em> following</em> , a following through the Cross to glory: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:24">Matthew 16:24</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:21">Mark 10:21</span> . Now, however, ἄρας τὸν σταυρόν is omitted. He had made this so plain, that it needed not expressing. There was also a forcible reminding Peter of the first time when he had heard this command on the same shore, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:19">Matthew 4:19</span> .</p>
