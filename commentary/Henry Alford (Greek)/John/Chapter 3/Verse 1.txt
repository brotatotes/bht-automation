<p><strong> 1.</strong> ] We have in the Talmud (see Lightfoot, Hor. Heb. in loc.) a Nicodemus ben Gorion, who was properly called Bonai, and said to have been a disciple of Jesus: but he is found living at the destruction of Jerusalem. This might certainly have been; still it must be quite uncertain whether he be the same with this Nicodemus.

<p>He is mentioned again ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:50">John 7:50</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:39">John 19:39</span> . He was a member of the Sanhedrim ( <strong> ἄρχων</strong> <strong> ,</strong> see reff.), and, besides, a νομοδιδάσκαλος ( Joh 3:10 ).</p>
