<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] I believe the E. V. is right in rendering <strong> ὁ διδ</strong> <strong> .</strong> <strong> a master;</strong> the article is inserted as required by τοῦ before Ἰσραήλ , which is expressed as giving a solemnity to Ἰσρ . as the people of God. Or is it possible that ὁ διδάσκαλος may merely be meant as <em> one of</em> οἱ διδάσκαλοι ? I prefer either of these reasons for the presence of the article, to supposing it to have any emphatic meaning. Nicodemus was manifestly in no supereminent place among the ἄρχοντες : see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:50-52">John 7:50-52</span> . Still less can I with Bp. Middleton, Gr. Art. pp. 242 3, believe any <em> blame conveyed in the title</em> . [Dean Alford afterwards preferred rendering ὁ διδάσκαλος <strong> the teacher;</strong> see N.T. for English Readers, and N.T. Authorized Version Revised.]</p>
