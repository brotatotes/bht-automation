<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] The words <strong> μαρτυρίαν λαμβάνειν</strong> prepared the way for the new idea which is brought forward in this verse <strong> πιστεύειν</strong> <strong> .</strong> Faith is, in the most pregnant sense, ‘the receiving of testimony;’ because it is the making <em> subjectively real</em> the contents of that testimony. So the πιστεύειν <strong> εἰς αὐτόν</strong> [see Joh 3:15 ] is, <em> the full reception of the Lord’s testimony;</em> because the burden of that testimony is, <em> grace and truth and salvation by Himself</em> . This faith is neither reasoning, nor knowledge, but a <em> reception</em> of divine Truth declared by One who came from God; and so it is <em> far above</em> reasoning and knowledge: <strong> πιστεύομεν</strong> above <strong> οἴδαμεν</strong> <strong> .

<p>But what are the <strong> ἐπίγεια</strong> ? The matters relating to the new birth which have hitherto been spoken of; called so because <em> that side of them</em> has been exhibited which is <em> upon earth</em> , and happens among men; ἃ τοῖς ἐπὶ γῆς ἔτι διατρίβουσιν ἀνθρώποις δυνατὰ ὑπάρξαι τε καὶ νοηθῆναι , Origen. That the <em> parable about the wind</em> is not intended, is evident from κ . οὐ <strong> πιστεύετε</strong> <strong> ,</strong> which in that case would be ‘do not <em> understand</em> .’ And the <strong> ἐπουράνια</strong> are the things of which the discourse goes on to treat <em> from this point:</em> viz. the <em> heavenly side</em> of the new birth and salvation of man, in the eternal counsels of God regarding His only-begotten Son.

<p>Stier supposes a reference in this verse to Wis 9:16 , καὶ μόλις εἰκάζομεν τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς , καὶ τὰ ἐν χερσὶν εὑρίσκομεν μετὰ πόνου , τὰ δὲ ἐν οὐρανοῖς τίς ἐξιχνίασεν ;</p>
