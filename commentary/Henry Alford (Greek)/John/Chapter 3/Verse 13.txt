<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] The whole verse seems to have intimate connexion with and reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="pr+30:4">Proverbs 30:4</span> ; and as spoken to a learned doctor of the law, would recall that verse, especially as the further question is there asked, ‘Who hath gathered <em> the wind</em> in His fists?’ ( מִי אָסַף־רוּחַ בּחָפְנָיו ), and ‘What is His name, and what His Son’s name?’ See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+30:12">Deuteronomy 30:12</span> , and the citation, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:6-8">Romans 10:6-8</span> .

<p>All attempts to explain away the plain sense of this verse are futile and ridiculous. The Son of Man, the Lord Jesus, the Word made Flesh, <em> was</em> <em> in, came down from</em> , heaven, and was <em> in heaven</em> (heaven about Him, heaven dwelling on earth, ch. Joh 1:51 ), <em> while here</em> , and ascended up into heaven when He left this earth; and by all these proofs, speaking in the prophetic language of accomplished Redemption, does the Lord establish, that <em> He alone</em> can speak of τὰ ἐπουράνια to men, or convey the blessing of the new birth to them. Be it remembered, that He is here speaking <em> proleptically</em> , of <em> results</em> of His course and sufferings on earth, of the way of regeneration and salvation which God has appointed by Him. He regards therefore throughout the passage, the great facts of redemption <em> as accomplished</em> , and makes announcements which could not be literally acted upon till they had been so accomplished. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14">John 3:14</span> ff., whose sense will be altogether lost, unless this <strong> ἀναβέβηκεν</strong> be understood of His exaltation to be a Prince and a Saviour.

<p><strong> ὁ ὢν ἐν τῷ οὐρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] See ch. Joh 1:18 and note. Doubtless the meaning involves ‘ <em> whose place is in heaven;</em> ’ but it also asserts the <strong> being in heaven</strong> of the <em> time then present:</em> see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:51">John 1:51</span> . Stier (iv. 68, edn. 2) speaks well of the majestic ὁ ὢν ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ , by which the Lord characterizes His whole life in the flesh between the καταβαίνειν and the ἀναβαίνειν . As uniting in Himself God, whose dwelling is heaven, with man whose dwelling is on earth, He ever was in heaven. And nearly connected with this fact is the transition to His being the fountain of eternal life, in Joh 3:14 ff.: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:47-50">1 Corinthians 15:47-50</span> , where the same connexion is strikingly set forth.

<p>To explain such expressions as ἀναβαίνειν εἰς τ . οὐρ ., &amp;c., as mere <em> Hebrew metaphors</em> (Lücke, De Wette, &amp;c.) is no more than saying that Hebrew metaphors were founded on deep insight into divine truth: these words in fact express <em> the truths on which Hebrew metaphors were constructed</em> . Socinus is quite right, when he says that <em> those who take</em> ἀναβ . εἰς τ . οὐ . <em> metaphorically, must in all consistency take</em> ὁ καταβὰς ἐκ τ . οὐρ . <em> metaphorically also;</em> “qualis descensus, talis etiam ascensus.”</p>
