<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] The <strong> κόσμος</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the Gentile world, was according to Jewish ideas to be judged and condemned by the Messiah. This error our Lord here removes. The assertion ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:39">John 9:39</span> , <strong> εἰς κρῖμα</strong> ἐγὼ εἰς τ . κόσ . τοῦτ . ἦλθον , is no contradiction to this. The κρῖμα there, as here, results from the separation of mankind into two classes, those who will and those who will not come to the light; and that result itself is not the <em> purpose why</em> the Son of God came into the world, but is evolved in the accomplishment of the higher purpose, viz. Love, and the salvation of men. Observe, the latter clause does not correspond to the former it is not ἵνα <strong> σώζῃ τὸν κόσμον</strong> , but <strong> ἵνα σωθῇ ὁ κόσμος δι</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> αὐτοῦ</strong> <strong> :</strong> the <em> free will</em> of the κόσμος is by this strikingly set forth, in connexion with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19-20">John 3:19-20</span> . Not that the Lord is not the σωτὴρ τοῦ κόσμου (ch. Joh 4:42 ), but that the peculiar cast of this passage required the other side of the truth to be brought out.</p>
