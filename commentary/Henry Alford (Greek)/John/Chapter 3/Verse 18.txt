<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] On <strong> πιστ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εἰς αὐτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> (which is John’s usual phrase) the remarks above on Joh 3:15 apply with little distinction; εἰς giving more the <em> direction</em> of the belief <em> towards</em> , and its <em> resting upon</em> , ἐν its <em> abiding in</em> , Jesus as the Saviour.
	</p>
<p><strong> οὐ κρίνεται</strong> ] See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span> , where the same assertion is made more fully; and note there.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἤδη κέκριται</strong> <strong> ,</strong> implying, <em> by no positive act of judgment of mine</em> , but by the very nature of things themselves. God has provided a remedy for the deadly bite of sin; this remedy the man has not accepted, not <em> taken:</em> he must then perish in his sins: he is <em> already judged and sentenced</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> μὴ πεπίστευκεν</strong> ] The perfect implies more than ‘that faith is a definite act in time’ (Lücke, De Wette); it sets before us the deliberate choice of the man, q. d. ‘he hath not chosen to believe’ (Lange, in Stier, iv. 93, edn. 2): see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:11-12">2 Thessalonians 2:11-12</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> εἰς τὸ ὄν</strong> <strong> .,</strong> not without meaning: that name was Ἰησοῦς , αὐτὸς γὰρ σώσει τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span> .
	</p>
<p>The <strong> μονογενοῦς</strong> also here sets before us the <em> hopelessness of such a man’s state:</em> he has no <em> other</em> Saviour.</p>
