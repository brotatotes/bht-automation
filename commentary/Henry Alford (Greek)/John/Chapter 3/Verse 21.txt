<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] Who is this <strong> ποιῶν τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀλήθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ? the end of ch. 1 will best explain to us, ἐν ᾧ δόλος οὐκ ἔστιν , see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:15">Luke 8:15</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+15:0">Psalms 15:0</span> . The πράσσων πονηρά is crooked and perverse; he has a light, which he does not follow; he knows the light, and avoids it; and so there is no truth, singleness, in him; he is a man at variance with himself. But the simple and single-minded is he who knowing and approving the light, comes to it; and comes that he may be carried onward in this spirit of truth and single-mindedness to higher degrees of communion with and likeness to God. “The good man seeks the light, and to place his works in the light, not from a vain love of praise, but from a desire for communion wherein he finds strength and security,” De Wette. But this is not all: the <em> manifesting his works, that they are wrought in God</em> , is and can be only by the candle of the Lord being kindled within him, and he himself born again in the Kingdom of God: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+139:23-24">Psalms 139:23-24</span> .

<p>We hear nothing of the effect produced on Nicodemus by this interview. It certainly did not alienate him from Jesus, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:50">John 7:50</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:39">John 19:39</span> , also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:42">John 12:42</span> . “It speaks for the simplicity and historic truthfulness of our Evangelist, that he adds nothing more, and even leaves untold the immediate result which the discourse had.” (Baumgarten-Crusius, in Stier, iv. 102, edn. 2.)</p>
