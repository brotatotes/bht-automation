<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] The circumstances under which this dispute arose seem to have been these: John and our Lord were baptizing near to one another. (On the relation of their baptisms, see below on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:26">John 3:26</span> .) They were both watched jealously (see ch. Joh 4:1 ) by the Pharisees. One of these ( <strong> Ἰουδαῖος</strong> <strong> ,</strong> i.e. Ἰουδ . τις ) appears to have entered into dispute with the disciples of John about the relative importance of the two baptisms; <em> they</em> perhaps maintaining that their master’s καθαρισμός preparatory to the Messiah was absolutely necessary for all, and <em> he</em> (the Ἰουδαῖος ) pointing out to them the apparent inconsistency of this Messiah himself authorizing a baptism in his name, and alleging that if so, their master’s baptism was rendered superfluous. We are driven to these conjectures, because the text gives us no further insight into the fact than that the circumstances and the answer of John render probable.</p>
