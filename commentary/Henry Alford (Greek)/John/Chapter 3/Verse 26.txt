<p><strong> πάντες ἔρχ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Not, probably, any who had been baptized already by John; but multitudes of persons. The baptism now carried on by the disciples appears to have stood very much in the same position as that of John. It was preparatory to the <em> public ministry</em> of our Lord <em> properly so called</em> , which began in Galilee after the imprisonment of John. It was <em> not accompanied with the gift of the Spirit</em> , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span> . As John’s commission was now on the wane, so our Lord’s was expanding. The solemn cleansing of the temple was its opening; and now it is proceeding onwards, gathering multitudes around it (see ch. Joh 4:1 ).</p>
