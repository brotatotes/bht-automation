<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] We are not to imagine that any thing is wanting to complete the sense or connexion. Our Lord replies, It is not <em> learning</em> , but <em> life</em> , that is wanted for the Messiah’s Kingdom; and <em> life</em> must begin by <em> birth</em> . Luther (Stier, iv. 17, edn. 2) says: “My teaching is not of <em> doing</em> and <em> leaving undone</em> , but of a <em> change in the man</em> ( <em> nicht von Thun und Lassen, fondern von Werden</em> ); so that it is, not <em> new works</em> done, but a <em> new man</em> to do them; not another <em> life</em> only, but another <em> birth</em> .” And <em> only by this means</em> can Nicodemus gain the teaching for which he is come, <strong> ἰδεῖν</strong> τ . β . τ . θ ., ‘become a disciple of Christ:’ <strong> ἴδοι</strong> <strong> ,</strong> τουτέστι νοήσοι , Thl., ‘ <em> understand, by sharing</em> ’ ‘have any conception of.’

<p><strong> ἄνωθεν</strong> οἱ μὲν “ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ” φασιν , οἱ “ ἐξ ἀρχῆς .” Chr [44] , who, as also Euthym [45] , explains <strong> γεν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἄνωθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> by παλιγγενεσία : Orig [46] , Cyr [47] , and Thl. taking the other meaning.

<p>The true meaning is to be found by taking into account the answer of Nicodemus, who obviously understood it of a <em> new birth in mature life</em> . <strong> Born afresh</strong> would be a better rendering than ‘born <em> again</em> ,’ being closer to the meaning of ἄνωθεν , ‘from the very beginning;’ ‘unless a man begin his life anew altogether ( πἁλιν ἄνωθεν , Gal 4:9 ), he cannot’ &amp;c.
	</p>
<p>It is not impossible that the other meaning may <em> lie beneath this</em> , as the βασιλεία is <strong> τοῦ θεοῦ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> and so must the birth be; but Grotius has remarked that in Hebrew and Aramaic (in one of which languages our Lord, discoursing with a Rabbinical Jew, probably spoke) there is no word of double meaning corresponding to ἄνωθεν : so that He must have expressed it, as Nicodemus understood it, of an <em> entirely new</em> birth. That John never uses the word elsewhere in this sense (Lücke) is here of little weight, for he uses it only three times more, and never with a verb cognate to γεννάομαι . The Evangelist most likely chose the Greek expression <strong> γεν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἄνωθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> as strictly corresponding to the term ἀναγεννᾶσθαι , which, when he wrote, was in common use in the Church: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:23">1 Peter 1:23</span> . Justin Martyr, as Bp. Wordsworth reminds us, quotes as our Lord’s saying, Apol. i. 61, p. 79, ἆν μὴ ἀναγεννήθητε , οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς τ . βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν : probably mixing this with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:3">Matthew 18:3</span> .
