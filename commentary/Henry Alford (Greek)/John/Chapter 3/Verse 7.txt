<p><strong> 7.</strong> ] The weightiest word here is <strong> ὑμᾶς</strong> <strong> .</strong> The Lord did not, could not, say this of <em> Himself</em> . Why? Because in the full sense in which the flesh is incapacitated from entering the kingdom of God, He was <em> not born of the flesh</em> . He inherited the weakness of the flesh, but His spirit was not, like that of sinful man, alien from holiness and God; and therefore on Him no second birth passed; when the Holy Spirit descended on Him at His baptism, the words spoken by the Father were indicative of <em> past approval</em> , not of <em> renewal</em> . His obedience was accepted as perfect, and the good pleasure of the Father rested on Him. Therefore He includes not Himself in this necessity for the new birth.

<p>The <strong> μὴ θαυμάσῃς</strong> applies to the next verse, in which Nicodemus is told that he has things as wonderful around him every day in the natural world.</p>
