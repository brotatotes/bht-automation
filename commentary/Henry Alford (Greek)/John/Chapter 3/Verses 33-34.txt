<p>ὁ λαβὼν αὐτοῦ τὴν μαρτυρίαν καὶ πιστεύων αὐτῷ , ἐβεβαίωσεν , ἔδειξεν , ὅτι ὁ θεὸς ἀληθής ἐστιν ὁ ἀποστείλας αὐτόν , οὕτινός ἐστι τὰ ῥήματα ἃ λαλεῖ · ὁ δὲ μὴ λαβὼν αὐτὴν καὶ ἀπιστῶν αὐτῷ , τοὐναντίον ποιεῖ , καὶ οὐδὲν ἕτερον ἢ προδήλως θεομαχεῖ . Euthym [57]

<p><strong> ἀληθής</strong> <strong> ,</strong> not as Wetstein, “Deum veracem esse, et quæ per Prophetas promiserat, præstitisse;” this does not suit the context, and besides would require πιστός , not ἀληθής (see 1Jn 1:9 ): but, as above from Euthym [58] , <strong> true.

<p><strong> οὐ γὰρ ἐκ μ</strong> <strong> .…</strong> ] Seeing that the contrast is between the <em> unlimited</em> gift of the Spirit to Him that comes from above, and the <em> limited</em> participation of Him by those who are of the earth; we must not understand the assertion generally, but supply αὐτῷ , as has usually been done, after <strong> δίδωσιν</strong> <strong> .</strong> “Spiritus sanctus non habitavit super Prophetas, nisi mensura quadam; quidam enim librum unum, quidam duos vaticiniorum ediderunt.” (Vajikra Rabba, in Wetstein.) This unmeasured pouring of the Spirit on Him accounts for his speaking the words of God.</p>
