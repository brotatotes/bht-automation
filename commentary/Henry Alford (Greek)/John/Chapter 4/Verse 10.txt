<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] The important words <strong> the gift of God</strong> have been misunderstood by many Commentators. Some suppose them to mean ‘ <em> our Lord himself</em> ,’ and to be in apposition with the next clause, καὶ τίς ἐστιν κ . τ . λ . Others, ‘ <em> this opportunity of speaking with me</em> .’ Doubtless both these meanings <em> are involved</em> , especially the former: but <em> neither of them is the primary one</em> , as addressed to the woman. The WATER <em> is, in this first part of the discourse, the subject</em> , and serves as a point of connexion, whereby the woman’s thoughts may be elevated, and her desire aroused. The process of the discourse in this particular is similar to that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:17">Acts 14:17</span> . From recognizing <em> this water</em> as the gift of God, in its <em> limitation</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:13">John 4:13</span> , and its <em> parabolic import</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:14">John 4:14</span> , her view is directed to Him who was speaking with her, and the Gift which He should bestow, THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37-39">John 7:37-39</span> .

<p><strong> τίς ἐστιν</strong> ] These pregnant words form the <em> second step</em> in our Lord’s declaration. He who speaks with thee is no ordinary Ἰουδαῖος , nor any ordinary man, but One who can give thee the gift of God; One sent from God, and God Himself. All this lies in the words, which however only serve to arouse in the woman’s mind the question of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:12">John 4:12</span> (see below).

<p><strong> ὕδωρ ζῶν</strong> ] Designedly used in a double sense by our Lord, that the woman may lay hold of the <em> material</em> meaning, and by it be awakened to the <em> higher one</em> (see reff.). The words bring with them, and in our Lord’s inner meaning involved, the performance of all such prophetic promises as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:25">Ezekiel 36:25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:1">Zechariah 13:1</span> (see also Jer 2:13 ); but, as regarded the woman, the <em> ordinary sense</em> was that intended for her to fasten on, which she does accordingly. On the question, how this living water could be <em> now</em> given, before Jesus was glorified, see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:38-39">John 7:38-39</span> .</p>
