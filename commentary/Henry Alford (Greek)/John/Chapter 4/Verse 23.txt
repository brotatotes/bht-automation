<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] The discourse returns to the ground taken in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:21">John 4:21</span> , but not so as to make Joh 4:22 parenthetical only: the spiritual worship now to be spoken of is the carrying out and consequence of the σωτηρία just mentioned, and could not have been brought in without it.

<p><strong> οἱ ἀληθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> προσκ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , as distinguished (1) from <em> hypocrites</em> , who have pretended to worship Him: (2) from <em> all</em> who went before, whose worship was necessarily imperfect.
	</p>
<p>The <strong> ἐν πνεύματι καὶ ἀληθείᾳ</strong> (not without an allusion to <strong> ἐν τούτῳ τῷ ὄρει</strong> ) is, in its first meaning, opposed to ἐν ἔθει καὶ ψεύδει , and denotes the <em> earnestness of spirit</em> with which the true worshippers shall worship: so Ps. 144:18, ἐγγὺς κύριος πᾶσιν τοῖς ἐπικαλουμένοις αὐτὸν <strong> ἐν ἀληθείᾳ</strong> . A deeper meaning is brought out where the ground of this kind of worship is stated, in the next verse.
	</p>
<p><strong> ζητεῖ</strong> not only ‘requires,’ from His very nature, <strong> but seeks, is seeking</strong> . This seeking on the part of the Father naturally brings in the idea, in the woman’s answer, of the Messiah, <em> by Whom</em> He seeks ( Luk 19:10 ) His true worshippers to gather them out of the world.
	</p>
<p><strong> τοὺς προσκ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The construction is, the Father is seeking for such to be οἱ προσκυνοῦντες αὐτόν , ‘ <em> for</em> οἱ προσκ . αὐτ . <em> of this kind</em> .’
	</p>
<p><strong> τοιούτους</strong> <em> may be</em> the predicate ‘ <em> such the Father seeketh his worshippers to be</em> :’ or it may be the object ‘ <em> such the Father seeketh as</em> (or <em> to be</em> ) <em> his worshippers</em> .’</p>
