<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] These words again seem uttered under a complicated feeling. From her λαλιά , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:29">John 4:29</span> , she certainly had some suspicion (in her own mind, perhaps over and beyond His own assertion of the fact: but see note there) that He who had told her all things, &amp;c., <em> was the Christ;</em> and from her breaking in with this remark after the weighty truth which had been just spoken, it seems as if she thought thus, ‘ <em> How these matters may be, I cannot understand; they will be all made clear when the Christ shall come</em> .’ The question of Joh 4:20 had not been answered to her liking or expectation: she therefore puts aside, as it were, what has been said, by a remark on that suspicion which was arising in her mind. It is not certain what expectations the Samaritans had regarding the Messiah. The view here advanced might be well derived from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span> ; and the name, and much that belonged to it, might have been borrowed from the Jews originally.

<p><strong> ὁ λεγόμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> χριστός</strong> appear to me to be the words of the woman, <em> not of the Evangelist;</em> for in this latter case he would certainly have used ὁ μεσσίας again in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:29">John 4:29</span> . See also the difference of expression where he inserts an interpretation, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:42">John 1:42</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:13">John 19:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:17">John 19:17</span> . It is possible that the name ὁ χριστός had become common in popular parlance, like many other Greek words and names.
