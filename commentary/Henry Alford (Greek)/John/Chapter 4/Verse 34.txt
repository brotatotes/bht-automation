<p><strong> 34.</strong> ] Christ alone could properly say these words. In the believer on Him, they are partially true, true as far as he has received the Spirit, and entered into the spiritual life; but in Him they were absolutely and fully true. His whole life was the doing of the Father’s will. We can ‘eat and drink, &amp;c. to the glory of God,’ but in Him the hallowing of the Father’s name, doing His will, bringing about His Kingdom, was His <em> daily bread</em> , and superseded the thoughts and desires for the other, needful as <em> it</em> was for His humanity.

<p><strong> ἵνα</strong> is not = ὅτι . The latter would imply what was true (but not here expressed), that <em> the absolute doing</em> , &amp;c. was His food; as it now stands, it implies that it was His food to <em> carry onward</em> to completion that work: to be ever, step after step, having regard to its being completed. <strong> My meat is</strong> (not <em> to do</em> , as E. V., but) <strong> that I may do</strong> , &amp;c. In the <strong> τελειώσω αὐτοῦ τὸ ἔργον</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the way is prepared for the idea introduced in the next verse. These words give an answer to the questioning in the minds of the disciples, and shew <em> that He had been employed in the Father’s work during their absence</em> .</p>
