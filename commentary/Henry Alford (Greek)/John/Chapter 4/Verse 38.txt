<p><strong> 38.</strong> ] Here, as often, our Lord speaks of the office and its work as <em> accomplished</em> , which is but beginning (see Isa 46:10 ).
	</p>
<p>By <strong> ἄλλοι</strong> here He cannot mean the O.T. Prophets (Grotius, Bengel, Lange), for then His own place would be altogether left out; and besides, all Scripture analogy is against the idea of the O.T. being the <em> seed</em> of which the N.T. is the <em> fruit:</em> nor can it be <em> right</em> , as Olshausen maintains, to leave Him out, as being the <em> Lord of the Harvest:</em> for He is certainly <em> elsewhere</em> , and was by the very nature of the case <em> here, the Sower</em> . The plural is I believe merely inserted as the correspondent word to ὑμεῖς in the explanation, as it was ἄλλος ἄλλος , in the proverb. (So Lücke, Tholuck, Stier. De Wette denies their interpretation, but gives none of his own.)</p>
