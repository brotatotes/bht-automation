<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] Robinson (iii. 112) can only solve the difficulty of the present well standing in a spot watered by so many natural fountains, by supposing that it may have been dug, according to the practice of the patriarchs, by Jacob, in connexion with the plot of ground which he brought, to have an independent supply of water.

<p><strong> οὕτως</strong> see reff. refers to <strong> κεκοπιακὼς ἐκ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὁδ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , and may be rendered <strong> accordingly</strong> . There is no authority for the meaning ἁπλῶς ὡς ἔτυχε , ‘just as he was,’ or ‘just as it happened,’ i.e. on the bare stone.

<p><strong> ὥρα</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> ἕκτη</strong> <strong> , mid-day</strong> . Townson supposed the sixth hour, according to John, to mean <em> six in the evening</em> , “after the way of reckoning in Asia Minor;” but, as Lücke observes (i. 580), this way of reckoning in Asia Minor is a pure invention of Townson’s. A decisive answer however to such a supposition here, or any where else in our Evangelist, is, that he would naturally have specified whether it was 6 A.M. or P.M. The <em> unusualness</em> of a woman coming to draw water at mid-day is no argument against its <em> possibility;</em> indeed the very fact of her being <em> alone</em> seems to shew that it was not the common time. This purely arbitrary hypothesis of St. John’s way of reckoning the hours has been recently again upheld by Bp. Wordsworth: but it has only harmonistic grounds to rest on. The passage which he urges as supporting it, Martyr. Polycarp, c. 21, p. 1044, ed. Migne, does not in reality give it the least countenance. The ὥρα ὀγδόη there mentioned is much more probably according to the usual Roman computation.</p>
