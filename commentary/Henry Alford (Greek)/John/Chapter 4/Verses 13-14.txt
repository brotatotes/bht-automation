<p><strong> 13, 14.</strong> ] Our Lord, without noticing this, by His answer leaves it to be implied, that, <em> assuming what she has stated</em> , He <em> is greater</em> than Jacob: for his (Jacob’s) gift was of water which cannot satisfy: but the water which He should give has <em> living power</em> , and becomes an eternal fountain within. This however, ‘that <em> He was greater than Jacob</em> ,’ lies only in the background: <em> the water</em> is the subject, as before.
	</p>
<p>The words apply to every similar quenching of desire by earthly means: the desire springs up again; is not <em> satisfied</em> , but only <em> postponed</em> . The manna was as insufficient to satisfy hunger, as this water, thirst, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:49">John 6:49</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:58">John 6:58</span> : it is only the ὕδωρ <strong> ζῶν</strong> , and the ἄρτος <strong> τῆς ζωῆς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> which can <em> satisfy</em> .
	</p>
<p>The <strong> ὁ πίνων</strong> sets forth the recurrence, the interrupted seasons, of the drinking of earthly water; the <strong> ὃς δ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἂν πίῃ</strong> the <em> once having tasted</em> , and ever continuing in the increasing power, and living forth-flowing, of that life-long draught.
	</p>
<p><strong> οὐ μὴ διψήσει</strong> <strong> ,</strong> shall never have to go away and be exhausted, and come again to be filled; but shall have the spring at home, in his own breast, so that he can “ <em> draw water with joy out of the wells of salvation</em> ” ( Isa 12:3 ) at his pleasure. “Ubi sitis recurrit, hominis, non aquæ, defectus est.” Bengel.

<p><strong> γενήσεται πηγή</strong> ] All earthly supplies have access only into those lower parts of our being where the desires <em> work themselves out</em> are but <em> local applications;</em> but the heavenly gift of spiritual life which Jesus gives to those who believe on Him, enters into the <em> very secret</em> and <em> highest place of their personal life</em> , the <em> source whence the desires spring out;</em> and, its nature being living and spiritual, it does not merely <em> supply</em> , but it <em> lives</em> and waxes onward, unto everlasting life, <em> in duration</em> , and also <em> as producing and sustaining it</em> .

<p>It should not be overlooked, that this discourse had, besides its manifold and wonderful meaning for us all, an especial moral one as applied to the woman, who, by successive draughts at the ‘broken cistern’ of carnal lust, had been vainly seeking solace: and this consideration serves to bind on the following verses (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:16">John 4:16</span> ff.) to the preceding, by another link besides those noticed below.</p>
