<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] The ground of the charge is now shifted; and by these last words ( Joh 5:17 ), occasion is given for one of our Lord’s most weighty discourses.

<p>The Jews understood His words to mean nothing short of <em> peculiar personal</em> <em> Sonship</em> , and thus equality of nature with God. And that this their understanding <em> was the right one</em> , the discourse testifies. <em> All might in one sense</em> , and <em> the Jews did in a closer sense</em> , call God <em> their</em> , or <em> our, Father;</em> but they at once said that the individual use of ‘MY FATHER’ by Jesus had a totally distinct, and in their view a blasphemous, meaning: this latter especially, because He thus made God a participator in his crime of breaking the sabbath. Thus we obtain from the adversaries of the faith a most important statement of one of its highest and holiest doctrines.</p>
