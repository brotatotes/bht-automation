<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] This being so, the end of all is, <em> the honour of the Father in and by the Son</em> . He (the Son) is the Lord of life, and the Judge of the world; all must honour Him with equal honour to that which they pay to the Father: and whosoever does not, however he may imagine that he honours or approaches God, does not honour him at all; because <em> He can only be known or honoured by us as</em> ‘THE FATHER WHO SENT HIS SON.’</p>
