<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] What follows, to Joh 5:30 incl., is an expansion of the two assertions in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21-22">John 5:21-22</span> , the <strong> ζωοποιεῖν</strong> and the <strong> κρίνειν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> intimately bound up as they are together. There is a parallelism in Joh 5:24-25 which should be noticed for the right understanding of the words. ὁ τὸν λόγον μου <strong> ἀκούων</strong> in one, answers to οἱ νεκροὶ <strong> ἀκούσονται</strong> τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ in the other. It is a kind of <em> hearing</em> which awakens to life, one accompanied by πιστεύειν τῷ πέμψαντί με . And this last is not barely ‘Him who sent Me,’ but Him, <em> the very essence of belief in Whom is in this</em> , THAT HE SENT ME (see ch. Joh 12:44 ). And the <em> dative</em> here after πιστεύω expresses that belief in the <em> testimony</em> of God that He hath sent His Son, which is dwelt on so much <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:9-12">1 John 5:9-12</span> , where, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:10">John 5:10</span> , we have the same ὁ μὴ πιστεύων τῷ θεῷ .

<p><strong> ἔχει ζ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αἰ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] So <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:12-13">1 John 5:12-13</span> . The <strong> πιστεύων</strong> and the <strong> ἔχει ζ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αἰ</strong> <strong> .</strong> are <em> commensurate:</em> where the faith is, the possession of eternal life is: and when the one remits, the other is forfeited. But here the faith is set before us as an <em> enduring</em> faith, and its effects described <em> in their completion</em> (see Eph 1:19-20 ).

<p><strong> εἰς κρίσιν οὐκ ἔρχεται</strong> <strong> ,</strong> κρίσις being the <em> separation</em> , the effect of which is to gather out of the Kingdom <em> all that offendeth;</em> and thus regarding especially the <em> damnatory</em> part of judgment, he who believes <em> comes not into</em> , has no concern with, κρίσις . Compare Psa 142:2 LXX. The reckoning which ends with εὖ ἀγαθὲ δοῦλε , is not κρίσις : <em> the reward is of free grace</em> . In this sense, the believers in Christ will not be judged according to their works: they are justified before God by faith, and <em> by God</em> θεὸς ὁ δικαιῶν , τίς ὁ κατακρίνων ; Their ‘passage over’ from death into life <em> has already taken place</em> , from the state of spiritual death into that ζωὴ αἰώνιος , which in their believing state they ἔχουσι already. It is to be observed that our Lord speaks in very similar terms of the unbelieving being <em> condemned already</em> , in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:18">John 3:18</span> .
