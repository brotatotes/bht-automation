<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] This verse continues to refer to <em> spiritual</em> awakening from the dead. The <strong> ἔρχεται ὥρα κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> νῦν ἐστιν</strong> is an expression (see ref.) used of those things which are to characterize the spiritual Kingdom of Christ, which was even now begun among men, but not yet brought (until the day of Pentecost, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:0">Acts 2:0</span> ) to its completion. Thus <strong> it cometh,</strong> in its fulness, and <strong> even now is begun.

<p><strong> οἱ νεκροί</strong> <strong> ,</strong> in reference to ἐκ θανάτον of the preceding verse <strong> the</strong> <em> spiritually</em> <strong> dead:</strong> see below on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28">John 5:28</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> τῆς φωνῆς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> His <em> call to awake</em> , in its widest and deepest sense; by His own preaching, by His Apostles, His ministers, &amp;c. &amp;c. In all these He speaks to the spiritually dead.
	</p>
<p><strong> οἱ ἀκούσ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Not ἀκούσαντες <em> merely</em> , which would be ‘and having heard it, shall live:’ but <strong> οἱ</strong> ἀκούσ ., <strong> and</strong> THEY WHO <strong> have heard it</strong> (or, <strong> who hear it) shall live.</strong> <em> This determines the verse to be spoken of spiritual, not bodily</em> awakening.
	</p>
<p><strong> οἱ ἀκούσαντες</strong> are the persons to whom the Lord cried so often ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν , ἀκουέτω : the persons who stand opposed to those addressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:40">John 5:40</span> , οὐ θέλετε ἐλθεῖν πρός με , ἴνα ζωὴν ἔχητε .
	</p>
<p><strong> ζήσουσιν</strong> is explained in the next verse.</p>
