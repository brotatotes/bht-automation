<p><strong> 35.</strong> ] This <strong> ἦν</strong> shews, as Stier rightly observes, that John <em> was now cast into prison</em> , if not executed.

<p><strong> ὁ λύχνος</strong> ] The article has been taken by some (e.g. Bengel, Lücke, Stier) to point to the prophecies concerning John. But we have no passage in the O.T. which designates Elias in such terms. In ref. Sirach we read of him, ἀνέστη προφήτης ὡς πῦρ , καὶ ὁ λόγος αὐτοῦ ὡς λαμπὰς ἐκαίετο , which Stier thinks may be referred to here. We may, as indeed he also suggests, believe that those words represent or gave rise to a common way of speaking of Elias, as certain Rabbis were called ‘The candle of the Law,’ &amp;c. (Lightf.) De Wette takes the article as meaning, ‘ <em> the lamp which was to lead you</em> ,’ &amp;c.

And even those few who remained true to him, did not follow his direction to Christ. For the mass of the people, and their leaders, his mission was in vain (Lücke, ii. 75).</p>
