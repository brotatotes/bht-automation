This <strong> ἄλλος</strong> is in strong contrast with the ἄλλος of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:32">John 5:32</span> . ‘The testimony of that Other, who is greater than I, ye will not receive; but if another come in his own name, him ye will receive.’ The words are perhaps spoken primarily of the false or Idol-Messiah, the Antichrist, who shall appear in the latter days ( 2Th 2:8-12 ); whose appearance shall be κατ ʼ ἐνέργειαν τοῦ σατανᾶ (their <em> father</em> , ch. Joh 8:44 ), <strong> ἀποδεικνὺς ἑαυτὸν ὅτι ἐστὶν θεός</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:4">2 Thessalonians 2:4</span> ; and doubtless, <em> in</em> that their final reference, embrace also all the cases in which the Jews <em> have</em> more or less <em> received</em> those false Messiahs who have been foreshadowers of the great Antichrist, and indeed all the cases in which <em> such a spirit</em> has been shewn by them, even in the absence of false Messiahs.</p>
