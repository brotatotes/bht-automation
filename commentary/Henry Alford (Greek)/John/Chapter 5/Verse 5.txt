<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] There are two ways of taking the construction of <strong> ἔχων</strong> <strong> :</strong> (1) to regard ἔχων ἐν τῇ ἀσθ . as = ἀσθενῶς ἔχων , and τριάκοντα ὀκτὼ ἔτη as the <em> accus. of duration;</em> which is objectionable on account of the article τῇ , (not on account of the present participle, as De Wette, for it is often found with duration of time,) and as being alien from John’s usage, which is (2) to place ἔχω in this sense with <em> an accusative of the time:</em> see reff., and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:6">John 5:6</span> . So that the construction is ἔχων τριάκ . ὀκτὼ ἔτη ἐν τῇ ἀσθ .
