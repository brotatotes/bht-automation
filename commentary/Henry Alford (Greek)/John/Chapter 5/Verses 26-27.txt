<p><strong> 26, 27.</strong> ] We have here again ζωοποιεῖν and κρίνειν bound together as the two great departments of the Son’s working; the former, as substantiating the ζήσουσιν just uttered; the latter, as leading on to the great announcement of the next verse. But the two departments spring from <em> two distinct sources</em> , united in the Person of the Incarnate Son of God. The Father hath given Him to have life in Himself, <em> as He is</em> THE SON OF GOD. <em> We</em> have none of us <em> life in ourselves: in Him</em> we live and move and have our being. But He, as the Father is, is the <em> source</em> of Life. Then again the Father hath given Him power to pass judgment, <em> because He is</em> THE SON OF MAN; man is to be judged by Man, by that Man whom God hath appointed, who is the inclusive Head of humanity, and to whom mankind, and man’s <em> world</em> , pertain by right of covenant-purchase. This κρίσιν <strong> ποιεῖν</strong> leads the thought to the <em> great occasion</em> when judgment shall be executed; which accordingly is treated of in the next verse.</p>
