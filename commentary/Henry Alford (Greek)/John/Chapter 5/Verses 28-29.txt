<p><strong> 28, 29.</strong> ] <strong> μὴ θαυμ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> as ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:7">John 3:7</span> , introduces a matter of even <em> greater</em> wonder to them; the astounding proof which shall be given in the face of the universe that this is so.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἔρχεται ὥρα</strong> <strong> ,</strong> but not καὶ νῦν ἐστιν this time, because He is <em> now speaking</em> of the great day of the resurrection: when not merely οἱ νεκροί , but <strong> πάντες οἱ ἐν τοῖς μνημείοις</strong> <strong> ,</strong> shall hear His voice, and <strong> οἱ</strong> ἀκούσαντες are not specified, because <em> all</em> shall <em> hear</em> in the fullest sense. Observe that here, as elsewhere, when the judgment according to <em> works</em> is spoken of, it is the great <em> general</em> resurrection of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31-46">Matthew 25:31-46</span> , which (and the notes) compare. So here we have not οἱ πιστεύσαντες and οἱ μὴ πιστεύσαντες , but the categories reach far wider, including indeed in this most general form the first resurrection unto life also and the two great classes are described as <strong> οἱ τὰ ἀγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ποιήσαντες</strong> and <strong> οἱ τὰ φαῦλα πράξαντες</strong> <strong> .
	</strong></p>
<p>On the difference between ποιεω and πράσσω , see note on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:20-21">John 3:20-21</span> .
	</p>
<p>Observe, that <strong> ζωή</strong> and <strong> κρίσις</strong> stand opposed here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span> : not that there is <em> no such thing</em> as an ἀνάστασις θανάτου (Schleiermacher, in Stier, iv. 194, edn. 2), but that <em> it is involved</em> in this κρίσις .
	</p>
<p>Olshausen observes (ii. 153) that this, and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:15">Acts 24:15</span> , are the only <em> direct</em> declarations in the N.T. of a <em> bodily resurrection of the unjust</em> as well as of the just. It is implied in some places, e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:28">Matthew 10:28</span> , and less plamly in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34">Matthew 25:34</span> ff.: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+20:5">Revelation 20:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+20:12">Revelation 20:12</span> , and directly asserted in the O.T., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+12:2">Daniel 12:2</span> . In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:0">1 Corinthians 15:0</span> , as the object was to convince <em> believers in Christ</em> of the truth of the resurrection of <em> their</em> bodies, no allusion is made to those who are not believers.</p>
