<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] <strong> ἐργάζ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> imperative: another instance of the construction which I have advocated in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:39">John 5:39</span> .
	</p>
<p>The E. V., ‘ <em> Labour not for</em> ,’ does not give the sense of ἐργάζ . They had not <em> laboured</em> in this case for the βρῶσις ἀπολλυμένη , but it had been furnished miraculously. A better rendering would be, <strong> Busy not yourselves about</strong> , <strong> Do not weary yourselves for,</strong> which they were doing, by thus coming after our Lord: [but best of all <strong> Work not for:</strong> so as to preserve the connexion between <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:27">John 6:27</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:29-30">John 6:29-30</span> .]
	</p>
<p><strong> τὴνἀπολλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> “ <em> whose nourishing power passes away</em> ,” De Wette. Rather perhaps more literally, <strong> which perisheth</strong> , E. V.: the <em> useless</em> part of it, in being cast out; the <em> useful</em> , in becoming part of the body which perishes (see 1Co 6:13 ).
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀλλὰ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> βρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] It is important to bear in mind that the ἐργάζεσθαι spoken of above, which also applies to this, was not a ‘ <em> working for</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> bringing about of</em> ,’ but a following Christ in order to obtain. So the meaning will be, <strong> but seek to obtain</strong> , by following after Me.… And thus μὴ .… ἀγγά keeps its true literal force, <strong> Do not.… but.

<p><strong> τὴν μένουσαν εἰς ζ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αἰ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:14">John 4:14</span> . If this βρῶσις <em> remains to eternal life</em> , it must be <em> spiritual food</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἣν</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> δώσει</strong> ] See ch. 4 ib. <strong> ἥν</strong> agrees with <strong> βρῶσιν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> not with <strong> ζωήν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> δώσει</strong> <strong> ,</strong> future, because the great Sacrifice was not yet offered: so in ch. 4.
	</p>
<p><strong> ὁ υἱὸς τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀνθρ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> emphatic here and belonging to this discourse, since it is of His <em> Flesh</em> that He is about to speak.
	</p>
<p><strong> τοῦτον γὰρ</strong> <strong> .…</strong> ] <strong> for Him the Father sealed, even God</strong> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐσφράγ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> by <em> undoubted testimony</em> , as at His baptism; and since, <em> by His miracles</em> , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:36">John 10:36</span> : not, ‘stamped with the image of His Person,’ which is altogether beside the present subject, and inconsistent with the meaning of σφραγίζω .</p>
