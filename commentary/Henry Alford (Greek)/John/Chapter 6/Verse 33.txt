<p><strong> 33.</strong> ] <strong> ὁ ἄρτος τοῦ θεοῦ</strong> = ὁ ἄρτος ὃν δίδωσιν ὁ πατήρ μου . The words <strong> ὁ καταβ</strong> <strong> …</strong> are the predicate of ὁ ἄρτος , and do <em> not apply, in the construction of this verse, to Christ personally</em> , however truly they apply to Him in fact. The E. V. is here wrong: it should be, <strong> The bread of God is</strong> <em> that</em> (not <em> He</em> ) <strong> which cometh,</strong> &amp;c. <em> Not</em> <em> till </em> Joh 6:35 does Jesus first say, ‘I AM the bread of life.’ The <em> manna</em> is still kept in view ὅταν κατέβη ἡ δρόσος … <strong> κατέβαινεν</strong> τὸ μάννα ἐπ ʼ αὐτῆς , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:9">Numbers 11:9</span> . And the present participle, here used in reference to the manna, is dropped when the Lord Himself is spoken of: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:38">John 6:38</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:41">John 6:41</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:58">John 6:58</span> , and especially the distinction between Joh 6:50 and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span> (so Lücke, De Wette, Stier, Bengel).</p>
