<p><strong> 35.</strong> ] As in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:30">John 5:30</span> , so here, our Lord passes from the indirect to the direct form of speech. Henceforward it is ‘I,’ ‘Me,’ throughout the discourse.

<p>In the genitive <strong> τῆς ζωῆς</strong> is implied ὁ καταβὰς ἐκ τοῦ οὐρ . καὶ ζωὴν διδοὺς τῷ κόσμῳ . So ὕδωρ ζῶν in ch. 4.

<p>On the assurance of <em> never hungering or thirsting</em> , see note at ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:14">John 4:14</span> . It is possible that our Lord placed the all-satisfying bread of life in contrast to the manna, which was <em> no sooner given</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:0">Exodus 16:0</span> , <em> than</em> the people <em> began to thirst</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+17:0">Exodus 17:0</span> ; but I would not lay any stress on this.

<p><strong> ὁ ἐρχόμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐμέ</strong> is in the same sense as in ch. Joh 5:40 that of acceptance of and faith in Him.</p>
