<p><strong> 49.</strong> ] <em> That</em> bread from heaven had no power to keep off death, and that, <em> death owing to unbelief:</em> our Lord by thus mentioning οἱ πατέρες <strong> ὑμῶν</strong> and their death, certainly hints at the <em> similar unbelief</em> of these Jews. And the same dubious sense of ἀποθάνῃ prevails in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:50">John 6:50</span> . Death is regarded as being swallowed up in the glory of the resurrection, and the second death which was hidden in the former ἀπέθανον has over him who eats this Bread of Life, <em> no power:</em> nay, he is brought, even <em> here</em> , into a resurrection state from sin and death: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:0">Romans 6:0</span> . init. and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+3:0">Colossians 3:0</span> init.</p>
