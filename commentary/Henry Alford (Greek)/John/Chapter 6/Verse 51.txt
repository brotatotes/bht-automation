<p><strong> καὶ ὁ ἄρτος</strong> <strong> .…</strong> ] From this time we hear no more of ἄρτος : this figure is dropped, and the reality takes its place.
	</p>
<p>Some difficult questions arise regarding the sense and reference of this saying of our Lord. (1) Does it refer to HIS DEATH? and, (2) is there any reference to the ORDINANCE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER?
	</p>
<p>(1) In treating this question I must at once reject all metaphorical and side-interpretations, as, that the <em> teaching</em> of Christ is the Bread, and to be <em> taught by Him</em> is feeding upon it (so Grotius, and the modern rationalists): that the <em> divine Nature of Christ</em> , or His <em> sending of the Holy Spirit</em> , or His <em> whole life of doing good on earth</em> , can be meant: all such have against them the plain sense of the words, which, as Stier observes, are <em> very simple ordinary words;</em> the only difficulty arising, when we come to enquire into their application to His own Person. The Bread of Life is <em> Himself:</em> and, strictly treated, when we come to enquire <em> what</em> , of that body, soul, and spirit, which constituted Himself, this Bread specifically is, we have His answer that it is <em> His Flesh</em> which He will give (for this will be the meaning, whether the words ἣν ἐγὼ δώσω are to be regarded as part of the text or not) on behalf of the life of the world. We are then specifically directed to <em> His Flesh</em> as the answer.
	</p>
<p>Then, <em> what does that Flesh import?</em> The flesh of animals is the ordinary food of men; but <em> not the blood</em> . The blood, which is the life, is spilt at death, and is not in the flesh when eaten by us. Now this distinction must be carefully borne in mind. The <em> flesh</em> here, (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:53">John 6:53</span> ,) and the <em> eating of the flesh, are distinct from the blood</em> , and <em> the drinking of the blood</em> . We have no generalities merely, to interpret as we please: but the terms used are <em> precise and technical</em> . It is then <em> only through or after the Death of the Lord</em> , that by any propriety of language, His Flesh could be said to be eaten.
	</p>
<p>Then another distinction must be remembered: The flesh of animals which we eat is <em> dead</em> flesh. It is already the prey of corruption; we eat it, and die ( Joh 6:49 ). But <em> this</em> Bread is <em> living Bread;</em> not dead flesh, but living Flesh. And therefore <em> manducation by the teeth materially is not to be thought of</em> here; but some kind of eating by which the <em> living Flesh of the Son of God</em> is made the <em> living sustenance</em> of those who partake of it. Now His Flesh and Blood were <em> sundered</em> by Death. Death was the shedding of His precious Blood, which <em> He did not afterwards resume:</em> see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:27">John 20:27</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:39">Luke 24:39</span> . His Flesh is the glorified substance of His Resurrection-Body, now at the right hand of God. It is then in His <em> Resurrection form only</em> that His Flesh can be eaten, and be living food for the living man. I cannot therefore see how <em> any thing short of His Death</em> can be here meant. By that Death, He has given His Flesh for the <em> life of the world:</em> not merely that <em> they who believe on Him</em> may, in the highest sense, have life; but that <strong> ὁ κόσμος</strong> may have life. <em> The very existence of all the created world</em> is owing to, and held together by, that Resurrection-Body of the Lord. In Him <em> all things</em> are gathered together and reconciled to God: τὰ πάντα ἐν αὐτῷ <strong> συνέστηκεν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:17">Colossians 1:17</span> .
	</p>
<p>(2) The question <em> whether there is here any reference to the</em> ORDINANCE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER, has been <em> inaccurately put</em> . When cleared of inaccuracy in terms, it will mean, <em> Is the subject here dwelt upon, the same as that which is set forth in the ordinance of the Lord’s Supper?</em> And of this there can surely be no doubt. To the <em> ordinance itself</em> , there is here <em> no reference;</em> nor <em> could</em> there well have been any. But the spiritual verity which underlies the ordinance is one and the same with that here insisted on; and so considered, the discourse is, as generally treated, most important towards a right understanding of the ordinance.

<p>On the <em> history</em> of the exegesis of this passage, see Lücke ii pp. 149 159 (3rd edn.), and Excursus ii., in his 2nd edn. (omitted in his 3rd); also Tholuck and Olshausen, in loc. To attempt to recount the various opinions, would exceed the limits of a note in an edition of the whole Testament: for the present subject is one in which the manifold dogmatical variations of individual belief have influenced Commentators to such an extent as to render accurate classification impossible. I may roughly state, that three leading opinions may be traced: that of those who hold ( α ) that <em> no reference</em> to the Holy Communion is intended, among whom are Origen and Basil, of the ancients; and of the moderns, the Swiss Reformers, Zwingle and Calvin (the former however not very decidedly, see Olsh. ii. 173 note), Luther, Melanchthon. ( β ) That the whole passage regards <em> exclusively</em> the Holy Communion, among whom are Chrysostom, Cyril, Theophylact, Euthymius, the Schoolmen, and the Roman Catholic expositors, with a few exceptions. ( γ ) That the <em> subject</em> and <em> idea</em> of the Holy Communion, not the ordinance is referred to: to which class belong the best modern Commentators in Germany, e.g. Lücke, Tholuck, Olshausen, Stier. Bengel’s note to the same effect is important: “Jesus verba sua scienter ita formavit, ut statim et semper illa quidem de spirituali fruitione sui agerent proprie; sed posthac eadem consequenter etiam in augustissimum S. Cœnæ mysterium, quum id institutum foret, convenirent. Etenim ipsam rem hoc sermone propositam in S. Cœnam contulit; tantique hoc sacramentum est momenti, ut facile existimari possit, Jesum, ut proditionem Judæ <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:71">John 6:71</span> , et mortem suam hoc versu, ita etiam S. Cœnam, de qua inter hæc verba certissime secum cogitavit, uno ante anno prædixisse, ut discipuli possent prædictionis postea recordari. Tota hæc de carne et sanguine J. C. oratio Passionem spectat, et cum ea S. Cœnam. Hinc separata carnis et sanguinis mentio constanter. Nam in passione sanguis ex corpore eductus est, Agnusque mactatus.”</p>
