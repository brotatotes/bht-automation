<p><strong> 53.</strong> ] Our Lord not only ratifies their φαγεῖν , but adds to it a more wonderful thing; that they must also do that against which a prohibition might seem to have existed from Noah downwards, <em> drink His Blood</em> . But observe, this Blood is not to be <em> eaten</em> in the Flesh, <em> which was the forbidden thing</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:4">Genesis 9:4</span> ; Lev 17:10-16 ), in its strict literal form: but to be <em> drunk</em> , separate from the flesh: again <em> presupposing death</em> . Now as the Flesh of Christ (see above) is the Resurrection-Body which He now has, and in which all things consist: so is His Blood (“the blood is the <em> life</em> .” <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+17:11">Leviticus 17:11</span> ; Lev 17:14 ) the Life which He gave up, paid down, as the penalty for the sin of the world. By the shedding, pouring forth, of that Blood, is remission of sin.

<p>It is quite impossible that these words should, as De Wette maintains, be merely an expansion of τὴν σάρκα φαγεῖν . Even had the idea of τὸ αἷμα πίνειν been one familiar to the Jews, the construction would not have allowed such an interpretation; but <em> new as it was</em> , and <em> abhorrent from their habits and law</em> , we must regard it as specially and purposely added.
	</p>
<p>But <em> what</em> is this eating and drinking? Clearly, not <em> merely faith:</em> for faith answers to the <em> hand reached forth for the food</em> , but is <em> not the act of eating</em> . Faith is a <em> necessary condition</em> of the act: so that we can hardly say with Augustine, “crede, et manducasti;” but ‘crede et manducabis.’ Inasmuch as Faith will necessarily in its energizing lead to this partaking, we sometimes incorrectly say that it <em> is</em> Faith: but for strict accuracy this is not enough. To eat the flesh of Christ, is <em> to realize, in our inward life, the mystery of His Body now in heaven</em> , <em> to digest and assimilate our own portion in that Body</em> .
	</p>
<p>To drink His Blood, is <em> to realize, in our inward life, the mystery of His satisfaction for sin, to digest and assimilate our own portion in that satisfaction, the outpouring of that Blood</em> . And both these definitions may be gathered into one, which is: The eating of His Flesh and drinking of His Blood import the making to ourselves and using as <em> objectively real</em> , those two great Truths of our Redemption in Him, of which our Faith <em> subjectively</em> convinces us.
	</p>
<p>And of this realizing of Faith He has been pleased to appoint certain symbols in the Holy Communion, which He has commanded to be received; to signify to us the spiritual process, and to assist us towards it.

<p><strong> οὐκ ἔχ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ζωὴν ἐν ἑαυτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] ‘Ye have not in you that spring of life, which shall overcome death, and lead ( Joh 6:54 ) to the resurrection in the true sense:’ see above, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44">John 6:44</span> , and notice again the solemn <em> refrain</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> τρώγων</strong> ] It is not necessary to see any more literal ‘eating’ in the word than in φαγών : it expresses the <em> present</em> of φαγών , which must be either τρώγων or ἐσθίων , and the real sense conveyed is, that by the very act of inward realization, which is the ‘manducatio,’ the possession of eternal life is certified.</p>
