<p><strong> 55.</strong> ] <strong> ἀληθής</strong> is here not = ἡ ἀληθινή , nor is the sense, ‘ <em> My Flesh is the true meat</em> &amp;c.,’ but <strong> My flesh is true meat</strong> , i.e. <em> really</em> TO BE EATEN, which they doubted. Thus ἀληθῶς is a gloss, which falls short of the depth of the adjective. This verse is decisive against all explaining away or metaphorizing the passage. Food and drink are not here mere metaphors; rather are our common material food and drink mere shadows and imperfect types of this only real reception of refreshment and nourishment into the being.</p>
