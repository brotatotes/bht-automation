<p><strong> 62.</strong> ] <strong> ἐὰν οὖν θεωρ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> <strong> what then, if ye see</strong> … not meaning ‘ <em> will ye not then be much more scandalized?</em> ’ or, ‘ <em> what will ye say</em> (or <em> do</em> ), <em> then?</em> ’ but appealing to an event which they should witness, as a <em> certain proof of one part</em> of the σκληρὸς λόγος , with which indeed <em> the rest of it was bound up</em> , His having <em> descended from heaven</em> . All attempts (as those of Lücke, De Wette, and others) to explain this otherwise than of His ascent into heaven, are simply <em> dishonest</em> , and spring from laxity of belief in the historical reality of that event. That it is not recorded by John, is of no moment here: see Prolegomena. And that none but the Twelve saw it, is unimportant; for how do we know that our Lord was not here speaking to some among the Twelve? To explain it of His <em> death</em> , as part of His going up where He was before, is hardly less disingenuous. Lücke maintains that θεωρεῖν need not mean bodily sight: which is true enough in some constructions in John (ch. Joh 8:51 alli [94] .); but surely, as joined with ἀναβαίνοντα , it must. The whole exegesis of the passage in the above-named Commentators is a remarkable instance of the warping of the judgment by unsoundness of belief in the historical truth of the evangelistic testimony.
