<p><strong> 69.</strong> ] <strong> πεπιστεύκαμεν</strong> seems to be used absolutely, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:64">John 6:64</span> : <strong> we believe, and have long done so</strong> .

<p>In the following words the readings vary; the common text having been to all appearance introduced from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:16">Matthew 16:16</span> . The circumstance of the Lord not being elsewhere called ὁ ἅγιος τ . θεοῦ by John, is of course <em> in favour</em> of the reading. The idea however is found (ch. Joh 10:36 ). I regard the coincidence with the testimony of the dæmoniacs, reff. Mark [95] , as a remarkable one. <em> Their</em> words appear to have been the first plain declaration of the fact, and so to have laid hold on the attention of the Apostles.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [95] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .</p>
