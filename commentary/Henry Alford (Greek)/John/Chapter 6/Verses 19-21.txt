<p><strong> 19 21. </strong> <strong> περ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐπὶ τῆς θαλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] There surely can be no question in the mind of an unprejudiced reader, that it is John’s intention to relate a <em> miracle;</em> nor again, that there could be in the minds of the disciples <em> no doubt about</em> that miracle, <em> no chance of a mistake</em> as to what they saw. I have treated of <strong> ἐπὶ τῆς θαλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:25">Matthew 14:25</span> .

<p>They were afraid: but upon being reassured by His voice, they were willing to take Him into the ship; and upon their doing so, the ship in a comparatively short time (or perhaps <em> immediately, by miracle</em> , but I prefer the other) was at the land to which they had been going, viz. by the storm ceasing, and the ship making smooth way ( ἐκόπασεν ὁ ἄνεμος , Matt., Mark).
	</p>
<p>It seems to me that the above interpretation of <strong> ἤθελον οὖν λαβεῖν</strong> is absolutely necessary to account for the <strong> οὖν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> and quite in accordance with John’s usage of θέλω (see reff.).
	</p>
<p>Some of the German Commentators (even De Wette among them) have created a difficulty, by strangely rendering ἤθελον , ‘ <em> they wished</em> ’ (implying, ‘ <em> but did not</em> ’), <em> but</em> ( καί ) <em> the ship was immediately</em> , &amp;c. i.e. they were already close to the land, and so there was no occasion. Prof. Bleek (Beiträge, pp. 103 4) half adopts this view: adding to it, I am sorry to see, that perhaps Jesus was on the land, and the disciples in the storm and darkness thought Him to be on the sea.</p>
