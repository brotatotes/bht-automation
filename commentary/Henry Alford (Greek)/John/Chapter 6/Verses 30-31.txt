<p><strong> 30, 31.</strong> ] This answers to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:12">John 4:12</span> , ‘ <em> Art thou greater than our father Jacob</em> ,’ &amp;c. It is spoken in unbelief and opposition; not, as many have supposed, as a request for the Bread of Life, meaning <em> it</em> by the sign, but in the ordinary sign seeking spirit of the Jews. Stier says well, “They have been hesitating between better and worse thoughts, till at last unbelief prevails.” The <strong> σημεῖον</strong> here demanded is the <em> sign from heaven</em> , the proof of the sealing by God; such a proof would be, in their estimation, compared with His present miracles, as the manna (bread <em> from heaven</em> ) was, compared to the multiplied loaves and fishes.

<p>The manna was extolled by the Jews as the greatest miracle of Moses. Josephus calls it θεῖον καὶ παράδοξον βρῶμα : see also Wis 16:20-21 . “They forgot that their fathers disbelieved Moses almost from the time when they began to eat the manna; and that the Psalm from which they quote most strongly sets forth this; that they despised the manna, and preferred ordinary meat to it.” Stier.

<p>Observe our Lord’s πιστ . <strong> εἰς</strong> and their πιστ . <strong> σοι</strong> <strong> .</strong> The former, the casting their whole hopes and faith on Him, is what He requires: but they will not even give the latter, common credence, to Him.

<p>Their <strong> τί ἐργάζῃ</strong> ; Meyer remarks, is a retort of our Lord’s command, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:27">John 6:27</span> . There is no σύ expressed, but the stress is on the <strong> τί</strong> <strong> .</strong></p>
