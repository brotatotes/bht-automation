<p><strong> 38 40.</strong> ] His reception of men is not capricious, nor even of His own arbitrary choice; but as He came into the world to do the Father’s will, and that will is that all who come to Him by faith shall have life, so He receives <em> all such;</em> loses none of them; and will raise them all up (here, <em> in the fullest</em> and <em> blessed sense</em> ) at the last day. ( <strong> ἀπολέσω</strong> again is not ‘ <em> destroy</em> ,’ ‘ <em> condemn</em> ,’ but <strong> lose:</strong> see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:25">John 12:25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:12">John 17:12</span> . ἵνα μὴ ἐξ ἐμῆς αἰτίας ἀπόληταί τις , Euthym [92] ) Olshausen remarks, that “in ch. 4 we had only the inexhaustible refreshing of the <em> soul</em> by the water of life; but this discourse goes further; that not even death itself shall destroy the <em> body</em> of him who has been nourished by this bread of life” (ii. 167).

<p><strong> ἀναστήσω</strong> refers to the only resurrection which is the completion of the man in his glorified state; it does not set aside the ἀνάστασις κρίσεως , but that very term is a debasement of ἀνάστασις : its true sense is only ἀνάστασις ζωῆς .

<p>Bengel has beautifully given the connexion of this last promise with what went before: “hic finis est, ultra quem periculum nullum.” But there is much more than this in it. In this declaration ( Joh 6:39-40 ) is contained the key of the following discourse, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44-59">John 6:44-59</span> . The <em> end</em> of the work of God, as regards man, is the glorification of his restored and sanctified nature, <em> body, soul, and spirit</em> , in eternity. Without this, salvation, restitution, would be incomplete. The adoption cannot be consummated without the redemption of the body. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18-23">Romans 8:18-23</span> . And the glorification of the body, soul, and spirit, of the whole man, cannot take place but by means of <em> the glorified Body of the second Adam</em> . “He who does not see this, will never understand either the Holy Communion, or this testimony of the Lord in its inner meaning.” Stier, iv. 243, edn. 2.

<p>The <strong> θεωρῶν</strong> here is a different thing from the mere ὁρᾶν of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:36">John 6:36</span> . It is the awakening of the attention preparatory to faith, answering to the looking on the serpent of brass: τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς τῆς ψυχῆς , Euthym [93] ; but afterwards he makes the θεωρεῖν = πιστεύειν , to which it is only preparatory.
