<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] Here only does our Lord call His teaching διδαχή , as being now among the διδάσκαλοι , the Rabbis, in the temple. It is often so called by the Evangelists, see reff.

<p>The words may bear two meanings: either, ‘ <em> the sense of Scripture which I teach is not my own, but that in which it was originally penned as a revelation from God;</em> ’ or, <strong> My teaching</strong> (generally) <strong> is not</strong> mine, but that <strong> of Him who sent me</strong> . The latter is preferable, as agreeing better with what follows, and because the former assumes that He was expounding Scripture, which, though probable, is not asserted.</p>
