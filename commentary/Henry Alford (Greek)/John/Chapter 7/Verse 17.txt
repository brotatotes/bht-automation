<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] <strong> θέλειν τὸ θέλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ποιεῖν</strong> is equivalent to τὴν ἀγάπην τοῦ θεοῦ ἔχειν ἐν ἑαυτοῖς , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:42">John 5:42</span> . The <strong> θέλειν</strong> should not have been slurred over in the E. V., for it is important. <strong> If any man’s will be, to do His will</strong> , &amp;c. As it now stands in the E. V., <em> a wrong idea is conveyed:</em> that the <em> bare performance of God’s outward commands</em> will give a man sufficient acquaintance with Christian doctrine: whereas what our Lord asserts to the Jews is, that if the <em> will</em> be set in His ways, if a man be really anxious to do the will of God, and thus to fulfil this first great commandment of the law, be, as Meyer expresses it, in ethical harmony with God, the singleness of purpose, and subjection to the will of God, will lead him on to faith in the promised and then apparent Messiah, and to a just discrimination of the divine character of his teaching.</p>
