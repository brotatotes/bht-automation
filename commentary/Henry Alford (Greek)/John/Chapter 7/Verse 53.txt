<p><strong> 53.</strong> ] The circumstance that this verse is included in the dubious passage is remarkable, and seems to shew, as remarked above, that the doubt <em> has not arisen from the ethical difficulty</em> , as Aug [118] hints (var. readd.), for then the passage would have begun with ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:1">John 8:1</span> . Nor can this verse have been expunged to keep up the connexion with ch. Joh 8:12 for that is just as good <em> with it</em> , if understood, as usually, of the members of the Sanhedrim. We must now regard it as fragmentary, forming the beginning of the account of the woman taken in adultery. It is therefore not clear to what the words apply. Taken in conjunction with what follows (see on ch. Joh 8:5 ), I should say that they indicate some time during the last days of the Lordâ€™s ministry, when He spent the nights on the Mount of Olives, as the date of the occurrence. Certainly the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:0">Luke 21:0</span> . seems to be its fitter place.
