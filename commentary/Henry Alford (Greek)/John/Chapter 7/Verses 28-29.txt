<p><strong> κἀμὲ οἴδατε</strong> <strong> .…</strong> ] It has been questioned whether these words are to be taken ironically, interrogatively, or affirmatively. I incline to the last view, for this reason: obviously no very high degree of knowledge <strong> whence He was</strong> is implied, for they knew not Him that sent Him (see also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:14">John 8:14</span> ; Joh 8:19 ), and therefore could not know <strong> whence He was</strong> , in this sense. The answer is made <em> in their own sense:</em> they knew that He was from Nazareth in Galilee, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:41">John 7:41</span> , and probably that He was called the son of Joseph. In this sense they knew <strong> whence He was;</strong> but further than this they knew not.

<p><strong> καὶ ἀπ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἐμ</strong> <strong> … and moreover and</strong> besides this not = <em> but</em> .
	</p>
<p>The sense of <strong> ἀληθινός</strong> must be gathered from the context. <strong> I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is</strong> ἀληθινός <strong> ye know Him not; I know Him, for I came from Him, and He sent Me</strong> . The matter here impressed on them is the <em> genuineness</em> , the <em> reality</em> of the fact: that Jesus <em> was sent</em> , and <em> there was one who sent Him</em> , though they knew Him not, and consequently knew not πόθεν ἐστίν . The nearest English word would be real: but this would not convey the meaning perspicuously to the ordinary mind; perhaps the E. V. <strong> true</strong> is better, provided it be explained to mean <em> objectively</em> , not <em> subjectively</em> , true: <strong> really existent</strong> , not ‘ <em> truthful</em> ,’ which it may be questioned whether the word ἀληθινός will bear, although it is so maintained by Euthym [112] , Cyril, Chrys., Theophylact, Lampe, Baumgarten-Crusius, Tholuck, and many others. See on this, ch. Joh 8:16 and note. With the <strong> δέ</strong> of the re [113] . omitted the sense becomes more emphatic. It was probably inserted on account of the apparent want of connexion, as has been the case very frequently throughout the Gospel. We have here an instance of a usage of ἐκεῖνος which is very common in St. John, as emphasizing the main subject, not (as more commonly) diverting the attention to one more removed. In ignorance of this usage, Hilgenfeld, “Die Evangelia nach ihrer Entstehung, u. s. w.,” has argued from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:35">John 19:35</span> , that the writer of this Gospel cannot himself have been an eye-witness of the crucifixion, because he there distinguishes that witness by ἐκεῖνος from himself. In consequence of this assertion, an article appeared in the Stud. u. Kritik. for 1859, pt. 3, by G. E. Steiss, in which the use of ἐκεῖνος by St. John is gone into, and Hilgenfeld’s mistake (which Köstlin had committed before him) was exposed. Referring to that article for the full treatment of the subject, I merely cite from among many other instances of the usage, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:33">John 1:33</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:11">John 5:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:57">John 6:57</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1">John 10:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:48">John 12:48</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:12">John 14:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:21">John 14:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span> .
