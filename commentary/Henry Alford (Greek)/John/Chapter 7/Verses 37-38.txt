<p><strong> 37, 38.</strong> ] It is not certain what is meant by this <strong> ἡ ἐσχ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡ μεγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> The command, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+23:34-35">Leviticus 23:34-35</span> , was to keep the feast seven days; the <em> first</em> to be a solemn assembly and a feast-sabbath, then on the <em> eighth</em> day another solemn assembly and a feast-sabbath: so also ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+23:39">Leviticus 23:39</span> . (But in Deu 16:13 nothing is said of the <em> eighth</em> day.) In Neh 8:18 the feast is kept seven days, and on the eighth is a solemn assembly, “ <em> according unto the manner</em> .” In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+29:12-38">Numbers 29:12-38</span> , where minute directions are given for every day of the feast, the eighth day is reckoned in, as usual. Josephus, Antt. iii. 10. 4, gives a similar account. In 2Ma 10:6 , we read ἡμέρας ὀκτώ , σκηνωμάτων τρόπον . But the eighth day was not properly one of the <em> feast days;</em> the people ceased to dwell in the tabernacles on the seventh day. Philo says of it, ἑπτὰ δὲ ἡμέραις ὀγδόην ἐπισφραγίζεται , καλέσας ἐξόδιον αὐτήν , οὐκ ἐκείνης ὡς ἔοικε μόνον τῆς ἑορτῆς , ἀλλὰ πασῶν τῶν ἐτησίων ὅσας καθηριθμήσαμεν · τελευταία γὰρ ἐστι τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ . De Septenario, § 24. And though this, as Lücke observes (ii. 224), may be pure conjecture, it is valuable, as shewing <em> the fact</em> the reason of which is conjectured; viz. that the <em> eighth day was held in more than ordinary estimation</em> . The <em> eighth</em> day then seems here to be meant, and <strong> the last of the feast</strong> to be popularly used, as in some of the citations above. But a difficulty attends this view. Our Lord certainly seems to allude here to the custom which prevailed during the seven days of the feast, of a priest bringing water in a golden vessel from the pool of Siloam with a jubilant procession to the temple, standing on the altar and pouring it out there, together with wine, while meantime the Hallel (Psalms 113-118.) was sung. This practice was by some supposed as the dwelling in tabernacles represented their life in the desert of old to refer to the striking of the rock by Moses: by others, to the rain, for which they then prayed, for the seed of the ensuing year: by the elder Rabbis (Maimonides, cited by Stier, iv. 331, edn. 2), to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+12:3">Isaiah 12:3</span> , and the effusion of the Holy Spirit in the days of the Messiah. But it was universally agreed (with the single exception of the testimony of R. Juda Hakkadosh, quoted in the tract Succa, which itself distinctly asserts the contrary), that on the eighth day this ceremony <em> did not</em> take place. Now, out of this difficulty I would extract what I believe to be the right interpretation. It <em> was</em> the eighth day, and the pouring of water <em> did not</em> take place. But is therefore (as Lücke will have it) all allusion to the ceremony excluded? I think not: nay, I believe it is the more natural. For seven days the ceremony had been performed, and the Hallel sung. On the eighth day the Hallel was sung, but the outpouring of the water did not take place: “desideraverunt aliquid.” ‘ <em> Then Jesus stood and cried</em> , &amp;c.’ Was not this the most natural time? Was it not probable that He would have said it at such a time, rather even than while the ceremony itself was going on?

<p>An attempt has been made to alter the punctuation thus: ἐάν τις διψᾷ , ἐρχέσθω πρός με , καὶ πινέτω ὁ πιστεύων εἰς ἐμέ · καθὼς εἶπεν ἡ γρ ., ποταμοὶ κ . τ . λ . Of this I can only say, that it is surprising to me how any one accustomed to the style of our Evangelist can for a moment suppose it possible. The harshness of καὶ πινέτω ὁ π . εἰς ἐμέ is beyond all example. The ordinary punctuation, making ὁ πισ . εἰς ἐμέ a nom. abs., see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39">John 6:39</span> , is the <em> only admissible one</em> , even were it beset with far greater difficulties than it is. (The punctuation above mentioned is strongly upheld against this note in Stier, edn. 2. In spite of what he there says, I cannot think it can ever make way among Biblical scholars. It introduces <em> two subjects</em> into the first part of the sentence, viz. ὁ διψῶν and ὁ πιστεύων εἰς ἐμέ , to the utter confusion of both sense and metaphor. The distinction, insisted on by Stier, between the believer on Christ, who was not only to <em> come</em> , but to <em> drink</em> , and the people at the feast, who only witnessed the outpouring of the water, and which he gives as a reason why πινέτω must stand emphatically <em> before</em> ὁ πιστ . its qualifying subject, will be quite as marked with the usual punctuation: nay even more so.)

<p>On the first clauses, see notes on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:13-14">John 4:13-14</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> καθὼς εἶπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡ γρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] These words must apply to ποταμοὶ ἐκ τ . κ .…, since ὁ πιστ . εἰς ἐμέ could not form part of the citation. But we look in vain for such a text in the O.T., and an apocryphal or lost canonical book is out of the question.

<p>I believe the citation to be intimately connected with the ceremony referred to, and that we must look for its place by consulting the passages where the <em> flowing out of water from the temple</em> (see above) is spoken of. The most remarkable of these is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+47:1-12">Ezekiel 47:1-12</span> . There a ποταμός of water of life (see Joh 7:9 especially) <em> flows from under the threshold of the temple</em> . Again in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:8">Zechariah 14:8</span> , ἐξελεύσεται ὕδωρ ζῶν ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ . I believe these expressions to be all to which the citation applies, and the ἐκ τῆς κοιλίας αὐτοῦ to be the interpretation of the corresponding words in the prophecies. For the temple was symbolic (see ch. Joh 2:21 ) of the Body of the Lord; and the Spirit which dwells in and flows forth from His glorified Body, dwells in and flows forth from His people also, who are made like unto Him, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:6">Galatians 4:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9-11">Romans 8:9-11</span> :<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span> .</p>
