<p>1.] John <em> never elsewhere mentions the Mount of Olives</em> (not even in ch. Joh 18:1 ): and when he introduces a new place, it is his habit to give explanations (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:45">John 1:45</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:2">John 5:2</span> , and λεγομένην ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:5">John 4:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:13">John 19:13</span> ; Joh 19:17 ). (Stier, who says (iv. 348, edn. 2), “The simple answer to Alford’s remark is, <em> that John here, and here only, mentions the Mt. of Olives</em> ,” omits all allusion to this habit of the Evangelist, which <em> alone gives weight</em> to my remark.)

<p>πορεύομαι with εἰς is not found elsewhere in John; but (in the Gospels) only in Matt. and Luke, and the frag. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:0">Mark 16:0</span> . fin. Nor is ὄρθρον , nor παραγίνομαι εἰς nor ὁ λαός <em> in this sense</em> , but always ὁ ὄχλος (see ὁ λαός ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:50">John 11:50</span> ; Joh 18:14 ): nor such an expression as καθίσας ἐδίδασκεν αὐτούς (v. r.): but all these are found in Luke. It is not in John’s manner to relate that <em> Jesus taught them</em> , without relating <em> what</em> He taught.</p>
