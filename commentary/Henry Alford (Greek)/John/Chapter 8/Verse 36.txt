<p><strong> 36.</strong> ] Ye then, being in sin, are carnal: the sons of the bondwoman, and therefore need liberation. Now comes in the <em> spiritual reality</em> , into which the discourse passes from the figure. This liberation can only take place by means of Him of whom Isaac was the type the Seed according to promise; those only who of His Spirit are born again, and after His image, are <strong> ὄντως ἐλεύθεροι</strong> truly sons of God, and no longer children of the bondwoman, but of the free. See by all means <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:19">Galatians 4:19</span> (where the subject really begins, not at Joh 8:21 ) to end, which is the best commentary on this verse. There neither is, nor can be here, any allusion either to the liberation of the sabbatical year (Œcolampadius); or to the subject of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:5-6">Hebrews 3:5-6</span> (Euthym [129] , after Chrys.).
