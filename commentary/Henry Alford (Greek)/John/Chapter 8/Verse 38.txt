[The speaking and doing were in each case from the <strong> father</strong> of each. But] Jesus was πρὸς τὸν θεόν , in a relation of abiding unity with His Father: they were ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς τοῦ διαβ ., he was the suggester of their course, the originator of their acts. Jesus was the υἱός , who remains in the house and sees the father’s acts: they the δοῦλοι , merely prescribed to and under bondage.
