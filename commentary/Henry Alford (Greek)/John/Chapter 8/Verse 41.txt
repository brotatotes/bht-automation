<p><strong> ἐκ πορν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Stier remarks, that they now let fall Abraham as their father, being convicted of unlikeness to him. They see that a <em> spiritual</em> paternity must be meant, and accordingly refer to God as their Father. This consideration will rule the sense of <strong> ἐκ πορν</strong> <strong> .,</strong> which must therefore be spiritual also. And spiritually the <strong> τέκνα πορνείας</strong> <strong> ,</strong> ref. Hosea, are idolaters. πολύθεος ὁ ἐκ πόρνης , τυφλώττων περὶ τὸν ἀληθῆ πατέρα , καὶ διὰ τοῦτο πολλοὺς ἀνθ ʼ ἑνὸς γονεῖς αἰνιττόμενος . Philo de Migr. Abr. 13, vol. i. p. 447. Ishmael cannot well be alluded to; for they would not call the relation between Abraham and Hagar one of πορνεία . Still less can Origen’s interpretation be adopted, ἔλεγον Ἡμεῖς μᾶλλον ἕνα πατέρα ἔχομεν τὸν θεόν , ἤπερ σύ , ὁ φάσκων μὲν ἐκ παρθένου γεγεννῆσθαι , ἐκ πορνείας δὲ γεγεννημένος , καὶ διὰ τὸ αὐχεῖν τὸ ἐκ παρθένου γεγεννῆσθαι λέγων ἕνα πατέρα ἔχειν μόνον , τὸν θεόν (tom. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:14">John 20:14</span> , p. 327), for our Lord never proclaimed this of Himself. There may possibly be a reference to the <em> Samaritans</em> ( Joh 8:48 ), who completely answered in the spiritual sense to the children of fornication: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+31:16">Deuteronomy 31:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:21">Isaiah 1:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:15">Ezekiel 16:15</span> ff; Eze 20:30 alli [130] .
