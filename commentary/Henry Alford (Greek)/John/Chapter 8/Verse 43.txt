<p><strong> 43.</strong> ] <strong> λαλιὰν γινώσκειν</strong> is to <em> understand the idiom or dialect</em> in which a man speaks, <strong> λαλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> being his <strong> manner of speech</strong> : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:73">Matthew 26:73</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="so+4:3">Song of Solomon 4:3</span> , LXX. <strong> Why do ye not understand my speech?</strong> as E. V. But this of course does not here refer to the mere outward expression of the Lord’s discourses, but to the <em> spiritual idiom</em> in which He spoke, and which can only be spiritually understood. Then <strong> ὁ λόγος ὁ ἐμός</strong> is the <em> matter</em> of those discourses, the Word itself.

<p>The connexion of the two clauses is, <strong> Why</strong> , &amp;c.? <strong> Because ye</strong> <em> cannot</em> <strong> receive</strong> , hear with the inner ear (see reff., and ch. Joh 6:60 ), <strong> that which I say</strong> . And the verification and ground of this ‘cannot’ is in the next verse. Meyer remarks, that in questions and answers, the emphatic words come <em> last</em> being here <strong> γινώσκετε</strong> and <strong> τὸν λόγον τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐμόν</strong> <strong> .</strong></p>
