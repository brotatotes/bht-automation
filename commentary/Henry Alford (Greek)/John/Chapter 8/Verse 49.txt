Joh 4:34 ), which was not the work of one having a devil. There is no <em> retort of the charge</em> in the emphatic <strong> ἐγώ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> as Cyr [136] and Lücke; this, as Meyer observes, would have required οὐκ ἐγώ . At present the <strong> ἐγώ</strong> followed by <strong> ὑμεῖς</strong> only brings out the two parties into stronger contrast.
