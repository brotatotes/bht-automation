<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] I will just remark that the very fact of their questioning thus, ‘Moses commanded, … but what sayest <em> Thou?</em> ’ belongs to the <em> last days</em> of the Lord’s ministry, and cannot well be introduced chronologically where it here stands: nor does John any where introduce these questions between the law of Moses and Jesus; but the synoptic Gospels often do.

<p>The command here mentioned is not to be found, unless ‘putting to death’ generally, is to be interpreted as = <em> stoning:</em> compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+31:14">Exodus 31:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+35:2">Exodus 35:2</span> , with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+15:35-36">Numbers 15:35-36</span> , in which the special order given by God would sanction such a view. But the Rabbis taught “omne mortis supplicium in scriptura absolute positum esse <em> strangulationem</em> .” Tract. Sanhedr. ch. 10. (Lücke, De Wette.) The passage <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:38">Ezekiel 16:38</span> ; Eze 16:40 proves nothing, or proves too much; for it is added, “and thrust thee through with their swords.”
	</p>
<p>I would rather suppose that from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+22:21">Deuteronomy 22:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+22:23-24">Deuteronomy 22:23-24</span> , an inference was drawn <em> what kind of a death</em> was intended in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+22:22">Deuteronomy 22:22</span> , the crime being regarded as the same; “ <em> he hath humbled his neighbour’s wife</em> .” We have similar indefiniteness in ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:25">John 8:25</span> , where evidently the same punishment is meant: see the whole matter discussed in Lücke, ii. 257 ff.</p>
