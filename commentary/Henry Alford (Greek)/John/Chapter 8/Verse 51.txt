<p><strong> 51.</strong> ] There is no pause (De Wette) between Joh 8:50 and this. This is the direct carrying on of the discourse, arising out of <strong> κρίνων</strong> in the last verse, and forming a “novum tentamen gratiæ” (Lampe). ‘Ye are <em> now</em> children of the devil, but if ye keep My word ye shall be rescued from that ἀνθρωποκτόνος .’

<p><strong> τὸν ἐμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λόγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τηρ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> as ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τῷ ἐμῷ μένειν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:31">John 8:31</span> , is not only outward obedience, but the endurance in, and obedience of faith.

<p><strong> θεωρεῖν θάν</strong> <strong> .,</strong> as γεύεσθαι θαν ., is a Hebraism for <em> to die</em> , see reff., and must not be pressed to mean, ‘shall not <em> feel</em> (the bitterness of) death,’ in a temporal sense, as has been done by Stier (iv. 433, edn. 2). The <em> death of the body</em> is not reckoned as <em> death</em> , any more than the <em> life of the body is life</em> , in our Lord’s discourses: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25-26">John 11:25-26</span> , and notes. Both words have a deeper meaning.</p>
