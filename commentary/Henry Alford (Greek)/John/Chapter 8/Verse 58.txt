<p><strong> 58.</strong> ] As Lücke remarks, all unbiassed exegesis of these words must recognize in them a declaration of the essential præ-existence of Christ. All such interpretations of <strong> πρὶν Ἀβραὰμ γενέσθαι</strong> <strong> ,</strong> as “ <em> before Abraham became Abraham</em> ,” i.e. father of many nations (Socinus and others), and of <strong> ἐγὼ εἰμί</strong> <strong> ,</strong> as “ <em> I was predetermined, promised by God</em> ” (Grotius and the Socinian interpreters), are little better than <em> dishonest quibbles</em> . The distinction between γενέσθαι and εἰμί is important. “Antequam <em> nasceretur</em> Abraham, ego <em> sum</em> ” (Erasmus). The present <strong> εἰμί</strong> expresses <em> essential existence</em> , as in reff., especially <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:17">Colossians 1:17</span> , and was often used by our Lord to assert His Divine Being.

<p>In this verse <em> the God-head of Christ is involved;</em> and this the Jews <em> clearly understood, by their conduct to Him</em> .</p>
