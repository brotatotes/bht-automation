<p><strong> 39, 40.</strong> ] There is a distinction between <strong> σπέρμα</strong> and <strong> τέκνα</strong> <strong> .</strong> The former our Lord grants that they were ( Joh 8:37 ), but the latter (by implication see below on the construction) He denies them. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:7">Romans 9:7</span> , οὐ γὰρ πάντες οἱ ἐξ Ἰσραήλ , οὗτοι Ἱσραήλ · οὐδ ʼ ὅτι εἰσὶν <strong> σπέρμα</strong> Ἁβραάμ , πάντες <strong> τέκνα</strong> <strong> .</strong> The latter betokens <em> likeness</em> , true genuine descent in character and habits.

<p>The reading in the text is remarkable as connecting together the present ἔστε and the imperfect <strong> ἐποιεῖτε</strong> <strong> .</strong> In such a case there must be a suppressed change of meaning between the protasis and the apodosis. The εἰ ἔστε concedes, in a certain sense: the ἐποιεῖτε denies, by making an assumption at variance with present fact. The sentence is in fact a combination of a protasis of one form with an apodosis of another. It might have been, (a) εἰ ἔστε …, ποιεῖτε ; or, (b) εἰ ἦτε …, ἐποιεῖτε . But as it stands, protasis (a) is joined with apodosis (b): and thereby the τέκνα τοῦ Ἀβραὰμ εἶναι in any worthy sense is denied, while in the mere formal sense it is conceded.

<p><strong> τοῦτο</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <strong> this</strong> ; not, ‘tale quid:’ and <strong> ἐποίησεν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <strong> fecit</strong> , not ‘fecisset:’ for the statement is one of a <em> fact:</em> <strong> this did not Abraham</strong> , as E. V.: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:0">Genesis 18:0</span> .</p>
