<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] According to Jewish ideas, every infirmity was the punishment of sin (see Joh 9:34 ). From <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:5">Exodus 20:5</span> , and the prevailing views on the subject, the disciples may have believed that the man was visited for the sins of his parents: but how could <em> he himself have sinned</em> before his birth? Beza and Grotius refer the question to the doctrine of metempsychosis; that he may have sinned in a former state of existence; this however is disproved by Lightfoot and Lampe. The Pharisees believed that the <em> good souls only</em> passed into other bodies, which would exclude this case (see Jos. Antt. xviii. 1. 3, and B. J. ii. 8. 14). Lightfoot, Lücke, and Meyer refer it to the possibility of sin <em> in the womb;</em> Tholuck to <em> predestinated sin</em> , punished by anticipation: De Wette to the general doctrine of the præ-existence of souls, which prevailed both among the Rabbis and Alexandrians: see Wis 8:19-20 (the applicability of which passage is doubted by Stier, iv. 455 note, edn. 2). So Isidore of Pelusium in the Catena (Lücke, ii. 372), οὗτος , <strong> ὥς φασιν Ἕλληνες</strong> <strong> ,</strong> ἢ οἱ γονεῖς αὐτοῦ , <strong> ὥς φασιν Ἰουδαῖοι</strong> .

<p>The question may have been asked vaguely without any strict application of it to the circumstances, merely taking for granted that <em> some sin</em> must have led to the blindness, and hardly thinking of the non-applicability of one of the suppositions to this case. Or perhaps, as Stier inclines to suppose, the <strong> οὖτος</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> ἤ</strong> may mean, ‘this man, or, <em> for that is out of the question</em> ( <em> dieser selbst, oder, da uns dies doch nicht denkbar ist, …</em> ), his parents?’

<p><strong> ἵνα</strong> as a <em> cause</em> why he should be …, used τελικῶς : not ἐκβατικῶς (Olsh.), expressing the mere consecution of events.</p>
