<p><strong> πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἁγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is a <em> contrast to</em> , and a reason for, the not drinking wine nor strong drink: compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:18">Ephesians 5:18</span> .

<p>Olshausen and Meyer think that (comparing Luk 1:44 ) the meaning is, the Holy Spirit should in some wonderful manner act on the child even <em> before</em> his birth. But (see reff.) this is not necessary, nay, would it not rather be in this case <strong> ἐν</strong> κοιλίᾳ …? The <strong> ἐκ</strong> seems to fix the prior limit of the indwelling of the Spirit, <em> at his birth</em> . Meyer grounds his view on the meaning of <strong> ἔτι</strong> as distinguished from ἤδη , and takes the construction as embracing both particulars he shall be so <em> in</em> , and shall become so <em> from</em> … So likewise Bleek, and Hoffmann, Weiss. und Erfüll. ii. 250 f.</p>
