<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] <strong> ἐνώπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτοῦ</strong> i.e. κυρίου τοῦ θ . αὐτῶν , manifest in the flesh. De Wette denies this interpretation, as contrary to all analogy: and yet himself explains the expression by saying that what the Messiah does, is in Scripture <em> ascribed to God as its doer</em> (similarly Meyer). But <em> why?</em> because Messiah is GOD WITH US. This expression is besides used (see Zec 14:5 ) in places where the undoubted and sole reference is to the Messiah. See Bleek’s note, in which he decides for this view, as against that which refers αὐτοῦ <em> directly</em> to the Messiah as the Son of God.

Bleek remarks that it was not in the wonder-working agency of Elias that John was like him, for “John did no miracle,” but in the power of his uttered persuasion.
