<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] <strong> ἐξ οἴκου Δ</strong> <em> refers to Joseph</em> in this place, who (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:0">Matthew 1:0</span> ) was of the direct lineage of David. That <em> Mary was so</em> , is no where <em> expressed</em> in the Gospels, but seems to be implied in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:32">Luke 1:32</span> , and has been the general belief of Christians. The Son of David was to be the fruit of <em> his body</em> ( Psa 132:11 ); which He would not be, unless His virgin mother was of the house of David. See notes on the genealogy in ch. 3. (Still we must remember the absolute oneness in the marriage relation, which might occasion that Mary herself should be reckoned as being in very deed that which her husband was. Perhaps this has been hardly enough taken into account. Edn. 5, 1862.)</p>
