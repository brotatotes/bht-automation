<p><strong> 3. </strong> <strong> ἔδοξεν κἀμοί</strong> ] Luke by this classes himself with these πολλοί , and shews that he intended no disparagement nor blame to them, and was going to construct his own history from similar sources. The παρηκ . ἄν . πᾶσιν ἀκρ . which follows, implies however a conscious superiority of his own qualification for the work. There is here no <em> expressed claim</em> to inspiration, but at the same time no <em> disclaimer</em> of it. (The addition <em> et spiritui sancto</em> , after κἀμοί , which is found in 3 lat. mss. and in got [5] ., makes the following clause an absurdity.)

<p><strong> παρηκ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> having traced down</strong> (by research), and so become accurately acquainted with. The word is used in just this sense by Demosth., περὶ τ . στ ., p. 285: ἐκεῖνος ὁ καιρὸς καὶ ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνη οὐ μόνον εὔνουν καὶ πλούσιον ἄνδρα ἐκάλει , ἀλλὰ καὶ <strong> παρηκολουθηκότα</strong> τοῖς πράγμασιν ἐξ ἀρχῆς , καὶ συλλελογισμένον ὀρθῶς τίνος ἕνεκα ταῦτ ʼ ἔπραττεν ὁ Φίλ ., καὶ τί βουλόμενος .

<p><strong> ἄνωθεν</strong> ] <strong> from the beginning</strong> i.e. as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:5">Luke 1:5</span> ; as distinguished from those who only wrote of the <em> official</em> life of the Lord, or only fragments perhaps of that.

<p><strong> καθεξῆς</strong> <strong> , consecutively:</strong> see reff. By this word we must not understand Luke to lay claim to any <em> especial chronological accuracy</em> in <em> writing;</em> which indeed is not found in his Gospel. He <em> traced</em> the events in order as they happened: but he may have <em> arranged</em> them as other considerations led him. The word is of later usage, e.g. by Plutarch, Ælian, &amp;c. The classics have ἐφεξῆς .

<p><strong> κράτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> θ <strong> εόφ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] It is wholly unknown who this person was. The name was a very common one. The conjectures about him are endless, and entirely without value. It appears that he was a person of dignity (see reff. on κράτιστ .), and a convert to Christianity.
	</p>
<p>The idea of the name being not a proper, but a <em> feigned one</em> , designating ‘those who loved God’ (found as early as Epiphanius, Hær. ii. 51, p. 429, εἴτουν τινὶ Θεοφίλῳ τότε γράφων τοῦτο ἔλεγεν , ἢ παντὶ ἀνθρώπῳ θεὸν ἀγαπῶντι : and adopted again recently by Bp. Wordsworth), is far-fetched and improbable.</p>
