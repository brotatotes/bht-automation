<p><strong> 38.</strong> ] Her own faithful and humble assent is here given to the divine announcement which had been made to her. I believe that her conception of the Lord is to be dated <em> from the utterance of these words</em> . So Euthym [9] : ἀπ ʼ αὐτῆς ἤδη συλλαβούσης ἅμα τῷ λόγῳ αὐτοῦ . Similarly Iren [10] , Tert [11] , Ath [12] , Maldonat., Grot. Lightfoot, holding a different opinion, says, <em> Agnosco quidem, communiter obtinuisse, quod Virgo in urbe Nazareta conceperit, idque eodem instante quo Angelus eam alloquebatur</em> . She was no unconscious vessel of the divine will, but (see Luk 1:45 ) in humility and faith, a fellow-worker with the purpose of the Father; and therefore <em> her own unity with that purpose</em> was <em> required</em> , and is here recorded.
