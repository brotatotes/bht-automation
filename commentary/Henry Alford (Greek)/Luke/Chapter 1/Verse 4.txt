<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] <strong> ἐπιγνῷς</strong> here in its stricter sense, of acquiring <em> additional</em> , more accurate knowledge see reff. <strong> κατηχ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Theophilus had then been orally instructed in the narratives which form the subject of this Gospel: and Luke’s intention in writing it is, that he might have a <em> more accurate knowledge of these histories</em> .

<p><strong> κατηχήθης</strong> literally, <strong> catechized,</strong> ‘ <em> catechetically taught</em> .’ Bleek, h. l., reminds us that this is not St. Luke’s own usage of the verb: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:21">Acts 21:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:24">Acts 21:24</span> , where it simply signifies hearing by report. But we may answer that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:25">Acts 18:25</span> , where the same construction occurs, this is the most likely sense.

<p><strong> λόγων</strong> is not to be <em> rendered</em> ‘things:’ <em> neither it, nor</em> ῥῆμα , <em> nor</em> דָּבָר , <em> ever has this meaning</em> , as is commonly but erroneously supposed. In all the commonly-cited examples of this, ‘ <em> things expressed in words</em> ’ are meant: here, <strong> the histories,</strong> <strong> accounts.</strong> (See Prolegg. to the Gospels, i. 3.)</p>
