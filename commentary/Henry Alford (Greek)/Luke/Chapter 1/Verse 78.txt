<p><strong> 78.</strong> ] <strong> ἀνατολή</strong> is (see reff.) the LXX rendering for צֶמַח a <em> branch</em> or <em> sprout</em> and thus, ‘ <em> that which springs up or rises</em> ,’ as <em> Light:</em> which, from the clauses following, seems to be the meaning here.

<p><strong> ἐξ ὕψ</strong> <strong> .</strong> may be taken with <strong> ἀνατ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> as in E. V.: or perhaps with the verb <strong> ἐπιφᾶναι</strong> <strong> .</strong> But however taken, the expression is not quite easy to understand. The word had come apparently to be a name for the Messiah: thus in ref. Zech. ἰδοὺ ἀνήρ , Ἀνατολὴ ὄνομα αὐτῷ : and then figures arising from the meaning of the word itself, became mixed with that which was said of Him. The day-spring does not come ἐξ ὕψους , but from beneath the horizon; but the Messiah <em> does</em> . Again the ἐπιφᾶναι κ . τ . λ . of the next verse belongs to the day-spring, and only figuratively to the Messiah. See Bleek’s long note.</p>
