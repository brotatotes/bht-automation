<p><strong> 1 4.</strong> ] PREFACE TO THEOPHILUS. The peculiar style of this preface, which is purer Greek than the contents of the Gospel, and also more laboured and formal, may be accounted for, partly because it is the composition of the Evangelist himself, and not translated from Hebrew sources like the rest, and partly because prefaces, especially when also dedicatory, are usually in a rounded and artificial style.</p>
