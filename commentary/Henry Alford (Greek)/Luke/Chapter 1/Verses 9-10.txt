<p><strong> 9, 10. </strong> <strong> τοῦ θυμιᾶσαι</strong> (not θυμιάσαι )] This was the <em> most honourable office</em> which was allotted among the priests each day, and the same person could not serve it more than once. On the manner of casting the lots, see Lightfoot in loc.
	</p>
<p><strong> τοῦ θ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εἰσελθών</strong> = <strong> to go in and to burn incense.</strong> The gen. <strong> τοῦ</strong> is in government after the verb ἔλαχεν : see Winer, § 44. 4. <em> a</em> . This verb commonly governs an accusative, but now and then a genitive: see Kühner, § 521: and cf. Il. ω . 76.

<p><strong> τὸν ναόν</strong> <strong> ] the holy place:</strong> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:1-6">Hebrews 9:1-6</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:7">Exodus 30:7</span> .

<p>An account of John Hyrcanus the high-priest having a vision at the time of offering incense occurs Jos. Antt. xiii. 10. 3: φασὶ γὰρ ὅτι κατ ʼ ἐκείνην τὴν ἡμέραν καθ ʼ ἣν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ τῷ Κυζικηνῷ συνέβαλον , αὐτὸς ἐν τῷ ναῷ θυμιῶν μόνος , ὢν ὁ ἀρχιερεύς , ἀκούσειε φωνῆς ὡς οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ νενικήκασιν ἀρτίως τὸν Ἀντίοχον . καὶ τοῦτο προελθὼν ἐκ τοῦ ναοῦ παντὶ τῷ πλήθει φανερὸν ἐποίησε · καὶ συνέβη οὕτως γενέσθαι . Here also we have the people outside (in the courts of the men and women): their prayers were offered <em> while the incense was burnt</em> , as the <em> smoke was symbolical</em> of the ascent of prayer, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+8:3-4">Revelation 8:3-4</span> .
	</p>
<p>It appears, from the allotment having been just mentioned, to have been the <em> morning</em> incense burning. So Meyer. Theophylact and others understand the whole as describing the entry into the Holy of holies on the great day of Atonement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+16:0">Leviticus 16:0</span> . But this is manifestly an error: for it would necessitate Zacharias having been high-priest, which he never was; and in this case there would have been no casting of lots.</p>
