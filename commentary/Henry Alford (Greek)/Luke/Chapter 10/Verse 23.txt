<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] This verse should not be marked off from Luk 10:22 by a new paragraph, as is done in the E. V.: much less, as in the Gospel for the 13th Sunday after Trinity, joined with what follows: except perhaps that the lesson taught us by its occurring there is an appropriate one, as shewing us how the <em> grace of Christian love</em> , which is the subject of the following parable, fulfils and abounds over, legal obedience. It is in connexion with the preceding, and comes as the conclusion after the thanksgiving in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span> . A similar saying of our Lord occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:16-17">Matthew 13:16-17</span> , but uttered altogether on a different occasion and in a different connexion.</p>
