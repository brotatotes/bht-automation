<p><strong> 36.</strong> ] It will be observed that our Lord not only elicits the answer from the questioner himself, but that it comes <em> in an inverted form</em> . The lawyer had asked, <em> to whom</em> he was to understand himself obliged to fulfil the duties of neighbourship? but the answer has for its subject <em> one who fulfilled them to another</em> . The reason of this is to be found, partly in the relation of neighbourship being <em> mutual</em> , so that if this man is my neighbour, I am his also; but chiefly in the intention of our Lord to bring out a strong contrast by putting the hated and despised Samaritan in the <em> active</em> place, and thus to reflect back the <strong> ὁμοίως</strong> more pointedly. “Observe γεγονέναι , to have <em> become</em> neighbour. The neighbour Jews became strangers, the stranger Samaritan became neighbour, to the wounded traveller. It is not place, but love, which makes neighbourhood.” Wordsworth.</p>
