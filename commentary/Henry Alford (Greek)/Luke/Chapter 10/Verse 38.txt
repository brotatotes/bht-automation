<p><strong> 38.</strong> ] <strong> ἐν τῷ πορ</strong> <strong> .</strong> need make no difficulty the whole of the events related in this section of the Gospel are allotted, as in the widest sense they belonged, to <em> the last journey of our Lord from Galilee</em> , which ended in the triumphal entry into Jerusalem: see note on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span> ff. Jesus, as we know that He afterwards did, so now probably, when at Jerusalem (at the feast of Dedication), abode at Bethany. He ‘loved’ (only used in this sense by John with regard to <em> this family</em> , and to <em> himself</em> ) Martha and Mary and Lazarus and this word implies surely hospitality and intercourse.

<p><strong> γυνή τις</strong> it does not follow that Martha was a widow; the incident brings out the <em> two sisters</em> , and therefore no others are mentioned. She may have had a husband or a father living. At all events, it is a consistency belonging to real life, that we find the same person prominent in the family in John, as here.</p>
