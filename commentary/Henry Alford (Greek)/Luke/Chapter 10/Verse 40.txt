<p><strong> 40.</strong> ] <strong> περιεσπ</strong> <strong> .</strong> (as also the form <strong> παρακαθεσθεῖσα</strong> above) is a word of later Greek. We have in Dion. Hal. ix. 43, περισπᾷ περὶ τὰς ἔξω στρατείας τὸν δῆμον : and in Jos. Antt. ver. 1. 4, πρὸς τοσαύτας ὑπηρεσίας διασπώμενος . See also Diod. Sic. i. 74: Polyb. xv. 3. 4. It exactly answers to the Latin ‘torqueor’ used in the same connexion by Horace, Sat. ii. 8. 67, and to a midland provincial expression ‘ <em> to be put about</em> ,’ meaning to be ‘distracted with officious care.’ See Phryn. ed. Lobeck, p. 415, who gives ἄσχολος εἶναι for the corresponding classical expression.

<p><strong> ἐπιστ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> generally, but not always, used by Luke of a <em> sudden coming into presence</em> . It looks here as if our Lord were teaching in another apartment from that where the διακονία was going on: this appears also in the <strong> κατέλειπεν</strong> <strong> .</strong></p>
