<p><strong> 25 37.</strong> ] QUESTION OF A LAWYER: THE PARABLE OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN. <em> Peculiar to Luke</em> . As Stier remarks (iii. 101, edn. 2), it is well that Luke has related the other incident respecting an enquiry of the same kind, for the critics would be sure to have maintained that this incident was another report of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:16">Matthew 19:16</span> . Such clear cases as this should certainly teach us caution, where <em> no such proof is given</em> of the independence of different narratives: and should shew us that both questions addressed to our Lord, and answers from Him, were, as matter of fact, repeated.

<p>See however a case to which this remark does not apply, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:57">Luke 9:57</span> ff.</p>
