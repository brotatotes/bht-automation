<p><strong> ἐσπλαγχν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] This was <em> the</em> <em> great difference</em> between the Samaritan and the others; the actions which follow are but the expansion of this compassion.

<p><strong> ἔλαιον κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οἶνον</strong> ] These were usual remedies for wounds in the East: Galen, cited by Wetstein in loc., prescribes thus for a wound in the head, ἐλαίας φύλλα τὰ ἁπαλώτατα τρίψας παράχει <strong> ἐλαίου</strong> καὶ <strong> οἴνου</strong> μέλανος καὶ κατάμασσε : see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:6">Isaiah 1:6</span> .

<p><strong> πανδοχεῖον</strong> ] The Attic form, as in the cognate words ἱεροδόκος , ξενοδοκεῖν , δωροδόκος , &amp;c., is πανδοκεῖον . So Phryn.: οἱ διὰ τοῦ <strong> χ</strong> λέγοντες ἁμαρτάνουσιν · διὰ γὰρ τοῦ <strong> κ</strong> χρὴ λέγειν πανδοκεῖον κ . πανδοκεὺς κ . πανδοκευτρία : p. 307, where see Lobeck’s note. This is the only place where <em> an inn</em> , as we understand the word, <em> a house for reception of travellers kept by a host</em> as distinguished from an empty caravanserai, is mentioned. The Rabbinical writers frequently speak of such, but under a name adopted from this word, פונדק (Wetstein). Bleek remarks that this serves to shew, that there <em> were</em> such inns in that neighbourhood, though certainly they were not frequent.
