<p><strong> οἶκ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐπὶ οἶκ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The ordinary rendering <strong> and house</strong> ( <strong> divided</strong> ) <strong> against house, falleth,</strong> is certainly right. Before Meyer charged this interpretation with having entirely arisen out of harmonistic considerations, he should have ascertained whether such an expression as a <em> kingdom</em> falling οἶκος ἐπὶ οἶκον is even tolerable. The ruling idea of the saying having been given by the <strong> βασ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐφ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἑαυτήν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the emphatic pronoun need not be expressed again. Similarly we have, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:11">1 Corinthians 2:11</span> , τίς οἶδεν ἀνθρώπων τὰ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου , εἰ μὴ τὸ πν . τοῦ ἀνθρώτου τὸ ἐν αὐτῷ ; the ὁ ἄνθρ . being the same throughout.</p>
