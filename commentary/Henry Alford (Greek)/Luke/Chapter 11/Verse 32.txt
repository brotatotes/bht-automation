<p><strong> 32. </strong> <strong> πλεῖον Ἰωνᾶ</strong> ] Not ‘ <em> a greater than Jonas</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> than Solomon:</em> ’ but Jonah = <em> the sign of</em> Jonah, so that <strong> πλεῖον</strong> is <em> He who is the sign</em> to this generation: a sign, πλεῖον , both in its <em> actuality</em> , its <em> significance</em> , and its <em> consequences</em> . The <em> order</em> , here, seems to be for the sake of climax; for the undervaluing and not appreciating His <em> wisdom</em> , will not lie so heavy on them in the judgment, as the <em> rejection</em> of His <em> preaching of repentance</em> .</p>
