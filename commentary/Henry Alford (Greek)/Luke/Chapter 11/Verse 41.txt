<p><strong> 41.</strong> ] Here again I am compelled entirely to differ from Stier, who, with Erasmus, Lightfoot, Kuinoel, Schleiermacher, &amp;c., understands this as <em> ironical</em> ‘ <em> but ye give alms of their contents, and behold, all things are clean</em> (in your estimation) <em> to you</em> .’ But (1) this is inconsistent with the imperative <strong> δότε</strong> <strong> .</strong> (2) It would require ἐκ τῶν ἐνότων , for the Pharisees did not give <strong> τὰ ἐνόντα</strong> in this sense. (3) It would be altogether irrelevant to the matter in hand, which was reproof to the Pharisees for their care <em> about outward cleanliness, when the inside was left unclean</em> . (4) It would be inconsistent with the emphatic position of <strong> τὰ ἐνόντα</strong> <strong> ,</strong> which are thus pointed out as the <em> true material</em> , out of which to give alms. It would be altogether contrary to our Lord’s usual habit of speaking about giving alms, to make Him cast a slur on it, as this would do: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:21">Mark 10:21</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:33">Luke 12:33</span> , where the expression is very similar to this.
	</p>
<p>The command is <em> a rebuke for their covetousness</em> (see ch. Luk 16:14 ), which follows in close connexion with <strong> ἁρπαγή</strong> and <strong> πονηρία</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:39">Luke 11:39</span> . The <strong> τὰ ἐνόντα</strong> are the <em> contents of the vessel</em> , which vessel (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:39">Luke 11:39</span> : see note above) is <strong> ὑμεῖς</strong> <strong> :</strong> = therefore, in its meaning, the τὰ ὑπάρχοντα of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:33">Luke 12:33</span> , and the <strong> πάντα καθαρά ἐστιν</strong> answers to the <strong> θησαυρὸς</strong> ἐν οὐρανῷ of that verse, the <em> result</em> of which is the <strong> καρδία</strong> ἐν οὐρανῷ : and such persons being <strong> καθαροὶ</strong> τῇ καρδίᾳ , to them, as τοῖς καθαροῖς , <strong> πάντα καθαρά</strong> ( Tit 1:15 ).</p>
