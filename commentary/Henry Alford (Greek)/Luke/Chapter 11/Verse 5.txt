<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] Now follows a parable on continuing instant in prayer, of the same nature as that in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:2">Luke 18:2</span> ff. In both parables, the argument is ‘à fortiori:’ “if <em> selfish man</em> can be won by prayer and importunity to give, and <em> unjust man</em> to do right, much more certainly shall the <em> bountiful</em> Lord bestow, and the <em> righteous</em> Lord do justice.” Trench, Parables, in loc., who further remarks, that here <em> intercessory</em> prayer is the subject of the parable; there, <em> personal</em> . And, that we must remember that all reluctance on the part of God to answer our prayers is not real, but <em> apparent</em> only, and arises from deeper reasons working for our good: whereas the reluctance in these two parables is <em> real</em> , arising from selfishness and contempt of justice.
