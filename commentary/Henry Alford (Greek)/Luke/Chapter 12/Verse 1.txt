<p><strong> 1. </strong> <strong> πρῶτον</strong> ] I am not convinced by Olsh., De Wette, and Meyer, that this belongs to <strong> προσέχ</strong> <strong> .…</strong> Every instance which they quote of πρῶτον being thus used, is where <em> some definite matter is subsequent</em> to the thing said or done; e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:33">Matthew 6:33</span> . But here is no <em> such matter:</em> πρ . would only mean, ‘ <em> earnestly</em> ,’ ‘ <em> be sure that you</em> ’ … which meaning I do not think it bears. I have therefore coupled it with <strong> τοὺς μ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> as distinguishing this section from what follows spoken <em> to the crowd</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:13">Luke 12:13</span> ff. On the rest, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:6">Matthew 16:6</span> .</p>
