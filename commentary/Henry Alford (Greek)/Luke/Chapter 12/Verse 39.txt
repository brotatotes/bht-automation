<p><strong> 39.</strong> ] I am surprised that Schleiermacher can have imagined (transl. p. 198) that this verse has been inserted so as to break the connexion, and by a later hand. Nothing can be more exact and rigid than the connexion as it now stands. Our Lord transfers, to shew the unexpected nature of his coming, and the necessity of watchfulness, the relation between <em> Himself</em> and the <em> servants</em> , to that between the <em> thief</em> and the <strong> οἰκοδεσπότης</strong> <strong> .</strong> For the purposes of this verse, <em> they</em> represent the οἰκοδεσπότης collectively, as put in charge with the Lord’s house and household (thus the verse is intimately connected with Luk 12:42 ): and in the further application, individually each as the οἰκοδεσπότης of his own σκεῦος , to be kept with watchfulness against that day: <em> He</em> is represented by the thief ἰδοὺ ἔρχομαι ὡς κλέπτης , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+16:15">Revelation 16:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+3:3">Revelation 3:3</span> .

<p>Olshausen’s view, that the οἰκοδ . is the ἄρχων τοῦ κόσμ . τούτου , is surely quite out of keeping with the main features of the parable. That <em> he</em> should be put in the place of the watching servants ( <strong> καὶ ὑμεῖς</strong> ) seems impossible: besides that the <strong> πιστὸς οἰκονόμος</strong> below is this very οἰκοδ ., being such in the absence of his Lord, but the <strong> οἰκονόμος</strong> when He appears.</p>
