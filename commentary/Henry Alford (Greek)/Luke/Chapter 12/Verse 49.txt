<p><strong> 49. </strong> <strong> πῦρ</strong> ] It is extraordinary that the official announcement of the Baptist (ch. Luk 3:16 ) αὐτὸς ὑμᾶς βαπτίσει ἐν πν . ἁγ . <strong> καὶ πυρί</strong> connected with the mention of a baptism here, with the promise <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:5">Acts 1:5</span> , and the appearance <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:3">Acts 2:3</span> , so strikingly expressed as <strong> διαμεριζόμεναι</strong> γλῶσσαι ὡσεὶ <strong> πυρός</strong> , have not kept the Commentators in general (Bleek is an exception) from falling into the blunder of imagining here that the <em> fire</em> is synonymous with, and means no more than, the <em> discord</em> and <em> division</em> which follow. The fire is, <em> the gift of the Holy Spirit</em> , the great crowning result of the sufferings and triumph of the Lord Jesus. To follow this out in all its references belongs to another place: see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:49">Mark 9:49</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:3">Acts 2:3</span> . This fire, in its purifying and separating effects on the mass of mankind, causes the <strong> διαμερισμός</strong> afterwards spoken of.

<p>The <em> construction</em> of <strong> τί θέλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εἰ ἤδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀν</strong> <strong> .</strong> has been ever a matter of dispute, while the <em> meaning</em> is on all hands nearly agreed. The three prevalent explanations of it are: (1) which is Origen’s (app [89] ), and is adopted by Grot., and defended by Meyer [formerly] and Stier, making εἰ = εἴθε , and rendering, <strong> and what will I? would that it were already kindled!</strong> Certainly thus there is nothing forced in the <em> construction;</em> we have εἰ for ‘ <em> utinam</em> ’ joined with aorist in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jos+7:7">Joshua 7:7</span> ; but the abrupt short ejaculation seems unlike the usual character of our Lord’s discourses. It is true the structure of Joh 12:27 affords an instance of a similar question, καὶ τί εἴπω ; … and under similar circumstances, of <em> His soul being troubled</em> . (2) which Theophyl., Kuinoel, Olsh., De Wette, Bleek, &amp;c. [so Meyer, edn. 5, see Moulton’s Winer, p. 562, note 3] adopt, taking τί = ὡς , as some do, adopting that reading, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:14">Matthew 7:14</span> (but see note there), and εἰ = ὅτι , and rendering, How I wish that it were already kindled! But here we have serious difficulties of an <em> idiomatic</em> kind: τί is apparently never thus used and εἰ only after words of wondering, being grieved, &amp;c.: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:44">Mark 15:44</span> .

<p>(3) That of Euthym [90] , Beza, &amp;c., and the E. V., ‘What will I, if it be already kindled?’ i.e. τί πλεῖον θέλω ἐὰν ἀνήφθη ; τί πλεῖον ἀναμένω ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ ; Euth. This also presents no constructional, but a very great contextual difficulty; for by Luk 12:50 it evidently <em> was not yet kindled;</em> and even if this were overcome, the expression, evidently a <em> deep one of personal anxiety</em> (and be it remembered Who said it), would be vapid and unmeaning in the extreme.

<p>All things then being considered, I prefer the first explanation.</p>
