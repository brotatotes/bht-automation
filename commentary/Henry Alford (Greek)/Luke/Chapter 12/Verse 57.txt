<p><strong> 57.</strong> ] In what follows, our Lord takes occasion from the <em> request about the inheritance</em> , which had begun this discourse, to pass to infinitely more solemn matters. There is, I think, no denying that the <strong> κρίνειν τὸ δίκ</strong> <strong> .</strong> and the <strong> ὁ ἀντίδικός σ</strong> <strong> .</strong> have <em> a</em> reference to that request, in the ability and duty of every man to ‘judge what is right:’ but the sense of the words far outruns that reference, and treats of loftier things. ‘ <em> Why do ye not discern of yourselves your true state that which is just the justice of your case as before God? You are going</em> (the course of your life is the journey) <em> with your adversary</em> (the just and holy law of God) <em> before the magistrate</em> (God Himself); <em> therefore by the way take pains</em> ( δὸς ἐργ ., <em> da operam</em> a Latinism: there is no reference to interest of money, as Thl., who also has the other interpretation, supposes) <em> to be delivered from him</em> (by repentance, and faith in the Son of God, see Psa 2:12 ), <em> lest he drag thee to the judge</em> ( κριτής who adjudges the case and inflicts the fine; that is, the Son, to whom all judgment is committed), <em> and the judge deliver thee to the exactor</em> (see Mat 13:41 ), <em> and the exactor</em> <strong><em> cast thee into prison</em></strong> ’ (ditto, Luk 12:42 ).</p>
