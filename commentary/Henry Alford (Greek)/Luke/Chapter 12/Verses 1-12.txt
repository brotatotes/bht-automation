Luk 11:53 ) in the spirit of the discourse which He has just completed, and cautions his disciples against that part of the character of the Pharisees which was most dangerous <em> to them</em> . The connexion of these twelve verses may be thus enunciated: <em> Beware of hypocrisy</em> ( Luk 12:1 ), <em> for all shall be made evident in the end</em> ( Luk 12:2 ), <em> and ye are witnesses and sharers in this unfolding of the truth</em> ( Luk 12:3 ). <em> In this your work, ye need not fear men; for your Father has you in His keeping</em> ( Luk 12:4-7 ) <em> and the confession of my name is a glorious thing</em> ( Luk 12:8 ), <em> but the rejection of it</em> ( Luk 12:9 ), <em> and especially the ascription of my works to the evil one</em> ( Luk 12:10 ), <em> a fearful one. And in this confession ye shall be helped by the Holy Spirit in the hour of need</em> ( Luk 12:11-12 ).</p>
