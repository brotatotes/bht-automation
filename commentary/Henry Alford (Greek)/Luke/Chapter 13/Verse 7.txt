<p><strong> 7. </strong> <strong> τρία ἔτη</strong> ] I have little doubt (against Bleek, alli [91] .) that an <em> allusion</em> is intended to the <em> three years of our Lord’s ministry</em> . The objection to this, that the cutting down ought then to have taken place <em> at the end of</em> τοῦτο τὸ ἔτος , does not apply; for all is left indefinite in the request and the implied answer. In the individual application, <em> many thousands did bear fruit this very year;</em> and of those who did not, who shall say <em> when</em> the Spirit ceased pleading with them, and the final sentence went forth?
