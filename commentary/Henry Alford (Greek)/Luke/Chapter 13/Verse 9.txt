<p><strong> 9.</strong> ] After <strong> καρπόν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> λείπει , τὸ εὖ ἔχει , Euthym [92] ; but not without reason: to fill up the aposiopesis <em> did not belong to the purpose of this parable</em> .
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [92] Euthymius Zigabenus, 1116
	</p>
<p><strong> εἰς τὸ μέλλον</strong> <strong> ,</strong> not ἔτος (Meyer), but indefinite (see reff.), <strong> hereafter:</strong> and purposely so; because, <em> in the collective sense</em> , the sentence lingered.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐκκόψεις</strong> <strong> ,</strong> THOU <strong> shalt cut it down</strong> not ἐκκόψω ; and I find in this an additional proof of the correctness of the foregoing interpretation. It is the κύριος τ . ἀμπελῶνος who ὅταν ἔλθῃ , κακοὺς κακῶς ἀπολέσει αὐτούς .
	</p>
<p><em> All judgment is committed to</em> THE SON: it is not the work of the Holy Spirit to cut down and destroy, for He is the Giver of <em> life</em> .
	</p>
<p>The above interpretation is partially given by Stier, who has however in my view (in his 2nd edn. also) quite missed the ἀμπελουργός , understanding by him <em> the husbandmen in</em> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:0">Matthew 21:0</span> , forgetting that they are <em> destroyed</em> in the sequel of that parable, and that their position, that of the <em> tenants</em> of the vineyard, does not appear at all in this, any more than does the ἀμπελουργός in that.</p>
