<p><strong> 34, 35.</strong> ] These verses are in too close connexion with the preceding to allow of the supposition that they are inserted unchronologically, as Grot., Me [93] ., De W., Neander, and even Schleierm. suppose: and their variations from those in Matthew ( Mat 23:37-39 ) are striking and characteristic. For γάρ , which <em> there</em> accounts for the ἐρημία of the temple, then for the last time left by our Lord, <em> does not appear here</em> , but δέ , introducing a fresh saying, <em> having</em> I believe <em> another meaning:</em> and the words ἀπ ʼ ἄρτι , which follow ἴδητε <em> there</em> , marking <em> that moment</em> as the <em> commencement</em> of the dereliction, are here omitted. Surely these differences indicate an uttering of the words <em> prophetically</em> , previous to their utterance in the act of departure. Our Lord overleaps in prophetic foresight the death just set forth as certain, and speaks of the ages to come, during which the holy city should be desolate and trodden down of the Gentiles.

<p>That the very words <strong> εὐλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὁ ἐρχ</strong> <strong> .</strong> κ . τ . λ . <em> were used by the multitude</em> at the Lord’s entry into Jerusalem, I should much rather ascribe to a misunderstanding by them and the disciples of this very declaration, than for a moment suppose that these words found any sufficient <em> fulfilment</em> in that entry (Erasmus, Paulus, Wieseler).</p>
