<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] The <strong> δοῦλος</strong> is one <em> spirit</em> , one <em> message;</em> but not necessarily, in the three cases, one and the same <em> person</em> . The three messages were delivered (1) by John the Baptist and our Lord; (2) by our Lord and the Apostles; (3) by the Apostles and those who came after. The elder prophets cannot be meant, for <strong> ἕτοιμά ἐστιν πάντα</strong> was the message, = ἤγγικεν ἡ βασ . τ . οὐρ .</p>
