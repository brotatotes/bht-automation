<p><strong> 26, 27.</strong> ] See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:37-38">Matthew 10:37-38</span> , and note. The remark there made of the <em> strangeness</em> of this sound of <em> the Cross</em> , still applies: our Lord had not yet announced his death <em> by crucifixion</em> .

<p><strong> μισεῖ</strong> ] It is well to enquire what sense this word here bears. That no such thing as <em> active hatred</em> can be meant, is plain: our Lord himself is an example to the contrary, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:25-27">John 19:25-27</span> ; the <em> hate</em> is the <em> general</em> , not <em> personal</em> , feeling of alienation in the inmost heart, so that this world’s relationships, as belonging to <em> the state of things in this world</em> , are not the <em> home</em> and <em> rest</em> of the heart. This is evident from the <strong> ἔτι τε κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἑαυ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ψυχήν</strong> which follows. Let the <em> hate begin here</em> , and little explanation will be further wanted. This addition also shews that the saying was not meant only for those times, in which more perhaps of the disruption of earthly ties was required, but <em> for all time:</em> for ἡ ἑαυτοῦ ψυχή is equally dear to every man in every age. It hardly need be observed that <em> this hate</em> is not only consistent with, but <em> absolutely necessary to</em> the very highest kind of love. It is that element in love which makes a man a <em> wise and Christian friend</em> , not for time only, but for eternity.

<p>Beware of thinking, with Wordsw., that in εἶναί μου μαθητής , there is any emphasis on μου . Rather is it in the <em> least</em> emphatic place in the sentence, in order to throw all the stress on the verb εἶναι : cf. ἵνα γεμισθῇ μου ὁ οἶκος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:23">Luke 14:23</span> ; καταφαγών σου τὸν βίον , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:30">Luke 15:30</span> . In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:33">Luke 14:33</span> , the collocation is different, and μου has a secondary emphasis. See remarks on this idea of Wordsworth’s, in note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> .</p>
