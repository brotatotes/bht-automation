<p><strong> 31 33.</strong> ] This same lesson is even more pointedly set before us in the following parable, which, as well as the other, is frequently misunderstood. The <em> two kings</em> here are, the <em> man desirous to become a disciple</em> , to work out his salvation, and GOD, with whose just and holy law he is <em> naturally at variance;</em> it is his ἀντίδικος , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:58">Luke 12:58</span> , and note: these two are going to engage in war: and the question for each man to sit down and ask himself is, ‘Can I, with ( <strong> ἐν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <em> clad in</em> , <em> surrounded by, all that I have</em> , all my instrument of war) my ten thousand, stand the charge of Him who cometh against me with ( <strong> μετά</strong> <strong> ,</strong> being <em> only as many as He pleases to bring with Him</em> for the purpose, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:17">Psalms 68:17</span> , E. V.) twenty thousand?’ see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="job+15:24-26">Job 15:24-26</span> .
	</p>
<p>Here the inadequacy of man’s resources is <em> plainly set forth</em> , not left, as in the former parable, to be inferred.
	</p>
<p>Then, finding that he has no hope of prevailing, <strong> ἔτι αὐτοῦ πόῤῥω ὄντος</strong> <strong> ,</strong> while there is yet time, he sends an embassy, and sues for peace, abandoning the conflict: throwing himself upon the mere mercy and grace of God; <strong> ἀποτασσόμενος πᾶσιν τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ ὑπάρχουσιν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> in both cases.
	</p>
<p>The ordinary misinterpretation of this parable is in taking the king with twenty thousand to be the ἄρχων τοῦ κόσμου τούτου which <em> destroys all the sense:</em> for with him the <em> natural man is at peace</em> , but the <em> disciple of Christ at war</em> .</p>
