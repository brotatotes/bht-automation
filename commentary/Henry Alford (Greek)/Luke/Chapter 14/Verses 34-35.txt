<p><strong> 34, 35.</strong> ] For the third time, our Lord repeats the saying concerning salt: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:13">Matthew 5:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:50">Mark 9:50</span> , and notes. The <strong> οὖν</strong> and <strong> καί</strong> <strong> ,</strong> here restored to the text, are both valuable; the former as importing the recurrence of a saying known before, the latter as giving force to the supposition. The <em> salt</em> , in Scripture symbolism, is the whole life-retaining antiseptic influence of the Spirit of God: this, working in the εἶναί μου μαθητής , is good: but if even this be corrupted if the mere appearance of this, and not the veritable salt (which is the <em> savour</em> ), be in you wherewith, &amp;c.? Such a disciple is <strong> ἔξω βλητέος</strong> <strong> .</strong> Salt was not used for <em> land</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+107:34">Psalms 107:34</span> , nor for <em> mingling with manure;</em> it is of no use for either of those purposes, but must be utterly cast out.
