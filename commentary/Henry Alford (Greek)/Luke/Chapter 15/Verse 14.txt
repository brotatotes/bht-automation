<p>This famine is the shepherd seeking his stray sheep the woman sweeping to find the lost. The famine, in the interpretation, is to be <em> subjectively</em> taken; he begins to <em> be in want</em> (no stress on αὐτός , which is inserted on account of the change of subject from the last clause), to <em> feel</em> the emptiness of soul which precedes either utter abandonment or true penitence.</p>
