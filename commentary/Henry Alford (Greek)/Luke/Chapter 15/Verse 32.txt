<p><strong> 32.</strong> ] <strong> ἔδει</strong> not <strong> σε</strong> <strong> ,</strong> but generally <strong> it was right.</strong> The Father still asserts the restored sonship of his returned prodigal <strong> ὁ ἀδελ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σου οὗτος</strong> <strong> .</strong> We may remark that the difficulties which have been found in the latter part of the parable, from the <em> uncontradicted</em> assertion in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:29">Luke 15:29</span> , if the <em> Pharisees</em> are meant, and the great pride and uncharitableness shewn, if <em> really righteous persons</em> are meant, are considerably lightened by the consideration, that the contradiction of that assertion would have been <em> beside the purpose of the parable;</em> that it was the very thing on which the Pharisees prided themselves; that, besides, it <em> is</em> sufficiently contradicted <em> in fact</em> , by the spirit and words of the elder son. He was breaking his Father’s commandment even when he made the assertion, and the making it is part of his hypocrisy.

<p>The result of the Father’s entreaty is left purposely uncertain (see Trench, Par. in loc.): is it possible that this should have been the case, had the <em> Jewish nation</em> been meant by the elder brother? But now, as he typifies a set of individuals who might themselves be (and many of them were) won by repentance, it is thus broken off, to be closed by each individual for himself. For we are all in turn examples of the cases of both these brothers, containing the seeds of both evil courses, in our hearts: but, thanks be to God, under that grace, which is sufficient and willing to seek and save us from both.</p>
