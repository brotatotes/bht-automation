<p><strong> 9.</strong> ] <strong> αἱ φίλαι κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γείτονες</strong> are invited but there is <em> no return home</em> now nor in the explanation, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:10">Luke 15:10</span> , is there any ἐν οὐρανῷ , because the Spirit <em> abides in the Church</em> because the <em> angels are present in the Church</em> , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:10">1 Corinthians 11:10</span> : nor is it ἔσται (as in Luk 15:7 at the return of the Redeemer then future), but <strong> γίνεται</strong> the ministering spirits rejoice over every soul that is brought out of the dust of death into God’s treasure-house by the searching of the blessed Spirit.
	</p>
<p>In this parable then we have set before us the sinner who is unconscious of <em> himself</em> and <em> his own real worth;</em> who is lying, though in reality a precious coin, in the mire of this world, lost and valueless, till he is searched out by the blessed and gracious Spirit. And that such a search will be made, we are here assured.</p>
