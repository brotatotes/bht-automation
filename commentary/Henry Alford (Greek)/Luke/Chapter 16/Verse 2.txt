<p><strong> 2. </strong> <strong> τί τοῦτο</strong> <strong> …</strong> ] It makes very little difference either in admissibility of construction or of sense, whether we render, ‘ <em> why</em> do I hear this of thee?’ i.e. ‘what is the ground of this report? what occasion hast thou given for this being brought to me?’ or, ‘ <em> What is this that</em> I hear of thee?’ i.e. ‘give some account of it.’ There is the same ambiguity in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:3">Mark 11:3</span> , τί ποιεῖτε τοῦτο ; I prefer rather the former, because no opportunity of explanation <em> what</em> it is, is given him, but he is commanded to produce his books, to shew <em> how</em> it has arisen.

<p>The interpretation of this announcement to the steward, is <em> the certainty</em> , spoken by God in every one of our consciences, <em> that we must give up and give an account of our stewardship at death</em> . The great truth lies in the background, that that dismissal, death itself, is the consequence of the διασκορπίζειν τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ , the <em> wages of sin</em> .</p>
