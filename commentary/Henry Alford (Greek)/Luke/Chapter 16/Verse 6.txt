<p><strong> 6. </strong> <strong> βάτους</strong> ] ὁ δὲ βάτος δύναται χωρῆσαι ξέστας ἑβδομήκοντα δύο , Jos. Antt. viii. 2. 9; the same for liquids as the ephah for solids. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+45:10-11">Ezekiel 45:10-11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+45:14">Ezekiel 45:14</span> , where the LXX represent the Heb. בַּת by χοῖνιξ and κοτύλη .
	</p>
<p><strong> δέξαι σ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The steward, not yet out of office, has all the vouchers by him, and returns each debtor his own bond, for him to alter the figure (not, to <em> make another</em> , which would imply the <em> destruction</em> of the old bond, not its <em> return</em> ).
	</p>
<p><strong> σου</strong> is not emphatic, as Wordsworth, who has several times fallen into this mistake: see note, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:26-27">Luke 14:26-27</span> : but entirely unemphatic; almost expletive.
	</p>
<p><strong> καθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ταχ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] καθίσας is graphic. ταχέως implies the hurry with which the furtive business is transacted. The debtors seem to be all together, that all may be implicated and none may tell of the other.</p>
