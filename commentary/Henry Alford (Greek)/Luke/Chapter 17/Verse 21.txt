<p><strong> ἰδοὺ γάρ</strong> ] <strong> for behold the kingdom of God is (already) among you.</strong> The misunderstanding which rendered these words ‘ <em> within you</em> ,’ meaning this in a spiritual sense, ‘ <em> in your hearts</em> ,’ should have been prevented by reflecting that they are addressed to the <em> Pharisees</em> , in whose hearts it certainly <em> was</em> not. Nor could the expression in this connexion well bear this spiritual meaning <em> potentially</em> i.e. is in its nature, within your hearts. The words are too express and emphatic for this. We have the very expression, Xen. Anab. i. 10. 3, ἀλλὰ καὶ ταύτην ἔσωσαν ( οἱ Ἕλληνες ) καὶ ἄλλα ὁπόσα <strong> ἐντὸς αὐτῶν</strong> καὶ χρήματα καὶ ἄνθρωποι ἐγένοντο πάντα ἔσωσαν : see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:26">John 1:26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:35">John 12:35</span> , both of which are analogous expressions. See the two renderings compared in Bleek’s note.

<p>The kingdom of God was <em> begun among them</em> , and continues thus making its way in the world, without observation of men; so that whenever men can say ‘lo here or lo there,’ whenever great ‘revivals’ or ‘triumphs of the faith’ can be pointed to, they stand self-condemned as <em> not belonging to that kingdom</em> . Thus we see that every such marked event in the history of the Church is by God’s own hand as it were <em> blotted</em> and <em> marred</em> , so as not to deceive us into thinking that the kingdom has come. So it was at the Pentecostal era: so at that of Constantine; so at the Reformation.

<p>The meaning ‘among you,’ includes of course the deeper and personal one ‘within each of you,’ but the two are not convertible.</p>
