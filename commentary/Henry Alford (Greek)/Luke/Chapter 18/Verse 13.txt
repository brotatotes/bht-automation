<p><strong> οὐδὲ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὀφθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Another contrast, for we must here suppose that the Pharisee prayed with all significance of gesture, with eyes and hands uplifted (see Mat 6:5 ). There is a slight but true difference also in <strong> σταθείς</strong> of the Pharisee ‘being put in position’ (answering to ‘being seated’ of the other usual posture), and <strong> ἑστώς</strong> of the publican, ‘standing;’ coming in merely and remaining, in no studied place or posture. So Tacitus, Hist. iv. 72, ‘ <em> stabant conscientia flagitii mœstæ fixis in terram oculis</em> :’ see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ezr+9:6">Ezra 9:6</span> .

<p>There may be a stress on <strong> τῷ</strong> be [105] . <strong> ἁμαρτ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> ‘ <em> me the sinner</em> .’ Gresw. But see reff., where, as probably here, the art. is generic. It seems to me that any emphatic comparison here would somewhat detract from the solemnity and simplicity of the prayer (agst. Stier, iii. 384, edn. 2). The <strong> τῷ</strong> rather implies, not comparison with others, but intense self-abasement: “sinner that I am.” Nor are we to find any doctrinal meanings in <strong> ἱλάσθ</strong> <strong> .:</strong> WE <em> know</em> of <em> one only way</em> , in which the prayer could be accomplished: but the words here <em> have no reference to that, nor could they have</em> .
