<p>The point of this part of the parable is, the extortion of <em> right</em> from <em> such a man</em> by importunity. <em> His act</em> was not an act of justice, but of injustice; his very ἐκδίκησις was ἀδικία , because he did it from <em> self-regard</em> , and <em> not from a sense of duty</em> . He, like the steward above, was τῆς <strong> ἀδικίας</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <em> belonging to, being of</em> , the iniquity which prevails in the world.</p>
