<p><strong> 10, 11.</strong> ] <strong> πρὸς ἑαυτόν</strong> belongs to <strong> προσηύχ</strong> <strong> .</strong> (cf. Mar 14:4 ), not to <strong> σταθείς</strong> <strong> :</strong> that would be καθ ʼ ἑαυτόν , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:17">James 2:17</span> . <strong> He stood</strong> (in the ordinary place), <strong> and prayed thus with himself,</strong> as E.

There, in the deepest humility, he ascribes it to the <em> grace of God</em> that he laboured more abundantly than they all; <strong> yet,</strong> <em> not </em> <strong><em> I,</em></strong> <strong> but the grace of God that was with me.</strong></p>
