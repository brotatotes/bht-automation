<p><strong> 15 17.</strong> ] LITTLE CHILDREN BROUGHT TO CHRIST. Here the narrative of Luke again falls in with those of Matthew and Mark, after a divergence of nearly nine chapters: see note on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:13-15">Matthew 19:13-15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:13-15">Matthew 19:13-15</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:13-16">Mark 10:13-16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:13-16">Mark 10:13-16</span> . The <em> narrative</em> part of our text is distinct from the two; the words of our Lord are verbatim as Mark: see notes on Matt. The place and time indicated here are the same as before, from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:11">Luke 17:11</span> .</p>
