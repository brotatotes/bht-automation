<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] The offering (ref. Levit.) was, <em> a lamb for a burnt-offering, and a pigeon for a sin-offering:</em> but if the parties were too poor to bring a lamb, then <em> two pigeons</em> . But as Bleek remarks, we are not hereby justified in assuming <em> extreme poverty</em> to have been the condition of our Lordâ€™s family. This no where appears from the gospel history.</p>
