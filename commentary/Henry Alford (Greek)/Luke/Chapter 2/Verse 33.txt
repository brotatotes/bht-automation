<p><strong> 33. </strong> <strong> ὁ πατ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτοῦ</strong> ] In Luk 2:48 we have Joseph again called by this name. <em> Our Lord Himself would not speak of him thus</em> , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:49">Luke 2:49</span> ; but in the simplicity of the narrative we may read οἱ γονεῖς αὐτοῦ and such expressions, without any danger of forgetting the momentous history of the Conception and Nativity.</p>
