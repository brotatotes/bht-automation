<p><strong> 35.</strong> ] This prophecy I do not believe to have its chief reference to the <em> deep sorrows</em> of the mother of our Lord <em> on beholding His sufferings</em> (Euthym [27] , alli [28] .), much less to her <em> future death by martyrdom</em> (Epiphan., Lightf.); least of all to the Crucifixion, which by shedding the blood of her Son, would also pierce her heart and drain it of its life-blood and make it childless, as Bp. Wordsw. referring to Bede, Aug [29] , who however (cf. Aug [30] Ep. ad Paulinum cxlix. 33, vol. ii., and Bede, in Luc. Expos. i. vol. iii. p. 346; Homil. lib. i. 15, vol. v. p. 81) say nothing of the kind, but simply refer the saying to her grief at beholding the Passion: and to Origen, who (in Luc. Hom. xvii. vol. iii. p. 952) gives a totally different interpretation, “pertransibit infidelitatis gladius, et ambiguitatis mucrone ferieris, et cogitationes tuæ te in diversa lacerabunt, cum videris illum quem Filium Dei audieras … crucifigi &amp;c.” None of these interpretations satisfy us: for the words stand in a totally different connexion, and one far worthier of the honour of that holy woman, and of the spiritual character of Symeon’s prophecy: that prophecy is, of the struggle of many in Israel through repentance to faith in this Saviour; among which number even <em> His mother herself was to be included</em> . The sharp pangs of sorrow for sin must pierce her heart <em> also</em> (cf. esp. Act 2:37 ); and the general end follows; <em> that the reasonings out of many hearts may be revealed;</em> that they who receive the Lord Jesus may be manifest, and they who reject Him: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:39">John 9:39</span> . Similarly Bleek: finding moreover in the traces of her connexion with our Lord in the Evangelic history the piercing and dividing of her soul, and in the last notice of her in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:0">Acts 1:0</span> , the triumph of her faith after the Ascension.
