<p><strong> 10, 11.</strong> ] <strong> παντὶ τῷ λ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> not (E. V.) <strong> to all people,</strong> here: but <strong> to all</strong> THE <strong> people,</strong> the Jewish people. To them was the first message of joy, before the bursting in of the Gentiles just as here the one angel gives the prefatory announcement, before the multitude of the heavenly host burst in with their proclamation of ‘peace on earth.’

<p><strong> σωτήρ</strong> ] <strong> a Saviour,</strong> as E. V., the name being particularized afterwards.

<p><strong> χρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κύρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] This is the only place where these words come together. In ch. Luk 23:2 we have χρ . βασιλέα , and in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36">Acts 2:36</span> κύριον καὶ χρ . (In Col 3:24 we have, in a somewhat different meaning (said to servants), τῷ κυρίῳ χριστῷ δουλεύετε .) And I see no way of understanding this <strong> κύριος</strong> <strong> ,</strong> but as corresponding to the Hebrew JEHOVAH.</p>
