<p><strong> 3 5.</strong> ] There is a mixture here of Roman and Jewish customs, which is not at all improbable, considering the circumstances. In the Roman census, men, women, and children were all obliged to go and be enrolled. Dion. Hal. iv. 15, ἃπαντας ἐκέλευσε ( ὁ Τύλλιος ) τοὺς ὁμοπάγους κατὰ κεφαλὴν ὡρισμένον νόμισμά τι συνεισφέρειν , ἕτερον μέν τι τοὺς ἄνδρας , ἕτερον δέ τι τὰς γυναῖκας , ἄλλο δέ τι τοὺς ἀνήβους . But then this census was made at their <em> dwelling-place</em> , not at that of their <em> extraction</em> . The latter practice springs from the Jewish genealogical habits, and its adoption in this case <em> speaks strongly for the accuracy of the chronology</em> . If this enrolment was by order of Augustus, and for the whole empire, it of course would be made so as to include <em> all</em> , after the Roman manner: but inasmuch as it was made <em> under the Jewish king Herod</em> , it was done <em> after the Jewish manner</em> , in taking this account of each <em> at his own place of extraction</em> .

<p>Mary being apparently <em> herself sprung from the lineage of David</em> (see ch. Luk 1:32 ), might on this account go to Bethlehem, being, as some suppose, an inheritress; but this does not seem to be the Evangelist’s meaning, but that, after the Roman manner, she <em> accompanied her husband</em> .

<p>No stress must be laid on <strong> ἐμνηστ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> as if she were <em> only</em> the <em> betrothed</em> wife of Joseph at this time; she had been taken to his house before this: the history in our text happening during the time indicated by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:25">Matthew 1:25</span> .</p>
