<p><strong> 36.</strong> ] The <strong> ἰσάγγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γάρ εἰσιν</strong> is alleged, not as shewing them to be ἀπαθεῖς κ . ἀφιλήδονοι (Euthym [108] ), but as setting forth their <em> immortality</em> .

<p><strong> υἱοὶ θ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is here used, not in its <em> ethical sense</em> , as applied to believers in this world, but its <em> metaphysical sense</em> , as denoting the <em> essential state</em> of the blessed after the resurrection: ‘they are, by their resurrection, <em> essentially</em> partakers of the divine nature, and so cannot die.’ When Meyer says that the Lord <em> only</em> speaks of the <em> risen</em> , and has not here in His view the ‘quick’ at the time of His coming, it must be remembered that the ‘change’ which shall pass on them ( 1Co 15:51-54 ) shall put them into precisely the same ἀφθαρσία as the risen (compare ibid. Luk 20:42 ).</p>
