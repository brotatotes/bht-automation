<p><strong> 34, 35. </strong> <strong> οἱ υἱοὶ</strong> <strong> …</strong> ] Peculiar to Luke, and important. For this present state of men, marriage is an ordained and natural thing; but in τῷ αἰῶνι ἐκείνῳ , which is by the context the state of the <em> first resurrection</em> (nothing being said of the rest of the dead, though the <em> bare fact</em> might be predicated of them also), they who are found worthy to obtain that state of life and the resurrection from the dead, are no longer under the ordinance of marriage: for neither can they any more die; i.e. they will have no need of a succession and renewal, which is the main purpose of marriage.</p>
