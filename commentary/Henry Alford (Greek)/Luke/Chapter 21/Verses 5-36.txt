<p><strong> 5 36.</strong> ] PROPHECY OF HIS COMING, AND OF THE TIMES OF THE END. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:1-51">Matthew 24:1-51</span> ( Mat 25:1-46 ). <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:1-37">Mark 13:1-37</span> . See notes on both, but especially on Matt. Meyer says truly in loc. that there is no trace in Luke of the discourse being delivered on <em> the Mount of Olives</em> but he adds, that it belongs to the discourses <em> in the temple</em> , which begin ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:1">Luke 20:1</span> , and that therefore Luke alone mentions ἀναθήματα . He seems to have overlooked the <em> break</em> at <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:7">Luke 21:7</span> , corresponding to the change of scene. All three speak of the <em> opening incident</em> as happening while He was departing from the temple; and Matt. and Mark, of the enquiry being made <em> afterwards</em> , on the Mount of Olives, i.e. in the evening, when He had retired thither ( Luk 21:37 ).</p>
