<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] Some (e.g. De Wette) suppose that it is here implied that our Lord <em> did not drink of the cup Himself</em> . But surely this cannot be so. The two members of the speech are strictly parallel: and if He desired to <em> eat</em> the Passover with them, He would also <em> drink of the cup</em> , which formed a usual part of the ceremonial. This seems to me to be implied in <strong> δεξάμενος</strong> <strong> :</strong> λαβών is the word used by all <em> afterwards</em> , when He did <em> not</em> partake of the bread and wine. This most important addition in our narrative, amounts I believe to a solemn declaration of the <em> fulfilment of the Passover rite</em> , in both its usual divisions, the eating the flesh of the lamb, and drinking the cup of thanksgiving. Henceforward, He who fulfilled the Law for man will no more eat and drink of it. I remark this, in order further to observe that <em> this division of the cup</em> is not only not <em> identical with</em> , but has <em> no reference to</em> , the subsequent one in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:20">Luke 22:20</span> . That was the <em> institution of a new rite;</em> this the <em> abrogation</em> <em> of an old one</em> , now fulfilled, or about to be so, in the person of the true Lamb of God.

<p>This is generally supposed to have been the <em> first</em> cup in the Passover-meal, with which the whole was introduced.
