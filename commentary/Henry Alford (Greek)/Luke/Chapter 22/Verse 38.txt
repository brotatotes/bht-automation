<p><strong> 38.</strong> ] Two of them were armed, either from excess of zeal to defend Him, excited by His announcement of His sufferings during this feast, or perhaps because they had brought their weapons from Galilee as protection by the way. The road from Jericho to Jerusalem (see ch. Luk 10:30 ) was much infested with robbers; and it was the custom for the priests, and even the quiet and ascetic Essenes, to <em> carry weapons</em> when travelling. Chrysostom (Hom. in Matt. lxxxiv. vol. vii. p. 797) gives a curious explanation of the two swords: εἰκὸς οὖν καὶ μαχαίρας εἶναι ἐκεῖ διὰ τὸ ἀρνίον . This certainly agrees with the number of the disciples sent to get ready the Passover: but it has nothing else to recommend it. They exhibit their swords, misunderstanding His words and supposing them to apply to that night. Our Lord breaks off the matter with <strong> ἱκανόν ἐστιν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> ‘ <em> It is enough;</em> ’ not ‘ <em> they are sufficient;</em> ’ but, <strong> It is well,</strong> <strong> we are sufficiently provided</strong> ‘it was not to this that My words referred.’ The rebuke is parallel with, though milder than, the one in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:17">Mark 8:17</span> , as the misunderstanding was somewhat similar.</p>
