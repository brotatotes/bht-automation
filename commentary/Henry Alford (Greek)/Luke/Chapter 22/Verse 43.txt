<p><strong> 43.</strong> ] The principal testimonies of the Fathers, &amp;c. against and for <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:43-44">Luke 22:43-44</span> , are collected in the digest. With the early and weighty evidence there cited in favour of the passage, it is impossible that it should have been an apocryphal insertion. It was perhaps, as Epiph [114] states of ἔκλαυσε , expunged by the orthodox, who imagined they found in it an inconsistency with the divine nature of our Lord. We have reason to be thankful, that orthodoxy has been better understood since. The strengthening by means of the angel is <em> physical</em> and the appearance likewise. See an interesting reply to the scoffs of Julian on this point, in Theodore of Mopsuestia, in loc. ed. Migne, p. 723. It is strange how Olshausen can have so far deceived himself as to imagine that <strong> ὤφθη αὐτῷ</strong> can imply a merely inward and spiritual accession of strength from above. It is strange likewise that the analogy of the ministration of angels in the Lord’s former temptation should not have occurred to those modern Commentators who have objected to this circumstance as improbable.

<p>This strengthening probably took place <em> between the first and the second prayer;</em> and the effect of it is the <strong> ἐκτενέστερον προσηύχετο</strong> of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:44">Luke 22:44</span> , and the entire resignation expressed in the second and third prayer of Matthew’s narrative.</p>
