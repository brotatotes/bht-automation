<p><strong> 54.</strong> ] <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:57">Matthew 26:57</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:53">Mark 14:53</span> . Joh 18:13 . Our narrative leaves it undecided <em> who this high-priest was</em> , inasmuch as, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:2">Luke 3:2</span> , <em> Annas and Caiaphas</em> are mentioned as high-priests. From John we find that it was <em> Annas;</em> who having questioned Jesus, sent Him bound to Caiaphas, before whom His trial took place. Luke omits this trial altogether or perhaps gives the substance of it in the account ( Luk 22:66-71 ) of the morning assembly of the Sanhedrim. See notes on Matt.</p>
