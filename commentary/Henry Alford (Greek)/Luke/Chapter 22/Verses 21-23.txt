<p><strong> 21 23.</strong> ] ANNOUNCEMENT OF A BETRAYER. See notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:20-25">Matthew 26:20-25</span> . I would not venture absolutely to maintain that this announcement is <em> identical</em> with that one; but I own the arguments of Stier and others to prove them distinct, fail to convince me. The expression <strong> πλὴν ἰδού</strong> bears marks of verbal accuracy, and inclines us to believe that this announcement was made <em> after the institution of the cup</em> , as here related. ‘Notwithstanding this My declaration of love, in giving My Body and Blood for you, there is one here present who shall betray Me.’

<p><strong> ἐπὶ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τρ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> viz. in dipping into the dish with the Lord.

<p><strong> πορεύεται</strong> ] A somewhat similar πορεύεσθαι to this occurs ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:33">Luke 13:33</span> ; but that is used of our Lord’s ministerial progress; this of His progress through suffering to glory.</p>
