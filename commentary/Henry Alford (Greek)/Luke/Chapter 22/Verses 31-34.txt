<p><strong> 31 34.</strong> ] APPEAL TO PETER: HIS CONFIDENCE, AND OUR LORD’S REPLY. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:30-35">Matthew 26:30-35</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:26-31">Mark 14:26-31</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:36-38">John 13:36-38</span> .) The speech appears to <em> proceed continuously</em> . There are marks in these words of our Lord, of close connexion with what has gone before. <em> His</em> way which the Father διέθετο to Him, is <em> to His kingdom</em> but it is <em> through</em> πειρασμοί . To <em> these</em> , who have been with Him in these trials, He διατίθεται βασιλείαν , but <em> His</em> way to it must be <em> their</em> way, and here is the πειρασμός , the sifting as wheat.

<p>The sudden address to Simon may perhaps have been occasioned by some remark of his, or, which I think more probable, may have been made in consequence of some part taken by him in the preceding strife for precedence. Such sudden and earnest addresses spring forth from deep love and concern awakened for another.</p>
