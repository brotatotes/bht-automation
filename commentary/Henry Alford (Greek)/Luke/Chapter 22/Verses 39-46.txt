<p><strong> 39 46.</strong> ] CHRIST’S AGONY AT THE MOUNT OF OLIVES. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:36-46">Matthew 26:36-46</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:32-42">Mark 14:32-42</span> . Joh 18:1 . For all comment on the general narrative, see notes on Matthew.

On the other hand it inserts the very important additional details of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:44-45">Luke 22:44-45</span> , besides the particularity of ὡσεὶ λίθου βολήν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:41">Luke 22:41</span> .</p>
