<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] The cause of the quarrel is uncertain: apparently something concerning Herodâ€™s power of jurisdiction, which was conceded by Pilate in this sending Jesus to him, and again waived by Herod in sending Him back again. From chap. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:1">Luke 13:1</span> , Pilate appears to have encroached on that jurisdiction.

<p>The remarks of some Commentators about their <em> uniting in enmity against Christ</em> (so even, recently, Wordsworth), are quite beside the purpose. The present feeling of Pilate was any thing but hostile to the person of Christ; and Herod, by his treatment of Him, shews that he thought Him beneath his judicial notice.

<p>This remission of Jesus to Herod seems not to have been known to either of the other three Evangelists. It is worthy of notice that they all relate the mocking by the soldiers of Pilate, which Luke omits, whereas he gives it as taking place before Herod. This is one of the very few cases where the nature of the history shews that <em> both</em> happened.

<p>Let the student ask himself, How could John, if he composed his Gospel with that of Luke before him, have here given us a narrative in which so important a fact as this is not only not related, but absolutely <em> cannot find any place of insertion?</em> Its <em> real place</em> is after <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:38">John 18:38</span> ; but obviously nothing was further from the mind of that Evangelist, for he represents Pilate as speaking continuously.</p>
