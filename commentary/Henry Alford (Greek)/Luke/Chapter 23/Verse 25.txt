<p><strong> 25.</strong> <strong> τὸν δ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σ</strong> <strong> .</strong> κ . τ . λ .] The description is inserted for the sake of contrast; see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:14">Acts 3:14</span> . Luke omits the scourging and mocking of Jesus. It is <em> just possible</em> that he might have omitted the mocking, because he had related a similar incident before Herod; but how shall we say this of the scourging, if he had seen any narratives which contained it? The break between Luk 23:25-26 is harsh in the extreme, and if Luke had any materials wherewith to fill it up, I have no doubt he would have done so.</p>
