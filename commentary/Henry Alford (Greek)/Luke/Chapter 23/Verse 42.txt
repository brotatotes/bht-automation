<p><strong> 42.</strong> ] The thief had heard of the announcements which Jesus had made, or at all events of the popular rumour concerning his Kingdom. His faith lays hold on the truth that this <em> is</em> the King of the Jews in a higher and immortal sense. There is nothing so astounding in this man’s faith <em> dogmatically</em> considered, as De Wette thinks; he merely <em> joins</em> the common belief of the Jews of a Messianic Kingdom, in which the ancient Fathers were to rise, &amp;c., with the conviction, that <em> Jesus is the Messiah</em> . What is <em> really</em> astounding, is the <em> power</em> and <em> strength</em> of that faith, which, amidst shame and pain and mockery, could thus lift itself to the apprehension of <em> the Crucified</em> as this King.

<p><strong> ἐν τῇ βασ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The Vulgate, which is followed by Luther, and the E. V., renders this as if it were εἰς τὴν βασ . (see var. readd.), which is a sad mistake, as it destroys the force of the expression. It is <em> in</em> <strong> thy Kingdom with thy Kingdom,</strong> so ἔλθῃ ἐν τῇ δόξῃ αὐτοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31">Matthew 25:31</span> , which we (E. V.) have translated rightly. The above mistake entirely loses <strong> ἔλθῃς</strong> making it merely ‘ <em> comest into</em> ,’ just as we say to ‘ <em> come into</em> ’ an estate: whereas it is the chief word in the clause, and ἐν τῇ β . σου its qualification, <strong> at Thy coming in Thy Kingdom.

<p>It will be seen that there is no necessity for supposing the man to have been <em> a disciple</em> , as some have done.

<p>It is remarkable how, in three following sayings, the Lord appears as Prophet, Priest, and King: as <em> Prophet</em> , to the <em> daughters of Jerusalem;</em> as <em> Priest</em> , interceding for forgiveness; as <em> King</em> , acknowledged by the penitent thief, and answering his prayer.</p>
