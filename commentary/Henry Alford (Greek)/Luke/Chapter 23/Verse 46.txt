<p><strong> 46.</strong> ] The use of <strong> φωνῇ μεγάλῃ</strong> shews that <em> this was the cry</em> to which Matt. and Mark allude. The words are from the LXX, varying however from the common reading παραθήσομαι , and giving the verb in the present, which is also the rendering of the Hebrew ( אַפְקִיד ).
	</p>
<p>These words have in them an important and deep meaning. They accompany that, which in our Lord’s case was strictly speaking the <em> act</em> of death. It was <em> His own act</em> not ‘feeling the approach of death,’ as some, not apprehending the matter, have commented; but a <em> determinate delivering up of His spirit to the Father</em> . παρέδωκεν τὸ πνεῦμα , John: see Joh 10:18 οὐδεὶς αἴρει αὐτὴν ἀπ ʼ ἐμοῦ , ἀλλ ʼ ἐγὼ <strong> τίθημι αὐτὴν ἀπ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἐμαυτοῦ</strong> <strong> .</strong> None of the Evangelists say ‘He <em> died:</em> ’ although that expression is ever after used of His death stated as one great fact: but it is, ἀφῆκεν τὸ πν ., Matt.; ἐξέπνευσεν , Mark, Luke; παρέδωκεν τὸ πνεῦμα , John.
	</p>
<p>The <strong> πνεῦμα</strong> here is the <em> Personality</em> the human soul informed by the Spirit, <em> in union:</em> not separated, so that His soul went to Hades, and His spirit to the Father (Olshausen). Both are delivered into the hand of the Father by Whom quickened (but ζωοποιηθεὶς πνεύματι of 1Pe 3:18 is to be rendered ‘quickened <em> in</em> the spirit’ <em> by the Father</em> is understood in ζωοποιηθείς ) He worked His great victory over death and Hell.
