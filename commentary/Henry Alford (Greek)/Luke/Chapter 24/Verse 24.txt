It is natural, even in accordance with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:12">Luke 24:12</span> , that the antithesis to τινές before, and the loose way of speaking to a stranger, who (they believed) was not acquainted with any among them, might cause them here to use τινές , without any reference to Peter being <em> accompanied</em> . But what wonder, if the reports of such a day of anxiety and confusion were themselves disjointed and confused?</p>
