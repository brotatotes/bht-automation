<p><strong> 30.</strong> ] I believe that there was something in the manner of His breaking the bread, and helping and giving it to them, which was his own appointed means of opening their eyes to the recognition of Him. But we must not suppose any reference to, much less any celebration of, the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper. <em> Neither of these disciples was present at its institution</em> (but see Wieseler’s conjecture, which is at all events worth consideration, in note on Luk 24:13 ); and certainly it had never been celebrated since. With this simple consideration will fall to the ground all that Romanists have built on this incident, even to making it a defence of administration in one kind only. See Wordsw., who gives, in reply, a solution as artificial and unwarranted as the argument of the R. Catholics: shewing the danger of departing from the plain sense of Holy Scripture in search of fanciful allusions. The analogy of such a breaking and giving with His institution of that holy ordinance becomes lost, when we force the incident into an example of the ordinance itself. The Lord at their meal takes on Him the office of the <em> master of the house</em> (which alone would shew that it was not <em> their house</em> , but an inn), perhaps on account of the superior place which His discourse had won for Him in their estimation: and as the Jewish rule was, that “three eating together were bound to give thanks” (Berac. 45. 1, cited by Meyer), He fulfils this duty. In doing so, perhaps the well-known manner of His taking bread, &amp;c., perhaps the marks of the nails in His hands, then first noticed, or these together, as <em> secondary</em> means, but certainly <em> His own will and permission to be seen by them</em> , opened their eyes to know Him.</p>
