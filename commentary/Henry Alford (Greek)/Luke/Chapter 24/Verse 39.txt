<p><strong> 39.</strong> ] There seems to be some doubt whether the reference to His hands and feet was on account of the <em> marks of the nails</em> , to prove His <em> identity</em> , or as being the <em> uncovered parts</em> of His body, and to prove His <em> corporeity</em> . Both views seem supported by the text, and I think both were united. The sight of the Hands and Feet, which they recognized as His, might at once convince them of the <em> reality</em> of the appearance, and the identity of the Person. The account of John confirms the idea that He shewed them the marks of the nails, both by <em> His side</em> being added, and by the expressions of Thomas which followed. The same seems also implied in our <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:40">Luke 24:40</span> .

<p>The assertion of the Lord must not be taken as representing merely ‘the popular notion concerning spirits’ (Dr. Burton); <em> He who is the Truth, does not speak thus of that which He knows, and has created</em> . He declares to us the truth, that those appearances to which He was now likened by the disciples, and spirits in general, have not flesh and bones. Observe σάρκα κ . ὀστέα but not αἷμα . This the resurrection Body probably <em> had not</em> , as being the <em> animal life:</em> see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:27">John 20:27</span> .</p>
