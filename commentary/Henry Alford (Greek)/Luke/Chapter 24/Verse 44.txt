<p><strong> 44.</strong> ] Certainly, from the recurrence of <strong> δέ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> which implies immediate sequence, Luke, at the time of writing his Gospel, was not in possession of records of any Galilæan appearances of the Lord, nor indeed of any later than this one. That he corrects this in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:0">Acts 1:0</span> , shews him meantime to have become acquainted with some other sources of information, not however perhaps including the Galilæan appearances (see Prolegg. to Luke, § iv. 2).

<p>The following discourse apparently contains a summary of many things said during the last forty days before the ascension; they cannot have been said <em> on this evening;</em> for after the command in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:49">Luke 24:49</span> , the disciples would not have gone away into Galilee. Whether <em> the Evangelist regarded</em> it as a summary, is to me extremely doubtful. Knowing apparently of no Galilæan appearances, he seems to relate the command of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:49">Luke 24:49</span> , both here and in the Acts, as intended to apply to the <em> whole time</em> between the Resurrection and the descent of the Holy Ghost.

<p>This threefold division of the O.T. is the ordinary Jewish one, into the Law ( תּוֹרָה ), Prophets ( נְבִיאִים ), and Hagiographa ( כְּתוּבִים ) the first containing the Pentateuch; the second Joshua, Judges, the four books of Kings, and the Prophets, except Daniel; the third the Psalms, and all the rest of the canonical books, Daniel, Esther, Ezra, and Nehemiah being reckoned as one book, and the Chronicles closing the canon.</p>
