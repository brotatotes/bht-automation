<p>A few words must be appended here on a point which has been much stirred in Germany, even among the more orthodox Commentators; THE HISTORIC REALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ASCENSION. On those among them who doubt <em> the fact of an Ascension at all</em> , I have nothing to say, standing as I do altogether on different ground from them.
	</p>
<p><em> The Lord Himself foretold</em> His Ascension, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:62">John 6:62</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:17">John 20:17</span> : it was immediately after His disappearance from the earth <em> expressly announced by the Apostles</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:33-34">Acts 2:33-34</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:31">Acts 5:31</span> : <em> and it continued to be an article of their preaching and teaching</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:6">Ephesians 2:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:10">Ephesians 4:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span> . <em> So far</em> should we have been assured of it, had we <em> not possessed</em> the testimonies of Luke, here and in the Acts: for the fragment super-added to the Gospel of Mark merely <em> states the fact</em> , not the <em> manner of it</em> . But, to take first the <em> a priori</em> view, <em> is it probable that our Lord would have left so weighty a fact in His history on earth, without witnesses?</em> And might we not have concluded from the wording of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:62">John 6:62</span> , that our Lord must have intended an ascension <em> in the sight of some of those to whom He spoke</em> , and that the Evangelist himself <em> gives that hint, by recording those words without comment, that he had seen it?
	</em></p>
<p>Then again, is there any thing in the bodily state of our Lord after His resurrection which raises any even the least difficulty here? He appeared suddenly, and vanished suddenly, when He pleased; when it pleased Him, He ate, He spoke, He walked, but His Body was the Body of the Resurrection; only not yet his σῶμα τῆς δόξης ( Php 3:21 ), because He had <em> not yet assumed</em> that glory: but that He <em> could</em> assume it, and did assume it at His Ascension, will be granted by all who believe in Him as the Son of God. So that it seems, <em> on à priori grounds</em> , probable that, <em> granted the fact of the Ascension</em> , it did take place in some such manner as our accounts relate: <em> in the sight of the disciples</em> , and <em> by the uplifting of the risen Body of the Lord towards that which is to those on this earth the visible heaven</em> .
	</p>
<p>This being so, let us now, secondly, regard the matter <em> à posteriori</em> . We possess two accounts of the circumstances of this ascension, written by the same person, and that person a contemporary of the Apostles themselves. Of the <em> genuineness</em> of these accounts there never was a doubt. How improbable that Luke should have related <em> what any Apostles or apostolic persons might have contradicted?</em> How improbable that the universal Church, founded by those who are said to have been eyewitnesses of this event, should have <em> received these two accounts as authentic, if they were not so?</em> That <em> these accounts themselves</em> are never referred to in the Epistles, is surely no argument against them. If an occasion had arisen, such as necessitated the writing of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:0">1 Corinthians 15:0</span> , there can be little doubt that St. Paul would have been as particular in the circumstances of the Ascension, as he has been in those of the Resurrection. The fact is, that by far the greatest difficulty remains to be solved by those who can imagine a myth or fiction on this subject to have arisen in the first age of the Church. Such a supposition is not more repugnant to our Christian faith and reverence, than it is to common sense and historical consistency.</p>
