Luke’s account is much more concise than usual, and wholly independent of the others; see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:10">Mark 1:10</span> ; we have here however three additional particulars 1. that <em> all the people had been baptized before</em> the Lord’s baptism: 2. that He <em> was praying</em> at the time of the descent of the Spirit: 3. that the Spirit appeared <em> in a bodily form</em> . On (1) we may remark that this is necessarily the meaning of ἐν τῷ βαπ . for Luke when he means ‘during,’ &amp;c. invariably uses the <em> present;</em> see for the past tense with ἐν τῷ reff. and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:1">Luke 14:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:15">Luke 19:15</span> ; Luk 24:30 for the present, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:1">Luke 5:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:5">Luke 8:5</span> , &amp;c., and for a comparison of the two, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:40">Luke 8:40</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:42">Luke 8:42</span> .
