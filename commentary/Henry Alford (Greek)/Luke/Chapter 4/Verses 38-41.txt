<p><strong> 38 41.</strong> ] HEALING OF SIMON’S WIFE’S MOTHER, AND MANY OTHERS. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14-17">Matthew 8:14-17</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:29-34">Mark 1:29-34</span> . Our account has only a slight additional detail, which is interesting however as giving another side of an eye-witness’s evidence it is <strong> ἐπιστὰς ἐπάνω αὐτῆς</strong> <strong> .</strong> Now this is implied in laying hold of her hand, as she was in bed; which particulars are both mentioned by Matt. and Mark: this being one of those many cases where alteration (of κρατήσας τ . χειρ .… into ἐπιστ . ἐπ . αὐτ .) is utterly inconceivable.</p>
