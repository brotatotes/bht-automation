<p><strong> 17 26.</strong> ] HEALING OF A PARALYTIC. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:2-8">Matthew 9:2-8</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:1-12">Mark 2:1-12</span> . This miracle is introduced by the indefinite words, καὶ ἐγ . ἐν μιᾷ τ . ἡμ .: see reff. In Mat 8:5 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:1">Matthew 9:1</span> , a series of incidents are interposed. Our Lord there appears to have returned from the country of the Gadarenes and the miracle on the dæmoniac there, to ‘ <em> His own city</em> ,’ i.e. Capernaum. The order in Mark is the same as here, and his narrative contains the only decisive note of sequence (ch. Luk 4:35 ), which determines his order and that in the text to have been the actual one, and the events in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:0">Matthew 8:0</span> to be related out of their order.</p>
