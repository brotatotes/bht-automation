<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] <strong> ἐν τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is vague in date, and may belong to any part of the period of our Lord’s ministry now before us. I believe it to be a form of acknowledgment on the part of the Evangelist, that <em> he did not determine exactly into what part of this period to bring the incident so introduced</em> . Indeed the whole of this paragraph is of a supplementary and indefinite character, serving more as a preface to the discourse which follows, than as an integral part of the narration in its present sequence. This of course in no way affects the accuracy of the circumstances therein related, which nearly coincide in this and the cognate, though independent, account of Mark.

The whole context, and the frequency of the objective genitive (see Winer, § 30. 1, edn. 6), should have prevented the Commentators (Hammond, Olearius, &amp;c.) from making the blunder of imagining <strong> προσευχή</strong> here to be a <em> proseucha</em> or <em> house of prayer:</em> see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:13">Acts 16:13</span> .</p>
