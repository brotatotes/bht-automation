<p><strong> 20. </strong> <strong> εἰς τοὺς μ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The discourse was spoken to the disciples generally, to the Twelve particularly, to the people prospectively; and its subject, both here and in Matt., is, <em> the state and duties of a disciple of Christ</em> .

<p><strong> πτωχοί</strong> ] To suppose that Luke’s report of this discourse refers <em> only to this world’s</em> poverty, &amp;c. and the blessings to anticipated <em> outward</em> prosperity in the Messiah’s Kingdom (De Wette, Meyer), is surely quite a misapprehension. Comparing these expressions with other passages in Luke himself, we must have concluded, <em> even without Matthew’s report</em> , that they bore a <em> spiritual</em> sense: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:11">Luke 16:11</span> , where he speaks of ‘ <em> the true</em> riches,’ and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:21">Luke 12:21</span> , where we have <strong> εἰς θεὸν</strong> πλουτῶν . And who would apply such an interpretation to our Luk 6:21 ?

<p><strong> ἡ βασ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θ</strong> <strong> .</strong> = ἡ βασ . τ . οὐρανῶν Matt., but it does not thence follow that αὐρανοί = θεός , but the two are different ways of designating the same kingdom the one by its situation <em> in heaven</em> , where its πολιτεία is ( ἡ ἄνω Ἰερουσαλήμ , Gal 4:26 ), the other by <em> Him</em> , whose it is.</p>
