<p><strong> 26.</strong> ] Not said to the <em> rich</em> , but to the <em> disciples</em> . The very warning conveyed in <strong> ψευδοπροφ</strong> <strong> .</strong> shews this, and should have prevented Meyer from making the blunder. The mention of προφ . and ψευδοπροφ . has reference to the disciples’ office as the salt of the earth. The address in Luk 6:27 is not (Meyer) a turning of the discourse to His own disciples, but <strong> ὑμῖν λέγω τοῖς ἀκούουσιν</strong> = ἐγὼ δὲ λέγω ὑμῖν , which introduces the same command <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:44">Matthew 5:44</span> , and τοῖς ἀκούουσιν serves the purpose of the ἐγώ <strong> to you who now hear Me.</strong> The discourse being mutilated, the strong antithesis could not be brought out.</p>
