<p><strong> 1 5.</strong> ] THE DISCIPLES PLUCK EARS OF CORN ON THE SABBATH. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:1-8">Matthew 12:1-8</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:23-28">Mark 2:23-28</span> . Between the discourse just related here and in Mark, and this incident, Matthew interposes <em> the raising of Jaeirusâ€™s daughter, the healing of the two blind and one dumb, the mission of the twelve, and the message of John</em> . I need not insist on these obvious proofs of independence in the construction of our Gospels.

<p>On the question of the arrangements, see on Matt.</p>
