<p><strong> 12 19.</strong> ] CALLING AND NAMES OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES. <em> Peculiar</em> (in this form) <em> to Luke:</em> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:15-21">Matthew 12:15-21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:13-19">Mark 3:13-19</span> . We may observe that Matt. does not relate the <em> choosing</em> of the Apostles, but only takes occasion to give a list of them on their being sent out, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:1">Luke 10:1</span> ff.; and that Mark and Luke agree in the time of their being chosen, placing it immediately after the healing on the sabbath, but with no very definite note of time.</p>
