<p><strong> 15. </strong> <strong> ἔδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τῇ μ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Doubtless there was a deeper reason than the mere consoling of the widow (of whom there were many in Israel now as beforetime), that influenced our Lord to work this miracle: Olshausen (vol. i. p. 271) remarks, “A reference in this miracle to the <em> raised man himself</em> is by no means excluded. Man, as a conscious being, can never be a <em> mere means</em> to an end, which would here be the case, if we suppose the consolation of the mother to have been the only object for which the young man was raised.” He goes on to say that the hidden intent was probably the spiritual awakening of the youth; which would impart a deeper meaning to <strong> ἔδωκεν αὐτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τῇ μ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐ</strong> <strong> .</strong> and make her joy to be a true and abiding one.</p>
