<p>The Pharisee <em> assumes</em> that our Lord did not know who, or of what sort, this woman was, and thence doubts His being a prophet (see Luk 7:16 ); the possibility of His <em> knowing this and permitting it</em> , never so much as occurs to him. It was the <em> touching</em> by an unclean person which constituted the defilement. This is all that the Pharisee fixes on: his <em> offence</em> is merely technical and ceremonial.</p>
