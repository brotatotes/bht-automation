<p><strong> 51.</strong> ] Our Lord had entered the house, where He found θόρυβον , τοὺς αὐλητὰς καὶ τὸν ὄχλον (Matt., Mark), who were all following Him into the chamber of death. On this <em> He declared who were to follow Him</em> ( οὐκ ἀφῆκεν , κ . τ . λ .), and uttered the words ἀναχωρεῖτε · οὐ γὰρ κ . τ . λ . Then He entered with His three Apostles and the parents. I say this, not for the sake of harmonizing, but to bring out the sequence in our narrative here, which unless we get the right meaning for ἀφῆκεν , seems disturbed.</p>
