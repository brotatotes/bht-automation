<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] He went <em> in a ship</em> (Matt., Mark, John), of which our Evangelist seems not to have been aware; for we should gather from our text that it was <em> by land</em> . A great difficulty also attends the mention of Bethsaida here. At first sight, it would appear to be the well-known Bethsaida, on the western bank of the lake, not far from Capernaum. But (1) our Lord was <em> on this side before</em> , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:37">Luke 8:37</span> ; and (2) Mark ( Mar 6:45 ) relates that <em> after</em> the miracle of the loaves He caused His disciples to cross over to Bethsaida. But there were <em> two places</em> of this name: another Bethsaida (Julias) lay at the top of the lake, on the Jordan: see Stanley, p. 381, edn. 3: Van de Velde, index, sub voce. Now it is very likely that our Lord may have crossed the lake to <em> this</em> Bethsaida, and St. Luke, finding that the miracle happened near Bethsaida, and <em> not being aware of the crossing of the lake</em> , may have left the name thus without explanation, as being that of the other Bethsaida. Mark gives us the exact account: that the Lord and the disciples, who went <em> by sea</em> , were perceived by the multitude who went <em> by land</em> , πεζῇ , and arrived before Him. How any of these accounts could have been compiled with a knowledge of the others, I cannot imagine.</p>
