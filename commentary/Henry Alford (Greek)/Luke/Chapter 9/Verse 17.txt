<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] <strong> κλασ</strong> <strong> .</strong> in Matt. is joined with τὸ περισσεῦον , in Mark with κοφίνους πλήρεις : here it may be taken with <strong> τὸ περισ</strong> <strong> .</strong> (ordinarily, and De Wette) or <strong> κόφ</strong> <strong> .</strong> (Meyer), but best, it appears to me, the <em> latter</em> , because the article is not expressed as in Matt.

<p>It is also an important observation, that the omission by Luke of the second miracle of feeding is not to be adduced against its historical reality, as has been done by Schleiermacher (transl. p. 144), since it is only omitted as <em> occurring in the midst of a large section, which the accounts gathered by Luke did not contain</em> . We see also, that the characteristic <strong> κοφίνους</strong> of the first feeding is preserved, without any confusion of terms: σπυρίδας being always used in relating and referring to the second, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:37">Matthew 15:37</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:10">Matthew 16:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:8">Mark 8:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:20">Mark 8:20</span> .</p>
