<p>It is remarkable that in [72] Mark, there is also a mixed construction, ἵνα μηδὲν αἴρωσιν … ἀλλ ʼ ὑποδεδεμένους … καὶ μὴ ἐνδύσησθε … (On <strong> ἀνά</strong> <strong> ,</strong> see reff.)

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [72] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .</p>
