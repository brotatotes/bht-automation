<p><strong> 46.</strong> ] There is not the least occasion to confine <strong> διαλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> to the sense of an inward doubt and questioning in the heart of each; indeed I will venture to say that no interpreter would have thought of doing so, had not the narratives of Matt. and Mark, by mentioning an outward expression of this thought, offered a temptation to <em> discover a discrepancy</em> , of which Meyer, as usual, has not failed to avail himself. Had our narrative stood by itself, we should have understood it, as I do now, of a dispute which had taken place or was taking place, and which, though not actually spoken out before the Lord, was yet open to His discerning eye, so that not only the words, but the disputing of their thoughts, was known to Him.

<p>The idea of <strong> τὸ τίς ἂν εἴη μ</strong> <strong> .</strong> meaning that each one thought “Who is greater than I?” (Meyer, in loc.) is absurd enough. Still more absurd however is the harmonistic attempt of Greswell, to make two distinct events out of (1) the incident in Mark and Luke, and (2) that in Matthew; one, ‘ <em> absente Petro</em> ,’ the other ‘ <em> reverso Petro, discipuli sponte contentionem suam ad Jesum referunt; de qua Ille uti prius, sed uberius, disserit</em> .’ (Harmony, p. 192, 3.) He has been led into this partly by the lower, literal-harmonistic spirit which pervades his school, and partly by the assumption which connects this strife and discourse immediately with the incident about the tribute-money, for which there is <em> not the least ground</em> in the text of Matt.</p>
