<p><strong> 55.</strong> ] <strong> [</strong> <strong> οὐκ οἴδατε οἵου πνεύματός ἐστε</strong> <strong> .</strong> Besides the <em> mistaken</em> ways of explaining these words of our Lord (e.g. ‘ <em> Do you not see what a</em> ( <em> bad</em> ) <em> spirit you are shewing?</em> ’ Bornemann) there are two senses which they <em> may</em> bear. (1) Affirmative, as in E. V., ‘putatis vos agi Spiritu tali quali olim Elias … sed erratis. Habetis quidem ζῆλον sed οὐ κατ ʼ ἐπίγνωσιν , et qui proinde humani est affectus, non divinæ motionis.’ Grot.; or (2) interrogative ‘ <em> Know ye not what manner of spirit ye belong to</em> ( <em> are of</em> ) <em> ?</em> ’ the spirit meant being the Holy Spirit. ‘The Spirit in Elias was a fiery and judicial spirit, as befitted the times and the character of God’s dealings then; but the Spirit in Me and mine is of a different kind a spirit of love and forgiveness.’
	</p>
<p>The latter of these is perhaps better suited to the context: but we seem to want an example in the Gospels of ( οὐκ ) οἴδατε used interrogatively: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:11">Matthew 7:11</span> [80] ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:22">Matthew 20:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:25">Matthew 20:25</span> [81] ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:42">Matthew 24:42</span> [82] ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:13">Matthew 25:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:2">Matthew 26:2</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:13">Mark 4:13</span> (doubtful, but the construction is direct): ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:56">Luke 12:56</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:14">John 8:14</span> ; Joh 14:4 alli [83] . I have therefore punctuated according to the former sense: which, indeed, seems more naturally followed by the γάρ of the clause following.

When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt.

<p>It is very interesting to remember that this same John came down to Samaria ( Act 8:14-17 ) with Peter, to confer the gift of the Holy Spirit on the Samaritan believers.]</p>
