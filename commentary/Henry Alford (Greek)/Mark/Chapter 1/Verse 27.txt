<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] <strong> πρὸς ἑαυτούς</strong> is not, each man within himself, but amounts to πρὸς ἀλλήλους , see reff.

<p>We may either take καινή with κατ ʼ ἐξουσίαν , ‘ <em> new in respect of power</em> ,’ as Meyer: or regard καινή and κατ ʼ ἐξουσίαν as two separate predicates of διδαχή . The latter view is preferable as more borne out by the adverbial use of κατά with nouns signifying <em> power</em> in the reff. Render then <strong> a teaching new and powerful.</strong></p>
