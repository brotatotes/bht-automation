<p><strong> 31.</strong> ] <strong> ἀφῆκεν αὐτήν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> of the <em> fever</em> , is common to all, and <strong> διηκόνει αὐτοῖς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> but <em> no more</em> . The same may be said of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:32-34">Mark 1:32-34</span> : the words <strong> καὶ ἦν ὅλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡ πόλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐπ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> θύραν</strong> are added in our text, shewing the accurate detail of an eye-witness, as also does the minute specification of the house, and of the two accompanying, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:29">Mark 1:29</span> . Observe the distinction between the <em> sick</em> and the <em> dæmoniacs</em> : cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:15">Mark 3:15</span> . Observe also πολλούς , πολλά , in connexion with the statement that the sun had set. There was not time for <em> all</em> . Meyer, who notices this, says also that in some the conditions of healing may have been wanting. But we do not find this obstacle existing on other occasions: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:24">Matthew 4:24</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:15">Matthew 12:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:14">Matthew 14:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:16">Acts 5:16</span> . On the not permitting the dæmons to speak, see note above, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:23-28">Mark 1:23-28</span> . I should be disposed to ascribe the account to Peter. Simon, Andrew, James, and John occur together again, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:3">Mark 13:3</span> .</p>
