<p>The citation here is from <em> two Prophets</em> , Isa. and Mal.: see reff. The fact will not fail to be observed by the careful and honest student of the Gospels. Had the citation from Isaiah stood first, it would have been of no note, as Meyer observes. Consult notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:10">Matthew 11:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:3">Matthew 3:3</span> .</p>
