<p><strong> 29, 30.</strong> ] Here our report is most important. To it and Luke we owe <strong> νῦν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> without which the promise might be understood of a <em> future life only</em> : and to it alone we owe <em> the particularizing of the returns</em> made, and the words <strong> μετὰ διωγμῶν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> which light up the whole passage, and shew that it is the inheritance of the earth <em> in the higher sense</em> by the meek which is spoken of; see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:21-22">1 Corinthians 3:21-22</span> . Observe <em> mothers</em> nature gives us only one but love, many (see Rom 16:13 ). We do not read, <em> fathers</em> , perhaps because of our high and absorbing relation to our Father in heaven, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:9">Matthew 23:9</span> . On <strong> καὶ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου</strong> <strong> ,</strong> Bp. Wordsw. observes, “See above, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:35">Mark 8:35</span> , where this phrase (not found in the other Evangelists, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span> ; Luk 9:24 ) is inserted by St. Mark. Perhaps it made a greater impression upon <em> his</em> mind, because he had formerly shrunk from suffering ἕνεκεν τ . εὐαγγελίου . (See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:13">Acts 13:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:38">Acts 15:38</span> .) St. Mark also alone here inserts our Lord’s words, μετὰ διωγμῶν , perhaps from a recollection that he had been once affrighted by persecution from doing the work of the Gospel: and desiring to prepare others to encounter trials which for a time had mastered himself.”
