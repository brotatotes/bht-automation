<p>This was (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span> ; Mat 17:22 ) the <em> third</em> declaration of His sufferings which the Lord had made to the disciples, and it was His <em> going before them</em> , accompanied most probably by something remarkable in his gait and manner a boldness and determination perhaps, an eagerness, denoted in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:50">Luke 12:50</span> , which struck them with astonishment and fear. See an interesting note here in Wordsw.
