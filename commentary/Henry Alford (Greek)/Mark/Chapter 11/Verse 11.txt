<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span> , and notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:1">Mark 11:1</span> . Also on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:13-18">John 2:13-18</span> .

<p>I am by no means certain that the solution proposed in the notes on Matt. is the right one, but I cannot suggest a better. When Mark, as here, relates an occurrence throughout, with such signs of an eyewitness as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:4">Mark 11:4</span> , it is <em> very difficult to suppose that he has transposed any thing</em> ; whereas Matt. certainly does not speak here so exactly, having transposed the anointing in Bethany: see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:2">Matthew 26:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:6">Matthew 26:6</span> .</p>
