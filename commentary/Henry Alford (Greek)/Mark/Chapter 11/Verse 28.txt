<p><strong> 28.</strong> ] <strong> ταῦτα</strong> need not necessarily refer to the cleansing of the temple, as Meyer; but seems from [36] Luke, to extend over our Lord’s whole course of teaching and putting himself forward in public. <strong> ἵνα ταῦτα ποιῇς</strong> is not a periphrasis of the infinitive, but contains the <em> purpose</em> of τὴν ἐξ . τ . ἔδ .

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [36] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .</p>
