<p><strong> 12 26.</strong> ] THE BARREN FIG-TREE. THE CLEANSING OF THE TEMPLE. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12-22">Matthew 21:12-22</span> . Our account here bears strong marks of being that of a beholder and hearer: e.g. <strong> ἐξελθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀπὸ Βηθ</strong> <strong> ., </strong> <strong> μακρόθεν</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> ἔχουσαν φύλλα</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> καὶ ἤκουον οἱ μαθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> .
	</strong></p>
<p>The times and order of the events are here more exact than in Matt., who places the withering of the tree <em> immediately after</em> the word spoken by our Lord.</p>
