<p><strong> στιβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> = βαΐα τ . φοινίκων <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:3">John 12:3</span> : but this word, by its derivation from στείβω , signifies not merely branches, but brunches cut for the purpose of being littered to walk on: and thus <em> implies</em> ἐστρώννυον εἰς τ . ὁδόν , which has been unskilfully supplied. Bp. Wordsw. complains of the introduction of τῶν ἀγρῶν into the text, adding “other instances, unhappily far too numerous, might be cited, where corrupt glosses and barbarisms have been recently received as improvements into the Sacred Text.” Surely a Commentator of Bp. W.’s learning and piety should know better than to write thus. He well knows, that it is not <em> as improvements</em> , that any such changes have been introduced as those to which he alludes, but simply and humbly in deference to the carefully weighed evidence of the best and oldest authorities, combined with that furnished by the existing phænomena of interpolation and adaptation of parallel places. The charge of attempting to “improve the Sacred Text” recoils on those, who in the face of such evidence, with such questions as “What writer would say, they cut branches off the fields?”, shelter their own rationalizing subjectivities under received readings which have been themselves glosses and “improvements” on the Sacred Text.</p>
