<p><strong> 41. </strong> <strong> τοῦ γαζ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] This is usually understood of <em> thirteen chests</em> , which stood in the court of the women, into which were thrown contributions for the temple, or the tribute (of Mat 17:24 ). But it is hardly likely that <em> they</em> would be called <strong> τὸ</strong> γαζ ., and we hear of a building by this name in Jos. Antt. xix. 6. 1. Lücke, on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:20">John 8:20</span> , believes <em> some part of the court of the women</em> to be intended, perhaps a chamber in connexion with these chests.

<p>Our Lord had at this time <em> taken his leave of the temple</em> , and was going out of it between <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:0">Matthew 23:0</span> end, and 24.</p>
