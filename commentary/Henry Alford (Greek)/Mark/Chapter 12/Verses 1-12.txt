<p>1 12.] PARABLE OF THE VINEYARD LET OUT TO HUSBANDMEN. This parable is, for the most part, identical with that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:33-46">Matthew 21:33-46</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:9-19">Luke 20:9-19</span> . The <em> number</em> , and <em> treatment</em> of the servants sent, is enlarged on here; and in Mar 12:4 there occurs the singular word <strong> κεφαλαιόω</strong> <strong> ,</strong> which appears to be used by a solœcism for κεφαλίζω , ‘ <em> to wound in the head</em> .’ Some have rendered it, ‘ <em> they made short work with him</em> ,’ which is the more usual sense of the word, but not probable here; for they <em> did not kill</em> him, but disgracefully used him.
	</p>
<p>I must not allow any opportunity to pass of directing attention to the <em> sort</em> of difference, in similarity, between these three reports, and observing that no origin of that difference is imaginable, except the <em> gradual deflection of accounts from a common, or a parallel, source</em> .
