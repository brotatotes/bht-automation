<p><strong> 28 34.</strong> ] REPLY CONCERNING THE GREAT COMMANDMENT. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:34-40">Matthew 22:34-40</span> , but with differing circumstances. There the question appears as that of one among the Pharisees’ adherents, who puts this question, πειράζων αὐτόν , and in consequence of the Pharisees coming up to the strife, after He had discomfited the Sadducees. I should be disposed to take Mark’s as the strictly accurate account, seeing that there is nothing in the question which indicates enmity, and our Lord’s answer, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:34">Mark 12:34</span> , plainly precludes it. The man, from hearing them disputing, came up, and formed one of the band who gathered together for the purpose of tempting Him. Mark’s report, which here is wholly unconnected in origin with Matt.’s, is that of some one who had taken accurate note of the circumstances and character of the man: Matt.’s is more general, not entering, as this, into individual motives, but classing the question broadly among the various “temptations” of our Lord at this time.</p>
