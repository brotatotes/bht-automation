<p>CHAP. <strong> 13.</strong> ] JESUS PROPHESIES OF HIS COMING, AND OF THE TIMES OF THE END. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:0">Matthew 24:0</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:5-36">Luke 21:5-36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:5-36">Luke 21:5-36</span> . The accounts are apparently distinct, and each contains some fragments which have escaped the others. On the <em> matter</em> of the prophecy, I have fully commented in Matt., where see notes: also those on Luke.
