<p><strong> 1, 2.</strong> ] CONSPIRACY OF THE JEWISH AUTHORITIES AGAINST JESUS. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:1-5">Matthew 26:1-5</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:1-2">Luke 22:1-2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:1-2">Luke 22:1-2</span> . The account of the events preceding the passion in our Gospel takes a middle rank between those of Matt. and Luke. It contains very few words which are not to be found in one or other of them; but at the same time the variations from both are so frequent and irregular, as in my opinion wholly to preclude the idea that Mark had ever seen either. The minute analysis of any passage in the three will, I think, convince an unprejudiced examiner of this.
