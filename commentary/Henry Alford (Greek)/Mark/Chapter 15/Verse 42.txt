<p><strong> 42. </strong> <strong> παρασκ</strong> <strong> ., </strong> <strong> ὅ ἐστι προσάβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The Friday afternoon ( ἡ παρασκ ., “the name by which Friday is now generally known in Asia and Greece.” Wordsw.) before <em> sunset</em> , at which time the Sabbath would begin, and the taking down, &amp;c. <em> would be unlawful</em> . The three Evangelists do not imply that this παρασκ . had any thing <em> especial</em> in it, as John does <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:31">John 19:31</span> . It is very remarkable, that <strong> ἐπεί</strong> occurs only here in this Gospel, but is found in the corresponding clause of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:31">John 19:31</span> , shewing perhaps in this place a <em> community of source</em> in two accounts otherwise so essentially distinct.</p>
