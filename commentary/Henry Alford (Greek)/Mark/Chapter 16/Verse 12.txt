<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] <strong> μετὰ ταῦτα</strong> is <em> not found in Mark</em> , though many opportunities occurred for using it. This verse epitomizes the events on the journey to Emmaus, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:13-35">Luke 24:13-35</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> περιπατοῦσιν ἐφανερώθη</strong> , though in <em> general</em> accord with Luke’s narrative, is not accurate in detail. It was not <em> as they walked</em> , but <em> as they sat at meat</em> that He was manifested to them.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν ἑτέρᾳ μορφῇ</strong> a slight difference from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:15-16">Luke 24:15-16</span> , which relates as the reason why they did not know Him, that <em> their eyes were holden</em> , his being <em> in his usual form</em> being declared by αὐτὸς ὁ Ἰησοῦς : but see notes there.</p>
