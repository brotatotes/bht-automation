<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] These past participles must be noticed, as carrying on the thought to a time <em> beyond the work of the preacher:</em> when <strong> σωθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> and <strong> κατακρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> shall take place; and reserving the division of mankind into these two classes, till that day.
	</p>
<p>On <strong> βαπτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span> .
	</p>
<p>There is no καὶ μὴ βαπτ . in the second clause here. Unbelief by which is meant the rejection of the gospel in heart and life, not weakness or doubt as in Mar 16:14 shall condemn a man, whether <em> baptized or unbaptized</em> . And, conversely, it follows that our Lord does not set forth here the <em> absolute</em> , but only the <em> general</em> necessity of Baptism to salvation; as the Church of England also teaches. But that general necessity extends to all to whom Baptism is <em> accessible;</em> and it was well said ‘Non privatio Baptismi, sed contemtus, damnat.’
	</p>
<p>These words cannot be taken, as those in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19-20">Matthew 28:19-20</span> , as setting forth the <em> order</em> in which faith and baptism must always come; <em> belief</em> and <em> disbelief</em> are in this verse the great leading subjects, and <strong> πιστεύσας</strong> must on that account stand first.
	</p>
<p>On <strong> ὁ πιστ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σωθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:31">Acts 16:31</span> . This is a solemn declaration of the doctrine of ‘salvation by faith,’ from the Lord Himself; but such a faith as is expanded, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:20">Matthew 28:20</span> , into διδάσκοντες αὐτοὺς <strong> τηρεῖν πάντα ὅσα ἐνετειλάμην ὑμῖν</strong> : which is its <em> proper fruits</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> κατακρ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> ‘will be <em> condemned;</em> ’ i.e. in the most solemn sense: for the <em> sin of unbelief:</em> for those are now spoken of who <em> hear</em> the gospel preached, and <em> reject</em> it.</p>
