<p><strong> 20.</strong> ] <strong> ἐξελθόντες</strong> not, from the chamber where they were assembled (Meyer) which would not answer to ἐκήρυξαν πανταχοῦ , but would require some immediate action of that very day to correspond to it (see Mat 12:14 ); but used in the more solemn sense of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:18">Romans 10:18</span> (cited from Psa 18:4 LXX), εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ἐξῆλθεν ὁ φθόγγος αὐτῶν : see reff.

<p><strong> πανταχοῦ</strong> ] No inference can be drawn from this word as to the date of the fragment. In Act 9:32 Peter is said διερχόμενον διὰ πάντων κατελθεῖν …: the expression being only <em> a general one</em> , indicating their performance, in their time and degree, of our Lord’s words, <strong> εἰς τὸν κόσμον ἅπαντα</strong> <strong> .

<p><strong> ἐπακολ</strong> <strong> .</strong> and <strong> παρακολ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ( Mar 16:17 ) are <em> both foreign to the diction of Mark</em> often as he uses the simple verb.

<p>A few concluding remarks may be added respecting <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:9-20">Mark 16:9-20</span> . (1) For the external evidence, see var. readd. As to its <em> genuineness as a work of the Evangelist Mark</em> , (2) internal evidence is, I think, very weighty <em> against Mark’s being the author</em> . No less than <em> twenty-one words and expressions occur in it</em> (and some of them several times), which are <em> never elsewhere used</em> by Mark, whose adherence to his own peculiar phrases is remarkable. (3) The inference therefore seems to me to be, that <em> it is an authentic fragment, placed as a completion of the Gospel in very early times:</em> by whom written, must of course remain wholly uncertain; but coming to us with very weighty sanction, and having strong claims on our reception and reverence.]</p>
