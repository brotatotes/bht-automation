The instances quoted by De Wette to shew that the unexpected introduction of notices contained in the other Gospels is in Mark’s manner, do not seem to me to apply here.

<p>This verse agrees with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:1">John 20:1</span> ff. but is unconnected with the former narrative in this chapter.</p>
