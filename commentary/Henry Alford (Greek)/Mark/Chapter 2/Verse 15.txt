Our Lord, and those following Him as disciples, were ordinarily entertained where He was invited, which will account for ἠκολοὐθουν αὐτῷ : and the change of subject in the two, αὐτόν and αὐτοῦ , is no uncommon thing: see a similar change in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:3">Luke 19:3</span> , where to be consistent Meyer ought to understand ὅτι τῇ ἡλ . μικ . ἦν of our Lord. To help out his interpretation he strangely enough makes καλέσαι , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:17">Mark 2:17</span> , mean ‘ <em> to invite</em> .’
