<p><strong> 19. </strong> <strong> ὅσον</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> νηστεύειν</strong> ] This repetition, <em> contained neither in Matt. nor Luke</em> , is inconsistent with the design of an abridger; and sufficiently shews the primary authority of this report, as also the <strong> ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:20">Mark 2:20</span> . St. Mark especially loves these solemn repetitions: cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:42">Mark 9:42</span> ff. It is strange to see such a Commentator as De Wette calling the ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμ . a proof of <em> carelessness</em> . It is a touching way, as Meyer well observes, of expressing ‘in that <em> atra dies</em> .’</p>
