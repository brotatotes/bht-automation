<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] <strong> τὸ σάβ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> διὰ τὸ ς</strong> <strong> .</strong> is peculiar to Mark, and highly important. The Sabbath was an ordinance <em> for man</em> ; for man’s rest, both actually and typically, as setting forth the rest which remains for God’s people ( Heb 4:9 ). But He who is now speaking has taken on Himself <em> Manhood</em> , the whole nature of Man; and is <em> rightful lord</em> over creation as <em> granted to man</em> , and <em> of all that is made for man</em> , and therefore <em> of the Sabbath</em> . The whole dispensation of <em> time</em> is created for <em> man</em> , for <em> Christ as He is man</em> , and is <em> in his absolute power</em> . There is a remarkable parallel, in more than the mere mode of expression, in 2 Mace. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:19">Mark 5:19</span> : οὐ διὰ τὸν τόπον τὸ ἔθνος , ἀλλὰ διὰ τὸ ἔθνος τὸν τόπον ὁ κύριος ἐξελέξατο .</p>
