<p><strong> 11. </strong> <strong> ὅταν</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> ἐθεώρουν</strong> ] See ref. The indic. is sometimes found with ὅταν in the N.T., see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+4:9">Revelation 4:9</span> , but generally amidst variety of readings: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:19">Matthew 10:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:25">Mark 11:25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:28">Luke 13:28</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14">Romans 2:14</span> . Meyer thus accounts for it that in later Greek the ἅν became completely attached to the ὅτε , and the <strong> whenever</strong> was treated as merely an expression of time so that in German it would not be <em> menn sie Jhn irgend sahen</em> , but <em> menn irgend sie Jhn sahen</em> .

<p>The unclean spirits are here spoken of in the person of those possessed by them, and the two fused together: for as it was impossible that <em> any but the spirits</em> could have <em> known</em> that He was the Son of God, so it was the material body of the possessed which fell down before Him, and <em> their</em> voice which uttered the cry: see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:32">Matthew 8:32</span> . The notion of the semi-rationalists, that the sick <em> identified themselves</em> with the dæmons (Meyer), is at once refuted by the universal agreement of the testimony given on such occasions, <em> that Jesus was the Son of God</em> .</p>
