<p><strong> 13 20.</strong> ] EXPLANATION OF THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER. In <strong> τὴν παρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ταύτην</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the general question which had been asked <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:10">Mark 4:10</span> ( <strong> τὰς παραβολάς</strong> ), is tacitly assumed to have had special reference to the one which has been given at length. Or we may understand, that the question of Mar 4:10 took the form which is given in [12] Matt.: διὰ τί ἐν παραβολαῖς λαλεῖς αὐτοῖς ; in which case the τάς must be generic: <strong> asked Him concerning parables</strong> ; or <strong> His parables.</strong> The three explanations (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:18-23">Matthew 13:18-23</span> ; Luk 8:9-15 ) are very nearly related to one another, with however differences enough to make the common hypotheses quite untenable. Matt. and Mark agree nearly verbatim, Matt. however writing throughout in the singular ( ὁ σπαρεὶς κ . τ . λ .). Mark has some additions, e.g. <strong> ὁ σπείρων τὸν λόγον σπ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:14">Mark 4:14</span> , after ἡ ἀπ . τοῦ πλ ., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:19">Mark 4:19</span> , <strong> καὶ αἱ π</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τὰ λ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐπιθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> : and some variations, e.g. <strong> σατανᾶς</strong> for Matt.’s ὁ πονηρός , and Luke’s ὁ διάβ .

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [12] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .
	</p>
<p>Such matters are <em> not trifling</em> , because they shew the <em> gradual deflection of verbal expression</em> in different versions of the <em> same report</em> , nor is the <em> general agreement</em> of Luke’s, which seems to be from a different hearer.</p>
