<p><strong> 9.</strong> ] <strong> ὅτι πολλοί ἐς</strong> <strong> .</strong> has perhaps given rise to the report of <em> two</em> dæmoniacs in Matt. I cannot see in the above supposition any thing which should invalidate the testimony of the Evangelists. Rather are all such tracings of discrepancies to their source, most interesting and valuable. Nor can I consent for a moment to accept here the very lame solution (repeated by Bp. Wordsw.), which supposes <em> one of the dæmoniacs not to be mentioned</em> by Mark and Luke: in other words, that the <em> least circumstantial</em> account is in possession of an additional particular which gives a new aspect to the <em> whole</em> : for the <em> plural</em> , used here and in Luke of the <em> many dæmons in one man</em> , is there used of the <em> two men</em> , and their separate dæmons.
