<p><strong> 1 20.</strong> ] HEALING OF A DÆMONIAC AT GERGESA. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28-34">Matthew 8:28-34</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:26-39">Luke 8:26-39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:26-39">Luke 8:26-39</span> . The accounts of Mark and Luke are strictly cognate, and bear traces of having been originally given by two eye-witnesses, or perhaps even by one and the same, and having passed through others who had learnt one or two minute additional particulars. Matt.’s account is evidently not from an eye-witness. Some of the most striking circumstances are there omitted. See throughout notes on Matt., <em> wherever the narrative is in common</em> .</p>
