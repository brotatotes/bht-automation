<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] <strong> σπεκουλάτωρ</strong> is supposed by some to represent <em> spiculator</em> , and to mean δορύφορος , as Suidas: by others, <em> speculator</em> , κατάσκοπος , as Philoxenus, in Gloss., one of the body-guard, which is the meaning taken by Meyer here. The Commentators refer to Seneca de Ira, i. 16, “Centurio supplicio præpositus condere gladium speculatorem jubet:” de Benef. iii. 25, “Speculatoribus occurrit, nihil se deprecari quo minus imperata peragerent dixit, et deinde cervicem porrexit:” Julius Firmicus, viii. 26, calls those “speculatores, qui nudato gladio hominum amputant cervices.” See Suet. Claud. 25: and a list of the sources of information in Schleusner, sub voce.</p>
