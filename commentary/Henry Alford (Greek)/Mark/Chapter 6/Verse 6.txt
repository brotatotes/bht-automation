<p><strong> 6. </strong> <strong> ἐθαύμαζεν</strong> ] This need not surprise us, nor be construed otherwise than as a literal description of the Lord’s mind: in the mystery of his humanity, as He was compassed by human infirmity, grew in wisdom, learned obedience, knew not the day nor the hour (ch. Mar 13:32 ), so He might <em> wonder</em> at the unbelief of His countrymen. Observe, owing to the <strong> διὰ</strong> with an accus., that their unbelief is not here said to be the <em> object</em> , but the <em> cause</em> , of the Lord’s wonder.
