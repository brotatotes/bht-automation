<p><strong> 7.] </strong> <strong> δύο δύο</strong> (see reff.) is a Hebraism: see Winer, § 37. 3. The Greek expression would be κατά , or ἀνὰ δύο , as in [20] Luke. Winer observes that the Syriac version always renders this latter expression by doubling the cardinal number. These <em> couples</em> are pointed out in Matt.’s list of the Apostles <em> not however in Mark’s</em> , which again shews the total absence of <em> connecting design</em> in this Gospel, such as is often assumed.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [20] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .</p>
