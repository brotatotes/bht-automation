<p><strong> 30 44.</strong> ] FEEDING OF THE FIVE THOUSAND. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:13-21">Matthew 14:13-21</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10-17">Luke 9:10-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10-17">Luke 9:10-17</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:1-13">John 6:1-13</span> . This is one of the very few points of comparison between the <em> four Gospels</em> during the ministry of our Lord. And here again I believe Mark’s report to be an original one, and of the <em> very highest</em> authority. Professor Bleek (Beiträge zur Evangelienkritik, p. 200) believes that Mark has <em> used the Gospel of John</em> , on account of the 200 denarii in our Mar 6:37 and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:7">John 6:7</span> ; and that he generally compiles his narrative from Matt. and Luke (ibid. p. 72 75), which has been elsewhere shewed to be utterly untenable. I believe Mark’s to be an <em> original full account</em> ; Matt.’s a compendium of <em> this same account</em> , but drawn up independently of Mark’s: Luke’s a compendium of <em> another account</em> : John’s an <em> independent narrative of his own as an eye-witness</em> .</p>
