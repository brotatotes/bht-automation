<p><strong> 19. </strong> <strong> καθαρίζων</strong> ] The masc. part. applies to ἀφεδρῶνα , by a construction of which there are examples, in which the grammatical <em> object</em> of the sentence is regarded as the logical <em> subject</em> , e.g. λόγοι δ ʼ ἐν ἀλλήλοισιν ἐῤῥόθουν κακοί , φύλαξ ἐλέγχων φύλακα , Soph. Ant [28] 259. See Kühner, Gramm. ii. § 678. 1. There need not be any difficulty in this additional clause: what is stated is <em> physically</em> true. The ἀφεδρών is that which, by the removal of the part carried off, purifies the meat; the portion available for nourishment being in its passage converted into chyle, and the remainder (the κάθαρμα ) being cast out.
