<p><strong> 24 30.</strong> ] THE SYROPHŒNICIAN WOMAN. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:21-28">Matthew 15:21-28</span> . Omitted by Luke. A striking instance of the independence of the two narrations. Mark, who is much more copious in particulars, <em> omits</em> a considerable and important part of the history: this would be most arbitrarily and indeed inexcusably done, if the common account of his having <em> combined and epitomized Matt. and Luke</em> is to be taken.

<p>Our Lord’s retirement was <em> to avoid the Pharisees</em> : see notes on Matt. throughout.</p>
