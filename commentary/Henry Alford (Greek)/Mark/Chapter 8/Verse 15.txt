<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] <strong> ὁρᾶτε</strong> is merely <em> take heed</em> , and does not belong to <strong> ἀπό</strong> <strong> .

<p><strong> βλέπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀπό</strong> is not ‘ <em> turn your eyes away from</em> ’ (Tittm. and Kuin. in Meyer), but as in reff.

<p>The ζύμη Ἡρώδου here seems to answer to the ζ . Σαδδουκαίων in Matt. But we must not infer from this that Herod was a Sadducee. He certainly was a bad and irreligious man, which would be quite enough ground for such a caution. We have a specimen of the morals of his court in the history of John the Baptist’s martyrdom. In the <em> last</em> <strong> οὔπω</strong> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:21">Mark 8:21</span> , Meyer sees a <em> new</em> climax, and refers the <em> not yet</em> to the moment even after the reminiscence of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:18-20">Mark 8:18-20</span> . It may doubtless be so, and the idea would well accord with the graphic precision of St. Mark.</p>
