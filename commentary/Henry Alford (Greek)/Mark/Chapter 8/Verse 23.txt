<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] The leading of this blind man out of the town appears as if it had been from <em> some local reason</em> . In Mar 8:26 we find him forbidden expressly to enter into or tell it <em> in the town</em> , and with a repetition of <strong> κώμη</strong> <strong> ,</strong> which looks as if the place had been somehow unworthy of such a work being done there. (This is a serious objection against Meyer’s reason, that the <em> use of spittle</em> in both miracles occasioned the same privacy here and in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:33">Mark 7:33</span> .) Or we may perhaps find the reason in our Lord’s <em> immediate departure</em> to such a distance ( Mar 8:27 ); and say, that He did not wish multitudes to gather about and follow Him.

<p><strong> πτύσας</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> ἐπιθεὶς</strong> <strong> …</strong> ] See above on ch.<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:33">Mark 7:33</span> .

<p>We cannot say what may have induced our Lord to perform this miracle <em> at twice</em> certainly not the reason assigned by Dr. Burton, “that a blind man would not, on suddenly recovering his sight, know one object from another, because he had never seen them before,” and so would require a double miracle; a second to open the eyes of <em> his mind also</em> , to comprehend what he saw. This assumes the man to have been <em> born</em> blind, which he was not, from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:24">Mark 8:24</span> ; for how should he know <em> how trees appeared?</em> and besides, the case of the man born blind in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:0">John 9:0</span> required no such double healing. These things were <em> in the Lord’s power</em> , and He ordered them as He pleased from present circumstances, or for our instruction.</p>
