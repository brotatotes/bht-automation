<p><strong> 27 30.</strong> ] CONFESSION OF PETER. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:13-20">Matthew 16:13-20</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:18-21">Luke 9:18-21</span> . With the exception of the introduction in Luke, which describes the Lord to have been <em> alone praying, and joined by his disciples</em> , and the omission of the praise of and promise to Peter by both Mark and Luke, the three are in exact accordance. On this latter omission no stress must therefore be laid as to the character of <em> Markâ€™s Gospel</em> , as has been done. (Thl. in 1. cited by De W.)</p>
