<p><strong> 49.</strong> ] In order to understand this difficult verse, it will be necessary first to examine its connexion and composition. (1) What is <strong> γάρ</strong> ? It connects it with the solemn assertions in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:43-48">Mark 9:43-48</span> , <strong> καλόν ἐστίν σε</strong> <strong> …</strong> and furnishes a <em> reason why</em> it is better for us to cut off and cast away, &amp;c. <strong> πᾶς</strong> then is <strong> every one</strong> , absolutely: referring back both to the σε , and the <strong> αὐτῶν</strong> above <strong> πᾶσα θυσία</strong> is (not <em> opposed</em> to (Meyer), but) <em> parallel with</em> <strong> πᾶς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> and <strong> καί</strong> equivalent to <strong> just as</strong> . (2) This being stated, let us now enquire into <em> the symbolic terms</em> used. FIRE is the <em> refiner’s fire</em> of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:2">Malachi 3:2</span> , to which indeed there seems to be a reference; the fire of Mat 3:11 and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:3">Acts 2:3</span> ; of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+28:14">Ezekiel 28:14</span> (see my Hulsean Lectures for 1841, pp. 9 12). Fire is <em> the symbol of the divine purity and presence</em> : our God is a <em> consuming fire</em> , not only to his foes, but to his people: but in <em> them</em> , the fire shall only burn up what is impure and requires purifying out, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:13">1 Corinthians 3:13</span> ; 1Pe 1:7 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:12">1 Peter 4:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:17">1 Peter 4:17</span> . This very fire shall be to them as <em> a preserving salt</em> . The SALT of the covenant of God (ref. Levit.) was to be mixed with <em> every sacrifice</em> ; and it is with fire that <em> all men are to be salted</em> . This fire is the divine purity and judgment <em> in the covenant</em> , whose promise is, ‘I will dwell among them.’ And in and among this purifying fire shall the people of God ever walk and rejoice everlastingly. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+21:23">Revelation 21:23</span> . This is the right understanding of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+33:14-15">Isaiah 33:14-15</span> , ‘Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? &amp;c. He that walketh in righteousness,’ &amp;c. And thus the connexion with the preceding verses is, ‘it is better for thee to cut off,’ &amp;c. ‘for it is <em> part of the salting of thee, the living sacrifice</em> ( Rom 12:1 ), that every offence and scandal must be burnt out of thee before thou canst enter into life.’</p>
