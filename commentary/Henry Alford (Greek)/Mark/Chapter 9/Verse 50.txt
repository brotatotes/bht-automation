<p><strong> 50.</strong> ] The connexion of this (elsewhere said in other references, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:13">Matthew 5:13</span> ; Luk 14:34 ) is now plain. If this fire which is to purify and act as a preserving salt to you, have, from the nullity and vapidity of the grace of the covenant in you, <em> no such power</em> , it can only <em> consume</em> the salt has lost its savour the covenant is void you will be cast out, as it is elsewhere added, and the fire will be no longer the fire of <em> purification</em> , but of <em> wrath eternal</em> .
	</p>
<p>I will just add that the interpretation of the sacrifice as the <em> condemned</em> and the fire and salt as <em> eternal fire</em> , except in the case of the salt having lost its savour, is <em> contrary to the whole symbolism of Scripture</em> , and to the exhortation with which this verse ends: ‘Have this grace of God this Spirit of adoption this pledge of the covenant, in yourselves; and,’ with reference to the strife out of which the discourse sprung, ‘have peace with one another.’</p>
