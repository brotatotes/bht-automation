Here again, while Matt. and Mark’s accounts seem to have <em> one and the same source</em> , they have deflected from it, and additional particulars have found their way into our text. Luke’s account is from a <em> different source</em> . If we might conjecture, Peter has furnished the accounts in Matt. and Mark: this latter being <em> retouched</em> , perhaps by himself: while that of Luke may have had another origin. The additional particulars in our text are, the very graphic and noble description in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:3">Mark 9:3</span> , <strong> στίλβ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> λευκᾶναι</strong> <strong> ,</strong> and <strong> οὐ γὰρ ἤδει τί ἀποκρ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> ἔκφοβοι</strong> <strong> .</strong> Mark omits ἐν ᾧ εὐδόκησα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:5">Matthew 17:5</span> .</p>
