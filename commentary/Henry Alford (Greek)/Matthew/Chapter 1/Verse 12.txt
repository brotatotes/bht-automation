When, therefore, it is denounced ( Jer 32:30 ) that Jeconiah should be ‘childless,’ this word must be understood as explained by the rest of the verse, ‘for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah.’ The LXX render this word עֲרִירִי , ἐκκήρυκτον : but the Talmudical writers explain it according to our rendering.
