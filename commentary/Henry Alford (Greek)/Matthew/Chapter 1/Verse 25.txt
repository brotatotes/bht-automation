<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] “ ‘ <em> non cognovit eam, doneo</em> .’ Non sequitur, ergo <em> post:</em> sufficit tamen confirmari virginitatem ad partum usque: de reliquo tempore lectori æquo relinquitur existimatio.” Bengel. And with regard to the much-controverted sense of this verse we may observe, (1) That the primâ facie impression on the reader certainly is, that οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν was confined to the period of time here mentioned. (2) That there is nothing in Scripture tending to remove this impression, either ( α ) by narration, and the very use of the term, ἀδελφοὶ κυρίου (on which see note at ch. Mat 13:55 ), without qualification, shews that the idea was not repulsive: or ( β ) by implication, for every where in the N.T. marriage is spoken of in high and honourable terms; and the words of the angel to Joseph rather imply, than discountenance, such a supposition. (3) On the other hand, the words of this verse do not <em> require</em> it: the idiom being justified on the contrary hypothesis. See reff. On the whole it seems to me, that <em> no one would ever have thought of interpreting the verse any otherwise than in its primâ facie meaning, except to force it into accordance with a preconceived notion of the perpetual virginity of Mary</em> . It is characteristic, and historically instructive, that the great impugner of the view given above should be Jerome, the impugner of marriage itself: and that his opponents in its interpretation should have been branded as heretics by after-ages. See a brief notice of the controversy in Milman, Hist. of Latin Christianity, i. 72 ff. As to the <em> expression</em> , compare the remarkable parallel, Diog. Laert. iii. 1. 2, where he says of the father of Plato, καθαρὰν γάμου φυλάξαι , ἕως τῆς ἀποκυήσεως , with ib. 4 (said of Plato) ἔσχε δ ʼ ἀδελφοὺς Ἀδείμαντον κ . Γλαύκωνα κ . ἀδελφὴν Ποτώνην .
