<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] These children of Judah were not born in marriage: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+28:16-22">Genesis 28:16-22</span> . Both the sons are named, probably as recalling the incident connected with their birth. The reason for the women (Thamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba) being mentioned, has been variously assigned: by Wets [2] ., <em> ut tacitæ Judæorum objectioni occurreretur</em> : by Fritzsche, <em> for the sake of minute accuracy</em> . It most probably is that given by Maldonatus: ‘Prætermisit Evangelista quod ordinarium erat, quod autem singulare et dubium exposuit.’ There may be something also in that suggested by Grotius: ‘Mulieres in hoc sensu obiter paucæ nominantur, extraneo ortiaut criminibus nobiles, quarum historia ad vocationem idololatrarum et criminosorum per Christi evangelium proludit:’ as also in De Wette’s view, that they serve as types of the mother of our Lord, and are consequently named in the course of the genealogy, as she is at the end of it.
