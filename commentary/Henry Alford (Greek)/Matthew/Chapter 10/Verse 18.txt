The <strong> μαρτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is in both senses a testimony <em> to</em> , and <em> against</em> them (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:4">Matthew 8:4</span> , note), and refers to both bets of persecutors: <strong> αὐτοῖς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> to <em> them</em> , i.e. the Jews (not the ἡγ . καὶ βασ . for they are in most cases Gentiles themselves), <strong> καὶ τοῖς ἔθν</strong> <strong> .</strong> It was a testimony in the best sense <em> to</em> Sergius Paulus, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:7">Acts 13:7</span> , but <em> against</em> Felix, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:25">Acts 24:25</span> ; and this double power ever belongs to the word of God as preached it is a δίστομος ῥομφαία (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:16">Revelation 1:16</span> ; Rev 2:12 ).</p>
