<p><strong> 20.</strong> <strong> οὐ γὰρ ὑμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> κ . τ . λ .] This shews the reference of the command to a <em> future</em> mission of the Apostles, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26-27">John 15:26-27</span> . (1) It is to be observed that our Lord never in speaking to His disciples says <em> our</em> Father, but either <em> my</em> Father (ch. Mat 18:10 ), or <em> your</em> Father (as here), or both conjoined ( Joh 20:17 ); never leaving it to be inferred that God is in the same sense His Father and our Father. (2) It is also to be observed that in the great work of God in the world, human individuality sinks down and vanishes, and God alone, His Christ, His Spirit, is the great worker, as here οὐχ ὑμεῖς ἐστε .… ἀλλὰ τὸ πν . τοῦ π . ὑμ .</p>
