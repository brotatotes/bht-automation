<p><strong> εἰς ὄνομα</strong> <strong> ,</strong> a Hebraism ( לְשֵׁם ): <strong> because He is:</strong> i.e. ‘for the love of Christ, whose prophet he is.’ The sense is, ‘He who by receiving (see above) a prophet because he is a prophet, or a holy man because he is a holy man, recognizes, enters into, these states as appointed by Me, shall receive the blessedness of these states, shall derive all the spiritual benefits which these states bring with them, and share their everlasting reward.’</p>
