<p><strong> 24 42.</strong> ] THIRD PART OF THE DISCOURSE. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:5">Matthew 10:5</span> . It treats of (I.) the <em> conflicts</em> ( Mat 10:24-26 ), <em> duties</em> ( Mat 10:26-28 ), and <em> encouragements</em> ( Mat 10:28-32 ) of all Christ’s disciples. (II.) The <em> certain issue of this fight in victory;</em> the <em> confession by Christ of those who confess Him</em> , set in strong light by the contrast of those who deny Him ( Mat 10:32-33 ); the <em> necessity of conflict to victory</em> , by the nature of Christ’s mission ( Mat 10:34-37 ), the <em> kind of self-devotion which he requires</em> ( Mat 10:37-39 ): concluding with the <em> solemn assurance that no reception of His messengers for His sake, nor even the smallest labour of love for Him, shall pass without its final reward</em> . Thus we are carried on to the end of time and of the course of the Church.</p>
