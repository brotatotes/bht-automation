<p><strong> 10. </strong> <strong> σου</strong> ] Our Lord here changes the person of the original prophecy, which is μου . And that He does so, making that which is said by Jehovah of Himself, to be addressed to the Messiah, is, if such were needed (compare also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:16-17">Luke 1:16-17</span> ; Luk 1:76 ), no mean indication of His own eternal and co-equal Godhead. It is worthy of remark that all three Evangelists quote this prophecy <em> similarly changed</em> , although St. Mark has it in an entirely different place. The student should compare the passage in the LXX with the three citations, h. l., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:2">Mark 1:2</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:27">Luke 7:27</span> . Also, that the high dignity and honour which our Lord here predicates of the Baptist, has a further reference: He was thus great above all others, <em> because he was the forerunner of Christ</em> . How great then above all others and him, must HE be.</p>
