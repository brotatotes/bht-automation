<p><strong> 11. </strong> <strong> ἐγήγερται</strong> ] Not merely a word of course, but especially used of prophets and judges, see reff., and once of our Saviour Himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:30">Acts 5:30</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> γεννητοῖς</strong> is most likely masculine. See reff.

<p><strong> ὁ δὲ μικρότερος</strong> ] This has been variously rendered and understood. Chrysostom’s interpretation is as follows: “ ὁ δὲ μικρότερος , ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν μείζων αὐτοῦ ἐστι .” μικρότερος , κατὰ τὴν ἡλικίαν καὶ κατὰ τὴν τῶν πολλῶν δόξαν , καὶ γὰρ ἔλεγον αὐτὸν φάγον καὶ οἰνοπότην · καὶ “ οὐχ οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ τοῦ τέκτονος υἱός ;” καὶ πανταχοῦ αὐτὸν ἐξηυτέλιζον . Hom. xxxvii. 2, p. 416. And a little afterwards: περὶ ἑαυτοῦ λέγων εἰκότως κρύπτει τὸ πρόσωπον διὰ τὴν ἔτι κρατοῦσαν ὑπόνοιαν καὶ τὸ μὴ δόξαι περὶ ἑαυτοῦ μέγα τι λέγειν · καὶ γὰρ πολλαχοῦ φαίνεται τοῦτο ποιῶν . τί δέ ἐστιν “ ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν ;” ἐν τοῖς πνευματικοῖς καὶ τοῖς κατὰ τὸν οὐρανὸν ἅπασι . καὶ τὸ εἰπεῖν δὲ “ οὐκ ἐγήγερται ἐν γεννητοῖς γυναικῶν μείζων Ἰωάννου ” ἀντιδιαστέλλοντος ἦν ἑαυτῷ τὸν Ἰωάννην , καὶ οὕτως ἑαυτὸν ὑπεξαιροῦντος . εἰ γὰρ καὶ γεννητὸς γυναικὸς ἦν αὐτός , ἀλλ ʼ οὐχ οὕτως ὡς Ἰωάννης · οὐ γὰρ ψιλὸς ἄνθρωπος ἦν , οὐδὲ ὁμοίως ἀνθρώπῳ ἐτέχθη , ἀλλὰ ξένον τινὰ τρόπον καὶ παράδοξον , ib. 2, 3, p. 417. So also Euthymius and Theophylact: but such an interpretation is surely adverse to the spirit of the whole discourse. We may certainly say that our Lord in such a passage as this would not designate Himself as ὁ μικρότερος compared with John, in any sense: nor again is it our Lord’s practice to speak of Himself as one ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν , or of His own attributes as belonging to or dependent on that new order of things which this expression implies, and which was <em> in Him</em> rather than He in it. Besides, the bare use of the comparative ὁ μικρότερος , with its reference left to be inferred, is, unless I am mistaken, unprecedented. If this had been the meaning, we should surely have had αὐτοῦ after μικρότερος . Again, the analogy of such passages as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:19">Matthew 5:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:1">Matthew 18:1</span> , would lead us to connect the preceding adjective μικρότερος with ἐν τῇ β . τ . οὐ ., and not the following.
	</p>
<p>The other, the usual interpretation, I am convinced, is the right one: <strong> but he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he.</strong> The comparative with the article is not put for the superlative, although in English we are obliged to render it so, but signifies ‘ <em> he that is less than all the rest</em> ’ (Winer, § 35. 4); and here is generic, of <em> all the inferior</em> ones.
	</p>
<p>There is very likely an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:8">Zechariah 12:8</span> ; “He that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David.”
	</p>
<p>Thus the parallelism is complete: <em> John</em> , not inferior to any born of women but <em> these, even the least of them</em> , are born of <em> another birth</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:12-13">John 1:12-13</span> ; Joh 3:5 ). <em> John</em> , the nearest to the King and the Kingdom <em> standing on the threshold</em> but <em> never having himself entered; these</em> , ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ , subjects and citizens and indwellers of the realm, ὧν τὸ πολίτευμα ἐν οὐρανοῖς . He, the <em> friend of the Bridegroom;</em> they, however weak and unworthy members, <em> His Body, and His Spouse</em> .
	</p>
<p>Meyer, giving in substance the above interpretation, believes that αὐτοῦ , i.e. Ἰωάν . τοῦ β ., is to be supplied after μικρότερος . This would be unobjectionable <em> in sense</em> , but is it, in usage? See reff., and remember that ἐν τ . βασ .… is equivalent in <em> meaning</em> to <strong> τῶν</strong> ἐν τ . βασιλείᾳ . Maldonatus (cited by Meyer) quotes the logical axiom, ‘minimum maximi est majus maximo minimi.’</p>
