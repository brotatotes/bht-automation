<p><strong> 19. </strong> <strong> ἐσθίων καὶ πίνων</strong> ] Alluding to our Lord’s practice of frequenting entertainments and feasts, e.g. the marriage at Cana, the feast in Levi’s house, &amp;c. See also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:14">Matthew 9:14</span> .

<p><strong> καί</strong> = <strong> and yet;</strong> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:32">John 16:32</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἡ σοφία</strong> <strong> , the divine wisdom</strong> which hath ordered these things.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐδικ</strong> <strong> . was justified</strong> the same tense as ἦλθεν both times refers to the <em> event</em> , q. d., ‘they were events in which wisdom was justified, &amp;c.’ The force of the aorist is not to be lost by giving a <em> present</em> meaning to either of the verbs. The meaning seems to be, that the waywardness above described was not universal, but that the τέκνα σοφίας (in allusion probably to the Book of Proverbs, which constantly uses similar expressions: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="pr+2:1">Proverbs 2:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:21">Proverbs 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:21">Proverbs 3:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="pr+4:1">Proverbs 4:1</span> , &amp;c.) were led to receive and justify (= clear of imputation) the Wisdom of God, who did these things. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:29">Luke 7:29</span> , where in this same narrative it is said, οἱ τελῶναι <strong> ἐδικαίωσαν</strong> τὸν θεόν , βαπτισθέντες τὸ βάπτισμα Ἰωάννου . The τέκνα σοφίας are opposed to the wayward παιδία above, the child <em> like</em> to the child <em> ish;</em> and thus this verse serves as an introduction to the saying in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span> . Chrysostom understands the verse differently: τουτέστιν , εἰ καὶ ὑμεῖς οὐκ ἐπείσθητε , ἀλλ ʼ ἐμοὶ λοιπὸν ἐγκαλεῖν οὐκ ἔχετε . Thus ὑμεῖς = τὰ τέκνα τῆς σοφ ., as being the people of the Lord; and ἡ σοφία is our Lord Himself. This seems far-fetched, and not so consistent with the context as the other interpretation.

<p><strong> ἀπό</strong> (reff.), not exactly equivalent to ὑπό , but implying ‘ <em> at the hands of</em> ’ the person whence the justification comes.</p>
