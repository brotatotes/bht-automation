<p><strong> 20. </strong> <strong> τότε ἤρξατο</strong> ] This expression betokens a change of subject, but not of locality or time. The whole chapter stands in such close connexion, one part arising out of another (e.g. this out of Mat 11:16-19 ), and all pervaded by the same great undertone, which sounds forth in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:28-30">Matthew 11:28-30</span> , that it is quite impossible that this should be a collection of our Lord’s sayings uttered at different times. I would rather regard the τότε ἤρξατο as a token of the report of an ear-witness, and as pointing to a pause or change of manner on the part of our Lord. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:13">Luke 10:13</span> .

<p><strong> ὅτι οὐ μετ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Connect this with the first subject of our Lord’s preaching, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:17">Matthew 4:17</span> . The reference is to some unrecorded miracles, of which we know (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:23">Luke 4:23</span> ; Joh 21:25 ) that there were many.</p>
