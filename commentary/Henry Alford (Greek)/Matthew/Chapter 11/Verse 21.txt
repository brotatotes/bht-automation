<p><strong> Βηθσαϊδάν</strong> ] Called πόλις <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:45">John 1:45</span> , κώμη <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:23">Mark 8:23</span> , <em> in Galilee</em> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:21">John 12:21</span> ; <em> on the western bank of the lake of Gennesaret, near the middle, not far from Capernaum;</em> the birth-place of Simon Peter, Andrew, and Philip. Both this and Chorazin appear to be put as examples of the lesser towns in which our Lord had wrought His miracles (the κωμοπόλεις of Mar 1:38 ), as distinguished from Capernaum, the chief town ( Mat 11:23 ) of the neighbourhood.
