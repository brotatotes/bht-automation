<p><strong> 24,</strong> and <strong> 22.</strong> ] These verses are connected with those respectively preceding them thus: ‘If these mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon in Sodom they would have, &amp;c. but, since no such opportunity was afforded <em> them</em> , and <em> ye</em> , Bethsaida, Chorazin, and Capernaum, have had and rejected such, it shall be more tolerable, &amp;c.’ And as to the saying of our Lord, ‘If more warnings had been given they would have repented,’ it is not for the infidel to say, ‘Why then were not more given?’ because every act of God for the rescue of a sinner from his doom is purely and entirely of free and undeserved grace, and the proportion of such means of escape dealt out to men is ruled by the counsel of His will who is holy, just, and true, and willeth not the death of the sinner; but whose ways are past our finding out.

<p>This <strong> ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται</strong> is one of those mysterious hints at the future dealings of God, into which we can penetrate no further than the actual words of our Lord reveal, nor say to what difference exactly they point in the relative states of those who are compared.
