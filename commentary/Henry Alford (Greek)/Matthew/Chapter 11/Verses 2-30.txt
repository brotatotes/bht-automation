<p><strong> 2 30.</strong> ] MESSAGE OF ENQUIRY FROM THE BAPTIST: OUR LORD’S ANSWER, AND DISCOURSE THEREON TO THE MULTITUDE. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:18-35">Luke 7:18-35</span> . There have been several different opinions as to the reason why this enquiry was made. I will state them, and append to them my own view. (1) It has been a very generally received idea that the question was asked <em> for the sake of the disciples themselves</em> , with the sanction of their master, and for the purpose of confronting them, who were doubtful and jealous of our Lord, with the testimony of His own mouth. This view is ably maintained by Chrysostom; τίνος οὖν ἕνεκεν ἔπεμψεν ἐρωτῶν ; ἀπεπήδων τοῦ Ἰησοῦ οἱ Ἰωάννου μαθηταί · καὶ τοῦτο παντί που δῆλόν ἐστι · καὶ ζηλοτύπως ἀεὶ πρὸς αὐτὸν εἶχον . καὶ δῆλον ἐξ ὧν πρὸς τὸν διδάσκαλον ἔλεγον ( Joh 3:26 ), καὶ πάλιν ( Joh 3:25 ), καὶ αὐτῷ πάλιν προσελθόντες ἔλεγον ( Mat 9:14 ), οὔπω γὰρ ἦσαν εἰδότες τίς ἦν ὁ χριστός , ἀλλὰ τὸν μὲν Ἰησοῦν ἄνθρωπον ψιλὸν ὑποπτεύοντες , τὸν δὲ Ἰωάννην μείζονα ἢ κατὰ ἄνθρωπον , ἐδάκνοντο εὐδοκιμοῦντα τοῦτον ὁρῶντες , ἐκεῖνον δέ ,· καθὼς εἶπε , λοιπὸν λήγοντα . Hom. xxxvi. 2, 3, p. 408. And similarly Euthymius and Theophylact. This view is also adopted and eloquently defended by Stier, Reden Jesu, 2nd edn., i. p. 392 sq. The objections to this view are, that the text evidently treats the question as coming from John himself; the answer is directed to John; and the following discourse is on the character and position of John. These are answered by Stier with a supposition that John <em> allowed the enquiry to be made</em> in his name; but surely our Saviour would not in this case have made the answer as we have it, which clearly implies that the object of the miracles done was <em> John’s</em> satisfaction. (2) The other great section of opinions on the question is that which supposes doubt to have existed, for some reason or other, in the Baptist’s own mind. This is upheld by Tertullian (cont. Marc. iv. 18, vol. ii. p. 402, ed. Migne, not iv. 5, as Bp. Wordsworth: nor is there any ambiguity in the main features of his view, as Bp. W. implies) and others, and advocated by De Wette, who thinks that the doubt was not perhaps respecting our Lord’s <em> mission</em> , but His <em> way of manifesting Himself</em> , which did not agree with the theocratic views of the Baptist. This he considers to be confirmed by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:6">Matthew 11:6</span> . Olshausen (in loc.) and Neander (Leben Jesu, p. 92) suppose the ground of the doubt to have lain partly in the Messianic idea of the Baptist, partly in the weakening and bedimming effect of imprisonment on John’s mind. Lightfoot carries this latter still further, and imagines that the doubt arose from dissatisfaction at not being liberated from prison by some miracle of our Lord. (Hor. Hebr. in loc.) This however is refuted by Schöttgen (Hor. Hebr. in loc.). The author of the Quæstiones et Resp. ad Orthodoxos among the works of Justin Martyr suggests, and Benson (Hulsean Lectures for 1820, p. 58 sqq.) takes up, the following solution: ἐπειδὴ διάφοροι φῆμαι περὶ ὧν ἐποιήσατο θαυμάτων ὁ Ἰησοῦς διέτρεχον , τῶν μὲν λεγόντων , Ἡλίας ἐστὶν ὁ ταῦτα ποιῶν · τῶν δέ , Ἱερεμίας · τῶν δέ , ἄλλος τις τῶν προφητῶν · ταύτας τὰς φήμας ἀκούων ὁ Ἰωάννης ἐν τῇ εἰρκτῇ πέμπει τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ μαθεῖν εἰ ὁ τὰ σημεῖα ποιῶν αὐτός ἐστιν ὁ ὑπ ʼ αὐτοῦ μαρτυρηθείς , ἢ ἕτερός τις ὁ παρὰ τῶν πολλῶν θρυλλούμενος . γνοὺς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς τοῦ Ἰωάννου τὸν σκοπόν , ἐπὶ τῆς παρουσίας τῶν μαθητῶν Ἰωάννου ἐποίησε πολλὰ θαύματα , πείθεν αὐτοὺς καὶ τὸν Ἰωάννηυ δι ʼ αὐτῶν ὡς αὐτὸς εἴη ὁ πεποιηκὼς καὶ τὰ ἐπ ʼ ὀνόματι ἑτέρων φημιζόμενα θαύματα , ὁ ὑπ ʼ αὐτοῦ μαρτυρηθείς . Resp. 38, p. 456. (3) It appears to me that there are objections against each of the above suppositions, too weighty to allow either of them to be entertained. There can be little doubt on the one hand, that our Saviour’s answer is directed to <em> John</em> , and not to the disciples, who are bonâ fide messengers and nothing more: <strong> πορευθέντες ἀπαγγείλατε Ἰωάννῃ</strong> can, I think, bear no other interpretation: and again the words μακάριός ἐστιν ὃς ἐὰν μὴ σκανδαλισθῇ ἐν ἐμοί must equally apply to John in the first place, so that, <em> in some sense, he</em> had been offended at Christ. On the other hand, it is exceedingly difficult to suppose that there can have been in John’s own mind any real doubt that our Lord was ὁ ἐρχόμενος , seeing that he himself had borne repeatedly such notable witness to Him, and that under special divine direction and manifestation (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16-17">Matthew 3:16-17</span> : Joh 1:26-37 ).
	</p>
<p>The idea of his objective faith being shaken by his imprisonment is quite inconsistent not only with John’s character, but with our Lord’s discourse in this place, whose description of him seems almost framed to guard against such a supposition.
	</p>
<p>The last hypothesis (that of the Pseudo-Justin) is hardly probable, in the form in which it is put. We can scarcely imagine that John can have doubted who this Person was, or have been confounded by the discordant rumours which reached him about His wonderful works. But that <em> one form</em> of this hypothesis is the right one, I am certainly disposed to believe, until some more convincing considerations shall induce me to alter my view. (4) The form to which I allude is this: John having heard all these reports, being himself fully convinced Who this Wonderworker was, was becoming impatient under the slow and unostentatious course of our Lord’s self-manifestation, and desired to obtain from our Lord’s own mouth a declaration which should set such rumours at rest, and (possibly) which might serve for a public profession of His Messiahship, from which hitherto He had seemed to shrink. He thus incurs a share of the same rebuke which the mother of our Lord received ( Joh 2:4 ); and the purport of the answer returned to him is, that the hour was not yet come for such an open declaration, but that there were sufficient proofs given by the works done, to render all inexcusable, who should be offended in Him, And the return message is so far from being a satisfaction designed for the <em> disciples</em> , that they are sent back like the messenger from Gabii to Sextus Tarquinius, with indeed a significant narrative to relate, but no direct answer; they were but the intermediate transmitters of the symbolic message, known to Him who sent it, and him who received it.
	</p>
<p>It is a fact not to be neglected in connexion with this solution of the difficulty, that John is said to have heard of the works, not τοῦ Ἰησοῦ , but <strong> τοῦ χριστοῦ</strong> <strong> :</strong> the only place where that name, standing alone, is given to our Lord in this Gospel. So that it would seem as if the Evangelist had purposely avoided saying τοῦ Ἰησοῦ , to shew that the works were reported to John not as those of the Person whom he had known as Jesus, but of the Deliverer the Christ; and that he was thus led to desire a distinct avowal of the identity of the two. I have before said that the opening part of the ensuing discourse seems to nave been designed to prevent, in the minds of the multitude, any such unworthy estimations of John as those above cited. The message and the answer might well beget such suspicions, and could not from the nature of the case be explained to them in that deeper meaning which they really bore; but the character of John here given would effectually prevent them, after hearing it, from entertaining any such idea.</p>
