<p><strong> 24. </strong> <strong> οἱ δὲ Φ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀκούσ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] St. Mark states ( Mar 3:22 ) that this accusation was brought by the γραμματεῖς οἱ ἀπὸ Ἱεροσολύμων καταβάντες . Luke ( Luk 11:15 ), by τινὲς ἐξ αὐτῶν , i.e. τῶν ὄχλων . On the charge itself, Trench remarks, ‘A rigid monotheistic religion like the Jewish, left but one way of escape from the authority of miracles, which once were acknowledged to be indeed such, and not mere collusions and sleights of hand. There remained nothing to say but that which we find in the N.T. the adversaries of our Lord continually did say, namely, that these works were works of hell.’</p>
