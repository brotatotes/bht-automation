<p><strong> 30.</strong> ] These words have been variously understood. Chrysostom and Euthymius understand them to refer to the devil: Bengel, Schleiermacher, and Neander, to the Jewish exorcists named above. Grotius and others understand it as merely a general proverb, and the ἐμοῦ to mean ‘ <em> any one</em> ,’ and here to apply to Satan, the sense being, ‘ <em> If I do not promote Satan’s kingdom, which I have proved that I do not, then I must be his adversary</em> .’ But this is on all accounts improbable: see below on συνάγων and σκορπίζει . I believe Stier is right in regarding it as a saying setting forth to us generally the entire and complete disjunction of the two kingdoms, of Satan and God. There is and can be in the world <em> no middle party:</em> they who are not with Christ, who do not gather with Him, are against Him and his work, and as far as in them lies are undoing it. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:7">Romans 8:7</span> . And thus the saying connects itself with the following verse: this being the case, <strong> διὰ τοῦτο</strong> λέγω ὑμῖν , the sin of an open belying of the present power of the Holy Spirit of God working in and for His Kingdom, assumes a character surpassingly awful. This saying is no way inconsistent with that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:40">Mark 9:40</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:50">Luke 9:50</span> . That is not a conversion of this, for the terms of the respective propositions are not the same. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:40">Mark 9:40</span> .

<p>As usual, this saying of our Lord reached further than the mere occasion to which it referred, and spoke forcibly to those many half-persuaded hesitating persons who flattered themselves that they could strike out a line avoiding equally the persecution of men and the rejection of Christ. He informed them (and informs us also) of the impossibility of such an endeavour.

<p>In the <strong> συνάγων</strong> there is an allusion to the idea of gathering the harvest: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:30">Matthew 13:30</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:52">John 11:52</span> , and for <strong> σκορπίζει</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:12">John 10:12</span> , in all which places the words exactly bear out their sense here.</p>
