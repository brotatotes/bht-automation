<p><strong> 41.</strong> ] In this verse there is no reference to the <em> sign</em> of Jonas <em> spoken of above</em> , but to a different matter, another way in which he should be a sign to this generation. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:29">Luke 11:29</span> f., and note. (But the preaching of Jonas to the Ninevites was a sign after <em> his</em> resurrection: so shall the preaching of the Son of Man by His Spirit in His Apostles be after His resurrection. Stier.)</p>
