<p><strong> 9. </strong> <strong> μεταβὰς ἐκεῖθεν</strong> ] This change of place is believed by Greswell to have been a journey back to Galilee after the Passover. (Diss. viii. vol. ii.) It is true that no such change is implied in Mark and Luke; but the words here point to a journey undertaken, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:1">Matthew 11:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:29">Matthew 15:29</span> , the only other places in this Gospel where the expression occurs. In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:3">John 7:3</span> , the cognate expression μετάβηθι ἐντεῦθεν is used of a journey from Galilee to Judæa. So that certainly it is not implied here (as Meyer, a [120] ., suppose) that the incident took place on the <em> same day</em> as the previous one. We know from Luk 6:1-49 that it was on another (the next?) sabbath.
