This account is given by Luke later in our Lord’s ministry, but without any fixed situation or time, and with less copiousness of detail. See also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:32">Matthew 9:32</span> , and notes there. St. Mark ( Mar 3:23-29 ) gives part of the discourse which follows, but without any determinate sequence, and omitting the miracle which led to it.</p>
