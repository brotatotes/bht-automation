<p><strong> 1. </strong> <strong> ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ</strong> ] These words may mean literally <em> in the same day</em> , But it is not absolutely necessary. The words certainly do bear that meaning in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:35">Mark 4:35</span> , and important consequences follow (see note there): but in Act 8:1 they are as evidently indefinite. The instances of their occurrence in John (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:20">John 14:20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:23">John 16:23</span> ; Joh 16:26 ) are not to the point, their use there being prophetical.

<p><strong> ἀπὸ τῆς οἰκ</strong> <strong> .</strong> perhaps implies that the foregoing discourse was delivered <em> in a house</em> , as some have thought: but the article need not (any more than τό before πλοῖον , see notes on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:1">Matthew 9:1</span> ; Mat 9:28 ) imply <em> any particular house</em> .</p>
