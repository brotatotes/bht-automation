<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] <strong> οἱ μαθηταί</strong> = οἱ περὶ αὐτὸν σὺν τοῖς δώδεκα Mark. This question took place during a pause in our Lord’s teaching, not when He had entered the house, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:36">Matthew 13:36</span> .

It is not mentioned in Mark: only the enquiry into the meaning of the parable just spoken: nor in Luke; but the answer implies it.</p>
