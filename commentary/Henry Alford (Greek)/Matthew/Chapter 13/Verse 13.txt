<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] <strong> ὅτι βλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οὐ βλέπουσιν</strong> κ . τ . λ . = (in Mark, Luke; similarly below) ἵνα βλ . μὴ βλέπωσιν κ . τ . λ . In the deeper view of the purpose of the parable, both of these run into one. Taking the saying of Mat 13:12 for our guide we have ὅστις οὐκ ἔχει = ὅτι βλέπ . οὐ βλέπουσιν , and καὶ ὃ ἔχει ἀρθ . ἀπ ʼ αὐτοῦ = ἵνα βλ . μὴ βλέπωσιν . The difficulties raised on these variations, and on the prophecy quoted in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:14-15">Matthew 13:14-15</span> , have arisen entirely from not keeping this in view.</p>
