<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] Here also the <em> fourth</em> class must not be understood as a decided well-marked company, excluding all the rest. For the soil is <em> not good by nature:</em> the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; but every predisposition to receive them is of God: even the shallow soil covering the rock, even the thorny soil, received its power to take in and vivify the seed, from God. So that divine grace is the enabling, vivifying, cleansing power throughout: and these sown on the good land are no naturally good, amiable, or pure class, but those prepared by divine grace receptive, by granted receptive power. The sowing is not necessarily the <em> first</em> that has ever taken place: the field has been and is continually resown, so that the <em> care of the husbandman</em> is presupposed. Again, no irresistible grace or absolute decree of God must be dreamt of here. God working not barely <em> upon</em> , but <em> with</em> man, is, as we said above, the μυστήριον τῆς βασιλείας here declared, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+4:3">Jeremiah 4:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ho+10:12">Hosea 10:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:7">Galatians 6:7</span> .

There is no point of comparison with the different classes in the parable of the <em> talents:</em> for he who had five talents yielded the <em> same</em> increase as he who had two.
