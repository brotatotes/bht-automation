<p>Lightfoot (Centurio Chorograph. Marco præmissa, p. 413) shews <em> Magdala</em> to have been only a sabbathday’s journey from Chamnath Gadara on the Jordan, and on the east side of the lake: but probably he is mistaken, for most travellers (see Winer, Realwörterbuch, in v.) place it about three miles from Tiberias, on the west side of the lake, where is now a village named Madschel. <em> Dalmanutha</em> , mentioned by Mark ( Mar 8:10 ), seems to have been a village in the neighbourhood.</p>
