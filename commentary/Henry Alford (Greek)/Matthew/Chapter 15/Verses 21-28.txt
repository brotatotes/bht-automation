<p><strong> 21 28.</strong> ] THE CANAANITISH WOMAN. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:24-30">Mark 7:24-30</span> ; omitted by Luke. It is not quite clear whether our Lord actually passed the frontier into the land of the heathen, or merely was <em> on</em> the frontier. The usage of εἰς τὰ μέρη in Matthew favours the former supposition: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:22">Matthew 2:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:13">Matthew 16:13</span> ; also for ὅρια , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:16">Matthew 2:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:13">Matthew 4:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:34">Matthew 8:34</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:35">Exodus 16:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+16:35">Exodus 16:35</span> , εἰς μέρος τῆς Φοινίκης , ‘to the borders of Canaan,’ has been quoted as supporting the other view; but the usage of our Evangelist himself seems to carry greater weight. And the question is not one of importance; for our Lord did not go to teach or to heal, but, as it would appear, to avoid the present indignation of the Pharisees. Mark’s account certainly implies that the woman was in the same place where our Lord was wishing to be hid, and could not.</p>
