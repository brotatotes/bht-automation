<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] As it was Peter’s <em> spiritual discernment</em> , given from above, which made him a foundation-stone of the Church, so is it his <em> carnality</em> , proceeding from want of unity with the divine will, which makes him an adversary now. Compare ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:10">Matthew 4:10</span> , also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span> .

<p><strong> σκάνδαλον εἶ ἐμοῦ</strong> ] <strong> Thou art my stumbling-block</strong> (not merely <em> a</em> stumbling-block to me; the definite article is omitted before a noun thrust forward for emphasis, but in English it must be supplied), my πέτρα σκανδάλου (in Peter’s own remarkable words, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:7-8">1 Peter 2:7-8</span> , joined too with the very expression, ὃν <strong> ἀπεδοκίμασαν</strong> οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες , which, as above noticed, occurs in this passage in Mark and Luke). Wordsw.’s note here, “our blessed Lord keeps up the metaphor of πέτρος , or a stone: thou who wert just now, by thy faith in confessing Me, <em> a lively stone</em> , art now by thy carnal weakness <em> a stumbling stone</em> to Christ,” seems to shew that his strong repudiation of any allusion to <strong> πέτρος</strong> in the <strong> πέτρα</strong> of Mat 16:18 has not carried full conviction to its writer. Before this rebuke St. Mark inserts καὶ ἰδὼν τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ , that the reproof might be before them all.</p>
