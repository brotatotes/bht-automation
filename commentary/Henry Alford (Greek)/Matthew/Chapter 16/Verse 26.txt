In the latter part of the verse, ἄνθρωπος and αὐτοῦ refer to the same person: ἀντάλλαγμα = ἐξίλασμα , τὴν τιμὴν τῆς λυτρώσεως τῆς ψ . αὐτοῦ <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+48:7-8">Psalms 48:7-8</span> . <strong> What shall a man give to purchase back his life? </strong> <strong> ψυχή</strong> <strong> ,</strong> not <em> soul</em> , but <strong> life,</strong> in the higher sense.</p>
