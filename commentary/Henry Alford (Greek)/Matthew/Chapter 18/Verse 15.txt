<p>One kind is, when <em> thou sinnest against another</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:7-14">Matthew 18:7-14</span> . A second kind, when <em> thy brother sins against thee</em> . The remedy for the former must be, in each individual being cautious in his own person, that of the latter, in the exercise of brotherly love, and if that fail, the authority of the congregation, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:15-17">Matthew 18:15-17</span> .

<p>Then follows an exposition of what that authority is, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:18-20">Matthew 18:18-20</span> .

<p>An attempt has apparently been made (see var. readd.) to render the passage applicable to <em> sin in general</em> , and so to give the Church power over sins upon earth.

<p><strong> ἐκέρδησας</strong> <strong> ,</strong> in the higher sense, <strong> reclaimed,</strong> gained for God, see reff.: and for thyself too: πρῶτον γὰρ ἐζημίου τοῦτον , διὰ τοῦ σκανδάλου ῥηγνύμενον ἀπὸ τῆς ἀδελφικῆς σου συναφείας . Euthym [149]
