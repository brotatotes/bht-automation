<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] This verse reasserts in a wider and more general sense the grant made to Peter in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span> . It is here not only to him as the first stone, but to the whole building. See note there, and on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:23">John 20:23</span> , between which and our ch. Mat 16:19 this is a middle point.</p>
