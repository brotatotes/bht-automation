<p><strong> 31.</strong> ] The fellow-servants <strong> ἐλυπήθησαν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the lord <strong> ὀργίζεται</strong> <strong> .</strong> <em> Anger</em> is not <em> man’s</em> proper mood towards sin, but <em> sorrow</em> (see Psa 119:136 ), because all men are sinners. These fellow-servants are the <em> praying people of God</em> , who plead with Him against the oppression and tyranny in the world.</p>
