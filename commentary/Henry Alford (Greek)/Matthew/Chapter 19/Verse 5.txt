<p><strong> 5.</strong> <strong> εἰς σάρκα μίαν</strong> ] εἶναι εἰς is not Greek, but a Hebraism, הָיָה לְ (Meyer). Stier remarks, that the essential bond of marriage consists <em> not in unity of spirit and soul</em> , by which indeed the marriage state should ever be hallowed and sweetened, but without which it still exists in all its binding power: the wedded pair are ONE FLESH, i.e. ONE MAN <em> within the limits of their united life in the flesh</em> , for <em> this world:</em> beyond this limit, the marriage is broken by the <em> death of the flesh</em> . And herein alone lies the justification of a <em> second</em> marriage, which in no way breaks off the unity of love in spirit with the former partner, now deceased. Vol. ii. p. 267, edn. 2.</p>
