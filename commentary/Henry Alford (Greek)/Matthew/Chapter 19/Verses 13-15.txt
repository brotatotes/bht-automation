<p><strong> 13 15.</strong> ] THE BRINGING OF CHILDREN TO JESUS. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:13-16">Mark 10:13-16</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:15-17">Luke 18:15-17</span> . After the long divergence of ch. Luk 9:51 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:14">Luke 18:14</span> , Luke here again falls into the synoptic narrative. This incident is more fully related in Mark, where see notes.

<p>Our Evangelist gives τὰς χ . ἐπιθ . αὐτ . κ . προσεύξ . (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:14">Genesis 48:14</span> ; Act 6:6 ), where the other two have only ‘ <em> that He should touch them</em> .’ The connexion in which it stands here and in Mark seems to be natural, <em> immediately after the discourse on marriage</em> . Some further remarks of our Lord, possibly on the fruit of marriage, may have given rise to the circumstance.</p>
