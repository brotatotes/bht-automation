<p><strong> 28 30.</strong> ] We may admire the <em> simple truthfulness</em> of this answer of our Lord. He does not hide from them their reward: but tells them prophetically, that in the new world, the accomplishment of that regeneration which He came to bring in (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:21">Acts 3:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+21:5">Revelation 21:5</span> ; Mat 26:29 ), when He should sit ( καθίσῃ in the <em> active</em> ) on His throne of glory ( ἐπ . θρόν <strong> ου</strong> τ . δ . αὐ ., the gen. expressing the simple fact of His session on His throne), then they also should sit ( καθίσεσθε in the <em> middle</em> ) on twelve thrones ( ἐπ . δώ . θρόν <strong> ους</strong> , the accus. expressing motion towards, as prescribed for them by another: “shall be promoted to, and take your seats upon …”) judging (see ref. 1 Cor.) the twelve tribes of Israel (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+21:12">Revelation 21:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+21:14">Revelation 21:14</span> : one throne, Judas’s, another took, Act 1:20 ). At the same time he informs them, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:29">Matthew 19:29</span> , that this reward should <em> not</em> in its most blessed particulars be <em> theirs alone</em> , but that of <em> every one who should deny himself for Him</em> (see 2Ti 4:8 ): and ( Mat 19:30 ) cautions them, referring perhaps especially to Judas, but with a view to all, as appears by the following parable, that <em> many first should be last</em> , and <em> last first</em> .

<p>Meyer’s rendering of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:30">Matthew 19:30</span> , joining πρῶτοι with ἔσονται , and thus making ἔσχατοι the subject and πρῶτοι the predicate of the first clause and vice versâ in the second, is not so good as the ordinary one: for whereas the πρῶτοι in the first clause, if it belonged to πολλοί , would naturally lose its article, ἔσχατοι , if it belonged to πολλοί , being divided from it by the predicate πρῶτοι , would take its article as the subject; πολλοὶ δὲ ἔσονται πρῶτοι οἱ ἔσχατοι : and the same of πρῶτοι in the second clause: καὶ ἔσχατοι οἱ πρῶτοι , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:16">Matthew 20:16</span> , by which Meyer defends his rendering, does not necessitate it, containing the same propositions stated in different order.</p>
