<p><strong> 4 6.</strong> ] On these verses we may remark (1) that our Lord refers to the Mosaic account of the Creation as <em> the historical fact</em> of the first creation of man; and grounds his argument on the <em> literal</em> expressions of that narrative. (2) That He cites both from the first and second chapters of Genesis, and in immediate connexion; thus shewing them to be consecutive parts of a continuous narrative, which, from their different diction, and apparent repetition, they have sometimes been supposed not to be. (3) That He quotes as <em> spoken by the Creator</em> the words in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24">Genesis 2:24</span> , which were actually said by Adam; they must therefore be understood as said in prophecy, <em> divino afflatu</em> , which indeed the terms made use of in them would require, since the relations alluded to by those terms did not yet exist. Augustin. de Nupt. ii. 4 (12), vol. x. pt. i., ‘Deus utique per hominem dixit quod homo prophetande prædixit.’ (4) That the force of the argument consists in the <em> previous unity</em> of male and female, not indeed organically, but by implication, in Adam. Thus it is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:27">Genesis 1:27</span> , not ἄνδρα καὶ γυναῖκα ἐποίησεν αὐτούς , but ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ ἐπ . αὐ . <strong> He made them</strong> (man, as a race) <strong> male</strong> (not, <em> a</em> male) <strong> and female:</strong> but then the male and female were implicitly shut up in one; and therefore after the creation of woman from man, when one man and one woman were united in marriage they should be <em> one flesh</em> , ἕνεκεν τούτου , <em> because</em> woman was taken out of man. The answer then is, that <em> abstractedly</em> , from the nature of marriage, <em> it is indissoluble</em> .
