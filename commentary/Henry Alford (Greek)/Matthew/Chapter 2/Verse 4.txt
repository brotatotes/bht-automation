<p><strong> 4. </strong> <strong> συναγαγών</strong> ] i.e. says Lightfoot, he <em> assembled the Sanhedrim</em> . For the Sanhedrim consisting of seventy-one members, and comprising Priests, Levites, and Israelites (Maimonides), under the term ἀρχιερεῖς are contained the two first of these, and under γραμ . τ . λαοῦ the third.

<p><strong> ἀρχ</strong> <strong> .</strong> are most likely the High Priest and those of his race, any who had served the office, and perhaps also the presidents of the twenty-four courses ( 1Ch 24:6 ).

<p><strong> γρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> consisted of the teachers and interpreters of the Divine law, the νομικοί and νομοδιδάσκαλοι of St. Luke. But the πρεσβύτεροι τοῦ λαοῦ are usually mentioned with these two classes as making up the Sanhedrim. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:3">Matthew 26:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:59">Matthew 26:59</span> . Possibly on this occasion the ἀρχ . and γρ . only were summoned, the question being one of Scripture learning. “ <strong> ἀρχιερεῖς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> ” says Bp. Wordsworth, “is a word suggestive of the confusion now introduced into the nomination to the office of High Priest, when the true High Priest came from heaven to ‘purify the sons of Levi’ ( Mal 3:3 ).” Instead of one High Priest for life, there were many, made and unmade in rapid succession. As Spanheim says, Dub. Evan. ii. 37, “ ἀρχιερωσύνη confusa, Christo exhibito. Summum sacerdotium pessime habitum, Herodis et Romanorum licentia.”
