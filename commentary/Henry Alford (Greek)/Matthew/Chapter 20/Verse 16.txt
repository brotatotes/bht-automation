<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] The last were first, as <em> equal to the first</em> ; first, <em> in order of payment</em> ; first, <em> as superior to the first</em> (no others being brought into comparison), in that their reward was <em> more</em> in proportion to their work, and <em> not marred</em> by a murmuring spirit. The first were last in these same respects.

<p>The last words of the verse belong not so much to the parable, as to the first clause, and are placed to account for its being as there described; for, while multitudes are called into the vineyard, many, by murmuring and otherwise disgracing their calling, will nullify it, and so, although first by profession and standing, will not be of the number of the elect: although called, will not be chosen. In ch. Mat 23:14 the reference is different.</p>
