<p><strong> 22.</strong> ] One at least of these brethren saw <em> the Lord on His Cross on His right and left hand the crucified thieves</em> . Bitter indeed must the remembrance of this ambitious prayer have been at that moment! Luther remarks, ‘The flesh ever seeks to be glorified, before it is crucified: exalted, before it is abased.’

<p>The ‘ <em> cup</em> ’ is a frequent Scripture image for joy or sorrow: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+23:5">Psalms 23:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+116:13">Psalms 116:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+51:22">Isaiah 51:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:42">Matthew 26:42</span> . <em> It</em> here seems to signify more the <em> inner</em> and spiritual bitterness, resembling the agony of the Lord Himself, and the <em> baptism</em> , which is an important addition in Mark, more the <em> outer</em> accession of persecution and trial, through which we must pass to the Kingdom of God. On the latter image see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+42:7">Psalms 42:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:2">Psalms 69:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+124:4">Psalms 124:4</span> .

<p>Stier rightly observes that this answer of our Lord contains in it <em> the kernel of the doctrine of the Sacraments</em> in the Christian Church: see Rom 6:1-7 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span> , and note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:50">Luke 12:50</span> .
	</p>
<p>Some explain their answer as if they understood the Lord to speak of <em> drinking out of the royal cup</em> , and <em> washing in the royal ewer</em> : but the words <strong> δύνασθε</strong> πιεῖν , and <strong> δυνάμεθα</strong> <strong> ,</strong> indicating a <em> difficulty</em> , preclude this.</p>
