<p>The last clause of the verse may be understood as in the E. V., ‘is not mine to give, <em> but it shall be given to them</em> for whom it is prepared of my Father;’ so Meyer, a [153] .; or, taking <strong> ἀλλά</strong> as = εἰ μή (see reff.), ‘is not mine to give, <em> except</em> to those for whom,’ &amp;c. So Chrys. &amp;c., Grot. a [154] . If however we understand after ἀλλά ‘it shall be given <em> by Me</em> ,’ we may say with Bengel, ‘res eodem recidit, sive oppositione, sive exceptione.’
