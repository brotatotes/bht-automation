<p><strong> 20 28.</strong> ] AMBITIOUS REQUEST OF THE MOTHER OF THE SONS OF ZEBEDEE; OUR LORD’S REPLY. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:35-45">Mark 10:35-45</span> . Not related by Luke. This request seems to have arisen from the promise made to the twelve in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span> . In Mark’s account, the <em> two brethren themselves</em> make the request. But the <em> narration</em> in the text is the more detailed and exact; and the two immediately coincide, by our Lord <em> addressing His answer</em> to the two Apostles ( Mat 20:22 ). The difference is no greater than is perpetually to be found in narrations of the same fact, persons being often related to have done <em> per se</em> what, accurately speaking, they did <em> per alterum</em> . The mother’s name was <em> Salome</em> ; she had followed our Lord from Galilee, and afterwards witnessed the crucifixion, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:40">Mark 15:40</span> . Probably the two brethren had directed this request <em> through</em> <em> their mother</em> , because they remembered the rebuke which had followed their former contention about precedence.</p>
