<p><strong> 23. </strong> <strong> οἱ ἀρχ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οἱ πρεσ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Mark and Luke add γραμματεῖς , and so make up the members of the Sanhedrim. It was an <em> official message</em> , sent with a view to make our Saviour declare Himself to be a prophet sent from God in which case the Sanhedrim had power to take cognizance of His proceedings, as of a professed Teacher. Thus the Sanhedrim sent a deputation to John on his appearing as a Teacher, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:19">John 1:19</span> . The question was <em> the result of a combination to destroy Jesus</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:47-48">Luke 19:47-48</span> . They do not now ask, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:18">John 2:18</span> , τί σημεῖον δεικνύεις ἡμῖν ὅτι ταῦτα ποιεῖς ; for they had had many signs which are now included in their ταῦτα . The second question, <strong> καὶ τίς</strong> κ . τ . λ ., is an expansion of ποίᾳ .</p>
