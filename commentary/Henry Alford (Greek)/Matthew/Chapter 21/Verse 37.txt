<p><strong> 37.</strong> ] See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:13">Luke 20:13</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:6">Mark 12:6</span> . Our Lord sets forth His heavenly Father in human wise deliberating, τί ποιήσω ; (Luke) and ἴσως ἐντρ ., to signify His gracious adoption, for man’s sake, of every means which may turn sinners to repentance. The difference here is fully made between the Son and all the other messengers; see Mark; ἔτι ἕνα υἱὸν εἶχεν ἀγαπητόν …: and, as Stier remarks, this is the real and direct answer to the question in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:23">Matthew 21:23</span> . The Son appears here, not in his character of Redeemer, but in that of a preacher a messenger demanding the fruits of the vineyard. (See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:17">Matthew 4:17</span> .)</p>
