<p><strong> ὁ πεσὼν</strong> <strong> .…</strong> he that <em> takes offence</em> , that <em> makes it a stone of stumbling</em> , <strong> shall be broken:</strong> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34">Luke 2:34</span> ; but <strong> on whomsoever,</strong> as its enemy, <em> it shall come in vengeance</em> , as prophesied in Daniel, λικμήσει αὐτόν , <strong> it shall dash him in pieces.</strong> Meyer maintains that the meaning of λικμ . is not this, but literally ‘ <em> shall winnow him</em> ,’ throw him off as chaff (see ref. Job). But the confusion in the parable thus occasioned is quite unnecessary. The result of winnowing is complete separation and dashing away of the worthless part: and it is surely far better to understand this <em> result</em> as the work of the falling of the stone, than to apply the words to a part of the operation for which the <em> falling of a stone</em> is so singularly unsuited.</p>
