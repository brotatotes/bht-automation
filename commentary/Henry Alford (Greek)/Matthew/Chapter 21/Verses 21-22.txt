<p><strong> 21, 22.</strong> ] This assurance has occurred before in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:20">Matthew 17:20</span> . That truest and <em> highest faith</em> , which implies a mind and will perfectly in unison with that of God, can, even in its least degree, have been in Him only who spoke these words. And by it, and its elevating power over the functions and laws of inferior natures, were His most notable miracles wrought. It is observable, that such a state of mind entirely precludes the idea of an <em> arbitrary</em> exercise of power none such can therefore be intended in our Lord’s assertion but we must understand, “if expedient.” Though we cannot reach this faith in its fulness, yet every approach to it ( Mat 21:21 ) shall be endued with some of its wonderful power, in obtaining requests from God.
