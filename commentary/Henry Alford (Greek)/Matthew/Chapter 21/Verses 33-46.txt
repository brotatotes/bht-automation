<p><strong> 33 46.</strong> ] PARABLE OF THE VINEYARD LET OUT TO HUSBANDMEN. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:1-12">Mark 12:1-12</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:9-19">Luke 20:9-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:9-19">Luke 20:9-19</span> . This parable is in intimate connexion with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:1">Isaiah 5:1</span> ff., and was certainly intended by our Lord as an express application of that passage to the Jews of His time. Both Mark and Luke open it with an ἤρξατο λέγειν …, as a fresh beginning, by our Lord, of a series of parables. Luke adds, that it was spoken πρὸς τὸν λαόν . Its subject is, of course, <em> the continued rejection of God’s prophets by the people of Israel, till at last they rejected and killed His only Son</em> . The <strong> οἰκοδεσπότης ἐφύτευσεν ἀμπελῶνα</strong> <strong> :</strong> i.e. ‘ <em> selected it out</em> of all His world, and <em> fenced it in</em> , and <em> dug a receptacle for the juice</em> (in the rock or ground, to keep it cool, into which it flowed from the press above, through a grated opening), <em> and built a tower</em> (of recreation or observation to watch the crops).’ This exactly coincides with the state of the Jewish nation, under covenant with God as His people. All these expressions are in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:1-30">Isaiah 5:1-30</span> . The <em> letting out to husbandmen</em> was probably that kind of letting where the tenant pays his rent <em> in kind</em> , although the καρποί <em> may</em> be understood of money. God began about 430 years after the Exodus to send His prophets to the people of Israel, and continued even till John the Baptist; but all was in vain; they “persecuted the prophets,” casting them out, and putting them to death. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ne+9:26">Nehemiah 9:26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:31">Matthew 23:31</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:37">Matthew 23:37</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:36-38">Hebrews 11:36-38</span> .)

<p>The <em> different sendings</em> must not be pressed; they probably imply the <em> fulness and sufficiency of warnings given</em> , and set forth the longsuffering of the householder; and the increasing rebellion of the husbandmen is shewn by their increasing ill-treatment of the messengers. Meyer understands αὐτοῦ after καρπούς , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:34">Matthew 21:34</span> , to mean <em> His</em> fruits; i.e. in <em> money</em> .</p>
