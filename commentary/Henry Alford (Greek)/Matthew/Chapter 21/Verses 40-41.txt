<p><strong> 40, 41.</strong> ] See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:5">Isaiah 5:5</span> . All means had been tried, and nothing but judgment was now left. Mark and Luke omit the important words λέγουσιν αὐτῷ , though Luke has given us the key to them, in telling us that the parable was spoken in the hearing of the <em> people</em> , who seem to have made the answer. Perhaps however the Pharisees (as suggested by Trench, Parables, in loco) may have made this answer, having <em> missed</em> , or (as Olshausen thinks, Biblisch. Comm. i. p. 793, and Stier, R. J. ii. 363) <em> pretended</em> to miss, <em> the sense of the parable</em> ; but from the strong κακοὺς κακῶς , I incline to the former view. Whichever said it, it was a self-condemnation, similar to that in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:25">Matthew 27:25</span> : the <em> last form</em> , as Nitzsch finely remarks (cited by Stier, ib.), of the divine warnings to men, ‘when they themselves speak of the deeds which they are about to do, and pronounce judgment upon them.’ So striking, even up to the last moment, is the mysterious union of human free-will with divine foresight (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span> ; Gen 1:20 ), that after all other warnings frustrated, the conscience of the sinner himself interposes to save him from his sin.

<p>The expression κακοὺς κακῶς ἀπολ . is one of the purest Greek: ἀπό σ ʼ ὀλῶ κακὸν κακῶς , Aristoph. Plut. 65, and indeed passim in the best writers.

<p><strong> οἵτινες</strong> ] <strong> of a kind, who:</strong> οἵ would identify, <strong> οἵτινες</strong> classifies. They do not specify <em> who</em> , but only <em> of what sort</em> , the new tenants will be. The clause is peculiar to Matthew. We may observe that our Lord here makes <strong> ὅταν ἔλθῃ ὁ κύριος</strong> <em> coincide with the destruction of Jerusalem</em> , which is incontestably the overthrow of the wicked husbandmen. This passage forms therefore an important key to our Lord’s prophecies, and a decisive justification for those who, like myself, firmly hold that <em> the coming of the Lord</em> is in many places to be identified, primarily, with that overthrow.</p>
