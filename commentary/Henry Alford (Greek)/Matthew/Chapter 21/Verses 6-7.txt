<p><strong> 6, 7.</strong> ] In Mark, εὗρον πῶλον δεδεμένον πρὸς θύραν ἔξω ἐπὶ τοῦ ἀμφόδου . Our Lord sat on the <em> foal</em> (Mark, Luke), and the mother accompanied, apparently after the manner of a sumpter, as prophets so riding would be usually accompanied (but not of course doing the work of a sumpter).

<p>In the last <strong> αὐτῶν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> probably the <em> animals</em> , not the garments, are to be understood. Thus we say, ‘the postilion rode on the horses.’ Meyer objects to this interpretation, that no such latitude of expression is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:5">Matthew 21:5</span> . But I cannot see how this affects the matter. Even if we take ἐπάνω αὐτῶν of the garments, the former ἐπ ʼ αὐτῶν will require similar latitude of interpretation. That this riding and entry were <em> intentional</em> on the part of our Lord, is clear: and also that He did not thereby mean to give any countenance to the temporal ideas of His Messiahship, but solemnly to fulfil the Scriptures respecting Him, and to prepare the way for his sufferings, by a public avowal of His mission. The typical meaning also is not to be overlooked. In all probability the evening visit to the temple was on the very day when the Paschal Lamb was to be taken up i.e. set apart for the sacrifice.</p>
