<p><strong> 11, 12.</strong> ] This second part of the parable is in direct reference to the word of prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="zep+1:7-8">Zephaniah 1:7-8</span> ; cf. especially <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:8">Matthew 22:8</span> , καὶ ἔσται ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θυσίας κυρίου καὶ ἐκδικήσω .… ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐνδεδυμένους ἐνδύματα ἀλλότρια . The coming of the King to see his guests is the final and separating Judgment of the Church, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:19">Matthew 25:19</span> , when that distinction shall be made, which God’s ministers have no power nor right to make in admissions into the visible Church. Yet as Trench remarks (Parables, p. 207), this coming of the King is not <em> exclusively</em> the final one, but every trying and sifting judgment adumbrates it in some measure. With regard to the <strong> ἔνδυμα γάμου</strong> <strong> ,</strong> we must not, I think, make too much of the usually cited Oriental custom of presenting the guests with such garments at feasts. For (1) it is not distinctly proved that such a custom existed; the passages usually quoted (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+45:22">Genesis 45:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jdg+14:12">Judges 14:12</span> ; 2Ki 5:22 ) are nothing to the purpose; 2Ki 10:22 shews that the worshippers of Baal were provided with vestments, and <em> at a feast</em> : and at the present day those who are admitted to the presence of Royalty in the East are clothed with a <em> caftan</em> : but all this does not make good the assumption: and (2) even granting it, it is not to be pressed, as being manifestly not the punctum saliens of this part of the parable. The guest was bound to provide himself with this proper habit, out of respect to the feast and its Author: <em> how</em> this was to be provided, does not <em> here</em> appear, but does <em> elsewhere</em> . The garment is <em> the imputed and inherent righteousness of the Lord Jesus</em> , put on <em> symbolically</em> in Baptism ( Gal 3:27 ), and <em> really</em> by a true and living faith (ib. Gal 3:26 ), without which none can appear before God in His Kingdom of Glory; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:14">Hebrews 12:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:7-8">Philippians 3:7-8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10">Colossians 3:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:14">Romans 8:14</span> : which truth could not be put forward <em> here</em> , but at its subsequent manifestation threw its great light over this and other such similitudes and expressions. This guest imagines <em> his own garment</em> will be as acceptable, and therefore neglects to provide himself.
