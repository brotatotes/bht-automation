<p><strong> 31 33.</strong> ] Our Lord does not cite the strong testimonies of the Prophets, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+26:19">Isaiah 26:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:1-14">Ezekiel 37:1-14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+12:2">Daniel 12:2</span> , but says, as in Luke ( Luk 20:37 ), ‘ <em> even Moses</em> has shewn,’ &amp;c., leaving those other witnesses to be supplied. The books of Moses were the great and ultimate appeal for all doctrine: and thus the assertion of the Resurrection comes from the very source whence their difficulty had been constructed. On the passage itself, and our Lord’s interpretation of it, much has been written. Certain it is that our Lord brings out in this answer a depth of meaning in the words, which without it we could not discover. Meyer, in reply to Strauss and Hase, finely says, “Our Lord here testifies of the conscious intent of God in speaking the words. God uttered them, He tells us, to Moses, in the consciousness of the still enduring existence of his peculiar relation to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”

<p>The groundwork of His argument seems to me to be this: the words ‘I am thy God’ imply a <em> covenant</em> ; there is <em> another side</em> to them: “Thou art Mine” follows upon “I am thine.” When God therefore declares that He <em> is the God</em> of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, He declares <em> their continuance</em> , as the other parties in this covenant. It is an assertion which <em> could not be made of an annihilated being of the past</em> . And notice also (with Bengel), that Abraham’s (&amp;c.) <em> body</em> , having had upon it <em> the seal of the covenant</em> , is included in this. Stier (after Lavater) remarks that this is a weighty testimony against the so-called ‘sleep of the soul’ in the intermediate state. Compare πάντες γὰρ αὐτῷ ζῶσιν <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:38">Luke 20:38</span> , and ζῶσι τῷ θεῷ 4Ma 7:19 ; [<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:25">Matthew 16:25</span> ,] spoken of the Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Thus the burden of the Law, ‘I AM THE LORD THY GOD,’ contains in it the seed of immortality and the hope of the resurrection.</p>
