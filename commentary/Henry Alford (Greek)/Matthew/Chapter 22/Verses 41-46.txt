<p><strong> 41 46.</strong> ] THE PHARISEES BAFFLED BY A QUESTION RESPECTING CHRIST AND DAVID. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:35-37">Mark 12:35-37</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:41-44">Luke 20:41-44</span> . (See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:34">Acts 2:34</span> .) Our Lord now questions his adversaries (according to Matt.: in Mark and Luke He asks the question not <em> to</em> , but <em> concerning</em> the Scribes or interpreters of the law), and again convicts them of ignorance of the Scriptures. From the universally recognized title of the Messiah as the Son of David, which by His question He elicits from them, He takes occasion to shew them, who understood this title in a mere worldly political sense, the difficulty arising from Davidâ€™s own reverence for this his Son: the solution lying in the incarnate Godhead of the Christ, of which they were ignorant.</p>
