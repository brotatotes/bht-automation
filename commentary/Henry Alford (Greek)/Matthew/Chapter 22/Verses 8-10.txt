<p><strong> 8 10.</strong> ] On <strong> οὐκ ἄξιοι</strong> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span> . ἦσαν , as Bengel, “ <em> præteritum</em> indignos eo magis <em> prætermittit</em> .”
	</p>
<p><strong> διέξοδοι</strong> are the places of resort at the meetings of streets, the squares, or confluences of ways. De Wette and Meyer are wrong in saying that they are not in the city, ‘for that was destroyed:’ it is not <em> the city of the murderers, but that in which the feast is supposed to be held</em> , which is spoken of: not Jerusalem, but God’s world.

<p><strong> πονηρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τε κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀγαθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Both the open sinners and the morally good together. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:47">Matthew 13:47</span> , where the net collects ἐκ παντὸς γένους . Stier remarks that we might expect, from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:31">Matthew 21:31</span> , to find the guest who by and by is expelled, <em> among the</em> <strong> ἀγαθοί</strong> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ὁ γάμος</strong> is here <strong> the feast,</strong> not <em> the place where it was held</em> .
	</p>
<p>Here, so to speak, the <em> first act</em> of the parable closes; and here is the situation of the Church at this day; collected out of all the earth, and containing both bad and good. <strong> ἐπλήσθη</strong> <strong> ,</strong> as Meyer well remarks, is emphatic.</p>
