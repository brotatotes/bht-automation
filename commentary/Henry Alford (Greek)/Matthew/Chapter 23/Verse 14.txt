<p><strong> 14.</strong> ] In Luk 11:52 it is added ἤρατε τὴν κλεῖδα τῆς γνώσεως the Key being, not the Key <em> of</em> , i.e. <em> admitting to</em> , Knowledge, but <em> the Knowledge itself</em> , the true simple interpretation of Scripture which would have admitted them, and caused them to admit others, into the Kingdom of Heaven by the recognition of Him of whom the Scriptures testify; whereas now by their perverse interpretations they had shut out both themselves and others from it. See a notable instance of this latter in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:24">John 9:24</span> . They shut the door as it were in men’s faces who were entering. On the interpolated <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:13">Matthew 23:13</span> , see notes in Mark ( Mar 12:40 ).</p>
