<p><strong> 34.</strong> ] From the similar place in the former discourse (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:49">Luke 11:49</span> , see notes there) it would appear that the <strong> διὰ τοῦτο</strong> refers to the <em> whole</em> last denunciation: ‘quæ cum ita sint’ ‘since ye are bent upon filling up the iniquities of your fathers, in God’s inscrutable purposes ye shall <em> go on</em> rejecting His messengers.’ Notice the difference between ἡ σοφία τοῦ θ . in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:49">Luke 11:49</span> , and <strong> ἐγώ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> with its emphasis here. These words are no where <em> written</em> in Scripture, nor is it necessary to suppose that to be our Lord’s meaning. He speaks this as Head of His Church, of those whom He was about to send: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8">1 Corinthians 12:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5">Ephesians 3:5</span> . He cannot, as some (Olsh.) think, include <em> Himself</em> among those whom He sends the Jews may have <em> crucified</em> many Christian teachers before the destruction of Jerusalem. And see Euseb. H. E. iii. 32, where he relates from Hegesippus the crucifixion of Symeon son of Clopas, in the reign of Trajan. The καί takes out the στανρώσετε , the special, from the ἀποκτενεῖτε , the general; with, of course, somewhat of emphasis. The <strong> προφῆται</strong> were the <em> Apostles</em> , who, in relation to the Jews, were such the <strong> σοφοί</strong> <strong> ,</strong> Stephen and such like, men full of the Holy Ghost the <strong> γραμματεῖς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> Apollos, Paul (who indeed was all of these together), and such.
