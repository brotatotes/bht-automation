<p><strong> 23, 24.</strong> ] It was doubtful, whether Lev 27:30 applied to every smallest garden herb: but the Pharisees, in their over-rigidity in externals, stretched it to this, letting go the heavier, more difficult, and more important (see Mat 23:4 ) matters of the Law. In the threefold enumeration, our Lord refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mic+6:8">Micah 6:8</span> (see also Hos 12:6 ) where <em> to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God</em> , are described as being better than all offerings.

<p><strong> ταῦτα</strong> <strong> ,</strong> these last, are the great points on which your exertions should have ( ἔδει , <em> oportebat</em> ) been spent and then, if for the sake of these they be observed, the others should not be neglected. Stier gives an instance of this, in ( <em> Scripture</em> ) <em> philology</em> , which if it be applied in subjection to a worthy appreciation of the <em> sense and spirit of the Writer</em> , may profitably descend to the minutest details: but if the philologian begin and end with his ‘micrology,’ he incurs the μωρὲ καὶ τυφλέ of the Pharisees (ii. 515, edn. 1).

The “strain <em> at</em> a gnat” in our present auth. vers. for “strain <em> out</em> a gnat” of the earlier English vss., seems not to have been a mistake, as sometimes supposed, but a deliberate alteration, meaning, “strain (out the wine) at (the occurrence of) a gnat.” <strong> τόν</strong> and <strong> τήν</strong> indicate reference to a proverb or fable. The camel is not only <em> opposed</em> , as <em> of immense size</em> , but is also joined with the other, as being equally unclean.</p>
