<p><strong> 8 10.</strong> ] The prohibition is against loving, and in any religious matter, using such titles, signifying dominion over the faith of others. It must be understood in the spirit and not in the letter. Paul calls Timotheus his ‘ <em> son</em> ’ in the faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2">1 Timothy 1:2</span> , and exhorts the Corinthians ( 1Co 11:1 ) to be followers of him as he of Christ. To understand and follow such commands in the slavery of the letter, is to fall into the very Pharisaism against which our Lord is uttering the caution. See (e.g.) Barnes’s note here.

<p><strong> ῥαββί</strong> = רַבִּי , my master: an expression used, and reduplicated as here, by <em> scholars to their masters</em> , who were never called by their own name by their scholars. So the Lord says, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:13">John 13:13</span> , ὑμεῖς φωνεῖτέ με Ὁ διδάσκαλος κ . ὁ κύριος , καὶ καλῶς λέγετε , εἰμὶ γάρ . See Schöttgen, Hor. Heb. ii. 900. The Teacher is probably not <em> Christ</em> , as supplied here in the rec [161] ., but the Holy Spirit (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:33-34">Jeremiah 31:33-34</span> ; Eze 36:26-27 ), only <em> not here named</em> , because this promise was only given in private <em> to the disciples</em> . If this be so, we have God, in His Triunity, here declared to us as the only Father, Master, and Teacher of Christians; their πατήρ , καθηγητής (= ὁδηγὸς τυφλῶν Rom 2:19 ), and διδάσκαλος the only One, in all these relations, on whom they can rest or depend. They are all <em> brethren</em> : all substantially equal <em> none by office or precedence nearer to God than another; none standing between his brother and God</em> . ‘And the duty of all Christian teachers is to bring their hearers to the confession of the Samaritans in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:42">John 4:42</span> ; οὐκέτι διὰ τὴν σὴν λαλιὰν πιστεύομεν · αὐτοὶ γὰρ ἀκηκόαμεν , καὶ οἴδαμεν ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν ἀληθῶς ὁ σωτὴρ τοῦ κόσμου .’ (Olshausen, Shristuz der einige Meister, p. 10, cited by Stier, ii. 444.)
