<p><strong> 22.</strong> ] If God had not in his mercy shortened (by His decree, to which the aor. refers) those days ( ἡμέρας ἐκδικήσεως , Luk 21:2 ), <em> the whole nation</em> (in the ultimate fulfilment, <em> all</em> <em> flesh</em> ) would have perished: but for the sake of the chosen ones, the believing, or those who should believe, or perhaps the preservation of the chosen race whom God hath not cast off, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:1">Romans 11:1</span> , they shall be shortened. It appears that besides <em> the cutting short in the Divine counsels</em> , which must be hidden from us, various causes combined to shorten the siege. (1) Herod Agrippa had begun strengthening the walls of Jerusalem in a way which if finished would have rendered them πάσης ἀνθρωπίνης κρείττονα βίας , but was stopped by orders from Claudius, A.D. 42 or 43, Jos. Antt. xix. 7. 2. (2) The Jews, being divided into factions among themselves, had totally neglected any preparations to stand a siege. (3) The magazines of corn and provision were burnt just before the arrival of Titus; the words of Josephus are remarkable on this, κατακαῆναι δὲ πλὴν ὀλίγου πάντα τὸν σῖτον , ὃς ἂν αὐτοῖς οὐκ ἐπ ʼ ὀλίγα διήρκεσεν ἔτη πολιορκουμένοις , B. J. ver. 1. 5. (4) Titus arrived suddenly, and the Jews voluntarily abandoned parts of the fortification (B. J. vi. 8. 4). (5) Titus himself confessed, (B. J. vi. 9. 1,) σὺν θεῷ γ ʼ ἐπολεμήσαμεν , καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ τῶνδε τῶν ἐρυμάτων Ἰουδαίους καθελών , ἐπεὶ χεῖρές τε ἀνθρώπων ἢ μηχαναὶ τί πρὸς τούτους τοὺς πύργους δύνανται ; (The foregoing particulars are from Mr. Greswell, ver. 343 ff. note.) Some such providential shortening of the great days of tribulation, and hastening of God’s glorious Kingdom, is here promised for <em> the latter times</em> .</p>
