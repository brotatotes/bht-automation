<p><strong> 30.</strong> ] This <strong> τότε</strong> <strong> ,</strong> so emphatically placed and repeated, is a <em> definite declaration of time</em> , not a mere sign of sequence or coincidence, as e.g. in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:23">Matthew 24:23</span> : when these things shall have been somewhile filling men’s hearts with fear, THEN shall, &amp;c.
	</p>
<p>It is quite uncertain what the σημεῖον shall be: plainly, not <em> the Son of Man Himself</em> , as Some explain it (even Bengel, generally so valuable in his explanations, says ‘Ipse erit signum sui,’ and quotes Luk 2:12 as confirming this view; but there the swaddling clothes and the manger were the ‘sign,’ not the <em> child</em> ), nor <em> any outward marks on his body</em> , as his wounds; for both these would confuse what the prophecy keeps distinct the seeing of the <em> sign</em> of the Son of Man, and all tribes of the earth mourning, and afterwards seeing <em> the Son of Man Himself</em> . This is manifestly <em> some sign in the Heavens</em> , by which all shall know that the Son of Man is at hand The <em> Star of the Wise Men</em> naturally occurs to our thoughts but a <em> star</em> would not be a sign which all might read.

<p>On the whole I think no sign completely answers the conditions but that of <em> the Cross</em> : and accordingly we find the Fathers mostly thus explaining the passage. But as our Lord Himself does not answer the question, <strong> τί</strong> τὸ σημεῖον τῆς σῆς παρουσίας ; we may safely leave the matter. I mention, just to shew how sensible expositors can be misled by a false interpretation of the whole, Wetstein’s strange paraphrase of τὸ σημεῖον τ . υ . τ . ἀνθ ., ‘fumus Hierosolymorum incensorum, qui interdiu solem, nocte vero lunam et Stellas obscurat.’
