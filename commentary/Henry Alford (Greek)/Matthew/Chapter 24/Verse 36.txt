<p><strong> 36.</strong> ] <strong> ἡμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐκ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> viz. of heaven and earth passing away; or, perhaps referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span> ff.

<p><strong> ἡμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὥρ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> the exact time as we say, ‘the hour and minute.’ The very important addition to this verse in Mark, and in some ancient MSS. here (but see digest), <strong> οὐδὲ ὁ υἱός</strong> <strong> ,</strong> is indeed included in εἰ μὴ ὁ πατήρ [ μου ] μόνος , but could hardly have been inferred from it, had it not been expressly stated: ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:23">Matthew 20:23</span> . All attempts to soften or explain away this weighty truth must be resisted; it will not do to say with some Commentators, ‘nescit ea <em> nobis</em> ,’ which, however well meant, is a mere evasion: in the course of humiliation undertaken by the Son, in which He increased in wisdom ( Luk 2:52 ), learned obedience ( Heb 5:8 ), uttered desires in prayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:12">Luke 6:12</span> , &amp;c.), <em> this matter was hidden from Him</em> : and as I have already remarked, this is carefully to be borne in mind, in explaining the prophecy before us.</p>
