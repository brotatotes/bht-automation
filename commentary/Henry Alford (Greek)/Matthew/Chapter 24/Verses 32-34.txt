<p><strong> 32, 33, 34.</strong> ] <strong> τὴν παρ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> not as E. V., ‘ <em> a parable</em> ,’ but <strong> the</strong> (not, <em> its</em> : the fig-tree may teach many lessons besides this; cf. reff. Matt. Luke) <strong> parable,</strong> the natural phænomenon which may serve as a key to the meaning.
	</p>
<p>This coming of the Lord shall be as sure a sign that the Kingdom of Heaven is nigh, as the putting forth of the tender leaves of the fig-tree is a sign that summer is nigh. Observe πάντα ταῦτα , every one of these things, this coming of the Son of Man <em> included</em> , which will introduce the millennial Kingdom.
	</p>
<p>As regards the parable, there is a reference to the <em> withered fig-tree which the Lord cursed</em> : and as that, in its judicial unfruitfulness, emblematized the Jewish people, so here the putting forth of the fig-tree from its state of winter dryness, symbolizes the <em> future reviviscence</em> of that race, which the Lord ( Mat 24:34 ) declares shall not pass away till all be fulfilled. That this is the true meaning of that verse, must appear when we recollect that it forms the conclusion of this parable, and is itself joined by παρέλθῃ to the verse following. We cannot, in seeking for its ultimate fulfilment, <em> go back</em> to the taking of Jerusalem and make the words apply to it.
	</p>
<p>As this is one of the points on which the rationalizing interpreters (De Wette, &amp;c.) lay most stress to shew that the prophecy has <em> failed</em> , it may be well to shew that <strong> γενεά</strong> has in Hellenistic Greek the meaning of <em> a race or family of people</em> . See Jer 8:3 LXX; compare ch. Mat 23:36 with ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:35">Matthew 23:35</span> , ἐφονεύσατε … but <em> this generation</em> did not slay Zacharias so that the <em> whole people</em> are addressed: see also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:45">Matthew 12:45</span> , in which the meaning absolutely requires this sense (see note there): see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:25">Luke 17:25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:17">Matthew 17:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:8">Luke 16:8</span> (where γενεά is predicated both of the υἱοὶ τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου and the νἱοὶ τοῦ φωτός ): <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:40">Acts 2:40</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:15">Philippians 2:15</span> . In all these places γενεά is = γένος , or nearly so; having it is true a more pregnant meaning, implying that the character of one generation <em> stamps itself upon the race</em> , as here in this verse also.
	</p>
<p>This meaning of γενεά is fully conceded by Dorner; ‘omnes reor concessuros, vocem γ . si eam vertas <em> ætas</em> , multas easque plane insuperabiles ciere difficultates, contextum vero et orationis progressum flagitare significationem <em> gentis</em> , nempe Judæorum.’ (Stier, ii. 502.) The continued use of <strong> παρέρχομαι</strong> in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:34-35">Matthew 24:34-35</span> , should have saved the Commentators from the blunder of imagining that the then living generation was meant, seeing that the prophecy is by the next verse carried on to the end of all things: and that, as matter of fact, the Apostles and ancient Christians <em> did continue to expect the Lord’s coming, after that generation had part away</em> . But, as Stier well remarks, “there are men foolish enough now to say, heaven and earth will never pass away, but the words of Christ pass away in course of time ; of this, however, we wait the proof.” ii. 505.
