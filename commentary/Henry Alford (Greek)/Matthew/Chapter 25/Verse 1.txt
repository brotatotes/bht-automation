<p><strong> δέκα παρθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The subject of this parable is not, as of the last, the distinction between the faithful and unfaithful servants; no <em> outward</em> distinction here exists all are virgins all companions of the bride all furnished with brightly-burning lamps all, up to a certain time, fully ready to meet the Bridegroom the difference consists in <em> some having made a provision</em> for feeding the lamps in case of delay, and <em> the others none</em> and the moral of the parable is <em> the blessedness of endurance unto the end</em> . ‘In eo vertitur summa parabolæ, quod non satis est ad officium <em> semel</em> accinctos fuisse et paratos, nisi ad finem usque duremus.’ Calvin.

<p>There is no question here of apostasy, or unfaithfulness but of the <em> want of provision</em> to keep the light bright against the coming of the bridegroom however delayed.

<p><em> Ten</em> was a favourite number with the Jews <em> ten</em> men formed a congregation in a synagogue. In a passage from Rabbi Salomo, cited by Wetstein, he mentions ten lamps or torches as the usual number in marriage processions: see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:13">Luke 19:13</span> .

<p><strong> εἰς ὑπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] It would appear that these virgins had left their own homes, and were waiting somewhere for the bridegroom to come, probably at the house of the bride; for the object of the marriage procession was to <em> fetch the bride to the bridegroom’s house</em> . Meyer however supposes that in this case the wedding was to be <em> held</em> in the bride’s house, on account of the thing signified the coming of the Lord to his Church; but it is better to take the ordinary custom, and interpret accordingly, where we can. In both the wedding parables (see ch. 22.) the <em> bride</em> does not appear for she, being the Church, is in fact the aggregate of the guests in the one case, and of the companions in the other. We may perhaps say that she is here, in the strict interpretation, the Jewish Church, and these ten virgins Gentile congregations accompanying her. The reading καὶ τῆς νύμφης is probably an interpolation, such as are of frequent occurrence in [168] and its cognates.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [168] The CODEX CANTABRIGIENSIS, or BEZÆ, so called because it was presented by Beza in 1581 to the University Library at Cambridge; where it is now exposed to view in a glass case. He procured it in 1562, from the monastery of St. Irenæus at Lyons. It is on parchment, and contains the Gospels and Acts, with a Latin version. Its lacunæ, which are many, will be perceived by the inner marginal letters in this edition. It once contained the Catholic Epistles: 3Jn 1:11-14 in Latin is all that now remains. It was edited with very accurate imitative types, at the expense of the University of Cambridge, by Dr. Kipling, in 1793. A new edition carefully revised and more generally accessible was published by Mr. Scrivener in 1864, and has been collated for this Edition. In the introduction some ten or twelve correctors are distinguished, whose readings are found in the notes at the end of the volume. The text of the Codex Bezæ is a very peculiar one, deviating more from the received readings and from the principal manuscript authorities than any other. It appears to have been written in France, and by a Latin transcriber ignorant of Greek, from many curious mistakes which occur in the text, and version attached. It is closely and singularly allied to the ancient Latin versions, so much so that some critics have supposed it to have been altered from the Latin: and certainly many of the phænomena of the MS. seem to bear out the idea. Where D differs in unimportant points from the other Greek MSS., the difference appears to be traceable to the influence of Latin forms and constructions. It has been observed, that in such cases it frequently agrees with the Latin codex <em> e</em> (see the list further on). Its peculiarities are so great, that in many passages, while the sense remains for the most part unaltered, hardly three words together are the same as in the commonly received text. And that these variations often arise from capricious alteration, is evident from the way in which the Gospels, in parallel passages, have been more than commonly interpolated from one another in this MS. The concurrence with the ancient Latin versions seems to point to a very early state of the text; and it is impossible to set aside the value of D as an index to its history; but in critical weight it ranks the lowest of the leading MSS. Its age has been very variously given: the general opinion now is that it was written in the <em> latter end of the fifth or the sixth century</em> .

<p>This <strong> ἐξῆλθον</strong> is <em> not their final going out</em> in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span> , for only half of them did so, but <em> their leaving their own homes</em> : cf. λαβοῦσαι ἔλαβον , &amp;c. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:3-4">Matthew 25:3-4</span> . The interpretation is these are souls come out from the world into the Church, and there waiting for the coming of the Lord not hypocrites, but <em> faithful souls, bearing their lamps</em> ( τ . λ . ἑαυτῶν , cf. 1Th 4:4 ) the inner spiritual life fed with the oil of God’s Spirit (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:2-12">Zechariah 4:2-12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:38">Acts 10:38</span> ; Heb 1:9 ). All views of this parable which represent the foolish virgins as having only a <em> dead faith</em> , only the lamp without the light, the body without the spirit, &amp;c., are <em> quite beside the purpose</em> ; the lamps (see Mat 25:8 ) were <em> all burning</em> at first, and for a certain time.
