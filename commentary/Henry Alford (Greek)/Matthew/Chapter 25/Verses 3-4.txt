<p><strong> 3, 4.</strong> ] These were not torches, nor wicks fastened on staves, as some have supposed, but properly <em> lamps</em> : and the oil vessels (which is most important to the parable) were <em> separate from</em> the lamps. The lamps being the hearts lit with the flame of heavenly love and patience, supplied with the oil of the Spirit, now comes in the difference between the wise and foolish: the one <em> made no provision for the supply</em> of this the others <em> did</em> . How so? The wise ones <em> gave all diligence to make their calling and election sure</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:10">2 Peter 1:10</span> ; 2Pe 1:5-8 ), making their bodies, souls, and spirits (their <em> vessels</em> , 2Co 4:7 ) a means of supplying spiritual food for the light within, by seeking, in the appointed means of grace, more and more of Godâ€™s Holy Spirit. The others <em> did not this</em> but trusting that the light, once burning, would ever burn, made no provision for the strengthening of the inner man by watchfulness and prayer.</p>
