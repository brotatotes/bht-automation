<p><strong> 31 46.</strong> ] THE FINAL JUDGMENT OF ALL NATIONS. <em> Peculiar to Matthew</em> . In the two former parables we have seen the difference between, and judgment of, <em> Christians</em> in their inward readiness for their Lord, and their outward diligence in profiting by his gifts. And <em> both these had reference to that first resurrection and millennial Kingdom</em> , the reality of which is proved by the passages of Scripture cited in the notes above, and during which <em> all Christians</em> shall be judged. We now come to the great and universal judgment at the end of this period, also prophesied of distinctly in order in Rev 20:11-15 in which <em> all the dead</em> , small and great, shall stand before God. This last great judgment answers to the judgment on Jerusalem, <em> after</em> the Christians had escaped from it: to the gathering of the eagles (ministers of vengeance) to the carcase. Notice the precision of the words in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31">Matthew 25:31</span> , <strong> ὅταν δὲ ἔλθῃ</strong> the <strong> ὅταν</strong> setting forth the indefiniteness of the time the <strong> δέ</strong> the distinction from the two parables foregoing; and <strong> τότε</strong> <strong> ,</strong> to mark a precise time when all this shall take place a <em> day</em> of judgment.
	</p>
<p>Compare for the better understanding of the distinction, and connexion, of these ‘two comings’ of the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16-17">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:7-10">2 Thessalonians 1:7-10</span> .
	</p>
<p>This description is not a parable, though there are in it parabolic passages, e.g. ὥσπερ ὁ ποιμ . κ . τ . λ .: and for that very reason, that which is illustrated by those likenesses is <em> not itself parabolic</em> . It will heighten our estimation of the wonderful sublimity of this description, when we recollect that it was spoken by the Lord <em> only three days before His sufferings</em> .

<p><strong> ἐν τῇ δόξ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] This expression, repeated again at the end of the verse, is quite distinct from μετὰ δυνάμ . κ . δόξ . πολλῆς ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span> : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+20:11">Revelation 20:11</span> . This <em> His glory</em> is that also of all his saints, with whom He shall be accompanied: see Jude, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:14">Matthew 25:14</span> . In this his coming <em> they are with the angels</em> , and <em> as</em> the angels: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+19:14">Revelation 19:14</span> (compare Mat 25:8 ): <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:5">Zechariah 14:5</span> .</p>
