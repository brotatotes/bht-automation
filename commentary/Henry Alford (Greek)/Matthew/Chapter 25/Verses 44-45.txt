<p>The sublimity of this description surpasses all imagination Christ, as the Son of Man, the Shepherd, the King, the Judge as the centre and end of all human love, bringing out and rewarding his latent grace in those who have lived in love everlastingly punishing those who have quenched it in an unloving and selfish life and in the accomplishment of his mediatorial office, causing, even from out of the iniquities of a rebellious world, his sovereign mercy to rejoice against judgment.</p>
