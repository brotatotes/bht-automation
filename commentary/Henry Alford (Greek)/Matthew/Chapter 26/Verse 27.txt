<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] <strong> ἔδωκεν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> aor. He gave, not to each, but once for all: in remarkable coincidence with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:17">Luke 22:17</span> , λάβετε τοῦτο κ . διαμερίσατε ἑαυτοῖς . This was <em> after the meal was ended</em> : ὡσαύτως καὶ τὸ ποτήριον μετὰ τὸ δειπνῆσαι . (Luke and 1 Cor.) As remarked above, it is quite uncertain whether our Lord followed minutely the Jewish practices, and we cannot therefore say whether the cup was one of wine and water mixed. It hardly follows from the expression of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:29">Matthew 26:29</span> , ἐκ τούτου τοῦ γεν . τ . ἀμπ ., that it was of unmixed wine.

Calvin remarks: “Cur de pane simpliciter dixit ut ederent; de calice, ut <em> omnes</em> biberent? Ac si Satanæ calliditati ex destinato occurrere voluisset.” (Cited in Stier, vi. 115.) It is on all accounts probable, and this command confirms the probability, that Judas <em> was present</em> , and <em> partook of both parts</em> of this first communion. The expressions are such throughout as to lead us to suppose that the same persons, οἱ δώδεκα , were present. On the circumstance mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:30">John 13:30</span> , which has mainly contributed to the other opinion, see note there.</p>
