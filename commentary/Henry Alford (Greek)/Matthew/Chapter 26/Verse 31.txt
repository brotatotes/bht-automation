<p><strong> γέγραπται γάρ</strong> ] This is a very important citation, and has been much misunderstood; <em> how much</em> , may appear from Grotius’s remark: “Tantum abest ut Zachariæ verbis directe Christum putem respici, ut multo magis credam agi inibi de aliquo <em> non bono</em> pastore,” &amp;c. But, on the contrary, if we examine Zechariah 11-13., we must I think come to the conclusion that the shepherd spoken of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:7-14">Matthew 11:7-14</span> , who is <em> rejected</em> and <em> sold</em> , who is said to have been <em> pierced</em> ( Mat 12:10 ), is also spoken of in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:7">Matthew 13:7</span> . Stier (Reden Jesu, vi. 176 ff.) has gone at length into the meaning of the whole prophecy, and especially that of the word עֲמִיתִי , ‘my fellow,’ and shewn that the reference can be to <em> no other than the Messiah</em> . The citation agrees verbatim with the LXX-A, except that πάταξον is changed into πατάξω God who <em> commands the striking</em> , into God who <em> Himself strikes</em> .</p>
