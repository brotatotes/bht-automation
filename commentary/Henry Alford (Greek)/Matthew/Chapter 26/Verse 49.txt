<p><strong> 49. </strong> <strong> εὐθέως</strong> ] see above on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:47">Matthew 26:47</span> . The <em> purpose</em> of the kiss, supposing it to have taken place <em> after</em> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:1-54">John 4:1-54</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1-47">John 5:1-47</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:1-71">John 6:1-71</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:1-53">John 7:1-53</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:1-59">John 8:1-59</span> , (and it is surely out of the question to suppose it to have taken place before, contrary to the plain meaning of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:4">John 18:4</span> ,) has been doubted. Yet I think on a review of what had happened, it is very intelligible not perhaps as some have supposed, to shew that Jesus could be approached with safety but at all events as the <em> sign agreed on</em> with the Roman soldiers, who probably did not personally know Him, and who besides would have had their orders from the city, to take Him whom Judas should kiss. Thus the kiss would be necessary in the course of their military duty, as their authorization, notwithstanding the previous declaration by Jesus of Himself.

<p><strong> κατεφ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is hardly as in my earlier editions, another word for ἐφίλ . It may well have its common and proper meaning, ‘Kissed him eagerly,’ with ostentation, as a studied and prearranged sign. See Ellicott, Lectures on the Life of our Lord, p. 331 note: and comp. Xenophon, Mem. ii. 6. 33, cited by Meyer, ὡς τοὺς καλοὺς φιλήσοντός μου , τοὺς δ ʼ ἀγαθοὺς καταφιλήσαντος .</p>
