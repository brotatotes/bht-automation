<p><strong> 51.</strong> ] The <strong> εἷς</strong> (or εἷς τις of Luke) was <em> Peter</em> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:10">John 18:10</span> . Why he was not mentioned, is idle to enquire: one supposition only must be avoided that there is any <em> purpose</em> in the omission. It is absurd to suppose that the mention of his name in a book current only among Christians, many years after the fact, could lead to his apprehension, which did not take place <em> at the time</em> , although he was recognized as the striker in the palace of the High-priest, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:26">John 18:26</span> . The real reason of the non-apprehension was, that the servant was <em> healed</em> by the Lord.

<p>This is the first opposition to ‘Thy will be done.’ Luke expresses it, that they <em> saw what would happen</em> and asked, ‘Lord, shall we smite with the sword?’ Then, while the other (for there were but two swords in the company) was waiting for the reply, the rash Peter, in the very spirit of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:22">Matthew 16:22</span> , smote with the sword the weapon of the flesh: an outbreak of the natural man no less noticeable than that more-noticed one which followed before morning. All four Evangelists agree in this account. Luke and John are most exact the latter giving the name of the slave, Malchus.

<p>The aim was a deadly one, and Peter narrowly escaped being one ὅστις ἐν τῇ στάσει φόνον πεποιήκει . From <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:51">Luke 22:51</span> , we learn that our Lord said ἐᾶτε ἕως τούτου (on the meaning of which see note there), touched the ear and healed it.
