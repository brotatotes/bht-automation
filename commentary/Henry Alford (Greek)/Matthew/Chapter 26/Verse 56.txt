<p><strong> 56.</strong> ] It is doubted whether these words are a continuation of our Lord’s speech, or a remark inserted by Matthew. The use of τοῦτο δὲ ὅλον γέγονεν in this Gospel would lead us to the latter conclusion: but when we reflect that thus our Lord’s speech would lose all its completeness, and that Mark gives in different words the speech going on to this same purport, we must I think decide for the other view. Besides, if the remark were Matthew’s, we should expect some particular citation, as is elsewhere his practice: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:22">Matthew 1:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:4">Matthew 21:4</span> . Mark gives it elliptically, ἀλλ ʼ ἵνα πληρωθῶσιν αἱ γραφαί . The Passion and Death of Christ were especially ἡ τῶν γραφῶν πλήρωσις . In this they all found their central point. Compare his dying word on the Cross, τετέλεσται , with this his assertion. On the addition in Luke, see note there.

Chrys.’s remark is worth noting: ὅτε μὲν γὰρ κατεσχέθη , ἔμενον · ὅτε δὲ ἐφθέγξατο ταῦτα πρὸς τούς ὄχλους , ἔφυγον · εἶδον γὰρ λοιπόν , ὅτι οὐκ ἔτι διαφυγεῖν ἔνι , ἑκόντος ἑαυτὸν παραδόντος αὐτοῖς καὶ λέγοντος κατὰ τὰς γραφὰς τοῦτο γίνεσθαι .</p>
