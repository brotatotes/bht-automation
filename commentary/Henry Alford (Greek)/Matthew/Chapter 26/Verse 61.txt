<p><strong> 61.</strong> ] See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:40">Matthew 27:40</span> : the <em> false witness</em> consisted in <em> giving that sense to His words</em> , which it appears by ch. Mat 27:63 they <em> knew they did not bear</em> . There is perhaps a trace, in the <em> different reports</em> of Matt. and Mark, of the <em> discrepancy between the witnesses</em> . There is considerable difference between τὸν ναὸν τοῦ θ .… οἰκοδομῆσαι and τὸν ν . τοῦτον τὸν χειροποίητον .… ἄλλον ἀχειροποίητον . The instance likewise of his zeal <em> for the honour of the temple</em> which had so lately occurred, might tend to perplex the evidence produced to the contrary.</p>
