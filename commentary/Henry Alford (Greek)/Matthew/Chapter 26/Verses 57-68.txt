<p><strong> 57 68.</strong> ] HEARING BEFORE CAIAPHAS. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:53-65">Mark 14:53-65</span> . (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:54">Luke 22:54</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:63-65">Luke 22:63-65</span> .) <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:24">John 18:24</span> . Previous to this took place a hearing <em> before</em> Annas, the <em> real</em> High-priest (see note on Luk 3:2 ), to whom the Jews took Jesus first; who enquired of Him about his disciples and his teaching ( Joh 18:19-23 ), and then ( Joh 18:24 ) sent Him bound to Caiaphas. Only John, <em> who followed</em> , relates this first hearing. See notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:12-24">John 18:12-24</span> , where this view is maintained. It may be sufficient here just to indicate the essential differences between <em> that</em> hearing and <em> this</em> . On that occasion no witnesses were required, for it was merely a private unofficial audience. Then the High-priest questioned and our Lord replied: whereas now, under false witness and reproach, He (as before Herod) is silent.</p>
