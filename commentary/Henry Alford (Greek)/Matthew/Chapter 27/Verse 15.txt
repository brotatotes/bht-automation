<p><strong> 15. </strong> <strong> κατὰ ἑορτήν</strong> ] <strong> feast by feast;</strong> i.e. at every feast. This distributive force of κατά is found both in local and temporal connexions: e.g. κατ ʼ οἶκον , house by house, κατ ʼ ἄνδρα , man by man, καθ ʼ ἡμέραν , day by day. See Bernhardy, Syntax, p. 240 f.
	</p>
<p>We have no other historic mention of this practice. Livy ( Mat 27:13 ) says of the feast of the Lectisternium, ‘vinctis quoque dempta in eos dies vincula.’</p>
