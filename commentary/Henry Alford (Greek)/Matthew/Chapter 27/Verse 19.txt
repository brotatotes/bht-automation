<p><strong> ἡ γυνὴ αὐτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] It had become the custom in Augustus’s time for the governors of provinces to take their wives with them abroad; Cæcina attempted to pass a law forbidding it (Tacit. Ann. iii. 33 ff.), but was vehemently opposed (by Drusus among others) and put down. We know nothing more of this woman than is here related. Tradition gives her the name of Procla or Claudia Procula. In the Gospel of Nicodemus, c. 2, we read that Pilate called the Jews and said to them, οἴδατε ὅτι ἡ γυνή μου θεοσεβής ἐστιν , καὶ μᾶλλον ἰουδαίζει σὺν ὑμῖν . λέγουσιν αὐτῷ Ναί , οἴδαμεν .
