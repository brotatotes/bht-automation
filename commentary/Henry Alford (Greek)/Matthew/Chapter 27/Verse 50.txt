<p><strong> 50.</strong> ] It has been doubted whether the τετέλεσται of John ( Joh 19:30 ) and πάτερ , εἰς χ . σου παρατίθεμαι τ . πν . μου of Luke ( Luk 19:46 ) are to be <em> identified with this crying out</em> , or to be taken as <em> distinct from it</em> . But a nearer examination of the case will set the doubt at rest. The παρέδωκεν of John (ib.) <em> implies the speech in Luke</em> ; which accordingly was that uttered in this φωνὴ μεγάλη . The τετέλεσται was said before: see notes on John.</p>
