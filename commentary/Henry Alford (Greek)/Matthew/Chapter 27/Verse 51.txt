<p><strong> 51.</strong> ] The <strong> ἰδού</strong> gives solemnity. This was the <em> inner veil</em> , screening off the holy of holies from the holy place, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+26:33">Exodus 26:33</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:2-3">Hebrews 9:2-3</span> . This circumstance has given rise to much incredulous comment, and that even from men like Schleiermacher. A right and deep view of the O.T. symbolism is required to furnish the key to it; and for this we look in vain among those who <em> set aside that symbolism entirely</em> .

<p>That was now accomplished, which was the one and great antitype of all those sacrifices offered in the holy place, <em> in order to gain</em> , as on the great day of atonement (for that day may be taken as the representation of their intent), <em> entrance into the holiest place</em> , <em> the typical presence of God</em> . What those sacrifices (ceremonially) procured for the Jews (the type of God’s universal Church) through their High-priest, was now (really) procured for all men by the sacrifice of Him, who was at once the victim and the High-priest. When Schleiermacher and De Wette assert that no use is made of this event in the Epistle to the Hebrews, they surely cannot have remembered, or not have deeply considered, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19-21">Hebrews 10:19-21</span> . Besides, suppose it <em> had</em> been referred to plainly and by name what would then have been said? Clearly, that <em> this</em> mention was <em> a later insertion, to justify that reference</em> . And <em> almost</em> this latter, Strauss, <em> recognizing the allusion in Heb.</em> , actually does. Schleiermacher also asks, <em> how could the event be known</em> , seeing none but priests could have witnessed it, and they would not be likely to betray it? To say nothing of the <em> almost certain spread of the rumour</em> , has he forgotten that ( Act 6:7 ) “a <em> great company of the priests</em> were obedient unto the faith?” Neander, who gives this last consideration its weight (but only as a possibility, that <em> some</em> priests may have become converts, and apparently without reference to the above fact), has an unworthy and shuffling note (L. J. p. 757), ending by quoting two testimonies, one apocryphal, the other Rabbinical, from which he concludes that ‘ <em> some</em> matter of fact lies at the foundation’ of this (according to him) <em> mythical adjunct</em> .

<p><strong> αἱ πέτραι ἐσχίσθησαν</strong> ] It would not be right altogether to reject the testimonies of travellers to the fact of extraordinary rents and fissures in the rocks near the spot. Of course those who know no other proof of the historical truth of the event, will not be likely to take this as one; but to us, who are firmly convinced of it, every such trace, provided it be soberly and honestly ascertained, is full of interest.</p>
