<p><strong> 52. </strong> <strong> καὶ τὰ μν</strong> <strong> …</strong> to end of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:53">Matthew 27:53</span> <strong> .</strong> ] The first clause, as following on an earthquake which splits the rocks, is by the modern Commentators received as genuine, and thrown into the same probability as the earthquake itself: but the following ones meet with no mercy at their hands. <em> Gin mythisch apokryphischer Unsass</em> is Meyer’s description of them and as he cannot find any <em> critical</em> ground for this, the <em> Greek Editor of Matthew</em> has the blame of <em> having added them</em> . I believe on the contrary that these latter clauses contain <em> the occasion of the former ones</em> . The whole transaction was <em> supernatural</em> and <em> symbolic</em> : no other interpretation of it will satisfy even ordinary common sense. Was the earthquake a <em> mere coincidence!</em> This not even those assert, who deny all symbolism in the matter. Was it a mere <em> sign of divine wrath</em> at what was done a mere <em> prodigy</em> , like those at the death of Cæsar? Surely no Christian believer can think this. Then <em> what was it?</em> What but the <em> opening of the tombs</em> the symbolic declaration ‘ <em> mors janua vitæ</em> ,’ that <em> the death</em> which had happened had broken the bands of death for ever? These following clauses (which have no mythical nor apocryphal character ἐνεφανίσθησαν <strong> πολλοῖς</strong> , and no more, is not the way of any but authentic history: see the Gospel of Nicodemus, ch. xvii. ff. in Jones’s Canon of the N.T. vol. ii. p. 255) require only this explanation to be fully understood. The graves were opened <em> at the moment of the death</em> of the Lord; but inasmuch as He is the first-fruits from the dead <em> the</em> Resurrection and the Life the bodies of the saints in them <em> did not arise till He rose</em> , and having appeared to many after his resurrection, possibly during the forty days, went up with Him into his glory. (Cf. on this Corn.-a-Lap., h. l.: who maintains that this was so, for five reasons: 1) “quia hoc decebat Christum, ut fructum mortis et resurrectionis suæ statim ostenderet in beata hac Sanctorum resurrectione: 2) quia animæ horum jam erant beatæ, ac proinde par erat eas non uniri corporibus nisi gloriosis et immortalibus: 3) quia exigua fuisset earum felicitas, ac longe major miseria, quod mox rursum deberent mori: 4) quia congruebat, ut hi Sancti Christum resurgentem et scandentem in cœlum, ejusque triumphum sua resurrectione decorarent: 5) quia convenit ut Christus in cœlo habeat Beatos quorum aspectu et collocutione externa se pascat humanitas, ne alioqui solitaria sit, expersque humanæ consolationis.” On this side, he claims Orig [185] (in Matt. Comm. series, vol. iii. p. 928; but wrongly, for Origen gives the whole a spiritual sense, more suo), Jerome, Bede, Thos. Aquinas, Anselm, Clem. Alex [186] (Strom. vi. 47, p. 764 [187] .), Euseb. (Dem. Evang. iv. 12, vol. iv. p. 284), Epiph [188] (Hær. lxxv. p. 911), a [189] . On the other side are Thl., Euthym [190] , Aug [191] (Ep. 164 (99) ad Evod. 3 (2) vol. ii.), alli [192] . Augustine is moved chiefly by the fact that David’s body appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:29">Acts 2:29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:34">Acts 2:34</span> , to have been still in his tomb after the Ascension.) Moses and Elias, who were before in glory, were not <em> from the dead</em> , properly speaking: see note on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:1">Matthew 17:1</span> .

<p>The explanation (Fritzsche) of <strong> μετὰ τὴν ἔγερσιν αὐτοῦ</strong> as ‘ <em> after He had raised them</em> ,’ is simply ridiculous. The words belong to the <em> whole sentence</em> , not merely to εἰσῆλθον .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἠγέρθησαν</strong> is the <em> result</em> not the <em> immediate accompaniment</em> , of the opening of the tombs. It is to prevent this being supposed, that the qualification μετ . τ . ἔ . αὐ . is added.</p>
