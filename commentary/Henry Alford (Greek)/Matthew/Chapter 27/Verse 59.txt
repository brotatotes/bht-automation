<p><strong> 59.</strong> ] John ( Joh 19:39 ) mentions <em> the arrival of Nicodemus</em> with an hundred pound weight of myrrh and aloes, in which also the Body was wrapped. The Three are not in possession of this nor Matthew and John of the subsequent design of the women to embalm It. What wonder if, at such a time, one party of disciples should not have been aware of the doings of another? It is possible that the women, who certainly <em> knew what had been done</em> with the Body (see Mat 27:61 ), may have intended to bestow on it more elaborate care, as whatever was done this night was <em> hurried</em> , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:41-42">John 19:41-42</span> .</p>
