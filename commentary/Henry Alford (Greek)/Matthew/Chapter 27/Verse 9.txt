<p><strong> 9.</strong> ] The citation is not from Jeremiah (see ref.), and is probably quoted from memory and unprecisely; we have similar instances in two places in the apology of Stephen, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:4">Acts 7:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:16">Acts 7:16</span> , and in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:26">Mark 2:26</span> . Various means of evading this have been resorted to, which are not worth recounting. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+18:1-2">Jeremiah 18:1-2</span> , or perhaps <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+32:6-12">Jeremiah 32:6-12</span> , may have given rise to it: or it may have arisen from a Jewish idea (see Wordsw. h. l.), “Zechariam habuisse spiritum Jeremiæ.” The quotation here is very different from the LXX, which see, and not much more like the Hebrew. I put it to any faithful Christian to say, whether of the two presents the greater obstacle to his faith, the solution given above, or that in Wordsw.’s note, that the name of one prophet is here substituted for that of another, to teach us not to regard the prophets as the <em> authors</em> of their prophecies, but to trace them to divine Inspiration.</p>
