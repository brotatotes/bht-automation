<p><strong> 3 10.</strong> ] REMORSE AND SUICIDE OF JUDAS. <em> Peculiar to Matthew</em> . This incident does not throw much light on the motives of Judas. One thing we learn for certain that our Lord’s being condemned, which he inferred from His being handed over to the Roman governor, <em> worked in him remorse</em> , and that <em> suicide was the consequence</em> . Whether this condemnation was <em> expected</em> by him or not, does not here appear; nor have we any means of ascertaining, except from the former sayings of our Lord respecting him. I cannot (see note on ch. Mat 26:14 ) believe that his intent was other than sordid gain to be achieved by the darkest treachery. To suppose that the condemnation <em> took him by surprise</em> , seems to me to be inconsistent with the spirit of his own confession, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:4">Matthew 27:4</span> . There <strong> παραδοὺς αἷμα ἀθῷον</strong> expresses his <em> act</em> his <em> accomplished purpose</em> . The bitter feeling in him now is expressed by ἥμαρτον , of which he is vividly and dreadfully conscious, now that the result has been attained.</p>
