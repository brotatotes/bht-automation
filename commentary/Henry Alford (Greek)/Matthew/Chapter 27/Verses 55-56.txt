<p><strong> ἡ Μαγδ</strong> <strong> ., from Magdala:</strong> see note on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:39">Matthew 15:39</span> . She is not to be confounded with Mary who anointed our Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span> , nor with the woman who did the same, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:36">Luke 7:36</span> ; see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:2">Luke 8:2</span> .

<p><strong> μήτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> υἱ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ζ</strong> <strong> .</strong> = Σαλώμη Mark. Both <em> omit Mary the mother of Jesus</em> : but we must remember, that if we are to take the group as described at this moment, <em> she was not present</em> , having been, as I believe (see note on Joh 19:27 ), led away by the beloved Apostle immediately on the speaking of the words, ‘Behold thy mother.’ And if this view be objected to, yet she could not be named here, nor in Mark, except separately from these three for she could not well have been one of the διακονοῦσαι αὐτῷ .
	</p>
<p>There must have been also <em> another group</em> , of His <em> disciples</em> , within sight; e.g. Thomas, who said, ‘Except I see in his hands the print of the nails,’ &amp;c., and generally those to whom He afterwards shewed his hands and feet as a proof of his identity.</p>
