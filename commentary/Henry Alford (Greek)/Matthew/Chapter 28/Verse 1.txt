<p><strong> 1. </strong> <strong> ὀψὲ δὲ σαβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] not, ‘ <em> at the end of the week</em> .’ The words σαββάτων and μίαν σαββ . are opposed, both being <em> days</em> . <strong> At the end of the Sabbath.</strong> There is some little difficulty here, because the end of the sabbath (and of the week) was at <em> sunset the night before</em> . It is hardly to be supposed that St. Matthew means the <em> evening</em> of the sabbath, though ἐπέφωσκε is used of the day beginning at sunset (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:54">Luke 23:54</span> , and note). It is best to interpret a doubtful expression in unison with the other testimonies, and to suppose that here both the <em> day</em> and the <em> breaking of the day</em> are taken in their <em> natural</em> , not their <em> Jewish</em> sense.
	</p>
<p><strong> μίαν σαβ</strong> . is a Hebraism; the Rabbinical writings use אהד , שני , שלישי , &amp;c., affixing בשבת to each, for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, &amp;c.

<p><strong> Μαρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡ Μ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡ ἄλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Μ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] In Mark, <em> Salome also</em> . John speaks of <em> Mary Magdalene alone</em> . see notes there.

<p><strong> θεωρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] It was to <em> anoint</em> the Body, for which purposes they had bought, since the end of the Sabbath, ointments and spices, Mark.
	</p>
<p>In Mark it is <em> after the rising of the sun</em> ; in John, <em> while yet dark</em> ; in Luke, <em> at dim dawn</em> : the two last agree with our text.</p>
