<p><strong> 1 10.</strong> ] JESUS HAVING RISEN FROM THE DEAD, APPEARS TO THE WOMEN. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:1-8">Mark 16:1-8</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:1-10">2 John 1:1-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:1-10">2 John 1:1-10</span><span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:1-10">2 John 1:1-10</span> . The independence and distinctness of the four narratives in this part have never been questioned, and indeed herein lie its principal difficulties. With regard to them, I refer to what I have said in the Prolegomena, that <em> supposing us to be acquainted with every thing said and done, in its order and exactness, we should doubtless be able to reconcile, or account for, the present forms of the narratives</em> ; but not having this key to the harmonizing of them, all attempts to do so in minute particulars must be full of arbitrary assumptions, and carry no certainty with them. And I may remark, that <em> of all harmonies</em> , those of <em> the incidents of these chapters</em> are to me the <em> most unsatisfactory</em> . Giving their compilers all credit for the best intentions, I confess they seem to me to <em> weaken</em> instead of strengthening the evidence, which now rests (speaking merely <em> objectively</em> ) on the unexceptionable testimony of three independent narrators, and of one, who besides was an eye-witness of much that happened. If we are to compare the four, and ask which is to be taken as most nearly reporting the <em> exact</em> words and incidents, on this there can I think be no doubt. On internal as well as external ground, <em> that of John</em> takes the <em> highest place</em> : but not, of course, to the exclusion of those parts of the narrative which he <em> does not touch</em> .
	</p>
<p>The <em> improbability</em> that the Evangelists had seen one anotherâ€™s accounts, becomes, in <em> this part</em> of their Gospels, an <em> impossibility</em> . Here and there we discern traces of a common narration as the ground of their reports, as e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1-48">Matthew 5:1-48</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1-34">Matthew 6:1-34</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:1-29">Matthew 7:1-29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:1-34">Matthew 8:1-34</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:1-43">Mark 5:1-43</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:1-56">Mark 6:1-56</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:1-37">Mark 7:1-37</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:1-38">Mark 8:1-38</span> , but even these are very few.
	</p>
<p>As I have abandoned all idea of harmonizing throughout, I will beg the student to compare carefully the notes on the other Gospels.</p>
