<p><strong> 14. </strong> <strong> διεκώλυεν</strong> ] A much stronger word than κωλύω , implying the active and earnest preventing, with the gesture or hand, or voice, as here. The imperfect tense conveys, not that he <em> endeavoured</em> merely to hinder Him (see Hermann’s note on Soph. Ajax, 1105), but <em> began</em> to hinder Him, <strong> was hindering Him.

<p>There is only an <em> apparent</em> inconsistency between the speech of John in this sense, and the assertion made by him in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:33">John 1:33</span> , ‘I knew him not.’ Let us regard the matter in this light: John begins his ministry by a commission from God, who also admonishes him, that He, whose Forerunner he was, would be in time revealed to him by a special sign. Jesus comes to be baptized by him. From the nature of his relationship to our Lord, he could not but know those events which had accompanied his birth, and his subsequent life of holy and unblameable purity and sanctity. My impression from the words of this verse certainly is, that he <em> regarded Him as the Messiah</em> . Still, his belief wanted that full and entire assurance which the occurrence of the predicted sign gave him, which the word ᾔδειν implies, and which would justify him in announcing Him to his disciples as the Lamb of God. See the ancient opinions in Maldonatus’s note.</p>
