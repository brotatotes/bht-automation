<p><strong> 2. </strong> <strong> μετανοεῖτε</strong> ] Used by the Baptist in the O.T. sense of <em> turning to God as His people</em> , from the spiritual idolatry and typical adultery in which the faithless among the Jews were involved. This, of course, included personal amendment in individuals. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:10-14">Luke 3:10-14</span> . Josephus describes John, Antt. xviii. 5. 2, as τοὺς Ἰουδαίους κελεύοντα ἀρετὴν ἐπασκοῦντας καὶ τῇ πρὸς ἀλλήλους δικαιοσύνῃ καὶ πρὸς τὸν θεὸν εὐσεβείᾳ χρωμένους βαπτισμῷ συνιέναι .

<p><strong> ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν</strong> ] An expression peculiar in the N.T. to St. Matthew. The more usual one is ἡ βασ . τοῦ θεοῦ : but ἡ β . τῶν οὐρ . is common in the Rabbinical writers, who do not however, except in one or two places, mean by it <em> the reign of the Messiah</em> , but <em> the Jewish religion</em> the <em> theocracy</em> . Still, from the use of it by St. Matthew here, and in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:17">Matthew 4:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:7">Matthew 10:7</span> , we may conclude that it was used by the Jews, and understood, to mean <em> the advent of the Christ</em> , probably from the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+2:44">Daniel 2:44</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13-14">Daniel 7:13-14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+7:27">Daniel 7:27</span> .

<p>It has been observed by recent critics, that wherever the term βασ . τ . οὐρ . (or its equivalent) is used in the N.T., it signifies, not the Church, nor the Christian religion, but strictly the <em> kingdom of the Messiah which is to be revealed hereafter</em> . I should doubt this being <em> exclusively</em> true. The state of Christian men <em> now</em> is undoubtedly a part of the bringing in of the kingdom of Christ, and, as such, is included in this term. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:34">Mark 12:34</span> , and note on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span> .</p>
