<p><strong> 1. </strong> <strong> ἀνήχθη εἰς τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἔ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The Spirit carried Him away, (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:39">Acts 8:39</span> ,) αὐτὸν ἐκβάλλει , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:12">Mark 1:12</span> ; compare Chrysostom’s excellent remarks on this agency of the Holy Spirit, in the opening of his 13th homily, p. 167. Had St. Luke’s ἤγετο ἐν τῷ πν . been our <em> only</em> account, we might have supposed what took place to have been done <em> in a vision:</em> but the expressions in the two other Evangelists, entirely preclude this. The <em> desert</em> here spoken of may either be the traditional place of the Temptation near Jericho (thence called <em> Quarantaria:</em> it is described in “The Land and the Book,” p. 617, as a high and precipitous mountain, with its side facing the plain perpendicular, and apparently as high as the rock of Gibraltar, and with caverns midway below, hewn in the rock), or as scripture parallelism between Moses, Elias, and our Lord, leads one to think, the <em> Arabian desert of Sinai</em> .

<p><strong> πειρασθῆναι</strong> ] The express <em> purpose</em> of ἀνήχθη . No other rendering is even grammatical. Hence it is evident that our Lord at this time was not ‘led up’ of his own will and design, but as a part of the conflict with the Power of Darkness, He was <em> brought</em> to the Temptation. As He had been subject to his earthly parents at Nazareth, so now He is subject, in the outset of His official course, to his Heavenly Parent, and is by His will thus carried up to be tempted. In reverently considering the nature and end of this temptation, we may observe, (1) That the whole is <em> undoubtedly an objective historical narrative</em> , recording an actual conflict between our Redeemer and the Power of Evil. (2) That it is undetermined by the <em> letter</em> of the sacred text, whether the Tempter appeared <em> in a bodily shape</em> , or, <em> as a spirit</em> , was permitted to exert a certain power, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:5">Matthew 4:5</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:8">Matthew 4:8</span> , over the person of our Lord, even as the Holy Spirit did in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:1">Matthew 4:1</span> . If the latter were the case, the words spoken at the various stages of the temptation, were suggested by this Evil Power to the soul of our Redeemer. But (3) such an interpretation, while it cannot justly be accused of unreality by any who do not reject belief in the spiritual world, hardly meets the expressions of the text, προσελθών <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:3">Matthew 4:3</span> , ἐὰν πεσὼν προσκυνήσῃς μοι <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:9">Matthew 4:9</span> , and ἀφίησιν αὐτόν <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:11">Matthew 4:11</span> . Nor do the two members of Mat 4:11 correspond to one another in this case, for the ἄγγελοι must have been visible and corporeal, as in the parallel case at Gethsemane, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:43">Luke 22:43</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> διαβόλου</strong> ] The <em> accuser</em> , or <em> adversary:</em> <strong> Satan.</strong> Not any <em> human</em> tempter or foe: no example can be adduced of a <em> man</em> being absolutely called <strong> ὁ</strong> διάβ . In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:70">John 6:70</span> , Judas is by our Lord called διάβ ., which is the generic substantive without the article; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="es+7:4">Esther 7:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="es+8:1">Esther 8:1</span> , Haman is called ὁ διάβολος , where the art. has no such meaning as would be here required.</p>
