<p><strong> 3. </strong> <strong> καὶ προσελθών</strong> ] From the words of both St. Mark and St. Luke, it appears that our Lord was tempted <em> also during the forty days</em> . Whether the words of St. Mark, ἦν μετὰ τῶν θηρίων , allude to <em> one kind</em> of temptation, is uncertain: see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:13">Mark 1:13</span> . The word προσελθ . need not be understood of the <em> first</em> approach, but the first <em> recorded</em> ‘at a certain time the tempter approaching, &amp;c.’
	</p>
<p><strong> ὁ πειράζων</strong> <strong> ,</strong> ‘the tempter.’ Here first we find the N.T. meaning of πειράζειν , <em> to solicit to sin</em> , which does not occur in the LXX, nor in the classics. The use of the pres. part. with the art., as denoting employ, or office, is very common. See, among other places, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:36-37">John 4:36-37</span> , and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:3">Matthew 13:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:46">Matthew 26:46</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:48">Matthew 26:48</span> . Cf. Winer, § 18. 3.

<p><strong> εἰ</strong> ] νομίζων ὑποκλέπτειν αὐτὸν τοῖς ἐγκωμίοις , Chrys. Or, as Euthymius, ᾤετο ὅτι παρακνισθήσεται τῷ λόγῳ , καθάπερ ὀνειδισθεὶς ἐπὶ τῷ μὴ εἶναι υἱὸς θεοῦ . At all events, there is no <em> doubt</em> expressed, as Wolf and Bengel think.
	</p>
<p><strong> υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ</strong> ] In the N.T. are found <em> three combinations</em> of these two substantives and the article, and <em> all with one and the same meaning</em> , viz. THE SON OF GOD, in the highest and Messianic sense. (1) The expression in the text, of which our Lord says, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:36">John 10:36</span> , ὃν ὁ Πατὴρ ἡγίασεν καὶ ἀπέστειλεν εἰς τὸν κόσμον ὑμεῖς λέγετε ὅτι βλασφημεῖς ὅτι εἶπον <strong> Υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ</strong> εἰμι ; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:40">Matthew 27:40</span> . (2) ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θ . In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:35">John 9:35</span> , we read, σὺ πιστεύεις εἰς <strong> τὸυ υἱὸν τοῦ θεοῦ</strong> <strong> ;</strong> … ὁ λαλῶν μετὰ σοῦ <strong> ἐκεῖνός</strong> ἐστιν . (3) υἱὸς θ . In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:35">Luke 1:35</span> , τὸ γεννώμενον ἅγιον κληθήσεται <strong> υἱὸς θεοῦ</strong> <strong> .</strong> See also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:54">Matthew 27:54</span> ( [28] Mk.), and notes there and on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:47">Luke 23:47</span> .
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [28] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .</p>
