<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] Our Lord does not give way to the temptation, so as to meet him with an open declaration, ‘I am the Son of God:’ thus indeed He might have asserted his Lordship over him, but not have been <em> his Conqueror for us</em> . The first word which He uses against him, reaches far deeper: ‘ <em> Man</em> shall not live, &amp;c.’ “This, like the other text, is taken from the history of Israel’s temptation in the wilderness: for Israel represents, in a foreshadowing type, the Son of Man, the servant of God for Righteousness, the one ἐρχόμενος , in whom alone that nature which in all men has degenerated into sin, πληροῖ πᾶσαν δικαιοσύνην . Adam stood not, Israel according to the flesh stood not, when the Lord their God tempted them: but rather, after Satan’s likeness, tempted their God: but now the second Adam is come, the true Israel, by whose obedience the <em> way of life</em> is again made known and opened ‘that man truly liveth on and in the eternal word of God.’ ” Stier’s Reden Jesu, vol. i. p. 16 (edn. 2). Observe also how our Lord resists Satan <em> in His humanity;</em> at once here numbering Himself with <em> men</em> , by adducing ὁ ἄνθρωπος as including His own case; and not only so, but thus speaking out the mystery of his humiliation, in which He had foregone his divine Power, of his own will. By ‘ <em> every word</em> (or ‘ <em> thing</em> ,’ for ῥῆμα is not expressed in the original) <em> that proceedeth out of the mouth of God</em> ,’ we must understand, <em> every arrangement of the divine will;</em> God, who ordinarily sustains by <em> bread</em> , can, if it please Him, sustain <em> by any other means</em> , as in the case alluded to.
