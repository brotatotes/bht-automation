<p><strong> δείκνυσιν αὐτ. π. τ. β</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The additional words in Luke, ἐν στιγμῇ χρόνου , are valuable as pointing out to us clearly the supernatural character of this vision. If it be objected, that in that case there was no need for the ascent of the mountain, I answer, that such natural accessories are made use of frequently in supernatural revelations: see especially <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+21:10">Revelation 21:10</span> . The attempts to restrict τοῦ κόσμου to <em> Palestine</em> , (which was, besides, God’s peculiar portion and vineyard, as <em> distinguished from</em> the Gentile world,) or <em> the Roman</em> empire, are mere subterfuges: as is also the giving to δείκνυσιν the sense of ‘points out the direction of.’ The very passage of Polybius cited to support this view, completely refutes it, when taken entire. Hannibal, from the Alps, is directing the attention of his soldiers to the view of Italy; ἐνδεικνύμενος αὐτοῖς τὰ περὶ τὸν Πάδον πεδία (in sight) … ἅμα δὲ καὶ τὸν τῆς Ῥώμης αὐτοῖς τόπον ὑποδεικνύων , where we may observe the distinction between the two compounds <strong> ἐν</strong> <strong> -</strong> and <strong> ὑπο</strong> - δείκνυμι : and further, that it is not <strong> τὴν Ῥ</strong> <strong> .</strong> but <strong> τὸν</strong> τῆς <strong> Ῥ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τόπον</strong> that he pointed out to them. Euthymius, however, interprets our verse thus, … λέγων · ἐν τούτῳ μὲν τῷ μέρει κεῖται ἡ βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων , ἐν τούτῳ δὲ ἡ τῶν Περσῶν , ἐν ἐκείνῳ δὲ ἡ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων , καὶ τὰ ἑξῆς ὁμοίως · καὶ ὅτι ἡ μὲν ἔχει δόξαν ἐπὶ τοῖσδε τοῖς εἴδεσιν , ἡ δὲ ἐπὶ τοῖσδε , καὶ ἄλλη ἐπ ʼ ἄλλοις , καὶ ἁπλῶς πάντα καταλέγει : and even Maldonatus approves it.

<p>In this last temptation the enemy reveals himself openly, as the ἄρχων τοῦ κόσμου τούτου , and as the father of lies; for though power is given him over this world and its sons, his assertion here is most untrue.</p>
