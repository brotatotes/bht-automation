<p><strong> 12 22.</strong> ] JESUS BEGINS HIS MINISTRY. CALLING OF PETER, ANDREW, JAMES, AND JOHN. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:14-20">Mark 1:14-20</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:14-15">Luke 4:14-15</span> . Between the last verse and this is a considerable interval of time. After returning from the temptation (see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:28">John 1:28</span> , end) our Lord was pointed out by John the Baptist, (ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29-34">John 1:29-34</span> ,) and again on the morrow to two of his disciples, Andrew and (probably) John, who followed Him, and were (on the next day? see note, Joh 1:44 ) joined by Simon Peter ( Joh 1:35-43 ): then on the morrow Philip and Nathanael were called ( Joh 1:44-51 ); three days after was the marriage in Cana ( Joh 2:1-11 ); then our Lord went down to Capernaum and remained not many days ( Joh 2:12 ); then followed the Passover; the cleansing of the temple ( Joh 2:13-22 ); the belief of many on Jesus ( Joh 2:23-25 ); the discourse with Nicodemus ( Mat 3:1-17 ); the baptizing by Jesus (i.e. his disciples) ( Joh 3:22-24 ); the question about purifying, and testimony of the Baptist ( Joh 3:25-36 ); the journey through Samaria into Galilee, and discourse with the woman of Samaria ( Joh 4:1-25 ); the return to Cana and healing of the ruler’s son in Capernaum ( Joh 4:43-54 ); and the journey to Jerusalem related in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1">John 5:1</span> . After that chapter St. John breaks off the first part of his narrative, and between his Joh 5:47 and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:1">John 6:1</span> , comes in the synoptic narrative, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:12-25">John 4:12-25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1-47">John 5:1-47</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:1-34">John 6:1-34</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:1-29">John 7:1-29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:1-34">John 8:1-34</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:1-38">John 9:1-38</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:1-42">John 10:1-42</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:1-30">John 11:1-30</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1-50">John 12:1-50</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1-38">John 13:1-38</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:1-15">John 14:1-15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:14-45">Mark 1:14-45</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:1-28">Mark 2:1-28</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:1-35">Mark 3:1-35</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:1-41">Mark 4:1-41</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:1-43">Mark 5:1-43</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:1-30">Mark 6:1-30</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:14-44">Luke 4:14-44</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:1-39">Luke 5:1-39</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:1-49">Luke 6:1-49</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:1-50">Luke 7:1-50</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:1-56">Luke 8:1-56</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:1-10">Luke 9:1-10</span> . This omission is in remarkable consistency with St. Matthew’s account of his own calling in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:9">Matthew 9:9</span> . Being employed in his business in the neighbourhood of Capernaum, he now first becomes personally acquainted with the words and actions of our Lord. From what circumstance the former miracle in Capernaum had not attracted his attention, we cannot, of course, definitely say; we can, however, easily conceive. Our Lord was not then <em> in</em> Capernaum; for the ruler sent to Him, and the cure was wrought by word at a distance. If Matthew’s attention had not been called to Jesus before, he might naturally omit such a narrative, which John gives probably from personal knowledge. The <em> synoptic narrative generally</em> omits this whole section of our Lord’s travels and ministry. Its sources of information, until the last visit to Jerusalem, seem to have been <em> exclusively Galilæan</em> , and <em> derived from persons who became attached to Him at a later period than any of the events recorded in that first portion of John’s Gospel</em> . The objections to this view are, the narrative, in the three Gospels, of the baptism and temptation; but the former of these would be abundantly testified by John’s disciples, many of whom became disciples of Jesus; and the latter could only have been derived from the mouth of our Lord Himself.</p>
