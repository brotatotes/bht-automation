<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] With the preceding verse the beatitudes end, in their general reference, and in this our Lord addresses <em> His disciples</em> particularly. The actions described in this verse are the expansion of δεδιωγμένοι in the last. <strong> διώξωσιν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> however, still means <strong> persecute;</strong> its <em> legal</em> usage is unknown in the N.T. <strong> ψευδόμενοι</strong> does not belong to ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ , as some recent Commentators have supposed (Tholuck, Meyer), but to εἴπωσιν . The pres. part., as usual, carries with it the logical condition.</p>
