<p><strong> 12. </strong> <strong> ὁ μισθὸς ὑμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] A reward, not of debt, but of grace, as the parable in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:1">Matthew 20:1</span> ff. clearly represents it. ‘An expression,’ as De Wette observes, ‘taken from our earthly commerce, and applied to spiritual things;’ in which however we must remember, that the principal reference is to God as the giver, and not to us as the deservers: see the parable above cited, where the μισθός is not what was <em> earned</em> , but what was <em> covenanted</em> . ‘Deus est debitor noster non ex commisso, sed ex promisso.’ Aug [40] (Tholuck.) These words, <strong> ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> must not be taken as having any bearing on the question as to the <em> future habitation</em> of the glorified saints. Their use in this and similar expressions is not <em> local</em> , but <em> spiritual</em> , indicating the blessed state when ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν shall have fully come. The local question is to be decided by wholly different testimonies of Scripture; by the general tenor of prophecy, and the analogies of the divine dealings: and all of these seem to point rather to this earth, purified and renewed, than to <em> the heavens</em> in any ordinary sense of the term, as the eternal habitation of the blessed.

<p>The reasoning implied in γάρ may be thus filled up: “and great will be <em> their</em> reward in heaven.”</p>
