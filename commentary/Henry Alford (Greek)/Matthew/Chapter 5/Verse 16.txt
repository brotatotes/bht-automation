<p><strong> 16. </strong> <strong> οὕτως</strong> ] i.e. <em> like a candle on a candlestick like a city on a hill;</em> not οὕτως , ὅπως , ‘so … that,’ as our English version seems rather to imply. By rendering οὕτως <strong> in like manner,</strong> the ambiguity will be avoided. See ref., and note there. The sense of this verse is as if it were ὅπως , ἰδόντες ὑμῶν τ . κ . ἔργ . δοξάσωσιν τ . π . ὑ … the <em> latter</em> verb, and not the former, carrying the purpose of the action. Thus the praise and glory of a well-lighted and brilliant feast would be given, not to the lights, but to the master of the house; and of a stately city on a hill, not to the buildings, but to those who built them. The whole of this division of our Lord’s sermon is addressed to <em> all His followers</em> , not exclusively to the ministers of his word. All servants of Christ are the salt of the earth, the light of the world ( Php 2:15 ). And all that is here said applies to us all. But à fortiori does it apply, in its highest sense, to those who are, among Christians, selected to teach and be examples; who are as it were the towers and pinnacles of the city, not only not hid, but seen far and wide above the rest.</p>
