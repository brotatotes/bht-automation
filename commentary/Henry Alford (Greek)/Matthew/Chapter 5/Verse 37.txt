The gender is ambiguous, as it may constructionally be in the Lord’s prayer, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:13">Matthew 6:13</span> , but see note there.

See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:8">1 John 3:8</span> .</p>
