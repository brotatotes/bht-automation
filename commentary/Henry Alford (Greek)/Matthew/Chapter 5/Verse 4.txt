<p><strong> 4. </strong> <strong> μακ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οἱ πενθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The spiritual qualification in the former verse must be carried on to this, and the mourning understood to mean not only that on account of sin, but <em> all such as happens to a man in the spiritual life</em> . All such mourners are blessed: for the Father of mercies and God of all consolation being their covenant God, His comfort shall overbear all their mourning, and taste the sweeter for it. In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:25">Luke 2:25</span> , the Messiah’s coming is called ἡ παράκλησις τοῦ Ἰσραήλ .
	</p>
<p>This beatitude is by many editors (Lachmann, e.g.) placed after <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:5">Matthew 5:5</span> . But the authority is by no means decisive, and I cannot see how the logical coherence of the sentences is improved by it.
	</p>
<p>In placing these two beatitudes first, the Lord follows the order in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span> , which He proclaimed in the synagogue at Nazareth, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:18">Luke 4:18</span> .</p>
