<p><strong> 5. </strong> <strong> οἱ πραεῖς</strong> ] A citation from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+37:11">Psalms 37:11</span> . The usual dividers and allotters of the earth being mighty and proud conquerors, and the Messiah being expected as such a conqueror, this announcement, that the meek should inherit the earth, struck at the root of the temporal expectations of power and wealth in the Messiah’s kingdom. This meekness is not mere outward lowliness of demeanour, but that true πραΰτης of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:2">Ephesians 4:2</span> , whose active side (Stier) is ἀγάπη , and its passive side μακροθυμία . On the promise, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:13-15">Isaiah 57:13-15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:21">Isaiah 60:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:22">1 Corinthians 3:22</span> . That kingdom of God which begins in the hearts of the disciples of Christ, and is not <strong> ἐκ</strong> τοῦ κόσμου τούτου , shall work onwards till it shall become <em> actually a kingdom over this earth</em> , and its subjects shall <em> inherit the earth:</em> first in its millennial, and finally in its renewed and blessed state for ever.</p>
