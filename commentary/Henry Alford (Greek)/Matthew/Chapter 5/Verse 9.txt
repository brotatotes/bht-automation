<p><strong> 9. </strong> <strong> εἰρηνοποιοί</strong> ] More than ‘ <em> the peaceful</em> ’ (‘pacifici,’ Vulg.). It is doubtful whether the word ever has this meaning. Thus Euthymius, mostly after Chrysostom: οἱ μὴ μόνον αὐτοὶ μὴ στασιάζοντες , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἑτέρους στασιάζοντας συνάγοντες εἰς εἰρήνην · υἱοὶ δὲ θεοῦ κληθήσονται , ὡς μιμησάμενοι τὸν μονογενῆ υἱὸν αὐτοῦ · ᾧ γέγονεν ἔργον συναγαγεῖν τὰ διεστῶτα καὶ καταλλάξαι τὰ ἐκπεπολεμωμένα . But even thus we do not seem to reach the full meaning, which probably is, “ <em> they that work peace;</em> ” not confining the reference to the reconciliation of persons at variance: see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:18">James 3:18</span> ; and, for the more special meaning, Xen. in reff.

<p><strong> κληθήσονται</strong> ] <em> implies</em> the reality, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:19">Matthew 5:19</span> ; <strong> shall</strong> (not only be, but also) <strong> be called,</strong> i.e. recognized, in the highest sense, both generally, and by the Highest Himself, as such. Cf. Maldonatus: ‘plus etiam quiddam mihi videtur <em> vocari</em> quam <em> esse</em> significare: nempe ita aliquid esse, ut appareat, ut omnium ore celebretur.’ Let it ever be remembered, according to the order of these beatitudes, and the assertion of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:17">James 3:17</span> , that the wisdom from above is <strong> πρῶτον</strong> ἁγνή , <strong> ἔπειτα</strong> εἰρηνική , implying no compromise with evil. And it is in the working out of this ἁγνότης that Luk 12:51 is especially true.</p>
