<p><strong> 40, 41.</strong> ] See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:39">Matthew 5:39</span> . <strong> κριθῆναι</strong> imports <em> legal contention only</em> , and is thus distinguished from the violence in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:39">Matthew 5:39</span> . (Meyer, against Tholuck (but not in edn. 3) and De Wette.) <strong> λαβεῖν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> i.e. in pledge for a debt: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+22:26">Exodus 22:26</span> . <strong> χιτῶνα</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the inner and less costly garment; <strong> ἱμάτιον</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the outer and more valuable, used also by the poor as a coverlet by night (Exod. ubi supra). In Luk 6:29 the order is inverted, and appears to be that in which the two garments would be taken from the body, that verse referring to abstraction by <em> violence</em> . See the apostolic comment on this precept, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:7">1 Corinthians 6:7</span> .

<p><strong> ἀγγαρεύσει</strong> ] Herod. viii. 98, after describing the Persian post-couriers, adds, τοῦτο τὸ δράμημα τῶν ἵππων καλέουσι Πέρσαι ἀγγαρήϊον . Æschylus, Agam. 285 (Dindorf), says of the beacons which brought the intelligence of the capture of Troy to Mycenæ, φρυκτὸς δὲ φρυκτὸν δεῦρ ʼ ἀπ ʼ ἀγγάρου πυρὸς ἔπεμπεν . ‘The Jews particularly objected to the duty of furnishing posts for the Roman government; and Demetrius, wishing to conciliate the Jews, promised, among other things, κελεύω δὲ μηδὲ ἀγγαρεύεσθαι τὰ Ἰουδαίων ὑποζύγια (Jos. Antt. xiii. 2. 3). Hence our Saviour represents this as a burden; and in the same manner Epictetus says, ἂν δὲ ἀγγαρεία ᾖ καὶ στρατιώτης ἐπιλάβηται , ἄφες , μὴ ἀντίτεινε μηδὲ γόγγυζε .’ Dr. Burton. The ἐπισταθμία , or billeting of the Roman soldiers and their horses on the Jews, was one kind of this ἀγγαρεία .</p>
