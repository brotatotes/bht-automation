<p><strong> 1.</strong> ] The discourse of our Lord now passes <em> from actions to motives;</em> not that He has not spoken to the heart before, but then it was only by inference, now directly.

<p><strong> δικαιοσύνη</strong> ] not ‘ <em> benevolence</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> alms</em> ,’ as צְדָקָה in Rabbinical usage, for this meaning is never found in the N.T., and in the apocryphal reff. a distinction is made, though the two are coupled closely together. Besides, here we have ἐλεημοσύνη treated of as a distinct head below. It is best then to render δικ ., <strong> righteousness,</strong> as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:20">Matthew 5:20</span> , as a general term including the three duties afterwards treated of.

<p>The words <strong> πρὸς τὸ θεαθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> clearly define the course of action objected to: not the open benevolence of the Christian who lets his light shine that men may glorify God, but the ostentation of him whose <em> object</em> is the praise and glory coming from man. ἔστι γὰρ καὶ ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀνθρώπων ποιοῦντα , μὴ πρὸς τὸ θεαθῆναι ποιεῖν · καὶ μὴ ποιοῦντα ἔμπροσθεν πἀλιν , πρὸς τὸ θεαθῆναι ποιεῖν . Chrysostom, Hom. xix. 1, p. 245.

<p><strong> εἰ δὲ μήγε</strong> does not apply to προσέχετε , so as to mean, ‘ <em> if ye do not take heed;</em> ’ but to μὴ ποιεῖν , and means, <strong> if ye do.</strong> That this is so, is clear from the reff. On the force of the <strong> γε</strong> <strong> ,</strong> modifying the condition expressed in the εἰ , and concentrating it on the example given, see Klotz ad Devar., p. 527, and ante, p. 308.</p>
