Augustine remarks (contra Epist. Parmeniani, l. ii. c. 10 (20), vol. ix.): ‘Quod utique non de illis peccatis dicitur quæ in baptismi regeneratione dimissa sunt, sed de iis quæ quotidie de seculi amarissimis fructibus humanæ vitæ infirmitas contrahit.’

<p><strong> ὡς καί</strong> ] Not ‘ <em> for</em> we also,’ &amp;c. (as in Luke, καὶ γὰρ αὐτοὶ ἀφ .) nor ‘ <em> in the same measure as we</em> also,’ &amp;c. but <strong> like as</strong> ( <em> quippe</em> ; not exactly <em> nam</em> , cf. Klotz ad Devar. p. 766. Hartung, Partikellehre, i. p. 460) <strong> we also,</strong> &amp;c. implying similarity in the two actions, of kind, but no comparison of degree. See especially the first ref., where manifestly while the kind of act was the same, the degrees were widely different.

<p>‘Augustine uses the testimony of this prayer against all proud Pelagian notions of an absolutely sinless state in this life’ (Trench); and answers the various excuses and evasions by which that sect escaped from the conclusion.

<p><strong> ἀφήκαμεν</strong> here implies that (see ch. Mat 5:23-24 ) the act of forgiveness of others is <em> completed before we approach</em> the throne of grace.</p>
