<p><strong> 26. </strong> <strong> τὰ πετ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The two examples, of the birds and the lilies, are not parallel in their application. The first is an argument from the less to the greater; that our Heavenly Father, who feeds the birds, will much more feed us: the second, besides this application, which ( Mat 6:30 ) it also contains, is a reproof of the vanity of anxiety about clothing, which, in all its pomp of gorgeous colours, is vouchsafed to the inferior creatures, but not attainable by, as being unworthy of, us. Notice, it is not said, μὴ σπείρετε μὴ θερίζετε μὴ συνάγετε ; the birds are not our example to follow in their habits, for God hath made us to differ from them the doing all these things is part of our πόσῳ μᾶλλον διαφέρετε , (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:24">Luke 12:24</span> ,) and increases the force of the <em> à fortiori;</em> but it is said, μὴ μεριμνᾶτε μὴ μετεωρίζεσθε . τί γοῦν ὠφελήσεις οὕτως ἐπιτεταμένως μεριμνῶν ; κἂν γὰρ μυρία σπουδάσῃς , οὐ δώσεις ὑετὸν οὐδὲ ἥλιον οὐδὲ πνοὰς ἀνέμων , οἷς ὁ σπόρος καρπογονεῖ . ταῦτα γὰρ ὁ θεὸς μόνος δίδωσιν .

<p>ὁ πατὴρ <strong> ὑμῶν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> not αὐτῶν : thus by every accessory word does our Lord wonderfully assert the truths and proprieties of creation, in which <em> we</em> , his sons, are His central work, and the rest <em> for us</em> . <strong> τοῦ οὐρ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> and afterwards <strong> τοῦ ἀγροῦ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> as Thol. remarks, are not superfluous, but serve to set forth the wild and uncaring freedom of the birds and plants. I may add, also to set forth their lower rank in the scale of creation, as <em> belonging to</em> the air and the field. Who could say of mankind, οἱ ἄνθρωποι τοῦ κόσμου ? Thus the <em> à fortiori</em> is more plainly brought out.</p>
