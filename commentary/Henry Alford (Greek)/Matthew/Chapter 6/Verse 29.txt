<p><strong> 29.</strong> ] We here have the declaration of the Creator Himself concerning the relative glory and beauty of all human pomp, compared with the meanest of His own works. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ch+9:15-28">2 Chronicles 9:15-28</span> . And the meaning hidden beneath the text should not escape the student. As the beauty of the flower is unfolded by the Divine Creator-Spirit from <em> within</em> , from the laws and capacities of its <em> own</em> individual life, so must all true adornment of man be unfolded <em> from within</em> by the same Almighty Spirit. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:3-4">1 Peter 3:3-4</span> . As nothing from without can defile a man, (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:11">Matthew 15:11</span> ,) so neither can any thing from without adorn him. Our Lord introduces with λέγω ὑμῖν His revelations of omniscience: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:10">Matthew 18:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:19">Matthew 18:19</span> .</p>
