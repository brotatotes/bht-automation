<p><strong> μὴ γνώτω</strong> ] Another popular saying, not to be pressed so as to require a literal interpretation of it in the act of almsgiving, as De Wette and others have done, but implying simplicity, both of intention and act. Equally out of place are all attempts to explain the right and left hand symbolically, as was once the practice. The sound sense of Chrysostom preserves the right interpretation, where even Augustine strays into symbolism: πάλιν ἐνταῦθα οὐ χεῖρας αἰνίττεται , ἀλλ ʼ ὑπερβολικῶς αὐτὸ τέθεικεν . εἰ γὰρ οἷόν τέ ἐστι , φησί , σεαυτὸν ἀγνοῆσαι , περισπούδαστον ἔστω σοι τοῦτο , κἂν αὐτὰς δυνατὸν ᾖ τὰς διακονουμένας χεῖρας λαθεῖν . Hom. xix. 2, p. 246.</p>
