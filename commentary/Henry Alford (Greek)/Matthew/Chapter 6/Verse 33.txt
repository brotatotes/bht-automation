<p><strong> 33. </strong> <strong> ζητεῖτε πρῶτον</strong> ] Not with any reference to seeking all these things <em> after</em> our religious duties, e.g. beginning with prayer days of avarice and worldly anxiety, but <strong> make your great object,</strong> as we say, <strong> your first care.
	</strong></p>
<p><strong> δικαιοσύνην</strong> ] Not here the <em> forensic righteousness of justification</em> , but the <em> spiritual purity</em> inculcated in this discourse. τήν δικ . <strong> αὐτοῦ</strong> answers to ἡ τελειότης αὐτοῦ , spoken of in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:48">Matthew 5:48</span> , and is another reference to the being as our Heavenly Father is. In the Christian life which has been since unfolded, the righteousness of justification is a <em> necessary condition</em> of likeness to God; but it is not the δικ . αὐτ . <em> here</em> meant. <strong> ταῦτα πάντα</strong> <strong> , these things, all of them</strong> the emphasis being on the genus <strong> all such things: </strong> <strong> πάντα ταῦτα</strong> <strong> , all these things</strong> ‘ <em> the whole of the things mentioned</em> ’ the emphasis being on πάντα , the fact that <em> all without exception</em> are included. See Winer, § 18. 4.
	</p>
<p><strong> προστεθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] There is a traditional saying of our Lord, αἰτεῖτε τὰ μεγάλα , καὶ τὰ μικρὰ ὑμῖν προστεθήσεται · καὶ αἰτεῖτε τὰ ἐπουράνια , καὶ τὰ ἐπίγεια προστεθήσεται ὑμῖν . Fabric. Cod. Apocr. i. 329. (Meyer.)</p>
