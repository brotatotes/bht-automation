<p><strong> 5. </strong> <strong> φιλοῦσιν</strong> ] not so well <em> solent</em> , as <em> amant:</em> <strong> they take pleasure,</strong> or <strong> love:</strong> see reff. and Winer, § 54. 4. The meaning <em> solere</em> for φιλεῖν is undoubtedly found: see Tholuck here.

<p><strong> ἑστῶτες</strong> ] No stress must be laid on this word as implying ostentation; for it was the ordinary posture of prayer. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1sa+1:26">1 Samuel 1:26</span> . 1Ki 8:22 is perhaps hardly a case in point, 2Ch 6:13 being a more specific statement. The command in Mark ( Mar 11:25 ) runs, ὅταν στήκετε προσευχόμενοι .… See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:11">Luke 18:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:13">Luke 18:13</span> . Indeed, of the two positions of prayer, considering the place, kneeling would have been the more singular and savouring of ostentation. The <em> synagogues</em> were <em> places of prayer;</em> so that, as Theophyl. (Thol.), οὐ βλάπτει ὁ τόπος , ἀλλὰ ὁ τρόπος καὶ ὁ σκυπός .</p>
