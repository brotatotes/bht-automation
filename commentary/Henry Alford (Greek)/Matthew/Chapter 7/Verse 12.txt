<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] Trench (Serm. Mount, p. 143) has noticed Augustine’s refutation of the sneer of infidels (such as Gibbon’s against this precept), that some of our Lord’s sayings have been before written by heathen authors. (See examples in Wets [87] . ad loc.) ‘Dixit hoc Pythagoras, dixit hoc Plato.… Propterea si inventus fuerit aliquis eorum hoc dixisse quod dixit et Christus, gratulamur illi, non sequimur illum. Sed prior fuit ille quam Christus. Si quis vera loquitur, prior est quam ipsa Veritas! O homo, attende Christum, non quando ad te venerit, sed quando te fecerit.’ Enarr. in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+140:6">Psalms 140:6</span> , § 19, vol. iv. pt. ii.

<p><strong> ουν</strong> is the inference indeed from the preceding eleven verses, but <em> immediately</em> from the δώσει ἀγαθὰ τοῖς αἰτοῦσιν αὐτόν just said, and thus closes this section of the Sermon with a lesson similar to the last verse of ch. 5, which is, indeed, the ground-tone of the whole Sermon ‘Be ye like unto God.’

<p><strong> οὕτως</strong> <strong> ,</strong> viz., <em> after the pattern of</em> ὅσα ἄν : not = ταῦτα , because what might suit <em> us</em> , might not suit others. We are to think what we should like done to <em> us</em> , and then apply that rule to our dealings with others: viz., by doing to them what we have reason to suppose <em> they would like done to them</em> . This is a most important distinction, and one often overlooked in the interpretation of this golden maxim.</p>
