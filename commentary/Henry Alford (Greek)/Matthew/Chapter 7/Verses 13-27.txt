<p><strong> 13 27.</strong> ] THE CONCLUSION OF THE DISCOURSE: <em> setting forth more strongly and personally the dangers of hypocrisy</em> , both in <em> being led aside by hypocritical teachers</em> , and in <em> our own inner life</em> . The πύλη stands at the end of the ὁδός , as in the remarkable parallel in the Table of Cebes, c. 16: οὐκοῦν δρᾷς θύραν τινὰ μικράν , καὶ ὁδόν τινα πρὸ τῆς θύρας , ἥτις οὐ πολὺ ὀχλεῖται , ἀλλ ʼ ὀλίγοι πάνυ πορεύονται : … αὕτη ἐστὶν ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἄγουσα πρὸς τὴν ἀληθινὴν παιδείαν .</p>
