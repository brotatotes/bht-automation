<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] <strong> κύριε σῶσον</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> ἀπολλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> = διδάσκαλε , οὐ μέλει σοι ὅτι ἀπολλ .; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:38">Mark 4:38</span> = ἐπιστάτα , ἐπιστάτα , ἀπολλ ., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:24">Luke 8:24</span> . On these and such like variations, notice the following excellent and important remarks of Augustine (De Consensu Evv. ii. 24 (55), vol. vii.): ‘Una eademque sententia est excitantium Dominum, volentiumque salvari; nec opus est quærere quid horum potius Christo dictum sit. Sive enim alliquid horum trium dixerint, sive alia verba quæ nullus Evangelistarum commemoravit, tantundem tamen valentia ad eandem sententiæ veritatem, quid ad rem interest?’ We may well exclaim, ‘O si sic omnia!’ Much useless labour might have been spared, and men’s minds led to the diligent enquiry into the real difficulties of the Gospels, instead of so many spending time in knitting cobwebs. But Augustine himself in the very next sentence, descends to the unsatisfactory ground of the Harmonists, when he adds, ‘Quamquam et hoc fieri potuit, ut pluribus eum simul excitantibus, omnia hæc, aliud ab alio, dicerentur.’ His mind however was not one to rest contented with such sophisms; and all his deeper and more earnest sayings are in the truer and freer spirit of the above extract.</p>
