<p><strong> 4. </strong> <strong> ὅρα μηδενὶ εἴπῃς</strong> ] Either (1) these words were a moral admonition, having respect to the state of the man ( διδάσκων τὸ ἀκόμπαστον καὶ ἀφιλότιμον , Chrysost.), for the injunction to silence was not our Lord’s uniform practice (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:19">Mark 5:19</span> , [97] Luke), and in this case they were of lasting obligation, that the cleansed leper was not to make his healing a matter of boast hereafter; or (2) they were a cautionary admonition, only binding till he should have shewn himself to the priest, in order to avoid delay in this necessary duty, or any hindrance which might, if the matter should first be blazed abroad, arise to his being pronounced clean, through the malice of the priests; or (3), which I believe to be the true view, our Lord almost uniformly repressed the fame of His miracles, for the reason given in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:15-21">Matthew 12:15-21</span> , that, in accordance with prophetic truth, He might be known as the Messiah not by wonder-working power, but by the great result of his work upon earth: οὐκ ἐρίσει , οὐδὲ κραυγάσει , οὐδὲ ἀκούσει τις ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ …, ἕως ἂν ἐκβάλῃ εἰς νῖκος τὴν κρίσιν . Thus the Apostles always refer primarily to the Resurrection, and only incidentally, if at all, to the wonders and signs. (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22-24">Acts 2:22-24</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:13-16">Acts 3:13-16</span> .) These latter were tokens of power common to our Lord and his followers; but in His great conflict, ending in His victory, He trod the winepress alone.

<p><strong> σεαυτὸν δεῖξ</strong> <strong> .</strong> κ . τ . λ .] Read <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+14:1-32">Leviticus 14:1-32</span> . This command has been used in support of the theory of satisfaction by priestly confession and penance. But even then (Trench on the Miracles, p. 221) the advocates of it are constrained to acknowledge that Christ alone is the cleanser. ‘Ut Dominus ostenderet, quod non sacerdotali judicio, sed largitate divinæ gratiæ peccato emundatur, leprosum tangendo mundavit, et postea sacerdoti sacrificium ex lege offerre præcepit.’ (Gratian de Pœnitentia, Dist. 1, c. 34, p. 1529 Migne.) ‘Dominus leprosum sanitati prius per se restituit, deinde ad sacerdotes misit quorum judicio ostenderetur mundatus … quia etsi aliquis apud Deum sit solutus, non tamen in facie Ecclesiæ solutus habetur, nisi per judicium sacerdotis. In solvendis ergo culpis vel retinendis ita operatur sacerdos evangelicus et judicat, sicut olim legalis in illis qui contaminati erant lepra quæ peccatum signat.’ (Peter Lombard. Sent. iv. dist. 18. 6, p. 887 Migne.) It is satisfactory to observe this drawing of parallels between the Levitical and (popularly so called) Christian priesthood, thus completely shewing the fallacy and untenableness of the whole system; all those priests being types, not of future human priests, but of Him, who abideth a Priest for ever in an unchangeable priesthood, and in Whom not a class of Christians, but <em> all</em> Christians, are priests unto God.
