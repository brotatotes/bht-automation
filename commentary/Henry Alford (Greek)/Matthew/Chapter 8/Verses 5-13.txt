<p><strong> 5 13.</strong> ] HEALING OF THE CENTURION’S SERVANT. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:1-10">Luke 7:1-10</span> , where we have a more detailed account of the former part of this miracle. On the chronological arrangement, see Prolegomena. The centurion did not himself <em> come</em> to our Lord, but sent elders of the Jews to Him, who recommended him to His notice as loving their nation, and having built them a synagogue. Such variations, the concise account making a man <em> fecisse per se</em> what the fuller one relates him <em> fecisse per alterum</em> , are common in all written and oral narrations. In such cases the fuller account is, of course, the stricter one. Augustine, answering Faustus the Manichæan, who wished, on account of the words of our Lord in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:11">Matthew 8:11</span> , to set aside the whole, and used this variation for that purpose, makes the remark, so important in these days, ‘Quid enim, nonne talibus locutionibus humana plena est consuetudo.… quid ergo, cum legimus, obliviscimur quemadmodum loqui soleamus? An Scriptura Dei aliter nobiscum fuerat, quam nostro more, locutura?’ Contra Faustum, xxxiii. 7, vol. viii. On the non-identity of this miracle with that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:46">John 4:46</span> ff., see note there.</p>
