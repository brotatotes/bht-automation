<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] <strong> πενθεῖν</strong> = νηστεύειν Mark and Luke. The difference of these two words is curiously enough one of Greswell’s arguments for the non-identity of the narratives. Even if there were any force in such an argument, we might fairly set against it that ἀπαρθῇ is common to all three Evangelists, and occurs no where else in the N.T.

<p><strong> ὁ νυμφίος</strong> ] This appellation of Himself had from our Lord peculiar appropriateness as addressed to the disciples of John. Their master had himself said ( Joh 3:29 ) ὁ ἔχων τὴν νύμφην , νυμφίος ἐστίν · ὁ δὲ φίλος τοῦ νυμφίου ὁ ἑστηκὼς καὶ ἀκούων αὐτοῦ , χαρᾷ χαίρει διὰ τὴν φωνὴν τοῦ νυμφίου . αὕτη οὖν ἡ χαρὰ ἡ ἐμὴ πεπλήρωται .

<p>Our Lord in calling Himself the Bridegroom, announces the fulfilment in Him of a whole cycle of O.T. prophecies and figures: very probably with <em> immediate</em> reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:1-23">Hosea 2:1-23</span> , that prophet having been cited just before: but also to many other passages, in which the Bride is the Church of God, the Bridegroom the God of Israel. See especially Isa 54:5-10 Heb. and E. V. As Stier (Reden Jesu, i. 320, edn. 2) observes, the article here must not be considered as merely introduced on account of the parable, as usual elsewhere, but the parable itself to have sprung out of the emphatic name, ὁ νυμφίος . The υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος are more than the mere guests at the wedding: they are the bridegroom’s friends who go and fetch the bride.

<p><strong> ἐλεύσονται δὲ ἡμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] How sublime and peaceful is this early announcement by our Lord of the bitter passage before Him! Compare the words of our Christian poet: ‘measuring with calm presage the infinite descent.’ ( <em> Wizenmann mag dabei wohl fragen:, Welcher Mensch hat je fo ruhig, so lieblich von einer solchen Hõhe in eine solche Jiefe geschaut?</em> ’ Stier, Reden Jesu, i. 322.)

<p><strong> ὅταν ἀπ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> when the Bridegroom shall have been taken from them:</strong> when His departure shall have taken place.
	</p>
<p><strong> καὶ τότε ν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] These words are not a declaration of a duty, or of an ordinance, as binding on the Church in the days of her Lord’s absence: the whole spirit of what follows is against such a Supposition: but they declare, in accordance with the parallel word πενθεῖν , that in those days they shall have <em> real occasion</em> for fasting; sorrow enough; see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:20">John 16:20</span> : a fast of God’s own appointing in the solemn purpose of His will respecting them, not one of their own arbitrary laying on. This view is strikingly brought out in Luke, where the question is, Can ye ποιῆσαι νηστεύειν the children, &amp;c., i.e. by your rites and ordinances? but, &amp;c. and τότε νηστεύσουσιν : there is no constraint in this latter case: they shall (or better, they will) fast. And this furnishes us with an analogous rule for the fasting of the Christian life: that it should be the genuine offspring of inward and spiritual sorrow, of the sense of the absence of the Bridegroom in the soul, not the forced and stated fasts of the old covenant, now passed away. It is an instructive circumstance that in the Reformed Churches, while those stated fasts which were retained at their first emergence from Popery are in practice universally disregarded even by their best and holiest sons, nothing can be more affecting and genuine than the universal and solemn observance of any real occasion of fasting placed before them by God’s Providence. It is also remarkable how uniformly a strict attention to artificial and prescribed fasts accompanies a hankering after the hybrid ceremonial system of Rome.

<p>Meyer remarks well that <strong> τότε</strong> refers to a definite point of time, not to the whole subsequent period.</p>
