<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] Our Lord in these two parables contrasts the old and the new, the legal and evangelic dispensations, with regard to the point on which He was questioned. The idea of the <em> wedding</em> seems to run through them: the preparation of the robe, the pouring of the new wine, are connected by this as their leading idea to one another and to the preceding verses.

<p>The old system of prescribed fasts for fasting’s sake must not be patched with the new and sound piece; the complete and beautiful whole of Gospel light and liberty must not be engrafted as a mere addition on the worn out system of ceremonies. For the πλήρωμα αὐτοῦ , the completeness of it, the new patch, by its weight and its strength pulls away the neighbouring weak and loose threads by which it holds to the old garment, and a worse rent is made. Stier notices the prophetic import of this parable: in how sad a degree the χεῖρον σχίσμα γίνεται has been fulfilled in the history of the Church, by the attempts to patch the new, the Evangelic state, upon the old worn out ceremonial system. ‘Would,’ he adds, ‘that we could say in the interpretation, as in the parable, <em> No man doeth this!</em> ’ The robe must be <em> all new</em> , all consistent: old things, old types, old ceremonies, old burdens, sacrifices, priests, sabbaths, and holy days, all are passed away: behold all things are become new.

<p><strong> χεῖρον σχ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γίν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> a worse rent takes place:</strong> not, as E. V., ‘ <em> the rent is made worse</em> ’ ( χ . γίν . τὸ σχ ., or χ . τὸ σχ . γίν .,) a worse rent, because the old, original rent was included within the circumference of the ἐπίβλημα , whereas this is outside it.</p>
