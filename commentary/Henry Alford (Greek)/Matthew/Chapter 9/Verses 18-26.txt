<p><strong> 18 26.</strong> ] RAISING OF JAEIRUS’S DAUGHTER, AND HEALING OF A WOMAN WITH AN ISSUE OF BLOOD. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:21-43">Mark 5:21-43</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:41-56">Luke 8:41-56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:41-56">Luke 8:41-56</span> . In Luke and Mark this miracle follows immediately after the casting out of the devils at Gadara, and our Lord’s recrossing the lake to Capernaum; but without any precise note of time as here. He may well have been by the sea (as seems implied by Mark and Luke), when the foregoing conversation with the disciples of John and the Pharisees took place. The account in the text is the most concise of the three; both Mark and Luke, but especially the latter, giving many additional particulars. The miracle forms a very instructive point of comparison between the three Gospels.</p>
