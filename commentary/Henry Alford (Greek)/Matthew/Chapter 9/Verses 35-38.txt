<p><strong> 35 38.</strong> ] OUR LORD’S COMPASSION FOR THE MULTITUDE. <em> Peculiar to Matthew</em> . In the same way as ch. Mat 4:23-25 introduces the Sermon on the Mount, so do these verses the calling and commissioning of the Twelve. These <em> general descriptions</em> of our Lord’s going about and teaching at once <em> remove all exactness of date from the occurrence which follows</em> as taking place at some time during the circuit and teaching just described. Both the Sermon on the Mount and this discourse are introduced and closed with these marks of indefiniteness as to time. This being the case, we must have recourse to the other Evangelists, by whose account it appears (as indeed may be implied in ch. Mat 10:1 ), that the Apostles <em> had been called to their distinct office some time before this</em> . (See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:16">Mark 3:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13">Luke 6:13</span> .) After their calling, and selection, they probably remained with our Lord for some time before they were sent out upon their mission.</p>
