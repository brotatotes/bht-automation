We cannot say when or how, but may well infer that it was at Colossæ, in building up the church there, while the Apostle was at Ephesus: see Prolegg. to Col. § ii. 7.

<p><strong> ἡμῶν</strong> ] Storr (cited in Koch) remarks, “In epistolarum inscriptione, quamvis pronomina et verba tertiæ personæ usitatiora sint, interdum tamen etiam pronomina et verba primæ personæ ut ἡμῶν l. n., et <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:2">Philemon 1:2</span> (cf. 1Ti 1:1 ), ἡμῖν <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1">2 Peter 1:1</span> ; ἐμοί Gal 1:2 et ἐλάβομεν <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5">Romans 1:5</span> (cf. Tit 1:3 ) reperire licet. Cf. Cic. epp. ad diversos lib. iv. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:0">Ephesians 1:0</span> , et lib. iii. Ephesians 2. Nempe verbum, quod ad omissum vocabulum χαίρειν intelligi debet, cum in tertia, tum in prima persona accipi potest, ut in laudatis inscriptionibus latinis S. P. D. et L. D. legere licet. ‘(ego) M. T. C. et Cicero <em> meus</em> salutem plurimam <em> dicimus</em> ,’ et ‘(ego) M. T. C. Appio Pulchro, ut spero, censori, salutem <em> dico</em> :’ cum legamus alias, v. c., lib. xvi. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:0">Ephesians 3:0</span> , lib. xiv. ep. 14, <em> dicunt</em> , vel v. c., Ephesians 1-5, <em> dicit.</em> ”

<p><strong> Ἀπφία</strong> is the Latin name Appia, also written Ἀππ ., see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:15">Acts 28:15</span> ; cf. Kühner, Gramm. § 44. She appears to have been the wife of Philemon (Chrys., Thdrt.); certainly, as well as Archippus, she must have belonged to his family, or they would hardly be thus specially addressed in a private letter concerning a family matter.

<p><strong> Ἀρχίππῳ</strong> ] Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+4:17">Colossians 4:17</span> .

<p><strong> συνστρατιώτῃ</strong> ] see reff. and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:3">2 Timothy 2:3</span> . He was perhaps Philemon’s <em> son</em> (so Michael., Olsh., al.): or a family friend ( ἕτερόν τινα ἴσως φίλον , Chrys.: so Thl.): or the minister of the family ( ὁ δὲ Ἄρχιππος τὴν διδασκαλίαν αὐτῶν ἐπεπίστευτο , Thdrt.): the former hypothesis being perhaps the most probable, as the letter concerns a family matter: but see on next clause. To what grade in the ministry he belonged, it is idle to enquire: nor does Col 4:17 furnish us with any data.

<p><strong> τῇ κατ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> οἶκ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐκκλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] This appears to have consisted not merely of the family itself, but of a certain assembly of Christians who met in the house of Philemon: see the same expression in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+4:15">Colossians 4:15</span> , of Nymphas: and in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:3-5">Romans 16:3-5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:19">1 Corinthians 16:19</span> , of Aquila and Prisca.

<p>Meyer remarks the <em> tact</em> of the Apostle in associating with Philemon those connected with his <em> house</em> , but not going <em> beyond</em> the limits of the house. The former part is noticed also by Chrys.: συμπαραλαμβάνει κ . ἕτερον (- ρους ) μεθ ʼ ἑαυτοῦ ὥστε κἀκεῖνον ὑπὸ πολλῶν ἀξιούμενον μᾶλλον εἶξαι κ . δοῦναι τὴν χάριν .</p>
