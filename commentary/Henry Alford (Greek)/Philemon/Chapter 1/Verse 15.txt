<p><strong> 15</strong> .] <strong> τάχα</strong> is delicately said, to conciliate Philemon: so Chrys., καλῶς τὸ <strong> τάχα</strong> , ἵνα εἴξῃ ὁ δεσπότης · ἐπειδὴ γὰρ ἀπὸ αὐθαδείας γέγονεν ἡ φυγὴ κ . διεστραμμένης διανοίας , κ . οὐκ ἀπὸ προαιρέσεως , λέγ <strong> ει τάχα</strong> . And Jerome says, ‘occulta sunt quippe judicia Dei, et temerarium est quasi de certo pronunciare.’ He refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+45:5">Genesis 45:5</span> , where Joseph suggests the purpose which God’s providence had in sending him down into Egypt.

<p><strong> ἐχωρίσθη</strong> ] εὐφήμως καὶ τὴν φυγὴν χωρισμὸν καλεῖ , ἵνα μὴ τῷ ὀνόματι τῆς θυγῆς παροξύνῃ τὸν δεσπότην , Thl.: similarly Chrys.

<p><strong> πρὸς ὥραν</strong> ] much has been built upon this as indicating that the Epistle was written not so far from Colossæ as Rome: but without ground: the contrast is between πρὸς ὥραν and αἰώνιον .

<p><strong> αἰώνιον</strong> agrees with αὐτόν : see reff.: and imports οὐκ ἐν τῷ παρόντι μόνον καιρῷ , ἀλλὰ κ . ἐν τῷ μέλλοντι , as Chrys.

<p><strong> ἀπέχῃς</strong> ] see reff., and note on Mat 6:2 <strong> mayest have him for thine own possess him fully, entirely</strong> . So Antonin., xi. 1, says that the λογικὴ ψυχή does not bear fruit for others to reap, &amp;c., but ὅπου ἂν καταληφθῇ , πλῆρες κ . ἀπροσδεὲς ἑαυτῇ τὸ προτεθὲν ποιεῖ ὥστε εἰπεῖν , Ἐγὼ <strong> ἀπέχω</strong> τὰ ἐμά .</p>
