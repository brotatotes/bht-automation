They became known, not as a matter simply of notoriety, but of notoriety <em> in Christ</em> , i.e. in connexion with Christ’s cause, as endured for Christ’s sake; and thus the Gospel was furthered) <strong> in the whole prætorium</strong> (i.e. the <em> barrack of the prætorian guards</em> attached to the palatium of Nero (Dio liii. 16, καλεῖται δὲ τὰ βασίλεια παλάτιον … ὅτι ἔν τε τῷ Παλατίῳ (monte Palatino) ὁ Καῖσαρ ᾤκει , καὶ ἐκεῖ τὸ στρατήγιον εἶχε . See Wieseler’s note, ii. 403 f.): not the <em> camp</em> of the same outside the city (‘castra prætorianorum,’ Tac. Hist. i. 31: Suet. Tiber. 37). That this was so, is shewn by the greeting sent ch. Php 4:22 from οἱ ἐκ τῆς Καίσαρος οἰκίας , who would hardly have been mentioned in the other case. The word ‘ <em> prætorium</em> ’ is also used of castles or palaces belonging to Cæsar (Suet.

The fact here mentioned <em> may</em> be traced to St. Paul being guarded by a prætorian soldier, and having full liberty of preaching the Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:30">Acts 28:30</span> f.): but more probably his situation had been changed since then, see Prolegg. to this Epistle, § iii. 6. I should now say that the ὅλῳ , and the τοῖς λοιποῖς πᾶσιν , make it more probable that the prætorium is to be taken in the larger acceptation, the quadrangular camp now forming part of Aurelian’s city walls, including also the smaller camp on the Palatine) <strong> and to all the rest</strong> (a popular hyperbole: i.e., to others, besides those in the prætorium: not to be taken (Chr., Thdrt., E.
