<p><strong> 9 11</strong> .] <em> The substance of his prayer</em> (already, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:4">Philippians 1:4</span> , alluded to) <em> for them</em> . <strong> καί</strong> refers back to the δέησις of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:4">Philippians 1:4</span> ; ‘and this is the purport of my prayer.’ At the same time this purport follows most naturally, after the expression of desire for them in the last verse.

<p>There is an ellipsis in the sense between <strong> τοῦτο</strong> and <strong> ἵνα</strong> , τοῦτο introducing the <em> substance</em> of the prayer, ἵνα its <em> aim</em> . See, on <strong> ἵνα</strong> with προσεύχομαι , note, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:13">1 Corinthians 14:13</span> ; and Ellic. here.

<p><strong> ἡ ἀγάπη ὑμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] not, ‘ <em> towards me</em> ,’ as Chrys. ( ὅρα πῶς φιλούμενος ἔτι μᾶλλον ἐβούλετο φιλεῖσθαι ), Thl., Grot., all., nor <em> towards God and Christ</em> (Calov., al.), but either perfectly general, as Ellic., or, ‘towards one another:’ virtually identical with the <strong> κοινωνία</strong> of Php 1:5 In <strong> ἡ</strong> ἀγάπη <strong> ὑμῶν</strong> its existence is recognized; in μᾶλλον καὶ μᾶλλον περισσ ., its deficiency is hinted at. <strong> ἐν</strong> is not to be taken as if ἐπίγνωσις and αἴσθησις were departments of Love, <em> in which it</em> was to increase: but they are rather elements, in whose increase in their characters Love is also, and as a separate thing, to increase: q.d. ‘that your love may increase, but not without an increase in ἐπίγνωσις and αἴσθησις .’ For by these Love is guarded from being ill-judged and misplaced, which, separate from them, it would be: and accordingly, on the increase of these is all the subsequent stress laid.

<p><strong> ἐπίγνωσις</strong> is accurate knowledge of moral and practical truth: <strong> αἴσθησις</strong> , <em> perceptivity</em> of the same, the power of apprehending it: “the contrary of that dulness and inactivity of the αἰσθητήρια τῆς καρδίας ( Jer 4:19 ), which brings about moral want of judgment, and indifference” (Meyer). De W. renders it well, <strong> moral tact</strong> .</p>
