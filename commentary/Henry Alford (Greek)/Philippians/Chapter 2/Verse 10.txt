<p><strong> 10</strong> .] <strong> that</strong> (intent of this exaltation) <strong> in the name of Jesus</strong> (emphatic, as the ground and element of the act which follows) <strong> every knee should bend</strong> (i.e. all prayer should be made (not, as E. V., ‘ <em> at</em> the name of Jesus every knee should bow,’ which surely the words will not bear). But <em> what</em> prayer? <em> to</em> JESUS, or <em> to</em> GOD THROUGH HIM? The only way to answer this question is to regard the general aim of the passage. This undoubtedly is, the <em> exaltation of Jesus</em> . The εἰς δόξαν θεοῦ πατρός below is no deduction from this, but rather an additional reason why we should carry on the exaltation of Jesus <em> until this new particular is introduced</em> . This would lead us to infer that the universal prayer is to be <em> to</em> JESUS. And this view is confirmed by the next clause, where every tongue is to confess that Jesus Christ is κύριος , when we remember the common expression, ἐπικαλεῖσθαι τὸ ὄνομα κυρίου , for prayer: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:12">Romans 10:12</span> f.; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:2">1 Corinthians 1:2</span> ( 2Ti 2:22 ); Acts ( Act 7:59 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:14">Acts 9:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:21">Acts 9:21</span> ; Act 22:16 ), <strong> of those in heaven</strong> (angels. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20-21">Ephesians 1:20-21</span> .

Various erroneous interpretations have been given e.g. Chr., Thl., Œc., Erasm. understand by καταχθ ., the <em> devils</em> and Chr., Thl. give metaphorical meanings, οἱ δίκαιοι κ . οἱ ἁμαρτωλοί ),</p>
