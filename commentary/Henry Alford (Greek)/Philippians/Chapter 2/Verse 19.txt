<p><strong> 19</strong> . <strong> ἐν κυρίῳ</strong> ] ‘my hope is not an idle one, as a worldly man’s might be; but one founded on faith in Christ.’ <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:19">1 Corinthians 15:19</span> , to which Meyer refers, is wholly different: see there.

<p><strong> ὑμῖν</strong> ] The dative after verbs of sending, &amp;c. need not be regarded (as De W., al., here) as the dativus commodi, but is similar to that case after verbs of giving indicating the position of the <em> recipient</em> . I stated in some former editions, that it is in no case equivalent to the mere <em> local</em> πρὸς ὑμᾶς . But Ellic. has reminded me, that this is too widely stated, later writers undeniably using it in this sense. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:16">Acts 21:16</span> , and cf. such examples as πότερον ἠγόμην Ἀβροκόμῃ , Xen. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:6">Ephesians 3:6</span> , and ἤγαγεν αὐτὸν Ἀθανασίῳ τῷ πάππᾳ , Epiph. vit. p. 340 d. See the discussion in Winer, § 31. 5.

<p><strong> κἀγώ</strong> ] ‘as well as you, by your reception of news concerning me.’

<p><strong> εὐψ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> may be of good courage</strong> . The <em> verb</em> is unknown to the classics: the imperative εὐψύχει is found in inscriptions on tombs, in the sense of the Latin ‘ <em> have pia anima</em> .’</p>
