<p><strong> 27</strong> .] <strong> καὶ γάρ</strong> recognizes and reasserts that which has before been put as from another, as “ ἔλεγες τοίνυν δή , ὅτι κ . τ . λ .” “ καὶ γὰρ ἔλεγον , ἔν γε ὄχλῳ .” Plato, Gorg. 459: see Hartung, Partikell. i. 137, <strong> for he really was sick</strong> .

<p><strong> παραπλήσιον</strong> does not involve any ellipsis (De W.) as of ἀφίκετο or the like, but (as Mey.) it stands adverbially as παραπλησίως ; so in Polyb. iii. 33. 10, εἰ πεποιήκαμεν παραπλήσιον τοῖς ἀξιοπίστως ψευδομένοις τῶν συγγραφέων : and <strong> θανάτῳ</strong> is the dative of <em> congruence</em> after it, sometimes a genitive, as Plato, Soph. p. 217, λόγων ἐπελάβου παραπλησίων <strong> ὧν</strong> … διερωτῶντες ἐτυγχάνομεν .

<p><strong> λύπην ἐπὶ λύπην</strong> ] for construction, see reff. The dative after ἐπί is more usual: so φόνος ἐπὶ φόνῳ , Eur. Iph. Taur. 197 (189): the accus. giving the sense of accession, “sorrow coming upon sorrow,” not, sorrow superimposed upon sorrow. The second λύπην refers to his own distress in his imprisonment, so often implied in this Epistle: see Prolegg. § iii. 4, 5: ‘si ad vincula accessisset jactura amici,’ Grot. This is better, than with Chrys., al., to refer it to Epaphroditus’s sickness, τὴν ἀπὸ τῆς τελευτῆς ἐπὶ τῇ διὰ τὴν ἀῤῥωστίαν , which does not agree with ἀλυπότερος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:28">Philippians 2:28</span> , implying that λύπη would remain even after the departure of Epaphroditus.</p>
