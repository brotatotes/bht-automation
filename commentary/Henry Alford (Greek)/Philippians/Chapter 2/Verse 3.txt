<p><strong> 3</strong> .] <strong> μηδὲν</strong> <strong> </strong> <strong> φρονοῦντες</strong> , scil. from the last verse: <strong> entertaining no thought in a spirit of</strong> (according to, after the manner of) <strong> self-seeking</strong> (see note, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:8">Romans 2:8</span> , on the common mistaken rendering of this word), <strong> nor in a spirit of vainglory</strong> ( κενοδοξία , ματαία τις περὶ ἑαυτοῦ οἴησις , Suidas), <strong> but by means of humility of mind</strong> (article either generic or possessive: in the latter case assuming <strong> ταπεινοφροσύνη</strong> as a Christian grace which you possess. The dative is either modal (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:18">Philippians 1:18</span> . Rom 4:20 ), or instrumental, or more properly perhaps, causal: see Ellicott’s note) <strong> esteeming one another superior to yourselves</strong> (i.e. each man his neighbour better than himself); <strong> each</strong> (the plural is only found here in the N. T., and unusual elsewhere: it occurs in Thuc. i. 2, ῥᾳδίως ἕκαστοι τὴν ἑαυτῶν ἀπολείποντες , Hom. Od. i. 164, πολλὸν γὰρ ἐν ἀμφιφορεῦσιν ἕκαστοι ἠφύσαμεν ) <strong> regarding</strong> (cf. both for expressions and sense, Herod. i. 8, πάλαι τὰ καλὰ ἀνθρώποισι ἐξεύρηται … ἐν τοῖσιν ἓν τόδε ἐστί , σκοπέειν τινὰ τὰ ἑωϋτοῦ : Thuc. vi. 12, τὸ ἑαυτοῦ μόνον σκοπῶν ) <strong> not their own matters, but each also the matters of others</strong> (“this second clause (Mey.) is a feebler contrast than might have been expected after the absolute negation in the first.” The καί shews that that first is to be taken with some allowance, for by our very nature, each man must σκοπεῖν τὰ ἑαυτοῦ in some measure). On the nature of the strife in the Philippian church, as shewn by the exhortations here, see Prolegg. § ii. 7.</p>
