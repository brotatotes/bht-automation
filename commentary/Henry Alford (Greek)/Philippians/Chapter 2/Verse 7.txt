<p><strong> 7</strong> .] <strong> but emptied Himself</strong> ( ἑαυτόν emphatic, not ἐκένωο εν ἑαυτόν .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐκένωσεν</strong> , contrast to <strong> ἁρπαγμὸν ἡγήσ</strong> <strong> .</strong> he not only did not <em> enrich</em> himself, but he <em> emptied</em> himself: He used His equality with God as an opportunity, not for self-exaltation, but for self-abasement. And the word simply and literally means, ‘ <em> exinanivit</em> ’ (vulg.) as above. He emptied Himself of the μορφὴ θεοῦ (not His <em> essential</em> glory, but its manifested possession: see on the words above: the glory which He had with the Father before the world began, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span> , and which He resumed at His glorification) He ceased, while in this state of exinanition, to reflect the glory which He had with the Father. Those who understand <strong> ὅς</strong> above of the <em> incarnate</em> Saviour, are obliged to explain away this powerful word: thus Calv., ‘ <em> inanitio hæc eadem est cum humiliatione de qua postea videbimus</em> :’ Calov., ‘ <em> veluti deposuit</em> :’ Le Clerc, ‘ <em> non magis ea usus est, quam si ea destitutus fuisset</em> :’ De W., ‘the manner and form of the κένωσις is given by the three following participles’ ( λαβών , γενόμενος , εὑρεθείς ): alii aliter) <strong> by taking the form of a servant</strong> (specification of the <em> method in which</em> He emptied Himself: not co-ordinate with (as De W., al.) but <em> subordinate to</em> <strong> ἐκένωσεν ἑαυτόν</strong> .
	</p>
<p>The participle <strong> λαβών</strong> does not point to that which has preceded ἑαυτ . ἐκέν ., but to a simultaneous act, = as in εὖ γ ʼ ἐποίησας ἀναμνήσας με (Plato, Phæd. p. 60 D), see Bernhardy, Synt. p. 383, and Harless on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span> . And so of γενόμενος below. The <strong> δοῦλος</strong> is contrasted with ‘equality with God’ and imports ‘ <em> a servant of God</em> ,’ not <em> a servant generally</em> , nor a servant of man and God. And this state, of a <em> servant of God</em> , is further defined by what follows) <strong> being made</strong> (by birth into the world, ‘ <em> becoming</em> :’ but we must not render the general, <strong> γενόμενος</strong> , by the particular, ‘ <em> being born</em> ’) <strong> in the likeness of men</strong> (cf. ἐν ὁμοιώματι σαρκὸς ἁμαρτίας , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span> . He was not a <em> man</em> , <em> purus putus homo</em> (Mey.), but the Son of God manifest in the flesh and nature of men. On the interpretation impugned above, which makes all these clauses refer to acts of Christ, in our <em> nature</em> , this word ὁμοιώματι loses all meaning. But on the right interpretation, it becomes forcible in giving another subordinate specification to μορφὴν δούλου λαβών viz. that He was made in <em> like form</em> to <em> men</em> , who are θεοῦ δοῦλοι ).</p>
