<p><strong> 8</strong> .] My interpretation has hitherto come very near to that of Meyer. But here I am compelled to differ from him. He would join <strong> καὶ σχ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εὑρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὡς ἄνθρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> to the foregoing, put a period at <strong> ἄνθρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , and begin the next sentence by <strong> ἐταπείνωσεν</strong> without a copula. The main objection to this with me, is, the word <strong> εὑρεθείς</strong> . It seems to denote the taking up afresh of the subject, and introducing a new portion of the history. Hitherto of the act of laying aside the form of God, specified to have consisted in μορφὴν δούλου λαβεῖν , and ἐν ὁμ . ἀνθρώπων γενέσθαι . But now we take Him up again, this having past; we <em> find</em> Him in his human appearance and what then? we have further acts of self-humiliation to relate. So Van Hengel: “duo enim, ut puto, diversa hic tradit Paulus, et quamnam vivendi rationem Christus inierit, … et quomodo hanc vivendi rationem ad mortem usque persecutus sit.” <strong> And when He was</strong> (having been) <strong> found in having</strong> (guise, outward semblance; e.g. of look, and dress, and speech. <strong> σχήματι</strong> is a more specific repetition of <strong> ὁμοιώμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> above: and is here <em> emphatic</em> : ‘being found in <em> habit</em> , &amp;c. He did not stop with this outward semblance, but …’) <strong> as a man</strong> (for He was not <em> a man</em> , but God (in Person), with the humanity taken on Him: ὡς ἄνθρωπος ἡ γὰρ ἀναληφθεῖσα φύσις τοῦτο ἦν · αὐτὸς δὲ τοῦτο οὐκ ἦν , τοῦτο δὲ περιέκειτο , Thdrt.) <strong> He humbled himself</strong> (in His humanity: a further act of self-denial. This time, ἑαυτόν does not precede, because, as Meyer well says, in Php 2:7 the pragmatic weight rested on the <em> reflexive reference</em> of the act, but here on the <em> reflexive act</em> itself) <strong> by becoming</strong> (see on the aorist participle above. It specifies, <em> wherein the</em> ταπείνωσις <em> consisted</em> ) <strong> obedient</strong> (to God; as before in the δούλου : not ‘ <em> capientibus se, damnantibus et interficientibus</em> ,’ as Grot. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:19">Romans 5:19</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:8">Hebrews 5:8</span> f., and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9">Philippians 2:9</span> , διὸ καὶ ὁ θεός , referring to the τῷ θεῷ here understood) <strong> even unto</strong> (as far as) <strong> death</strong> (the climax of His obedience, <strong> μέχρι θανάτου</strong> must not be taken with ἐταπείνωσεν , as Beng., al., which breaks the sentence awkwardly), <strong> and that the death of the cross</strong> (on this sense of δέ , see ref., and note there: τουτέστι , τοῦ ἐπικαταράτου , τοῦ τοῖς ἀνόμοις ἀφωρισμένου , Thl.).</p>
