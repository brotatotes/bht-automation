<p><strong> 1</strong> .] He appears to have been closing his Epistle ( τὸ λοιπόν , and reff.), but to have again gone off, on the vehement mention of the Judaizers, into an explanation of his strong term <strong> κατατομή</strong> . Chrys., al., find a connexion with the foregoing, but it is farfetched ( ἔχετε Ἐπαφρ ., δι ʼ ὃν ἤλγειτε , ἔχετε Τιμόθ ., ἔρχομαι κἀγώ . τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἐπιδίδωσι · τί ὑμῖν λείπει λοιπόν ;): the sense is evidently closed with ch. 3:30.

<p><strong> τὰ αὐτά</strong> ] It seems to me that Wiesinger has rightly apprehended the reference of this somewhat difficult sentence. The <strong> χαίρετε ἐν κυρίῳ</strong> , taken up again by the <strong> οὕτως στήκετε ἐν κυρίῳ</strong> , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+4:1">Philippians 4:1</span> , is evidently put here emphatically, with direct reference to the warning which follows <strong> let your joy (your boast) be in the Lord</strong> . And this same exhortation, <strong> χαίρειν</strong> , is in fact the groundtone of the whole Epistle. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:18">Philippians 1:18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:25">Philippians 1:25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:17">Philippians 2:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+4:4">Philippians 4:4</span> , where the <strong> πάλιν</strong> ἐρῶ seems to refer back again to this saying. So that there is no difficulty in imagining that the Apostle may mean χαίρετε by the <strong> τὰ αὐτά</strong> . The word <strong> ἀσφαλές</strong> is no objection to this: because the χαίρ . ἐν κυρ . is in fact an introduction to the warning which follows: a provision, by upholding the antagonist duty, against their falling into deceit. And thus all the speculation, whether <strong> τὰ αὐτά</strong> refer to a lost Epistle, or to words uttered ( γράφειν ?) when he was with them, falls to the ground. And the inference from Polycarp’s words in his Epistle to these Philippians, § 3, p. 1008, ὃς καὶ ἀπὼν ὑμῖν ἔγραψεν ἐπιστολάς , may be a true one, but does not belong here.
