<p><strong> 12</strong> .] <strong> not that</strong> (I do not mean, that …, see reff.) <strong> I have already acquired</strong> (this χριστὸν κερδῆσαι : not the βραβεῖον below (Mey.), which is an image subsequently introduced, whereas the reference here must be to something foregoing, nor τὴν ἀνάστασιν , which has just been <em> stated</em> as an object of his wishes for the future: but as Calv., “nempe ut in solidum communicet Christi passionibus, ut perfectum habeat gustum potentiæ resurrectionis, ut ipsum plane cognoseat”) <strong> or am already completed</strong> (in spiritual perfection. Philo de Alleg. iii. 23, vol. i. p. 101, πότε οὖν , ὦ ψυχή , μάλιστα νεκροφορεῖν σαυτὴν ὑπολήψῃ ; ἆρά γε οὐχ ὅταν τελειωθῇς καὶ βραβείων κ . στεφάνων ἀξιωθῇς ;), <strong> but I pursue</strong> (the image of a runner in a course is already before him. So διώκω absolute in Æsch. Theb. 89, ὄρνυταιλαὸς … ἐπὶ πόλιν διώκων . This is simpler than to suppose that an object, the βραβεῖον , is in his mind, though not expressed. See Ellic.’s note) <strong> if</strong> (nearly = εἴ πως above) <strong> I may also</strong> (besides διώκειν not as Mey., nicht bloss greife ( ἔλαβον ), sondern auch ergreife: nor does it answer to the καί following, as De W.) <strong> lay hold of</strong> (Herod. ix. 58, διωκτέοι εἰσί , ἐς ὃ καταλαμφθέντες … δώσουσι δίκας : Lucian, Hermotim. 77, διώκοντες οὐ κατέλαβον ) <strong> that for which</strong> (this seems the simplest rendering, and has been the usual one. Meyer’s rendering of <strong> ἐφ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ᾧ</strong> ‘ <em> because</em> ,’ after Chrys., Thdrt., Thl., requires καταλάβω to be <em> absolute</em> , and would more naturally be expressed ἐφ ʼ ᾧ κἀγὼ κατελήμφθην , the emphatic first person hardly admitting of being supplied from the preceding clause: whereas on our rendering the whole forms but one clause, the first person recurring throughout it. Grot.’s, ‘quo ut pervenire possem,’ Beza’s, &amp;c., ‘for which reason,’ all keeping <strong> καταλάβω</strong> absolute, are not open to the above objection) <strong> I was also laid hold of</strong> (the <strong> καί</strong> belongs to the verb, not to ἐγώ understood, nor to the ἐφ ʼ ᾧ , as if there might be other ends for which he was apprehended (Ellic.): see above and brings out, that in my case there was another instance of the καταλαβεῖν . For the sense, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span> , ἐπιγνώσομαι καθὼς καὶ ἐπεγνώσθην : and Plato, Tim. p. 39, τῇ δὴ ταὐτοῦ φορᾷ τὰ τάχιστα περμόντα ὑπὸ τῶν βραδυτέρων ἰόντων ἐφαίνετο καταλαμβάνοντα καταλαμβάνεσθαι . The time referred to by the aorist was his <em> conversion</em> : but we need not, as Chrys., al., press the image of the race, and regard him as <em> flying</em> and <em> overtaken</em> ) <strong> by Christ</strong> .</p>
