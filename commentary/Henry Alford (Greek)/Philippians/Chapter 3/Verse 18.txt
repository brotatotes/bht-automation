<p><strong> 18</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (reason for σκοπεῖτε κ . τ . λ . in the form of warning against others who walk differently) <strong> many walk</strong> (no need to supply any thing, as κακῶς (Œc.), or ‘ <em> longe aliter</em> ’ (Grot.), nor to understand the word ‘ <em> circulantur</em> ,’ as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:8">1 Peter 5:8</span> (Storr, al., but inconsistently with Php 3:17 ), still less with Calv. ‘ <em> ambulant terrena cogitantes</em> ’ (ungrammatical: <strong> οἱ</strong> τὰ ἐπίγ . φρ .): or to consider the sentence as broken off by the relative clause (De W., al.); for <strong> περιπατοῦσιν</strong> is a ‘verbum indifferens,’ as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:17">Philippians 3:17</span> , τοὺς <strong> οὕτως</strong> περιπ .) <strong> whom I many times</strong> (answers to πολλοί ) <strong> mentioned to you</strong> (viz. when I was with you) <strong> but now mention even weeping</strong> ( διὰ τί ; ὅτι ἐπέτεινε τὸ κακόν , ὅτι δακρύων ἄξιοι οἱ τοιοῦτοι … κλαίει τοίνυν ὁ Παῦλος ἐφ ʼ οἷς ἕτεροι γελῶσι καὶ σπαταλῶσιν . οὕτως ἐστὶ συμπαθητικός , οὕτω φροντίζει πάντων ἀνθρώπων . Chrys.), <strong> the enemies</strong> (the article designates the particular class intended) <strong> of the cross of Christ</strong> (not, as Thdrt., Luth., Erasm., all., of the <em> doctrine</em> of the Cross: nor is there any reason to identify these with those spoken of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:2">Philippians 3:2</span> . Not Judaistic but Epicurean error, not obliquity of creed but of practice, is here stigmatized. And so Chrys., ἐπειδή τινες ἦσαν ὑποκρινόμενοι μὲν τὸν χριστιανισμόν , ἐν ἀνέσει δὲ ζῶντες <strong> κ</strong> <strong> .</strong> τρυφῇ · τοῦτο δὲ ἐναντίον τῷ σταυρῷ ), <strong> of whom perdition</strong> (everlasting, at the coining of the Lord: see ch. Php 1:28 ) <strong> is the</strong> (fixed, certain) <strong> end; of whom their belly is the god</strong> (cf. the boast of the Cyclops, in Eurip. Cycl. 334 ff., ἃ ʼ γὼ οὔ τινι θύω , πλὴν ἐμοί , θεοῖσι δ ʼ οὔ , | καὶ τῇ μεγίστῃ γαστρὶ τῇδε δαιμόνων | ὡς τοὐμπιεῖν γε καὶ φαγεῖν τοὐφ ʼ ἡμέραν , | Ζεὺς οὗτος ἀνθρώποισι τοῖσι σώφροσιν . Seneca de benef. vii. 26, ‘alius abdomini servit’) <strong> and their glory in their shame</strong> (“ <strong> ἡ δόξα</strong> is subjective, in the judgment of these men, and τῇ αἰσχύνῃ objective, according to the reality of morals. Cf. Polyb. xv. 23. 5, ἐφ ʼ οἷς ἐχρῆν αἰτχύνεσθαι καθ ʼ ὑπερβολήν , ἐπὶ τούτοις ὡς καλοῖς σεμνύνεσθαι καὶ μεγαλαυχεῖν . On εἶναι ἐν , ‘ <em> versari</em> ,’ to be found in, or contained in, any thing, cf. Plato Gorg. 470 E, ἐν τούτῳ ἡ πᾶσα εὐδαιμονία ἐστίν , Eur. Phœn. 1310, οὐκ ἐν αἰσχύνῃ τὰ σά .” Meyer.

<p>Ambr., Hil., Pel., Aug., Beng., al., refer the expression to circumcision, taking another meaning for αἰσχύνη (‘venter et pudor sunt affinia.’ Beng.), but without reason; and Chrys., al., disown the meaning), <strong> who regard</strong> (it is not easy to give φρονεῖν , φρόνημα , in this sense, by one word in English. They betoken the whole aspect, the <em> set</em> of the thoughts and desires: τὰ ἐπίγεια , are the substratum of all their feelings) <strong> the things on earth</strong> (in opposition to the things above, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+3:1">Colossians 3:1</span> ff. The construction is that of logical reference to the subject of the sentence, setting aside the strictness of grammatical connexion: so Thuc. iii. 36, ἔδοξεν αὐτοῖς … ἐπικαλοῦντες …, and iv. 108; vi. 24; vii. 42: see more examples in Kühner, ii. 377.
