<p><strong> 15, 16</strong> .] <em> Exhortation to them to be unanimous in following this his example</em> . In order to understand this somewhat difficult passage, we must remember (1) that the description of his own views and feelings which he holds up for their imitation ( συμμιμηταί μου γίν .) began with having no confidence in the flesh, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:4">Philippians 3:4</span> , and has continued to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:14">Philippians 3:14</span> . Also (2) that the description commencing with <strong> ὅσοι οὖν τέλειοι</strong> , is taken up again from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3">Philippians 3:3</span> , ἡμεῖς γάρ ἐσμεν ἡ περιτομή , οἱ πνεύματι θεοῦ λατρεύοντες , κ . καυχώμενοι ἐν χ . Ἰησοῦ , κ . οὐκ ἐν σαρκὶ πεποιθότες . These two considerations will keep us from narrowing too much the <strong> τοῦτο φρονῶμεν</strong> , and from misunderstanding the <strong> ὅσοι οὖν τέλειοι</strong> . <strong> As many of us then</strong> (refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3">Philippians 3:3</span> ; see above) <strong> as are perfect</strong> (mature in Christian life, = those described above, Php 3:3 ), <strong> let us be of this mind</strong> (viz. that described as entertained by himself, Php 3:7-14 ): <strong> and if in any thing</strong> (accusative of reference: see Kühner, Gramm. ii. 220 ff.) <strong> ye be differently minded</strong> (for ἑτέρως , cf. Od. α . 232 ff., μέλλεν μέν ποτε οἶκος ὅδ ʼ ἀφνειὸς κ . ἀμύμων | ἔμμεναι , ὄφρ ʼ ἔτι κεῖνος ἀνὴρ ἐπιδήμιος ἦεν | νῦν δ ʼ <strong> ἑτέρως</strong> ἐβάλοντο θεοί , κακὰ μητιόωντες : Demosth. p. 298. 22, εἰ μέν τι τῶν δεόντων ἐπράχθη , τὸν καιρόν , οὐκ ἐμέ φησιν αἴτιον γεγενῆσθαι , τῶν δ ʼ ὡς <strong> ἑτέρως</strong> συμβάντων ἁπάντων ἐμὲ καὶ τὴν ἐμὴν τύχην αἰτίαν εἶναι . Hence it gives the meaning of diversity in a bad sense. The difference referred to seems to be that of too much self-esteem as to Christian perfection: see below), <strong> this also</strong> (as well as the rest which he has revealed) <strong> will God reveal to you</strong> (i.e. in the progress of the Christian life, you will find the true knowledge of your own imperfection and of Christ’s all-sufficiency revealed to you by God’s Spirit, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span> ff. ὅρα πῶς συνεσταλμένως τοῦτό φησιν . ὁ θεὸς ὑμᾶς διδάξει , τουτέστιν , ὑμᾶς πείσει , οὐχὶ διδάξει ἁπλῶς . ἐδίδασκε μὲν γὰρ ὁ Παῦλος , ἀλλ ʼ ὁ θεὸς ἐνῆγε . καὶ οὐκ εἶπεν , ἐνάξει , ἀλλ ʼ ἀποκαλύψει , ἵνα δόξῃ μᾶλλον ἀγνοίας εἶναι τὸ πρᾶγμα . οὐ περὶ δογμάτων ταῦτ ʼ εἴρηται , ἀλλὰ περὶ βίου τελειότητος , κ . τοῦ μὴ νομίζειν ἑαυτοὺς τελείους εἶναι · ὡς ὅγε νομίζων τὸ πᾶν εἰληφέναι , οὐδὲν ἔχει .

<p><strong> τοῦτο</strong> must not be taken as Œc., Grot., &amp;c. as representing <em> the fact, that ye</em> <strong> ἑτέρως φρονεῖτε</strong> , but is <em> the thing, respecting which</em> ye ἑτ . φρ .).</p>
