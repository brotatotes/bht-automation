<p><strong> οὐχ ὅτι</strong> ] See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:12">Philippians 3:12</span> ; <strong> my meaning is not, that</strong> … καθ ʼ, <strong> according to</strong> , i.e. <strong> in consequence of</strong> see reff., and Od. γ . 106, πλαζόμενοι κατὰ ληΐδ ʼ: Herod. ii. 152, κατὰ ληΐην ἐκπλώσαντας : Thuc. vi. 31, κατὰ θέαν ἥκειν : not, as Van Hengel, ‘ <em> ut more receptum est penuriæ</em> ,’ which would be κατὰ τοὺς ὑστεροῦντας (see Rom 3:5 al.).

<p><strong> For I</strong> (emphatic: <strong> for my part</strong> , whatever others may feel) <strong> learned</strong> (in my experience, my training for this apostolic work: not ‘ <em> have learned</em> :’ the aorist is much simpler and more humble ‘I was taught:’ the present result of this teaching comes below, οἶδα , but not in this word), <strong> in the state in which I am</strong> (not ‘ <em> in whatsoever state I am</em> ’ (E. V.: which would be ἐν οἷς ἂν εἰμί , cf. ὅπου ἂν εἰσεπορεύετο , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:56">Mark 6:56</span> , ὅσοι ἂν ἥπτοντο αὐτοῦ , ib. Winer, § 42. 3. <em> a</em> ), nor as Luther, bei welchen ich bin ( οἷς masculine), which is against the context. But <strong> ἐν οἷς εἰμί</strong> does not apply only to the Apostle’s <em> present circumstances</em> , but to any <em> possible</em> present ones: ‘ <em> in which I am at any time</em> :’ see next verse) <strong> to find competence</strong> (we have no word for αὐτάρκης . ‘ <em> Self-sufficing</em> ’ will express its meaning of independence of external help ( τελειότης κτήσεως ἀγαθῶν , Plato, Def. p. 412), but is liable to be misunderstood: ‘ <em> competent</em> ’ is not in use in this sense, though the abstract noun <strong> competence</strong> is: the German genügsam gives it well).</p>
