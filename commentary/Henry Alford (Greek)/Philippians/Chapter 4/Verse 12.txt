See Ellic.’s note) <strong> how to be brought low</strong> (generally: but here especially by <em> need</em> , in humiliation of circumstances.

<p>Meyer remarks that <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:8">2 Corinthians 4:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:9-10">2 Corinthians 6:9-10</span> , are a commentary on this), <strong> I know also</strong> ( καί as before, or as an addition to <strong> οἶδα καὶ ταπεινοῦσθαι</strong> ) <strong> how to abound</strong> ( ὑψοῦσθαι , as Wies. remarks, would be the <em> proper</em> general opposite: but he chooses the special one, which fits the matter of which he is treating): <strong> in every thing</strong> (not as vulg., E. V., all., ‘ <em> every where</em> ,’ nor ‘ <em> at every time</em> ,’ as Chrys., Grot., nor both, as Thl., &amp;c.: but as usually in St. Paul: see ref. and note) <strong> and in all things</strong> (not, as Luth., Beng., ‘ <em> respectu omnium hominum</em> :’ ἐν παντὶ πράγματί , φησι , κ . ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς παρεμπίπτουσι , Œc.: the expression conveys <em> universality</em> , as ‘ <em> in each and all</em> ,’ with us) <strong> I have been taught the lesson</strong> (‘ <em> initiated</em> :’ but no stress to be laid, as by Beng., ‘disciplina arcana imbutus sum, ignota mundo:’ see the last example below. Beware (against Wiesinger) of joining <strong> μεμύημαι</strong> with <strong> ἐν παντὶ κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐν πᾶσιν</strong> , <em> initiated in, &amp;c.</em> ; the verb is (against Ellicott) not constructed with ἐν , but with an accusative of the person and the thing ( μυεῖν τινά τι ), which last accusative remains with the passive: so μ ʼ ἀνὴρ ἐμύησ ʼ Ἑλικωνίδα , Anthol. ix. 162, οἱ τὰς τελετὰς μεμυημένοι , Plato, Symp. p. 209. The present construction, with an infinitive, occurs, Alciphr. ii. 4, κυβερνᾷν μυηθήσομαι ) <strong> both to be satiated and to hunger</strong> (the forms πεινᾷν , διψᾷν , for - ῇν , seem to have come in with Macedonian influence: being found first in Aristotle; see Lobeck in Phryn. p. 61), <strong> both to abound and to be in need</strong> .</p>
