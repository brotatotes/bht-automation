This he specifies by <strong> ὅτε ἐξῆλθον ἀπὸ Μακεδονίας</strong> . See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:14">Acts 17:14</span> .

Similar usages of λῆψις κ . δόσις occur: e.g. Artemid. i. 44, οἱ διὰ δόσεως κ . λήψεως ποριζόμενοι : Arrian, Epict. ii. 9, τὸν φιλάργυρον ( ἐπαύξουσιν ) αἱ ἀκατάλληλοι λήψεις κ . δόσεις : Cicero, Lælio 16, ‘ratio acceptorum et datorum.’ See Wetst.) <strong> but you only:</strong></p>
