The hint which Chrys., al., find here, εἰ γὰρ οἱ ἐν τοῖς βασιλείοις πάντων κατεφρόνησαν διὰ τὸν βασιλέα τῶν οὐρανῶν , πολλῷ μᾶλλον αὐτοὺς χρὴ τοῦτο ποιεῖν , is alien from the simplicity of the close of an Epistle. The reason of these being specified is not plain: the connexion perhaps between a <em> colonia</em> , and some of the imperial household, might account for it.</p>
