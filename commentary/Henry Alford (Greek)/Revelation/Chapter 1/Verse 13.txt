I will not deny that the anarthrous use of this title may mark out less sharply our Lord himself than the use with the articles; but in N. T. Greek we should be no more justified in rendering υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου in such a connexion as this, “a son of man,” than πνεῦμα θεοῦ , “a spirit of God.” That meaning would doubtless have been here expressed by τοις υἱοῖς τῶν ἀνθρώπων . The same remarks apply to ref. Dan.), <strong> clothed in a garment reaching to the feet</strong> (see the reff. in Dan. and Ezek., which the description and even the diction closely resemble. The χιτὼν ποδήρης , <em> vestis talaris</em> , was a sign of high rank or office: “sunt enim vestes pendulæ et laxæ, apud Persas imprimis, regum nobilium et sacerdotum insigne, cf.

Dan., Gabriel has his <em> loins</em> girt with gold of Uphaz. Bengel, and after him Züllig and De Wette, suppose a distinction the girding round the loins betokening activity, while that round the breast is a sign of repose. But Hengst. well observes that this would hardly apply: for Christ is here in fulness of energy as ruler and orderer of His Church. Ebrard seems nearer the truth in regarding the higher girding as a sign of majesty. But perhaps after all the point is not to be pressed; for the angels in ch. Rev 15:6 are also girt περὶ τὰ στήθη . Nor is the golden girdle distinctive of regal majesty: for this they also bear, ibid.
