<p><strong> 2</strong> .] <strong> who testified of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, whatsoever things he saw</strong> (these words must, in all fairness of construction, be referred to this present book, and not, as by some of the older Expositors, and recently by Ebrard, to the Gospel of St. John. The reasons given by Ebrard for such reference will not hold. He objects to ἐμαρτύρησεν being taken of this book, that such a use of the aor. would be peculiar to the Epistolary style, whereas this book, though containing Epistles, is not itself an Epistle. Even were the usage thus confined, it might be answered from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span> , that the whole <em> is</em> in an Epistolary form. But the usage is not thus confined, as every scholar knows. Witness Thucyd. i. 1, Θουκυδίδης Ἀθηναῖος ξυνέγραψε τὸν πόλεμον κ . τ . λ . Again, Ebrard objects that the sense thus obtained would be a strange one: “God gave the Revelation to Christ; He signified it by His angel to John, which last hereby makes it known.” But I own I am unable to see any strangeness in it. It seems to me the obvious way in which a faithful account of this Revelation would be prefaced by its Writer. On the other side, the objections to Ebrard’s reference are to me insuperable. First, as to its <em> introduction with the simple relative</em> ὅς . We may safely say that had any previous writing or act been intended, we should have had <strong> ὃς καί</strong> , or in St. John’s simple style, even more than this, ὃς καὶ τὸ πρότερον , or ὃς καὶ ἐν ἄλλῳ βιβλίῳ . The ὅς as it stands, I submit, carries on the action, and does not identify John as the same who at a previous time did some other action. Next, as to the <em> things witnessed</em> . The words ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ κ . ἡ μαρτυρία Ἰ . χρ . cannot with any likelihood be taken to mean “the (personal) Word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ;” for why, if the former term refer to Christ personally, should He be introduced in the second member under a different name? Besides, the words occur again below, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span> , as indicating the reason why John was in the island Patmos; and there surely they cannot refer to his written Gospel, but must be understood of his testimony for Christ in life and words: moreover, ἡ μαρτυρία Ἰησοῦ is itself otherwise explained in this very book, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span> . But there is yet another objection to the supposed reference to the Gospel, arising from the last words, ὅσα εἶδεν . First, the very adjective <strong> ὅσα</strong> refutes it. For the Evangelist distinctly tells us, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:30">John 20:30</span> , that in writing his Gospel, he did not set down ὅσα εἶδεν , but only a portion of the things which Jesus did in the presence of His disciples, whereas in the case of this Revelation it was otherwise: he set down all which he saw, as a faithful transmitter of the Apocalyptic vision to the churches. But still more does the verb εἶδεν carry this refutation. In no place in the Gospel does St. John use this verb of his eye-witnessing as the foundation of his testimony; indeed he only uses it of himself at all on two occasions, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:40">John 1:40</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:8">John 20:8</span> . But in this book, it is the word in regular and constant use, of the seeing of the Apocalyptic visions; being thus used in it no less than 55 times. And some of these usages are such that there can be no doubt this place is connected with them; e. g., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:19">Revelation 1:19</span> , γράψον οὖν ἃ εἶδες , and the repetition itself so frequently occurring καὶ εἶδον καὶ ἰδού . Taken then as representing the present book, τὸν λόγον here will be the aggregate of οἱ λόγοι <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span> ; ἡ μαρτυρία Ἰης . χρ . will be the πνεῦμα τῆς προφητείας , embodied in writing for the Church in all ages).</p>
