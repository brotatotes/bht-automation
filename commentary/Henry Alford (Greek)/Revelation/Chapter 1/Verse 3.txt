<p><strong> 3</strong> .] <strong> Blessed is</strong> (or <em> be</em> , in the ordinary meaning of μακάριος : not necessarily referring on to eternal blessedness, as Hengst.) <strong> he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the prophecy and observe the things written in it; for the time is near</strong> (it can hardly be reasonably denied that in the ὁ ἀναγινώσκων and the οἱ ἀκούοντες , the Apostle had in his mind the one public reader and the many hearers. Ebrard attempts to deny this, but it seems to me unsuccessfully. His instance of St. John’s passing from a singular to a plural, πᾶς ὀφθαλμός , καὶ οἵτινες αὐτὸν ἐξεκέντησαν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:7">Revelation 1:7</span> , would be applicable only if we had here πᾶς ὁ ἀναγινώσκων . Considering that no <em> such</em> transition is elsewhere found, we can hardly escape the inference that it was intended. And so the great majority of Commentators: so Andreas (“plures uno legente possunt audire,” Gloss. ord.), Bed [2] (“doctores et auditores”), <strong> Lyra</strong> (“ <em> qui legit</em> , quantum ad doctores: <em> qui audiunt</em> , quantum ad discipulos”), &amp;c.: Bengel (“unus, ille primum, per quem Johannes librum ex Patmo in Asiam misit, legebat publice in ecclesiis, et multi audiebant”), Ewald, Hengst., De Wette, Stern, Gräber, &amp;c. Others have explained the change of number variously: e. g., Beza, ex Hebraismo; Cotter (in Pool), “quia soli legimus, audimus conjuncti:” Ribera, “quoniam multo plures audiunt, quam legunt:” &amp;c. If the words are to be understood as above, they form at least a solemn rebuke to the practice of the Church of England, which omits with one or two exceptions the whole of this book from her public readings. Not one word of the precious messages of the Spirit to the Churches is ever heard in the public services of a Church never weary of appealing to her <em> Scriptural</em> liturgies. Surely it is high time, that such an omission should be supplied. Notice that not three classes of persons, but two only, are here indicated: he that reads, and they that hear and do. Had there been an article before τηροῦντες , these latter would have formed a separate class from the ἀκούοντες .

<p>The E.

The <em> time being near</em> makes the book of the more importance, and the blessedness of reading and observing it greater. The <em> nearness</em> spoken of is to be understood as the ἐν τάχει , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:1">Revelation 1:1</span> , which see. We know little now of relative nearness and distance in point of time: when the day of the Lord shall have opened our eyes to the true measure, we shall see, how near it always was).

<p>CH. Rev 1:4 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+3:22">Revelation 3:22</span> .] INTRODUCTION TO THE PROPHECY, in the form of a <em> sevenfold Epistle</em> to the seven churches of Asia. And herein, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4-6">Revelation 1:4-6</span> , <em> address and greeting</em> , ending with <em> doxology</em> . (Ebrard, who seems to love singularity for its own sake, objects to the above arrangement, because the sevenfold epistle has not yet begun, and prefers calling this a dedicatory title to the whole book. But the other view is far simpler and better. The sevenfold Epistle is clearly before St. John’s mind, and, full of the images of the vision which he had seen, he only interrupts it by solemn ejaculatory references to the glories of that vision and the sublime announcement of the Lord’s coming, and then hastens on to introduce it by a prefatory account of his own circumstances when the Epistles were entrusted to him and of the appearance of the Lord who thus entrusted them.) <strong> John to the seven churches which are in Asia</strong> (the form of address is exactly that in the Epistles of St. Paul: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span> ff., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span> ff., &amp;c. That St. Paul in Rom. and elsewhere is careful to designate himself and his office, and St. John introduces himself without any such designation, belongs doubtless in part to the individual character of the two Apostles, but is besides a strong testimony that the John who here writes needed no such designation in the eyes of those to whom he was writing. See this, and other evidence as to the authorship, urged in the prolegomena. See on the seven churches prolegg. § iii. 7 ff. <strong> Ἀσία</strong> , as always in the N. T., is the proconsular province so called. “Constabat, ut a Cicerone alicubi dicitur illa proconsularis Asia, quæ inter præcipuas Romani orbis provincias olim habita, ex Phrygia, Mysia, Caria, Lydia; sub quibus insuper, sub Mysia nempe et Lydia, intelligi debent Ionia et Æolis, ac addi præterea vicinæ maris Ægæi insulæ. Qui amplissimus terrarum tractus, præ aliis Romani orbis provinciis, ingenti imprimis urbium, et multarum ex iis insignium et magnarum, numero gaudebat. Dicebatur Proconsularis, quod eadem a viro consulari sub Proconsulis nomine regebatur.” Spanheim de usu numismatum, p. 610 (from Hengstenb.)); <strong> grace be to you and peace</strong> (so St. Paul in all his Epistles except the two to Timothy) <strong> from Him who is and who was and who is to come</strong> (a paraphrase of the unspeakable name יהוה , resembling the paraphrase אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:14">Exodus 3:14</span> , for which the Jerusalem Targum has, as here, <em> qui fuit, est, et erit</em> : as has the Targum of Jonathan in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+32:39">Deuteronomy 32:39</span> , Schemoth R. 3. f. 105. 2: “Dixit Deus S. B. ad Mosen: Ego fui et adhuc sum, et ero in posterum.” Schöttg., Wetst., De Wette. “ <strong> ὁ ἐρχόμενος</strong> , <strong><em> instants</em></strong> , i. e., <em> futurus</em> : ut Marc. 10:30. Caret lingua Hebræa participio quale est ἐσόμενος .” Ewald. Each of the appellations by itself is to be regarded as a proper name ὁ ὤν , ὁ ἦν (not ὃ ἦν : the imperf. or aor. being used in the lack of a past participle of εἰμί ), and ὁ ἐρχόμενος : and it follows from what is remarked above that the meaning of ἐρχόμενος is not here to be pressed as referring to any future <em> coming</em> , any more than in its English representative, “He that is <em> to come</em> .” By doing so we should confuse the meaning of the compound appellation which evidently is all to be applied to the Father, ὡς αὐτοῦ περιέχοντος ἐν ἑαυτῷ πάντων τῶν ὄντων τὴν ἀρχὴν καὶ τὰ μέσα καὶ τὰ τελευταῖα , as the second alternative in the Catena. In the first (Arethas?) ὁ ὤν is supposed to mean the Father ( ἐγὼ εἰμὶ <strong> ὁ ὤν</strong> , as said to Moses), ὁ ἦν the Son ( ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος ), and ὁ ἐρχόμενος the Spirit, as ever proceeding forth and descending on the Church. Hengstenb., who presses the literal sense of ἐρχόμενος , avoids this confusion, but falls into that of making the covenant Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit, come to judge the world and the Church. At least so it would seem: for when he comes to this the weak part of his exegesis, he obscures his meaning by raising a cloud of rhetorical description of what shall take place at that coming. He connects ἐρχόμενος with ἰδοὺ ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν νεφ . below, in spite of the καὶ ἀπὸ … καὶ ἀπό intervening. It is needless to say, that that ἔρχεται is to be referred to the last subject only, viz. to Ἰησοῦς χριστός . And wherever the ἔρχομαι ταχύ , with which he also connects it, occurs, it is distinctly said of the glorified Saviour), <strong> and from the seven spirits which</strong> ( <strong> are</strong> ) <strong> before His throne</strong> (Andreas, in catena, takes these for the seven principal angels (ch. Rev 8:2 ): so Clem.-Alex [3] , Beza, Lyra, Ribera, Hammond, Bossuet, Wetst., al. But this is highly improbable, as these angels are never called πνεύματα , and as surely mere creatures, however exalted, would not be equalized with the Father and the Son as fountains of grace. The common view is doubtless right, which regards the seven as τὰς ἐνεργείας τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος (so τινές in catena: Andr [4] , Victorin [5] , Primas [6] , al.): “Thou the anointing Spirit art, Who dost thy sevenfold gifts impart:” but rather perhaps to be regarded as expressing His plenitude and perfection, than to be separately assigned as (but qu.?) in the following lines of the hymn Veni Creator Spiritus. The key to this expression, which is an anticipation of the visions afterwards to be related, is ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span> , where see notes: as also on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+4:5">Revelation 4:5</span> . The ἑπτά can hardly be entirely without allusion to the ἑπτὰ ἐκκλησίαι , and to the <em> sevenfold</em> imagery throughout. The number seven denotes completeness, and, as Schöttgen shews h. 1., was much noted by the Jewish Commentators as occurring in the O. T. The seven spirits betoken the completeness and universality of working of God’s Holy Spirit, as the seven churches typify and indicate the whole church. The reference to Isa 11:2 is but lamely made out, there being there but <em> six</em> energies of the Spirit mentioned. That to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:2">Zechariah 4:2</span> ; Zec 4:10 is more to the point: see notes as above.

<p>The <strong> ἅ</strong> , without its verb, is solœcistic), <strong> and from Jesus Christ</strong> (as we have before had the Father and the Holy Spirit mentioned as the sources of grace and peace; so now the Son, coming last, on account of that which is to follow respecting Him: “quia de illo continuanda erat oratio,” Vitr., who also notices that what follows has respect to His threefold office of Prophet, King, and Priest: see however below), <strong> the faithful witness</strong> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:37">John 18:37</span> , εἰς τοῦτο ἐλήλυθα εἰς τὸν κόσμον , ἵνα μαρτυρήσω τῇ ἀληθείᾳ . It is to the general mission of the Redeemer to bear witness to the truth, and not merely to the apocalyptic portion of His testimony which is to follow (De W.), that this title must be referred. This book ( Rev 1:2 ) is ἡ μαρτυρία Ἰησοῦ χρ .: but the <em> title</em> reaches far wider. Embracing as it does that μαρτυρία before Pontius Pilate, and indeed that of His whole life of witnessing to the truth, we can perhaps hardly say that it marks out his prophetic office with sufficient distinctness for us to believe it indicated here), <strong> the first-born of the dead</strong> (death is regarded as the womb of the earth, from which the resurrection is the birth: see note on ref. Col.: and Act 2:24 note. <strong> πρωτότοκος</strong> must not with Hengst. be diluted into πρῶτος . The ἀπαρχὴ τῶν κεκοιμημένων , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:20">1 Corinthians 15:20</span> , is quite a different figure), <strong> and the Ruler of the kings of the earth</strong> (this kingly office of Christ is reached through his death and resurrection. In Ps. 88:27, the combination of titles is much as here, κἀγὼ πρωτότοκον θήσομαι αὐτόν , ὑψηλὸν παρὰ τοῖς βασιλεῦσι τῆς γῆς . See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:4">Isaiah 55:4</span> , ἰδοὺ μαρτύριον ἐν ἔθνεσιν ἔδωκα αὐτόν , ἄρχοντα καὶ προστάσσοντα ἔθνεσιν . “That which the Tempter held forth to Jesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:8">Matthew 4:8</span> , on condition of worshipping him, He has now attained by the way of his humiliation unto death: viz. victory over the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33">John 16:33</span> .” De Wette). Now follows, consequent upon the glorious titles of Christ which have been enumerated, an ascription of praise to Him for His inestimable love to us. <strong> Unto Him that loveth us</strong> ( <strong> ἀγαπῶντι</strong> , <em> present</em> part., not imperf. as Bengel, includes in itself ἀγαπήσαντι , which is the feebler, as it is the more obvious reading. It is His ever-abiding character, that He loveth His own, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1">John 13:1</span> ; out of that love sprang the mighty act of love which follows: but it did not exhaust its infinite depth: it endures now, as then. The waiting till He become, in the unfolding of the Father’s purposes, the acknowledged Head over his Church, is in reality as great a proof of that love now, as the Cross was then) <strong> and washed</strong> ( <strong> or, loosed</strong> ) <strong> us from our sins in His blood</strong> (the aor. points to a definite event, viz. his sacrifice of Himself. In such an image as this, which occurs again ch. Rev 7:14 we have enwrapped together the double virtue of the atoning blood of Christ in justification, the deliverance from the guilt of sin, and sanctification, the deliverance from the power of sin: the forensic and the inherent purity, of both which it is the efficient medium: of the former by its application in faith, of the latter by such faith, in its power, uniting us to Him who is filled with the Spirit of holiness. See 1Jn 1:7 and note),</p>
