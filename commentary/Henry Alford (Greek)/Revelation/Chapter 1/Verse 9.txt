<p><strong> 9</strong> .] <em> Description of the Writer, and of the place where the Revelation was seen</em> . <strong> I John</strong> (so again ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+22:8">Revelation 22:8</span> ; so <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+8:1">Daniel 8:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+9:2">Daniel 9:2</span> ; Dan 10:2 ) <strong> your brother</strong> (no inference can be drawn against the apostleship of the Writer from this his designation of himself. Indeed from his entire silence respecting himself in his Gospel, we may well believe that here, where mention of his name was absolutely required, it would be introduced thus humbly and unobtrusively), <strong> and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus</strong> (the construction and arrangement are peculiar. The conjunction of these terms seems to be made to express, a partaker, as in the kingdom, so in the tribulation and endurance which are in and by Christ: but the insertion of βασιλείᾳ between θλίψει and ὑπομονῇ is startling, and the effect of it must be to make the construction zeugmatic, <strong> ἐν</strong> χρ . Ἰ . not properly belonging to βασιλείᾳ . It can hardly be that the words are, as De W., “ <em> ordnungslos neben einander gestellt</em> .” More probably, the tribulation brings in the kingdom ( Act 14:22 ), and then as a corrective to the idea that the kingdom in its blessed fulness was yet present, the ὑπομονή is subjoined. “Tres hæreditatum uncias introducit Johannes, quibus se participem ostendit. Sed media harum, i. e. regnum, possideri non potest, nisi et hic tribulatio exercuerit, et illic patientia defenderit.” Ambr [8] Ansbert), <strong> was</strong> (“ <em> befand mich</em> :” not = ἦν , which announces the simple fact. When an <em> event</em> is notified with ἐγένετο , we express the meaning by “came to pass:” when a <em> person</em> , we have no word which will do it) <strong> in the island which is called Patmos</strong> (see Prolegomena, § ii. par. 4) <strong> on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus</strong> (the substantives form the same expression as occurred before <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:2">Revelation 1:2</span> , where see note. There they indicated <em> this</em> portion of the divine word and testimony, of which John was a faithful reporter. Whether their meaning is the same here, will depend partly on what sense we assign to the prep. <strong> διά</strong> <strong> .</strong> In St. Paul’s usage, as in reff., it would here signify <em> for the sake of</em> , i. e. for the purpose of receiving: so that the Apostle would thus have gone to Patmos by special revelation in order to receive this ἀποκάλυψις . Again, keeping to this meaning of <strong> διὰ</strong> , these words may mean, that he had visited Patmos in pursuance of, for the purposes of, his ordinary apostolic employment, which might well be designated by these substantives. And such perhaps would have been our acceptation of the words, but that three objections intervene. 1) From what has preceded in this verse, a strong impression remains on the mind that St. John wrote this in a season of tribulation and persecution. Why should he throw over his address this tinge of suffering given by the θλῖψις and ὑπομονή , if this were not the case? De W. will not allow this: but to my mind Hofmann is quite right in pressing it (Weiss. u. Erfull. ii. 308). 2) The usage of our Writer himself in two passages where he speaks of death by persecution (reff.) shews that with him διὰ in this connexion is “ <em> because of</em> ,” “ <em> in consequence of</em> .” De W. naively says that had it not been for these parallel places, such a meaning would never have been thought of here. We may as simply reply, that owing to those parallel places, it must be accepted here. St. John’s own usage is a better guide in St. John’s writings than that of St. Paul. And Origen’s ear found no offence in this usage, for he incorporated it into his own sentence, … κατεδίκασε τὸν Ἰωάννην μαρτυροῦντα διὰ τὸν τῆς ἀληθείας λόγον εἰς Πάτμον τὴν νῆσον . See the passage, Prolegg. § i. par. 12. 3) An early patristic tradition relates that St. John was banished to Patmos. See the authorities in the Prolegg. ut supra, and the question discussed, whether we are justified in ascribing this tradition solely to our present passage. These considerations, mainly those arising from the passage itself, compel us, I believe, to understand the words of an exile in Patmos).
