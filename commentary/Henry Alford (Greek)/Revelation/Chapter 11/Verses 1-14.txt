<p>CH. Rev 10:1 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+11:14">Revelation 11:14</span> .] EPISODICAL AND ANTICIPATORY. As after the sixth seal, so here after the sixth trumpet, we have a passage interposed, containing two episodes, completing that which has been already detailed, and introducing the final member of the current series. But it is not so easy here as there, to ascertain the relevance and force of the episodes. Their subjects here seem further off: their action more complicated. In order to appreciate them, it will be necessary to lay down clearly the point at which we have arrived, and to observe what is at that point required.
	</p>
<p>The last vision witnessed the destruction of a third part of the ungodly by the horsemen from the East, and left the remainder in a state of impenitent idolatry and sin. Manifestly then the prayers of the saints are not yet answered, however near the time may be for that answer. If then this Episode contains some assurance of the approach of that answer in its completeness, it will be what we might expect at this point in the series of visions.
	</p>
<p>At the same time, looking onwards to the rest of the book, we see, that as out of the more general series of visions at the opening of the seals, affecting both the church and the world, there sprung a new and more particular series of the trumpets, having reference to one incident in the former vision, and affecting especially the “inhabiters of the earth,” so if now the gaze of prophecy once more turns to the church and her fortunes, and the Apostle receives a new commission to utter a second series of prophecies, mainly on that subject, it will also be no more than what we might fairly look for.
	</p>
<p>Again: if the episodical vision in its character and hue partakes of the complexion of the whole series of trumpet-visions, and, as regards the church, carries a tinge of persecution, and of the still crying prayer for vengeance, not yet fully answered, while at the same time it contains expressions and allusions which can only be explained by reference onward to the visions yet to come; this complex character is just that which would suit the point of transition at which we are now standing, when the series of visions immediately dependent on one feature in the opening of the seals is just at its end, and a new one evolving the other great subject of that general series is about to begin.
	</p>
<p>Now each one of these particulars is found as described above. For 1) the angel of ch. 10 declares, with reference to the great vengeance-burden of the whole series of the trumpet-visions, respecting which the souls of the martyrs had been commanded ἵνα ἀναπαύσωνται ἔτι χρόνον μικρόν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+6:11">Revelation 6:11</span> , that χρόνος οὐκέτι ἔσται , but that in the days of the seventh angel, when he is about to blow, the whole mystery of prophecy would be fulfilled.
	</p>
<p>2) The same angel gives to the Seer the open little book, with a distinct announcement that he is to begin a new series of prophecies, and that series, by what immediately follows, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+11:1">Revelation 11:1</span> ff., evidently relating to the church of God in an especial manner.
	</p>
<p>3) The whole complexion of the episodical vision of the two witnesses, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+11:3">Revelation 11:3</span> ff., is tinged with the hue which has pervaded the series of trumpet-visions, from their source in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9-11">Revelation 6:9-11</span> , viz. that of vengeance for the sufferings of the saints: while at the same time allusions occur in it which are at present inexplicable, but will receive light hereafter, when the new series of visions is unfolded. Such are the allusions to τὸ θηρίον τὸ ἀναβαῖνον ἐκ τῆς ἀβύσσου , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+11:7">Revelation 11:7</span> , and to ἡ πόλις ἡ μεγάλη , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+11:8">Revelation 11:8</span> .
	</p>
<p>With these preliminary considerations, we may, I think, approach these episodical visions with less uncertainty.</p>
