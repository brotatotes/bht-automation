<p><strong> 1 5</strong> .] <em> The Lamb on Mount Sion, and his hundred and forty-four thousand</em> . <strong> And I saw, and beheld the Lamb</strong> (viz., the same which before was seen in the midst of the throne, ch. Rev 5:6 al.) <strong> standing upon</strong> (see on this accus., when the super-position is first mentioned, note, ch. Rev 4:2 ) <strong> the mount Sion</strong> (as in ch. 11, the holy city is introduced as the seat of God’s true Church and worship, so by a similar figure (not the same, for thus Mount Sion would be outside the ναός , and thus given to the Gentiles) the holy mountain Sion is now chosen for the site of the display of God’s chosen ones with Christ, the Son of David, whose city Sion was), <strong> and with Him an hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father</strong> (observe the tacit assumption that all understand Who is imported by the Lamb) <strong> written on their foreheads</strong> (first observe the contrast: the nations of the earth, constrained to receive the mark of the beast on their forehead and hand, and the Lamb’s elect, marked with His name and that of His Father. The question next meets us, Are these 144,000 identical with the same number in ch. Rev 7:4 ? This question clearly must not be answered merely by the absence of a defining article here, to identify these χιλιάδες as those there spoken of. For it might well be, that the reader should be meant to identify the two in his mind, by recognizing the marks common to the two, without the note of identification being expressly set in the text. The presumption certainly is that the same number occurring here, representing as there the elect and first-fruits of the church, here as there also inscribed on their foreheads with the seal of God in the one case, and His Name in the other, must be descriptive of the same body of persons. And this view, if acquiesced in here, will reflect back considerable light on that former vision of the sealing in ch. 7. Those, as these, will represent the first-fruits or choice ones among God’s people, as indeed we have treated them in this commentary, and not the totality of those who shall form the great multitude which no man can number. These, as those, are taken to represent the people of God: their introduction serves to place before us the church on the holy hill of Sion, where God has placed His King, as an introduction to the description of her agency in preaching the everlasting Gospel, and her faithfulness amidst persecutions). <strong> And I heard a voice out of heaven as a voice of many waters</strong> (reff.), <strong> and as a voice of great thunder</strong> (ch. Rev 6:1 ): <strong> and the voice which I heard</strong> ( <strong> was</strong> ) <strong> as of harpers harping with</strong> (the ἐν of investiture, cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+6:8">Revelation 6:8</span> , Rev 9:19 and notes) <strong> their harps. And they sing</strong> [ <strong> as it were</strong> ] <strong> a new song</strong> (i. e. if the ὡς be retained, they sing what sounded like a melody unheard before. The subject to ᾄδουσιν is of course not the 144,000, but the heavenly harpers. On the subject of their song, see below) <strong> before the throne and before the four living-beings and the elders</strong> (the whole heavenly symbolism remaining as before, while the visions regarding God’s temple and Mount Sion and the holy city are going forward. I would call the attention of the reader to the fact, essential to the right understanding of the vision, that the harpers and the song are in heaven, the 144,000 on earth): <strong> and no one was able to learn the song</strong> (to apprehend its melody and meaning, so as to accompany it and bear a part in the chorus) <strong> except the hundred and forty-four thousands who</strong> (the gender is πρὸς τὸ σημαινόμενον , see ref.) <strong> were purchased</strong> (reff. and Rev 14:4 ) <strong> from the earth</strong> (the song has regard to matters of trial and triumph, of deep joy and heavenly purity of heart, which none other among men but these pure and holy ones are capable of apprehending. The sweetest and most skilful harmonies convey no pleasure to, nor are they appreciated by an uneducated ear: whereas the experienced musician finds in every chord the most exquisite enjoyment. The unskilled ear, even though naturally distinctive of musical sounds, could not learn nor reproduce them: but both these can be done by those who have ears to hear them. Even so this heavenly song speaks only to the virgin heart, and can be learnt only by those who accompany the Lamb whithersoever He goeth). <strong> These are they who were not</strong> (the aor. shews that their course is ended and looked back on as a thing past: and serves to confute all interpretations which regard them as representing saints while in the midst of their earthly conflict and trial) <strong> defiled with women</strong> (see below); <strong> for they are</strong> (always were and have kept themselves till the time present) <strong> virgins</strong> (there are two ways of understanding these words. Either they may be figurative, merely implying that these pure ones lived in all chastity, whether in single or in married life, and incurred no pollution (ref. 2 Cor.): or they may be meant literally, that these purest ones had lived in that state of which St. Paul says <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span> , καλὸν ἀνθρώπῳ γυναικὸς μὴ ἅπτεσθαι . And as between these two meanings I conceive that the somewhat emphatic position of μετὰ γυναικῶν goes some way to decide. It is not ἐμολύνθησαν , the fact of impurity in allowed intercourse, but μετὰ γυναικῶν , that is put forward, the fact of commerce with women. I would therefore believe that in the description of these who are the first-fruits from the earth, the feature of virginity is to be taken in its literal meaning. Nor need any difficulty be found in this. It is on all hands granted that he who is married in the Lord enters into holy relations of which the single have no experience, and goes through blessed and elevating degrees of self-sacrifice, and loving allowance, and preferring others before himself. And as every step of grace assured is a step of glory secured, there is no doubt that the holy married servants of God shall have a peculiar entrance into the fulness of that future Kingdom’s employ, which will not be the lot of the single: seeing that in this matter also, the childhood of this state will be the father of the manhood of that one. But neither on the other hand can it be denied that the state of holy virginity has also its peculiar blessings and exemptions. Of these, the Apostle himself speaks of that absence of distraction from the Lord’s work, which is apt to beset the married, busy as they are with the cares of a household and with pleasing one another. And another and primary blessing is, that in them that fountain of carnal desire has never been opened, which is so apt to be a channel for unholy thoughts and an access for the tempter. The virgins may thus have missed the victory over the lusts of the flesh: but they have also in great part escaped the conflict. Theirs is not the triumph of the toil-worn and stained soldier, but the calm and the unspottedness of those who have kept from the strife. <em> We</em> are perhaps more like that which the Lord intended us to be: but they are more like the Lord Himself. And if He is to have round Him a peculiar and closer band, standing with Him on Mount Sion, none will surely grudge this place to those who were not defiled with women. Among these will be not only those who have lived and served Him in holy virginity, but also the dear children whom He has claimed from us for Himself, the youths and maidens who were gathered to His side before the strife began: before their tongues had learned the language of social falsehood, or their good names been tarnished with the breath of inevitable calumny. There is one meaning which these words will not bear, and which it is surprising that any Commentator should ever have attached to them; viz. that μετὰ γυναικῶν refers to the woman mentioned below, ch. 17. So Bp. Wordsworth, Lectures, p. 284: “They have not been defiled with women. What women? it may be asked. If we proceed, we read of the woman seated on the Beast, and of the harlotry of the woman, with whom the Kings of the earth commit fornication. And soon we see her displayed in all her meretricious splendour. There then is the reply.” Similarly in his notes ad loc. The fact, that an indefinite plural sometimes points to a singular, is, as in all other figures of speech, substantiated by the undoubted requirements of the particular context: whereas here the whole context is against it: the following παρθένοι γάρ εἰσιν carrying its decisive condemnation): <strong> these</strong> ( <strong> are</strong> ) <strong> they that follow the Lamb wheresoever</strong> (for this use of ὅπου , see reff.) <strong> he goeth</strong> ( <strong> ἄν</strong> seems to have lost its peculiar force, and to have been joined to the ὅπου preceding, so that an indicative after it did not offend the ear.

<p>The description has very commonly been taken as applying to the entire obedience of the elect, following their Lord to prison and to death, and wherever He may call them: so Cocceius, Grot., Vitringa, Wolf (who cites the oath of soldiers, ἀκολουθεῖν τοῖς στρατηγοῖς ὅπου ποτ ʼ ἄν ἄγωσιν ), Bengel, De Wette, Hengstb., Ebrard: but this exposition is surely out of place here, where not their life of conflict, but their state of glory is described. The words, as Aug [115] (in a beautiful passage, De sancta Virginitate, c. 27, vol. vi. p. 410 f., in which however he rhetorically mingles both meanings), Andreas, Züllig, Stern, Düsterd., are used of special privilege of nearness to the Person of the Lamb in glory): <strong> these were purchased from men as a first-fruit to God and to the Lamb</strong> (all have been thus purchased: but these specially as and for the purpose of being a first-fruit. The ref. James treats of a different matter, the purchase of all the redeemed as the first-fruits of creation. But these are a first-fruit among the purchased themselves), <strong> and in their mouth was not found falsehood: they are blameless</strong> (the Apostle has before him the words of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:1">Psalms 14:1</span> ff., so strikingly similar: τίς κατασκηνώσει ἐν τῷ ὄρει τῷ ἁγίῳ σου ; πορευόμενος ἄμωμος , … λαλῶν ἀλήθειαν ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ , ὃς οὐκ ἐδόλωσεν ἐν γλώσσῃ αὐτοῦ . These stand on Mount Sion, with Him who eminently fulfilled this character, and being in all things like Him).
