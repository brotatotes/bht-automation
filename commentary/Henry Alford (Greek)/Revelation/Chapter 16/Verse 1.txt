The words ἐκ τοῦ ναοῦ may have been erased (as in var. readd.) from the difficulty presented by τοῦ θεοῦ below, none being able to enter during the pouring out of the vials) <strong> saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God into the earth</strong> (so, previous to the series of trumpets, the angel casts the fire from the altar into the earth, ch. Rev 8:5 ).</p>
