<p><strong> 4 7</strong> .] <strong> And the third poured out his vial into the rivers and the fountains of the waters: and they became</strong> (it is quite impossible, in the lax construction of the Apocalyptic Greek, to maintain here a distinction, as Düsterd. has done, from the previous ἐγένετο , and to render here, “there came blood.” Analogy must be our guide: and the account to be given of the singular is either that it belongs to τὰ ὕδατα , or that the rivers and fountains are taken together, and regarded as neuter in sense though not in construction) <strong> blood</strong> (that the fact was so, is testified by what follows, in which it is assumed that the sources of ordinary drink have become blood). <strong> And I heard the angel of the waters</strong> (i. e. the angel who was set over the waters; see reff.: not as Grot., “vocatur angelus aquarum quia in aquas immisit phialam.” Schöttgen, h. l., p. 1131 f., gives examples of angels of the earth and of the sea: see also Wolf, h. l. This is more probable than Düsterd.’s idea that the analogy to be followed is that of the four living-beings, and that the angel <em> symbolized</em> the waters) <strong> saying, Thou art righteous who art and wast</strong> (as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+11:17">Revelation 11:17</span> , the καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος is omitted. For the construction, see reff.) <strong> holy</strong> (I incline against Düsterd., to the usual connexion, viz. the making ὅσιος belong to ὁ ὢν κ . ὁ ἦν , and not in apposition with δικαιος . And that which moves me to it is, 1) the extreme improbability of two epithets, δίκαιος and ὅσιος , both being predicated in such an acknowledgment of an act of justice: and 2) that as I have taken it, it best agrees with the ὅσιος in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+15:4">Revelation 15:4</span> , where it is predicated of God not as the result of any manifested acts of His, but as an essential attribute confined to Him alone), <strong> because Thou didst judge thus</strong> (lit., “these things:” viz. the issue mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+16:4">Revelation 16:4</span> ; the turning the drinking-water into blood: “Thou didst inflict this judgment”): <strong> because</strong> (this <strong> ὅτι</strong> repeats the former ὅτι , καί (following being “ <em> and</em> :” not, as it might be taken, “ <em> because they, &amp;c., Thou hast also</em> ”) <strong> they shed the blood of saints and prophets, and Thou hast given them blood to drink</strong> (on the form of the inf., πεῖν , see Winer, edn. 6, § 15, and Anthol. xi. 140. 3, οἷς οὐ σκῶμμα λέγειν , οὐ πεῖν φίλον ): <strong> they are worthy</strong> (these words are made stronger by their asyndetous character). <strong> And I heard the altar saying</strong> (certainly the simplest understanding of these words is, that they involve a personification of the altar. On the altar are the prayers of the saints, offered before God: beneath the altar are the souls of the martyrs crying for vengeance: when therefore the altar speaks, it is the concentrated testimony of these which speaks by it), <strong> Even so, Lord God Almighty: true</strong> (reff.) <strong> and just are Thy judgments</strong> .</p>
