<p>CH. Rev 18:1 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span> .] THE DESTRUCTION OF BABYLON. And herein, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+18:1-3">Revelation 18:1-3</span> .] <em> Announcement of the destruction</em> . The Seer does not see the act of destruction: it is prophesied to him in ch. 17, and now announced, as indeed it had been by anticipation before, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span> , as having taken place. <strong> After these things I saw another angel</strong> (another besides the one who shewed him the vision in the last chapter: or, perhaps, as it is natural to join the ἄλλον in some measure with the participle following, another besides the last who came down from heaven, ch. Rev 10:1 ) <strong> coming down out of heaven</strong> (the Seer is still on the earth) <strong> having great power</strong> (possibly, as Elliott suggests, as the executor of the judgment that he announced. If so, the announcement is still anticipatory, see Rev 18:21 ), <strong> and the earth was lighted up by his glory</strong> ( <strong> ἐκ</strong> , as the source of the brightness): <strong> and he cried with</strong> (or, <strong> in</strong> ) <strong> a mighty voice saying, Babylon the great is fallen</strong> [ <strong> is fallen</strong> ], <strong> and is become an habitation of dæmons</strong> (see especially LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+34:14">Isaiah 34:14</span> ff.), <strong> and a hold</strong> (a place of detention: as it were an appointed prison) <strong> of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hated bird</strong> (see the prophecy respecting Babylon, Jer 50:39 ): <strong> because by</strong> ( <strong> out of</strong> , as source: or, according to the other reading, <strong> of</strong> ) <strong> the wrath of her fornication all the nations have fallen</strong> (or, according to the other reading, <strong> drunk</strong> : see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span> . The use of the θυμός is even more remarkable here: of (or, by) that wine of her fornication which has turned into wrath to herself), <strong> and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth became rich out of the quantity</strong> ( <strong> δύναμις</strong> , copia, as Vitringa, who remarks, “alluditur ad Hebræam vocem חיל , cujus hæc significationis vis est, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="job+31:25">Job 31:25</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+28:4">Ezekiel 28:4</span> .” We have πλούτου μεγάλου δύναμιν in Jos. Antt. iii. 2. 4) <strong> of her luxury</strong> ( <strong> στρῆνος</strong> , see reff. and note on 1 Tim., seems properly to mean the exuberance of strength, the flower of pride).</p>
