<p>CH. Rev 17:1 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span> .] THE JUDGMENT OF BABYLON. And herein, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1-6">Revelation 17:1-6</span> .] <em> The description of Babylon under the figure of a drunken harlot, riding on the beast</em> . <strong> And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials</strong> (we are not told which of the seven, and it is idle to enquire. The seventh has been conjectured, because under the outpouring of his vial Babylon was remembered) <strong> and talked with me saying, Hither</strong> (see reff.), <strong> I will shew thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon</strong> [ <strong> the</strong> ] <strong> many waters, with whom the kings of the earth</strong> ( <strong> have</strong> ) <strong> committed fornication, and they who inhabit the earth have been made drunk from the wine</strong> ( <strong> ἐκ</strong> , the wine having been the source of their drunkenness) <strong> of her fornication</strong> (the figure here used, of a harlot who has committed fornication with secular kings and peoples, is frequent in the prophets, and has one principal meaning and application, viz. to God’s church and people that had forsaken Him and attached herself to others. In eighteen places out of twenty-one where the figure occurs, such is its import; viz. in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:21">Isaiah 1:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:20">Jeremiah 2:20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:1">Jeremiah 3:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:6">Jeremiah 3:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:8">Jeremiah 3:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:15-16">Ezekiel 16:15-16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:28">Ezekiel 16:28</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:31">Ezekiel 16:31</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:35">Ezekiel 16:35</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:41">Ezekiel 16:41</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+23:5">Ezekiel 23:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+23:19">Ezekiel 23:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+23:44">Ezekiel 23:44</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ho+2:5">Hosea 2:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ho+3:3">Hosea 3:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ho+4:15">Hosea 4:15</span> ( Mic 1:7 ). In three places only is the word applied to heathen cities: viz. in Isa 23:15-16 to Tyre, where, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+17:17">Revelation 17:17</span> , it is also said, “she shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth:” and in Nah 3:4 to Nineveh, which is called the well-favoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts. And there the threat is pronounced of a very similar ruin to that which befalls Babylon here. So that the Scripture analogy, while it points to unfaithfulness and treachery against God’s covenant, also brings to mind extensive empire and wide-spread rule over the kingdoms of the earth. It is true, that as far as <em> the image itself</em> is concerned, pagan Rome as well fulfils its requirements as Tyre and Nineveh. It will depend on subsequent features in the description, whether we are to bound our view with her history and overthrow. Still, it will not be desirable to wait for the solution of this question till we arrive at the point where those features appear: for by so doing much of our intermediate exegesis will necessarily be obscured. The decisive test then which may at once be applied to solve the question, is derived from the prophecy of the destruction of Babylon in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+18:2">Revelation 18:2</span> . It is to be laid utterly waste, and to “become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.” Now no such destruction as this has yet befallen Rome, unless her transfer from pagan to papal rule be such a destruction, and the Pope and his ecclesiastics be described in the above terms. In an eloquent passage of Vitringa, he presses Bossuet with this dilemma. Again, it is said of this harlot, μεθ ʼ ἧς ἐπόρνευσαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς . But we may ask, if this be pagan Rome, who and what are these kings, and what is indicated by her having been the object of their lustful desires? In the days of Imperial Rome, there were no independent kings of the earth except in Parthia and Persia. Rome in her pagan state, as described for the purpose of identification in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+17:18">Revelation 17:18</span> , was not one who intrigued with the kings of the earth, but ἡ ἔχουσα βασιλείαν ἐπὶ τῶν βασιλέων τῆς γῆς : she reigned over them with undisputed and crushing sway.
	</p>
<p>I do not hesitate therefore, induced mainly by these considerations, which will be confirmed as we proceed step by step in the prophecy, to maintain that interpretation which regards papal and not pagan Rome as pointed out by the harlot of this vision. The subject has been amply discussed by many expositors. I would especially mention Vitringa, and Bp. Wordsworth.
	</p>
<p>The “sitting upon many waters” is said of Babylon in Jer. in reff., but has here a symbolical meaning; see below, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+17:15">Revelation 17:15</span> . On the ἐμεθύσθησαν see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span> . The same thing is said of Babylon in Jer. l. c. But there she herself is the cup in the Lord’s hand). <strong> And he</strong> (the angel) <strong> carried me away to the wilderness</strong> (not, as Elliott, al., and even Düsterd., “a wilderness.” Such inferences from the absence of the art. in this later Greek, never secure, are more than ever unsafe when a preposition precedes: and the usage of the LXX should have prevented any such rendering here. In no fewer than twenty places (see Tromm.) they use the word ἔρημος anarthrously, where there can be no question that “ <em> the wilderness</em> ” is the only rendering. In fact it may be questioned whether the expressly indefinite rendering, “ <em> a</em> wilderness,” is ever justifiable, except in case of predication, or junction with an adjective, without some further indication than the mere omission of the definite article after a preposition. Had it been intended here, we may safely say that εἰς τόπον ἔρημον , or εἰς τόπον τινὰ ἔρημον would have been used. The most natural way of accounting for the Seer being taken into the wilderness here, is that he was to be shewn Babylon, which was in the wilderness, and the overthrow of which, in the prophecy from which come the very words ἔπεσεν ( πέπτωκεν , LXX) Βαβυλών ( Isa 21:9 ), is headed τὸ ὅραμα <strong> τῆς ἐρήμου</strong> . So that by the analogy of prophecy, the journey to witness the fall of Babylon would be εἰς ἔρημον . The question of the identity of this woman with the woman in ch. 12 is not affected by that of the identity of this wilderness with that) <strong> in the spirit</strong> (see reff., and note on ch. Rev 1:10 ): <strong> and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast</strong> (this beast is introduced as if a new appearance: but its identity with that mentioned before, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span> ff., is plain as the description goes onward. For not to mention the features which the two have in common, this beast, as soon as described, is ever after mentioned as τὸ θηρίον : and in ch. Rev 19:19-20 the identity is expressly established. For there we read, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+19:19">Revelation 19:19</span> , that the beast and the kings of the earth make war against the Lamb, which beast can be no other than this on which the woman rides, cf. our <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+19:12-14">Revelation 19:12-14</span> : and in the next verse, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span> , we read that <em> the beast was taken, and the false prophet who did miracles before him</em> , which beast can be no other than that of ch. 13. See Rev 19:14 there. The identity of the two is therefore matter not of opinion, but of demonstration. The differences in appearance doubtless are significant. That with which we are now concerned, the scarlet colour, is to be understood as belonging not to a covering on the beast, but to the beast itself. It is akin to the colour of the dragon ( πυῤῥός ), but as that is the redness of fire (see however ch. Rev 6:4 ), so is this of blood, with which both the beast and its rider are dyed. It was the colour, see ref. Heb., of the wool to be used in sprinkling the blood of sacrifice. There may be an allusion to the Roman imperial purple: for the robe which was put on our Lord in mockery was κόκκινος , ref. Matt. But this is more probably conveyed by its own proper word in the next verse.
	</p>
<p>By the woman <em> sitting</em> on the wild-beast, is signified that superintending and guiding power which the rider possesses over his beast: than which nothing could be chosen more apt to represent the superiority claimed and exercised by the See of Rome over the secular kingdoms of Christendom), <strong> full of names of blasphemy</strong> (for the construction with accus., see reff., and Winer, edn. 6, § 32. 5. The names of blasphemy, which were found before on the heads of the beast only, have now spread over its whole surface. As ridden and guided by the harlot, it is tenfold more blasphemous in its titles and assumptions than before. The heathen world had but its Divi in the Cæsars, as in other deified men of note: but Christendom has its “most Christian” and “most faithful” Kings, such as Louis XIV. and Philip II.; its “Defenders of the faith,” such as Charles II. and James II.; its society of unprincipled intriguers called after the sacred name of our Lord, and working Satan’s work “ad majorem Dei gloriam;” its “holy office” of the Inquisition, with its dens of darkest cruelty; finally its “patrimony of St. Peter,” and its “holy Roman Empire;” all of them, and many more, new names of blasphemy, with which the woman has invested the beast. Go where we will and look where we will in Papal Christendom, names of blasphemy meet us. The taverns, the shops, the titles of men and of places, the very insurance badges on the houses, are full of them), <strong> having seven heads and ten horns</strong> (as in its former appearance, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span> ; inherited from the dragon, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+12:3">Revelation 12:3</span> . These are presently interpreted: we now return to the description of the woman herself). <strong> And the woman was clothed in purple</strong> (St. John’s own word, even to its peculiar form, see reff., for the mock-imperial robe placed on our Lord: and therefore bearing probably here the same signification; but not in mockery, as Bed [121] , “fucus simulati regiminis:” for the empire is real) <strong> and scarlet</strong> (see above. This very colour is not without its significance: witness the Cardinals, at the same time the guiding council of the Church and princes of the State), [ <strong> and</strong> ] <strong> gilded with gold and with</strong> (the κεχρυσωμένη is zeugmatically carried on) <strong> precious stone and with pearls</strong> (this description needs no illustration for any who have witnessed, or even read of, the pomp of Papal Rome: which, found as it is every where, is concentrated in the city itself), <strong> holding a cup of gold in her hand full of abominations and of the impure things</strong> (the change of construction is remarkable: for such it must be accounted, and not, with Düsterd., the accus. governed by ἔχουσα . It seems to be made, not to avoid an accumulation of genitives, as Hengstb., but to mark a difference between the more abstract designation of the contents of the cup as βδελύγματα , and the specification of them in the concrete as τὰ ἀκάθαρτα κ . τ . λ .) <strong> of her fornication</strong> (this cup is best taken altogether symbolically, and not as the cup in the Mass, which, however degraded by her blasphemous fiction of transubstantiation, could hardly be called by this name, and moreover is <em> not given</em> , but <em> denied</em> by her to the nations of the earth. That she should have represented herself in her medals as holding forth this cup (with the remarkable inscription, “sedet super universam;” see Elliott, vol. iv. p. 30, plate), is a judicial coincidence rather than a direct fulfilment), <strong> and</strong> ( <strong> having</strong> ) <strong> upon her forehead a name written</strong> (as was customary with harlots: so Seneca, Controv. i. 2, in Wetst.: “Stetisti puella in lupanari:.… nomen tuum pependit a fronte: pretia stupri accepisti:” and Juv. Sat. vi. 123 of Messallina, “Tunc nuda papillis Constitit auratis, titulum mentita Lyciscæ”), <strong> Mystery</strong> (is this word part of the name, or not? On the whole it seems more probable that it is. For though no such word would in the nature of things be attached to her forehead as part of her designation, so neither would the description which follows Βαβυλὼν ἡ μεγάλη , to which the word μυστήριον seems partly to refer. But whether part of the name or not, the meaning will be the same: viz. that the title following is to be taken in a spiritual and an enigmatical sense: compare ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span> , and 2Th 2:7 ), <strong> Babylon the great, the mother of the harlots and of the abominations of the earth</strong> (i. e. not only first and greatest of these, but herself the progenitress and origin of the rest. All spiritual fornication and corruption are owing to her, and to her example and teaching). <strong> And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus</strong> (as the Seer contemplates the woman, he perceives that she is drunken: and from what is revealed to him, and from her symbolic colour of blood, he assigns the cause of that intoxication. Wetst. quotes Plin. H. N. xiv. 28, “quo facile intelligitur ebrius jam sanguine civium, et tanto magis eum sitiens”). <strong> And I wondered, when I saw her, with great wonder</strong> (what was the ground of the Seer’s astonishment? One doubtless might be assigned, which would at once account for any degree of such emotion. If this woman is the same as he before saw, who fled into the wilderness from the face of the dragon, “the faithful city become an harlot” ( Isa 1:21 ), he might well wonder. And certainly there is much in favour of such a supposition. It has been taken up by some considerable expositors, such as Auberlen (Der Prophet Daniel, pp. 278 ff.), who has argued earnestly but soberly for it. There is one objection to it, which has been made more of in this place than perhaps it deserves. It is, that in the Angel’s replication to St. John’s wonder, no allusion is made to this circumstance as its principal ground. But, it may well be replied, this would be just what we might expect, if the fact of identity were patent. The Seer, versed in the history of man’s weakness and depravity, full of O. T. prophetic thoughts and sayings, would need no solution of the fact itself: this would lie at the ground of his wonder, and of the angel’s explanation of the consequences which were to follow from it. Auberlen very properly lays stress on the fact, that the joint symbolism of the wilderness and the woman could not fail to call up in the mind of the Seer the last occasion when the two occurred together: and insists that this symbol must be continuous throughout. Without going so far as to pronounce the two identical, I think we cannot and ought not to lose sight of the identity of symbolism in the two cases. It is surely meant to lie beneath the surface, and to teach us an instructive lesson. We may see from it two prophetic truths: first, that the church on earth in the main will become apostate and faithless, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:8">Luke 18:8</span> ; and secondly, that while this shall be so, the apostasy shall not embrace the whole church, so that the second woman in the apocalyptic vision should be <em> absolutely</em> identical with the first. The identity is, in the main, not to be questioned: in formal strictness, not to be pressed. This being so, I should rather regard St. John’s astonishment as a compound feeling, occasioned partly by the enormity of the sight revealed to him, partly also by the identity of the symbolism with that which had been the vehicle of a former and altogether different vision).
