An account of them will be found in Vitringa, Apocalypsis Johannis, &amp;c. pp. 27 58: and (but scantily, as most interpreters pass over them but slightly) in the introductions to the principal Commentaries.

An address to the angel of the church, always commencing with οῖδα , introducing a statement of its present circumstances: continuing with an exhortation either to repentance or to constancy: and ending with a prophetic announcement, mostly respecting what shall be at the Lord’s coming. 4. A promise made to ὁ νικῶν , generally accompanied with a solemn call to earnest attention, ὁ ἔχων οὖς κ . τ . λ .</p>
