<p><strong> 1 7</strong> .] THE EPISTLE TO THE CHURCH AT EPHESUS. See Prolegg. § iii. 7. To <strong> the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These things saith he that holdeth fast</strong> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+2:25">Revelation 2:25</span> , ch. Rev 3:11 ) <strong> the seven stars in his right hand</strong> (cf. Joh 10:28 ), <strong> He that walketh in the midst of the seven candlesticks of gold</strong> (assertions of Christ’s being the Lord, the Governor and the Upholder of His Church, agreeably to the vision of ch. 1.: coming in suitably in this first Epistle, as beginning the complete number): <strong> I know</strong> (am aware of: not as Lyra, “ <em> id est, approbo</em> .” The context determines this to be the fact here, but not this word. The ἔργα might be <em> bad</em> ones, see Joh 3:19 ) <strong> thy works</strong> (so in all the Epistles, except those to Smyrna and Pergamum) <strong> and thy labour</strong> (reff.) <strong> and endurance</strong> ( <strong> κόπος</strong> and <strong> ὑπομονή</strong> form the active and the passive sides of the energizing Christian life. The omission of the σου after τὸν κόπον serves to bind the two together in one. They are epexegetic, in fact, of ἔργα ; cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:58">1 Corinthians 15:58</span> ; these being the resulting fruits of κόπος and ὑπομονή , see ch, Rev 14:13 ), <strong> and that thou canst not bear</strong> (reff.) <strong> evil men</strong> (on κακός and πονηρός , see note, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+16:2">Revelation 16:2</span> . These are here regarded as a burden, an incubus, which the Ephesian church had thrown off. The assertion is as yet general: it is particularized in the next clause) <strong> and didst try</strong> (make experiment of, rather than put to the test, which is δοκιμάζειν , 1Jn 4:1 ) <strong> those who call themselves apostles and are not, and didst find them false</strong> (this is deeply interesting in connexion with St. Paul’s prophetic caution, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28-30">Acts 20:28-30</span> . That which he foretold had come to pass, but they had profited by his apostolic warning): <strong> and hast endurance, and didst bear</strong> (them, while trying them; or perhaps the verb is used absolutely) <strong> for my Name, and hast not been weary</strong> (there is a seeming inconsistency in οἶδα τὸν κόπον σου … καὶ οὐ κεκοπίακες , which caused those who were not aware of St. John’s use of the last word (reff.) to alter the sentence as in var. readd. “Novi laborem tuum, nec tamen laboras, i. e. labore non frangeris.” Beng. ἀντὶ τοῦ οὐκ ἀπεκαρτέρησας , οἱονεί , οὐκ ἀπηγόρευσας , οὐ προδέδωκας , οὐκ ἐλιποτάκτησας διὰ τὸ ὄνομά μου , Areth [17] in Catena). <strong> Howbeit I have</strong> (nothing need be supplied: the following clause is the object to ἔχω ) <strong> against thee</strong> (reff.) <strong> that thou hast left</strong> (deserted; or let go: see reff.) <strong> thy love which was at first</strong> (towards whom? Arethas, in Cat., understands τὴν πρὸς τοὺς πγησίον χορ - ηγίαν : Grot. similarly, “multum remisisti de prima illa cura circa pauperes:” Calov., “sedula cura et vigilantia cum fervore ac zelo pro verbi divini puritate adversus pseudoprophetas:” Eichhorn, strangely enough, “quod nimis morose et severe coerces improbos doctores:” Heinrichs, De Wette, and Ebrard think it is <em> brotherly love</em> which is meant. But there can I think be little question that the language is conjugal, and the love, as Aretius, Ansbert (“casti sponsi dilectionem abjecisti”), Vitringa, Züllig, Hengstenb., Düsterd., Stern (but applying it all to the bishop personally), al., the first fervent chaste and pure love of the newly-wedded bride: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span> .

<p><strong> τὴν πρώτην</strong> must not be taken as if it were comparative ( <em> priorem</em> ), but literally. In what particular the Ephesian church had left her first love, is not stated. Perhaps, as Ansbert, “dilectione sæculi æstuabat:” or, seeing that it is negative, rather than positive delinquency which is blamed, the love of first conversion had waxed cold, and given place to a lifeless and formal orthodoxy). <strong> Remember therefore whence thou hast fallen</strong> (the first fervour of love is regarded as a height, from which the church had declined. The Commentators cite Cic. ad Att. iv. 16, “non recordor unde ceciderim, sed unde resurrexerim”), <strong> and repent</strong> (quickly and effectually, aor.) <strong> and do the first works</strong> (the works which sprung from that thy first love: those resume); <strong> but if not, I (will) come to thee</strong> (a strong ‘dativus incommodi:’ = ἐπί σε , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+3:3">Revelation 3:3</span> . Not Christ’s final coming, but his coming in special judgment is here indicated), <strong> and will move thy candle-stick out of its place</strong> (i. e. as Aretius, “efficiam ut ecclesia esse desinas:” see the fulfilment noticed in Prolegg. § iii. par. 7. Some take it too vaguely,as Ewald, “gratiam et benevolentiam meam tibi detraham:” others, as Grot., misled by their acceptation of the <em> first love</em> (see above), “efficiam ut plebs tua alio diffugiat, nempe ad ea loca ubi major habetur cura pauperum:” others again, going quite wrong, owing to a fancy that the Epistle is addressed to the <em> bishop</em> , “tollam a te ecclesiam, ne illi ultra præsideas;” so Zeger, al. Koppe and Heinrichs give a modification of the true meaning which is hardly justified: “primariam episcopatus sedem Epheso aliorsum transferam”), <strong> if thou do not repent</strong> (shalt not have repented; i. e. by the speedy time indicated in the previous aorist).</p>
