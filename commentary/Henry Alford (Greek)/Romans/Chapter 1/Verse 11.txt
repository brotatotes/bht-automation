<p><strong> 11. </strong> <strong> ἐπιποθῶ</strong> ] not ‘ <em> I vehemently desire</em> :’ ἐπί does not <em> intensify</em> , but merely expresses the direction of the πόθος , see Herod. v. 93, and compare such expressions as μὴ προσεῶντος ἡμᾶς τοῦ ἀνέμου , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:7">Acts 27:7</span> .

<p><strong> ἵνα τὶ μεταδῶ χάρισμα πν.</strong> ] That the χάρισμα here spoken of was no mere supernatural power of working in the Spirit, the whole context shews, as well as the meaning of the word itself in reff. And even if χάρισμα , barely taken, could ever (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4">1 Corinthians 12:4</span> ; 1Co 12:9 are no examples, see there) mean technically a <em> supernatural endowment of the Spirit</em> , yet the epithet πνευματικόν , and the object of imparting this χάρισμα , <em> confirmation in the faith</em> , would here preclude that meaning. Besides, Paul did not value the mere bestowal of these ‘gifts’ so highly, as to make it the subject of his earnest prayers incessantly. The gift alluded to was παράκλησις , as De Wette observes.

<p><strong> πνευμ</strong> <strong> ., spiritual</strong> : springing from the Spirit of God, and imparted to the spirit of man.

<p><strong> εἰς τὸ στηρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὑμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Knowing the trials to which they were exposed, and being conscious of the fulness of spiritual power for edification ( 2Co 13:10 ) given to him, he longed to impart some of it to them, that they might be confirmed. “The Apostle does not say εἰς τὸ στηρίζειν ὑμ ., for this belongs to God; see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span> . He is only the instrument: hence the passive.” Philippi.</p>
