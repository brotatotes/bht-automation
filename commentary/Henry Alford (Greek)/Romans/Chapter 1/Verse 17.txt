<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] An explanation, <em> how</em> the gospel is the <em> power of God to salvation</em> , and how it is so <em> to the believer</em> : because in it <strong> God’s righteousness</strong> (not His <em> attribute</em> of righteousness, ‘the righteousness of God,’ but righteousness <em> flowing from, and acceptable to Him</em> ) is unfolded, and the more, the more we believe. I subjoin De Wette’s note on δικ . θεοῦ . “The Greek δικ . and the Heb. צְדָקָה are taken sometimes for ‘virtue’ and ‘piety’ which men possess or strive after, sometimes imputatively, for ‘freedom from blame’ or ‘justification,’ The latter meaning is most usual with Paul: δικ . is that which is so in the sight of God (ch. Rom 2:13 ), the result of His justifying forensic Judgment, or of ‘ <em> Imputation</em> ’ (ch. Rom 4:5 ). It may certainly be imagined, that a man <em> might obtain</em> justification by <em> fulfilling the law</em> : in that case his righteousness is an ἰδία ( δικαιοσύνη ) (ch. Rom 10:3 ), a δικ . ἐκ τοῦ νόμου ( Php 3:9 ). But it is impossible for him to obtain a ‘righteousness of his own,’ which at the same time shall avail before God (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span> ; Gal 2:16 ). The Jews not only <em> have</em> not fulfilled the law (ch. Rom 3:9-19 ), but <em> could</em> not fulfil it (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span> ff.): the Gentiles likewise have rendered themselves obnoxious to the divine wrath ( Rom 1:24-32 ). God has ordained that the whole race should be included in disobedience. Now if man is to become righteous from being unrighteous, this can only happen by God’s grace, because God <em> declares him righteous</em> , assumes him to be righteous, δικαιοῖ (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</span> ; Gal 3:8 ): δικαιοῦν is not only negative, ‘ <em> to acquit</em> ,’ as הַצְדִּיק <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:7">Exodus 23:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:23">Isaiah 5:23</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:13">Romans 2:13</span> (where however see my note), but also positive, ‘ <em> to declare righteous</em> :’ but never ‘to <em> make</em> righteous’ by transformation, or imparting of moral strength by which moral perfection may be attained. <em> Justificatio</em> must be taken as the old protestant dogmatists rightly took it, <em> sensu forensi</em> , i.e. <em> imputatively</em> . God justifies for Christ’s sake (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:22">Romans 3:22</span> ff.) on condition of faith in Him as Mediator: the result of <em> His justification</em> is δικαιοσύνη ἐκ πίστεως , and as He imparts it freely, it is δικαιοσύνη θεοῦ (gen. subj.) or ἐκ θεοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:9">Philippians 3:9</span> ; so Chrys. &amp;c. ( δικ . θεοῦ is ordinarily taken for δικ . παρὰ θεῷ , as Luth.: ‘ <em> die Gerechtigfeit die vor Gott gilt</em> :’ compare ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:13">Romans 2:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:11">Galatians 3:11</span> ; but that this is at least not necessary, see 2Co 5:21 ). This justification is certainly an objective act of God: but it must also be subjectively apprehended, as its <em> condition</em> is subjective. It is <em> the acquittal from guilt, and cheerfulness of conscience, attained through faith in God’s grace in Christ</em> , the very frame of mind which would be proper to a perfectly righteous man, if such there were, the harmony of the spirit with God, peace with God. All interpretations which overlook the fact of imputation (the R.-Cath., that of Grotius, Baumgarten-Crusius, &amp;c.) are erroneous.” To say, with Jowett, that all attempts to define δικαιος . θεοῦ are “the after-thoughts of theology, which have no real place in the interpretation of Scripture,” is in fact to shut our eyes to the great doctrinal facts of Christianity, and float off at once into uncertainty about the very foundations of the Apostle’s argument and our own faith: of which uncertainty his note here is an eminent example.

	</p>
<p><strong> ἀποκαλύπτεται</strong> ] generally used of <em> making known</em> a thing hitherto concealed: but here of that gradually more complete realization of the state of justification before God by faith in Christ, which is the continuing and increasing gift of God to the believer in the Gospel.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐκ πίστεως</strong> ] “ ἐκ points to the condition, or the subjective ground. πίστις is faith in the sense of <em> trust</em> , and that (a) <em> a trustful assumption of a truth</em> in reference to knowledge = <em> conviction</em> : (b) <em> a trustful surrender of the soul</em> , as regards the <em> feeling</em> . Here it is especially the latter of these: that trust reposed in God’s grace in Christ, which tranquillizes the soul and frees it from all guilt, and especially trust in the atoning death of Jesus. Bound up with this (not by the meaning of the words, but by the idea of unconditional trust, which excludes all reserve) is <em> humility</em> , consisting in the abandonment of all merits of a man’s own, and recognition of his own unworthiness and need of redemption.” De Wette.
	</p>
<p><strong> εἰς πίστιν</strong> ] ἀπὸ πίστεως ἄρχεται κ . εἰς πιστεύοντα λήγει (Œcum.) seems the most probable interpretation, making πίστιν almost = τοὺς πιστεύοντας , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:22">Romans 3:22</span> ; but not entirely, it is still the <em> aspect</em> , the <em> phase</em> , of the man, which is receptive of the δικαιοσύνη θεοῦ , and to this it is revealed. The other interpretations, ‘ <em> for the increase of faith</em> ’ (Meyer), ‘ <em> that faith may be given to it</em> ’ (Fritzsche, Tholuck, Krebs), ‘ <em> proceeding from faith, and leading to a higher degree of faith</em> ’ (Baumg.-Crus.), do not seem so suitable or forcible. It will be observed that ἐκ π . εἰς π . is taken with ἀποκαλύπτεται , not with δικαιοσύνη . The latter connexion would do for <strong> ἐκ π</strong> <strong> .</strong> , but not for <strong> εἰς π</strong> <strong> .

<p><strong> καθὼς γέγρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] He shews that <em> righteousness by faith is no new idea</em> , but found in the prophets. The words (ref.) are cited again in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:11">Galatians 3:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:38">Hebrews 10:38</span> , in the former place with the same purpose as here. They are used in Habakkuk with reference to credence given to the prophetic word: but properly speaking, <em> all faith is one</em> , in whatever word or act of God reposed: so that the Apostle is free from any charge of forcing the words to the present purpose. The two ways of arranging them, ὁ δίκαιος ἐκ πίστεως ζήσεται , and ὁ δίκαιος ἐκ πίστεως ζήσεται , in fact amount to the same: if the former, which is more agreeable to the Heb., be taken, ζήσεται must mean, ‘shall live <em> on,’ endure in his</em> δικαιοσύνη , <em> by means of faith</em> , which would assert that it was a δικαιοσύνη of faith, as strongly as does the latter. See by all means, on the quotation, Umbreit’s note: and Delitzsch, der Proph. Habakuk, p. 51 ff. This latter remarks (I quote from Philippi), “The Apostle rests no more on our text than it will bear. He only places its assertion, that the life of the just springs from his faith, in the light of the N. T.”</p>
