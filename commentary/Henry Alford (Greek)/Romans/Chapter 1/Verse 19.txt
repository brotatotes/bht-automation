<p><strong> τὸ γνωστόν</strong> <strong> , that which is known</strong> , the objective knowledge patent and recognized in Creation: so Chrys., Theodoret, Luther, Reiche, Meyer, De Wette, al.: not ‘ <em> that which may be known</em> ’ (as Orig [2] , Theophyl., Œc [3] , Erasm., Beza, Grot., al.

He speaks <em> now</em> not of what they <em> might have known</em> of God, but of what they <em> did know</em> . Thus τὸ γνωστ . τ . θεοῦ will mean, <em> that universal objective knowledge of God as the Creator</em> which we find more or less in every nation under heaven, and which, as matter of historical fact, was proved to be in possession of the great Gentile nations of antiquity.
