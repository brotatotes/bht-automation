<p><strong> 20.</strong> ] <strong> For</strong> (justifying the clause preceding) <strong> His invisible attributes</strong> (hence the plur. applying to δύναμις and θειότης which follow), <strong> ἀπὸ κτίσεως κόσμ</strong> <strong> ., from the time of the creation</strong> , when the manifestation was made by God: not = ἐκ κτίσεως κ . ‘by the creation of the world;’ which would be tautological, τοῖς ποιήμασι νοούμενα following, besides that κτίσις κόσμου cannot = ἡ κτίσις , in the sense of ‘the creation,’ i.e. ‘the creatures.’ Umbreit has here a long and important note on O. T. prophecy in general, which will be found well worth study.
	</p>
<p><strong> τοῖς ποιήμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> νοούμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> being understood</strong> (apprehended by the mind, see reff.) <strong> by means of His works</strong> (of creation and sustenance, not here of moral government), <strong> καθορᾶται</strong> <strong> , are perceived</strong> ; not, ‘are <em> plainly</em> seen,’ this is not the sense of κατά in καθοράω , but rather that of looking down on, taking a survey of, and so apprehending or perceiving.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἥ τε ἀΐδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> δύν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> His eternal Power</strong> . To this the evidence of Creation is plainest of all: Eternal, and Almighty, have always been recognized epithets of the Creator.
	</p>
<p><strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θειότης</strong> ] <strong> and Divinity</strong> (not <em> Godhead</em> , which would be θεότης ). The fact that the Creator is <em> divine</em> ; is of a <em> different nature</em> from ourselves, and accompanied by distinct attributes, and those of the highest order, which we call <em> divine</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> εἰς τὸ εἶναι αὐτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀναπολ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] εἰς τό with an inf. never <em> properly</em> indicates only the <em> result</em> , ‘so that;’ but is often <em> used</em> where <em> the result</em> , and <em> the intention</em> , are bound together in the process of thought. This is done by a very natural habit in speaking and writing, of transferring one’s self to the position of the argument, and regarding that which contributed to a result, as worked purposely for that result. And however true it is, that in the doings of the Allwise, <em> all results are purposed</em> , to give the sense ‘ <em> in order that they might be inexcusable</em> ,’ would be manifestly contrary to the whole spirit of the argument, which is bringing out, not at present <em> God’s sovereignty in dealing with man</em> , but <em> man’s inexcusableness in holding back the truth by unrighteousness</em> . <strong> εἰς τό</strong> , then, in this case, is most nearly expressed by <strong> wherefore</strong> , or <strong> so that</strong> . See Winer, edn. 6, § 44. 6. οὐ διὰ τοῦτο ταῦτα πεποίηκεν ὁ θεός , εἰ καὶ τοῦτο ἐξέβη . οὐ γὰρ ἵνα αὐτοὺς ἀπολογίας ἀποστερήσῃ , διδασκαλίαν τοσαύτην εἰς μέσον προύθηκεν , ἀλλ ʼ ἵνα αὐτὸν ἐπιγνῶσιν · ἀγνωμονήσαντες δὲ πάσης ἑαυτοὺς ἀπεστέρησαν ἀπολογίας . Chrys. Hom. iv. p. 450.</p>
