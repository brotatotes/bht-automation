<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] This verse casts light on the τὴν ἀλήθ . ἐν ἀδικίᾳ κατεχόντων of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:18">Romans 1:18</span> . The <em> truth of God</em> (the true notion of Him as the Creator) which they professed, they changed into (see on ἐν , Rom 1:23 ) <em> a lie</em> ( ψεῦδος = שֶׁקֶר , used of idols, Jer 16:19 ), thus counteracting its legitimate agency and depriving it of all power for good.
	</p>
<p><strong> σεβάζομαι</strong> , of the honour of <em> respect</em> and <em> observance</em> and <em> reverence</em> , <strong> λατρεύω</strong> , of <em> formal worship with sacrifice and offering</em> . Both verbs belong to τῇ κτίσει ; though σεβάζομαι would require an accusative, λατρεύω , the nearest, takes the government.
	</p>
<p><strong> τῇ κτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] the <em> thing made</em> , the <strong> creature</strong> a general term for all objects of idolatrous worship.
	</p>
<p><strong> παρά</strong> <strong> , beyond</strong> which would amount to the exclusion of the Creator.
	</p>
<p>The doxology expresses the horror of the Apostle at this dishonour, and puts their sin in a more striking light. But we need not supply εἰ καὶ οὗτοι ὕβρισαν , as Chrys.
	</p>
<p><strong> εὐλογητός</strong> is <strong> Blessed</strong> , κατ ʼ ἐξοχήν : the LXX put for it the perf. part., Ps. 117:24. The adjective is usually of <em> God</em> : the participle, of man.</p>
