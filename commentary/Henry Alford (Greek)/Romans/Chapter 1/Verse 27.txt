<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] <strong> τὴν</strong> ἀσχημ . perhaps, as De W., ‘ <em> the</em> (well-known, too frequent) <em> indecency</em> ,’ ‘cui ipsa corporis … conformatio reclamat,’ Bengel: but more probably the article is only generic, as in 2Pe 1:5-8 repeatedly.

<p><strong> τὴν ἀντιμισθίαν</strong> ] The Apostle treats this ἀτιμία into which they fell, as a <em> consequence of, a retribution for</em> , their departure from God into idolatry, with which <em> in fact</em> it was closely connected. <em> This shame</em> , and not its <em> consequences</em> , which are not <em> here</em> treated of, is the ἀντιμισθία of their πλάνη , their aberration from the knowledge of God, which they received. This is further shewn by ἣν ἔδει in the past tense. εἰ λὰρ καὶ μὴ γέεννα ἦν , μηδὲ κόλασις ἠπείλητο , τοῦτο πάσης κολάσεως χεῖρον ἦν . εἰ δὲ ἥδονται , τὴν προσθήκην μοι λέγεις τῆς τιμωρίας . Chrys. Hom. v. p.457.
