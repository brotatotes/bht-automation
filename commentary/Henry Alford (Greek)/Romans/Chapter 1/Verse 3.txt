<p><strong> 3. </strong> <strong> περὶ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ</strong> ] belongs to ὃ προεπ . above, <strong> which he promised beforehand, &amp;c., concerning His Son</strong> , i.e. ‘which (good tidings) He promised beforehand, &amp;c., <em> and indicated that it should be</em> concerning His Son.’ This is more natural than to bind these words to εὐαγγ . θεοῦ which went before. Either meaning will suit Rom 1:9 equally well. Christ, the Son of God, is the <em> great subject</em> of the good news.

<p><strong> γενομένου</strong> ] not ὄντος , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1-3">John 1:1-3</span> , and notes [nor as in E. V. ‘ <em> was made</em> .’ There is nothing in the word indicating <em> creation</em> , however true that may have been: see Joh 1:14 ].

<p><strong> κατὰ σάρκα</strong> ] On the side of His humanity, our Lord ἐγένετο ; <em> that</em> nature of His begins only then, when He was γενόμενος ἐκ γυναικός , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> σάρξ</strong> is here used exactly as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span> , ὁ λόγος σὰρξ ἐγένετο , to signify <em> that whole nature, body and soul</em> , of which the outward visible tabernacle of the FLESH is the concrete representation to our senses.
	</p>
<p>The words <strong> ἐκ σπέρματος Δαυείδ</strong> cast a hint back at the <em> promise</em> just spoken of. At the same time, in so solemn an enunciation of the dignity of the Son of God, they serve to shew that even according to the human side, His descent had been fixed in the line of him who was Israel’s anointed and greatest king.</p>
