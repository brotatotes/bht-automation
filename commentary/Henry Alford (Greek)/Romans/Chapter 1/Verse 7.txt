<p><strong> ἀγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θ</strong> <strong> ., </strong> <strong> κλητ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἁγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Both these clauses refer to <em> all the Christians addressed</em> : not (as Bengel) the first to Jewish, the second to Gentile believers.

<p><strong> ἀπ. θ. πατ. ἡμ. κ. κυρ. Ἰ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> χ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Not, as Erasmus, ‘ <em> from God, the Father of us and of our Lord Jesus Christ</em> ,’ but <strong> from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ</strong> . God is the <em> Giver</em> of Grace and Peace, Christ the <em> Imparter</em> .</p>
