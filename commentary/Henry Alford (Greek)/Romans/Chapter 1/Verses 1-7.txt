<p><strong> 1 7.</strong> ] ADDRESS OF THE EPISTLE, WITH AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF PAUL’S CALLING, TO BE AN APOSTLE OF THE GOSPEL OF THE SON OF GOD. “Epistola tota sic methodica est, ut ipsum quoque exordium ad rationem artis compositum sit. Artificium quum in multis apparet, quæ suis locis observabantur, tum in eo maxime, quod inde argumentum principale deducitur. Nam Apostolatus sui approbationem exorsus, ex ea in Evangelii commendationem incidit: quæ quum necessario secum trahat disputationem de fide, ad eam, quasi verborum contextu manu ducente, delabitur. Atque ita ingreditur principalem totius Epistolæ quæstionem, fide nos justificari: in qua tractanda versatur usque ad finem quinti capitis.” Calvin.

<p>Paul in the addresses of his Epistles never uses the common Greek formula χαίρειν ( Jam 1:1 ), but always a <em> prayer for blessing</em> on those to whom he is writing. In all his Epistles (as in both those of Peter, and in the Apocalypse) this prayer is for χάρις and εἰρήνη , except in 1 and 2 Tim., where it is for χάρις , ἔλεος , and εἰρήνη , as in 2 John. In Jude only we find ἔλεος , εἰρήνη , and ἀγάπη .

<p>The address here differs from those of most of Paul’s Epistles, in having <em> dogmatic clauses</em> parenthetically inserted: such are found also in the Epistle to Titus, and (in much less degree) in that to the Galatians. These dogmatic clauses regard, 1. the <em> fore-announcement of the Gospel through the prophets:</em> 2. the <em> description and dignity of Him</em> who was the subject of that Gospel: 3. the <em> nature and aim of the apostolic office</em> to which Paul had been called, including the <em> persons addressed</em> in the objects of its ministration.</p>
