<p><strong> 29 31.</strong> ] <strong> πεπληρωμένους</strong> belongs to the subject of ποιεῖν , understood.
	</p>
<p>The reading πορνείᾳ appears to have arisen out of πονηρίᾳ , and is placed by some MSS. after that word, by some after κακίᾳ , omitting πον . The Apostle can hardly have written it here, treating as he does all these immoralities of the heart and conscience as <em> results</em> of, and <em> flowing from</em> , the licentious practices of idolatry above specified.
	</p>
<p>Accurate distinctions of ethical meaning can hardly be found for all these words. Without requiring such, or insisting on each excluding the rest, I have collected the most interesting notices respecting them. Umbreit has illustrated their LXX usage and Hebrew equivalents.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀδικίᾳ</strong> ] Perhaps a general term, comprehending all that follow: such would be according to the usage of the Epistle: but perhaps to be confined to the stricter import of injustice; of which on the part of the Romans, Wetst. gives abundant testimonies.
	</p>
<p><strong> πονηρίᾳ</strong> ] Ammonius interprets τὸ πονηρόν , τὸ δραστικὸν κακοῦ , used therefore more of the tempter and seducer to evil.
	</p>
<p><strong> πλεονεξίᾳ</strong> ] <strong> covetousness</strong> (not as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:6">1 Thessalonians 4:6</span> , see there), of which the whole provincial government and civil life of the Romans at the time was full. ‘Quando | major avaritiæ patuit sinus?’ exclaims Juvenal, soon after this. Sat. i. 87.
	</p>
<p><strong> κακίᾳ</strong> ] more the <em> passive side of evil</em> the capability of and proclivity to evil, the opposite to ἀρετή : so Arist. Eth. Nic. ii. 3. 6, ὑπόκειται ἄρα ἡ ἀρετὴ εἶναι .… τῶν βελτίστων πρακτική · ἡ δὲ κακία , τοὐναντίον .
	</p>
<p><strong> φθόνου</strong> and <strong> φόνου</strong> are probably put together from similarity of sound. So Eurip. Troad. 770 ff., ὦ Τυνδάρειον ἔρνος , οὔποτ ʼ εἶ Διὸς πολλῶν δὲ πατέρων φημί σ ʼ ἐκπεφυκέναι , Ἀλάστορος μὲν πρῶτον , εἶτα δὲ φθόνου , φόνου τε , θανάτου θ ʼ, ὅσα τε γῆ τρέφει κακά .
	</p>
<p><strong> κακοηθείας</strong> ] Sea reff.
	</p>
<p><strong> ψιθυρ</strong> <strong> . secret maligners, </strong> <strong> καταλ</strong> <strong> . open slanderers</strong> . The distinction attempted to be set up by Suidas and others, between θεομισής , ὑπὸ θεοῦ μισούμενος , and θεομίσης , ὁ μισῶν τὸν θεόν , has been applied to θεοστυγεῖς also, which has therefore been written θεοστύγεις . But the distinction is untenable; all compound adjectives in ης being oxyton.
	</p>
<p><strong> θεοστυγής</strong> is never found in an active sense, ‘ <em> hater of God</em> ,’ but always in a passive, <strong> hated by God</strong> (cf. Eur. Troad. 1205, ἡ θεοστυγὴς Ἑλένη : Cycl. 395, τῷ θεοστυγεῖ ᾅδου μαγείρῳ : ib. 598: so θεοφιλής , Demosth. 1486 ult.: εὐτυχεστάτην πασῶν πόλεων τὴν ὑμετέραν νομίζω καὶ θεοφιλεστάτην : and Æsch. Eum. 831); and such is apparently the sense here. The order of crimes enumerated would be broken, and one of a totally different kind inserted between καταλάλους and ὑβριστάς , if θεοστ . is to signify ‘ <em> haters of God</em> .’ But on the other supposition, if any crime was known more than another as ‘ <em> hated by the gods</em> ,’ it was that of ‘ <em> delatores</em> ,’ abandoned persons who circumvented and ruined others by a system of malignant espionage and false information. And the crime was one which the readers of this part of Roman history know to have been the pest of the state; see Tacitus, Ann. vi. 7, where he calls the delatores ‘Principi quidem grati, et <em> Deo exosi</em> .’ So also Philo, ap. Damascen. (quoted by Wetst.) διάβολοι καὶ θείας ἀποπέμπτοι χάριτος , οἱ τὴν αὐτὴν ἐκείνῳ διαβολικὴν νοσοῦντες κακοτεχνίαν , θεοστυγεῖς τε καὶ θεομισεῖς πάντη . It does not follow that the <em> delatores only</em> are intended, but the expression may be used to include all those abandoned persons who were known as <em> Diis exosi</em> , who were employed in pursuits hateful and injurious to their kind. So Wetst., Meyer, Rückert, Fritzsche, De Wette: the majority of Commentators incline to the <em> active</em> sense, so Theodoret, Œc [4] , Erasm., Luther, Calv., Beza, Estius, Grot., Tholuck, Reiche, &amp;c.

<p><strong> ὑβριστάς</strong> ] opposed by Xenoph. Mem. i. ana Apol. Socr. to σώφρων , ‘a discreet and modest man:’ but here perhaps, as said by Paul of himself, ref. 1 Tim., ‘qui contumeliâ afficit,’ ‘an insulting person.’
	</p>
<p><strong> ὑπερηφάνους</strong> ] ἐστὶ δὲ ὑπερηφανία καταφρόνησίς τις πλὴν αὑτοῦ τῶν ἄλλων , Theophr. Char. 34. It may be observed that Aristotle, Rhet. ii. 16, mentions ὑβρισταί and ὑπερήφανοι as examples of τῷ πλούτῳ ἃ ἕπεται ἤθη .

<p><strong> ἀλαζόνας</strong> ] see reff. δοκεῖ δὲ καὶ ἀλαζὼν εἶναι ὁ θρασὺς καὶ προσποιητικὸς ἀνδρείας , Aristot. Eth.
