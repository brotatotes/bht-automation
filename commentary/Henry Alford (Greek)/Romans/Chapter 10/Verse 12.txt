<p><strong> 12</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (an explanation of the strong expression <strong> πᾶς</strong> ὁ πιστεύων , as implying the <em> universal</em> offer of the riches of God’s mercy in Christ) <strong> there is no distinction of Jew and Greek</strong> (Gentile. See ch. Rom 3:22 ); <strong> for the same Lord of all</strong> (viz. <em> Christ</em> , who is the subject here: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:9">Romans 10:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:11">Romans 10:11</span> ; Rom 10:13 cannot be separated. So Orig [95] , Chrys., Œc [96] , Calov., Wolf, Bengel, Rück., Meyer, Fritz., De Wette, Tholuck, al. So πάντων κύριος of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:36">Acts 10:36</span> . Most modern Commentators make ὁ αὐτός the subject, and κύριος the predicate. But I prefer the usual rendering, both on account of the strangeness of ὁ αὐτός thus standing alone, and because this Apostle uses the expression ὁ αὐτὸς κύριος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:5">1 Corinthians 12:5</span> , and even ὁ αὐτὸς θεός , ib. 6, for ‘the same Lord,’ and ‘it is the same God.’ Stuart supplies, ‘(there is) the same Lord:’ but this is harsh, and unnecessary, if the participle πλουτῶν be taken as συντελῶν κ . συντ . in ch. Rom 9:28 ) <strong> is rich towards all</strong> (‘by <strong> εἰς</strong> is signified the direction in which the stream of grace rushes forth.’ Olsh.) <strong> who call upon Him.
