<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] <strong> For</strong> (explanation of οὐ κατ ʼ ἐπίγν .) <strong> not recognizing</strong> (‘ <em> being ignorant of</em> ’ is liable to the objection, that it may represent to the reader a state of <em> excusable</em> ignorance, whereas they <em> had it before them</em> , and <em> overlooked</em> it) <strong> the righteousness of God</strong> (not, the <em> way of justification</em> appointed by God, as Stuart, al.: but that only <em> righteousness</em> which avails before God, which becomes ours in justification; see De Wette’s note, quoted on ch. Rom 1:17 ), <strong> and seeking to set up their own righteousness</strong> (again, not <em> justification</em> , but <em> righteousness</em> : that, namely, described <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:5">Romans 10:5</span> ; not that it was ever theirs, but the Apostle speaks subjectively. Notwithstanding the MS. authority against δικαι . after ἰδίαν , it would seem as if it had been written for emphasis’ sake by the Apostle, and omitted on account of the word occurring thrice in the sentence), <strong> they were not subjected</strong> (historical: <em> implying</em> , but not itself <em> bearing</em> , a perfect sense. The passage, not in a middle sense, as De Wette and Thol., expresses the <em> result only</em> ; it might be themselves, or it might be some other, that subjected them, but the historical fact was, that they <em> were not subjected</em> ) <strong> to the righteousness of God</strong> (the δικ . τ . θ . being considered as a <em> rule</em> or <em> method</em> , to which it was necessary to conform, but to which they were never subjected as they were to the law of Moses).</p>
