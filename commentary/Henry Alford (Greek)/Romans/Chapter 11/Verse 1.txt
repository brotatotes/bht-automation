<p><strong> 1</strong> .] <strong> I say then</strong> (a false inference from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:19-21">Romans 10:19-21</span> , made in order to be refuted), <strong> Did</strong> ( <strong> μή</strong> , it cannot surely be, that) <strong> God cast off His people</strong> (as would almost appear from the severe words just adduced)? <strong> Be it not so: for I also am an Israelite</strong> ( ἐκ γένους Ἰσρ ., Php 3:5 ), <strong> of the seed of Abraham</strong> (mentioned probably for solemnity’s sake, as bringing to mind all the promises made to Abraham), <strong> of the tribe of Benjamin</strong> (so Php 3:5 ). There is some question <em> with what intent</em> the Apostle here brings forward <em> himself</em> . Three ways are open to us: either (1) it is as <em> a case in point</em> , as an example of an Israelite who has <em> not been rejected</em> but <strong><em> is</em></strong> <em> still one of God’s people</em> : so almost all the Commentators but this is hardly probable, for in this case ( α ) he would not surely bring one only example to prove his point, when thousands might have been alleged ( β ) it would be hardly consistent with the humble mind of Paul to put himself alone in such a place, and ( γ ) μὴ γένοιτο does not go simply to <em> deny</em> a hypothetical <em> fact</em> , but applies to <em> some deprecated consequence</em> of that which is hypothetically put: or (2) as De Wette, al., he implies, ‘ <em> How can I say such a thing, who am myself an Israelite</em> , &amp;c.?’ ‘Does not my very nationality furnish a security against my entertaining such an idea?’ or (3) which I believe to be the right view, but which I have found only in the commentary of Mr. Ewbank, as implying that if such a hypothesis were to be conceded, it would exclude from God’s kingdom the <em> writer himself, as an Israelite</em> . This seems better to agree with μὴ γένοιτο , as deprecating the <em> consequence</em> of such an assertion.

<p>But a question even more important arises, not unconnected with that just discussed: viz. <em> who are</em> <strong> ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ</strong> ? In order for the sentence καὶ γὰρ ἐγὼ κ . τ . λ . to bear the meaning just assigned to it, it is obvious that ὁ λαὸς αὐτ . must mean the people of God <em> nationally</em> considered. If Paul deprecated such a proposition as the rejection of <em> God’s people</em> , because he himself would thus be <em> as an Israelite</em> cut off from God’s favour, the rejection assumed in the hypothesis must be <em> a national rejection</em> . It is against <em> this</em> that he puts in his strong protest. It is <em> this</em> which he disproves by a cogent historical parallel from Scripture, shewing that there is a remnant καὶ ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ according to the election of grace: and not only so, but that that part of Israel (considered as having continuity of national existence) which is for a time hardened, shall ultimately come in, and so all Israel (nationally considered again, Israel <em> as a nation</em> ) shall be saved. Thus the covenant of God with Israel, having been <em> national</em> , shall ultimately be fulfilled to them <em> as a nation</em> : not by the gathering in merely of <em> individual</em> Jews, or of <em> all</em> the Jews <em> individually</em> , into the Christian church, but by the <em> national restoration</em> of the Jews, not in unbelief, but as a <em> Christian believing nation, to all that can, under the gospel, represent their ancient pre-eminence</em> , and to the <em> fulness of those promises which have never yet in their plain sense been accomplished to them</em> . I have entered on this matter here, because a clear understanding of it underlies all intelligent appreciation of the argument of the chapter. Those who hold <em> no national restoration of the Jews to pre-eminence</em> , must necessarily confound the ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ remnant according to the election of grace, with the οἱ λοιποί , who nationally shall be grafted in again.
