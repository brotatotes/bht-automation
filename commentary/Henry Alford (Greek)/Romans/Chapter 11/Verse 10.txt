<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] <strong> let their eyes be darkened that they may not see, and their back bow thou down always</strong> . “Instead of bending the back, the Heb. text speaks of making the loins to tremble, מָתְנֵיהֶם הַמְעַד . This elsewhere is a sign of <em> great terror</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="na+2:10">Nahum 2:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+5:6">Daniel 5:6</span> ; and the <em> darkening of the eyes</em> betokens in the Psalm, a weakened, humbled, servile condition, just as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+28:65-67">Deuteronomy 28:65-67</span> . It is plain from διὰ παντός , that we must not suppose the infirmities of <em> age</em> to be meant. The Apostle might well apply such a description to the servile condition of the bondmen of the law, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:24">Galatians 4:24</span> .” Tholuck.</p>
