<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] <strong> I say then</strong> (see on Rom 11:1 ), <strong> Did they</strong> (who? see below) <strong> stumble in order that they should fall</strong> (not ‘ <em> sic, ut caderent</em> ’ as Vulg., so Orig [102] , Chrys., Grot., al., denoting the <em> result</em> merely: neither the grammar nor the context will bear this: the Apostle is arguing respecting <em> God’s intent</em> in the παράπτωμα of the Jewish nation. He here calls it by this mild name to set forth that it is not final. The subject of ἔπταισαν is the αὐτοί of the following verses, i.e. the <em> Jews, as a people</em> : not the <em> unbelieving individuals</em> , who <em> are characterized as</em> <strong> πεσόντες</strong> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:22">Romans 11:22</span> . He regards the λοιποί as the representatives of the Jewish people, who have <em> nationally stumbled</em> , but not <em> in order to their final fall</em> , seeing that God has a gracious purpose towards the Gentiles even <em> in</em> this πταῖσμα of theirs, and intends to raise <em> them nationally from it</em> in the end. This distinction, between the πταίσαντες , <em> the whole nation as a nation</em> , and the πεσόντες , the <em> unbelieving branches who have been cut off</em> , is most important to the right understanding of the chapter, and to the keeping in mind the separate ideas, of the <em> restoration of individuals</em> here and there throughout time, and the <em> restoration of Israel</em> at the end.

<p>The stress is on <strong> πέσωσιν</strong> , and it is the <em> fall</em> which is denied: not on <strong> ἵνα</strong> πέσωσιν , so that the <em> purpose</em> merely should be denied, and the fall admitted)? <strong> God forbid: but</strong> (the truer account of the matter is) <strong> by their trespass</strong> (not <em> fall</em> , as E. V.) <strong> salvation (has come) to the Gentiles, for to provoke them</strong> (Israel) <strong> to jealousy</strong> . Two gracious purposes of God are here stated, the latter wrought out through the former. By this stumble of the Jews out of their national place in God’s favour, and the admission of the Gentiles into it, the very people thus excluded are to be stirred up to set themselves in the end effectually to regain, as a nation, that pre-eminence from which they are now degraded.</p>
