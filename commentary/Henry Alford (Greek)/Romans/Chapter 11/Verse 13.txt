<p><strong> 13</strong> .] ‘Why, in an argument concerning the <em> Jews</em> , dwell so much on the reference to the <em> Gentiles</em> discernible in the divine œconomy regarding Israel? Why make it appear as if the treatment of God’s chosen people were regulated not by a consideration of <em> them</em> , but of the less favoured Gentiles?’ The present verse gives an answer to this question. <strong> But</strong> (apology for the foregoing verse: if γάρ be read, the sense will be much the same <strong> For</strong> (i.e. let it be understood, that), &amp;c.) <strong> I am speaking to you the Gentiles. Inasmuch therefore</strong> ( <strong> μὲν οὖν</strong> is surely not to be rejected as yielding no sense, as De Wette and Tholuck, who object to it as proceeding from those who hold a new sentence to begin at ἐφ ʼ ὅσον , and ὑμῖν .… ἔθνεσιν to refer to the foregoing: but the usage of μὲν οὖν in 1Co 6:4 seems strictly analogous to that in our text, where no new sentence is begun in any sense which may not be true here.

<p><strong> ἐφ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ὅσον</strong> , not ‘ <em> as long as</em> ,’ as Orig [103] and Vulg.) <strong> as I am Apostle of the Gentiles, I honour mine office</strong> (by striving for their conversion and edification at all times, by introducing a reference to them and their part in the divine counsels, even when speaking of mine own people), <strong> if by any means I may</strong> (regarding it as a real service done on behalf of Israel, thus to honour mine office by mentioning the Gentiles, if this mention may) <strong> provoke to jealousy mine own flesh</strong> (the Jews) <strong> and may save some of them.
