<p><strong> 22</strong> .] The caution of the preceding verse is unfolded into a setting before the Gentile of the true state of the matter. <strong> Behold therefore</strong> ( <em> posito</em> , that thou enterest into the feeling prompted by the last verse) <strong> the goodness and the severity</strong> (no allusion to ἀποτέμνω in its literal sense) <strong> of God: towards those who fell</strong> (see on Rom 11:11 ).

<p>Here the πεσόντες are opposed to σύ , the figure being for the moment dropped: for πίπτειν can hardly be used of the <em> branches</em> , but of <em> men</em> ) <strong> severity; but towards thee, the goodness of God</strong> (the nominatives here, as involving a departure from the construction, are preferable: and the repetition of θεοῦ is quite in the manner of the Apostle: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:24-25">1 Corinthians 1:24-25</span> . Rückert thinks that because Clem [108] Alex. Pædag. i. 8 [70], p. 140 P., understands χρηστότης , in ἐὰν ἐπιμείνῃς τῇ χρηστότητι , of the χρηστότης of <em> men</em> ( τουτέστι τῇ εἰς χριστὸν πίστει ), θεοῦ may have been a marginal gloss to guard against this mistake, and may have found its way into the text, misplaced. But this is hardly probable: θεοῦ is much more likely to have been erased as unnecessary), <strong> if thou abide by</strong> (reff.) <strong> that goodness; for</strong> ([supply <strong> otherwise</strong> :] assuming that thou dost <em> not</em> abide by that goodness) <strong> thou also shalt be cut off</strong> (ind. fut. The placing only a comma at ἐκκοπήσῃ , as Meyer, not Lachm. (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:0">Exodus 2:0</span> ) and Tischend.(<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:0">Exodus 7:0</span> [and 8]), prevents the break evidently intended between the treatment of the case of the Gentile and that of the Jews).
