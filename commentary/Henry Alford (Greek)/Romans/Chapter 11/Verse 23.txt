<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] <strong> And they moreover, if they continue not</strong> (not exactly the same meaning as before: the χρηστότης before being external and objective, this, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1">Romans 6:1</span> , a subjective state) <strong> in their</strong> (see on Rom 11:20 ) <strong> unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again</strong> . Some, e.g. Grot., represent this last clause as implying, that God’s power to graft them in again has always been the same, but has waited for their change of mind, to act: ‘Nihil est præter incredulitatem quod Deum impediat eos rursum pro suis assumere et paterne tractare:’ but surely De W.’s interpretation is far better: ‘The Apostle obscurely includes in the ἐγκεντρ . the removal of their unbelief and the awakening of faith, and this last especially he looks for from above:’ for, as he observes, the <em> power</em> of God would not be put forward, if the other were the meaning.</p>
