<p><strong> 8.</strong> ] <strong> but the rest were hardened</strong> (not ‘ <em> blinded</em> ;’ see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:18">Ephesians 4:18</span> : σκληροτέραν ἡ ἀπιστία τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν ἀπειργάσατο . Theodoret. It is passive, and implies <em> God as the agent</em> . This for the sake of the context, ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς <strong> ὁ θεὸς</strong> κ . τ . λ ., not necessarily for the meaning of the word itself, which might indicate ‘became hard,’ but certainly <em> does not here</em> ), <strong> as it is written</strong> (if we are to regard these passages as merely <em> analogous instances</em> of the divine dealings, we must remember that the <em> perspective of prophecy</em> , in stating such cases, <em> embraces all analogous ones</em> , the divine dealings being self-consistent, and <em> especially that great one</em> , in which the words are most prominently fulfilled), <strong> God gave to them</strong> (LXX and Heb., πεπότικεν ὑμᾶς ) <strong> a spirit</strong> (see reff.) <strong> of stupor</strong> (there is at the end of Fritzsche’s commentary on this chapter an elaborate excursus on κατάνυξις , in which he has thoroughly investigated its derivation and meaning. He comes to the conclusion that it is derived from κατανύσσω , ‘compungo,’ and <em> might</em> signify any excitement of mind, pity, sadness, &amp;c., but in the few places where it occurs, it <em> does</em> import <em> stupor</em> or <em> numbness</em> : so ref. Ps. ἐπότισας ἡμᾶς οἶνον κατανύξεως , which Hammond explains to mean the stupifying wine given to them that were to be put to death. Hamm. also cites from Marcus Eremita, νουθες . ψυχ . p. 948, a passage where he describes πόνον τῆς κατανύξεως as the consequence of οἰνοποσίαι . Tholuck compares the similar meanings of ‘frappé,’ <em> struck</em> , <em> betroffen</em> ), <strong> eyes that they should not see</strong> (such eyes that they might not see: in the Heb. and LXX the negative is joined with the verb, καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκεν κύριος ὁ θ . ὑμῶν κ . τ . λ .) <strong> and ears that they should not hear unto this present day</strong> . These last words are not, as Beza, E. V., Griesb., Knapp, to be separated from the citation, and joined to ἐπωρώθησαν : they belong to the words in Deut. and are adduced by St. Paul as applying to the day then present, as they did to the day when Moses spoke them: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:15">2 Corinthians 3:15</span> .</p>
