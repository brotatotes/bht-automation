<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] <strong> Having</strong> (the participial construction is resumed, as in Rom 12:9 ) <strong> the same spirit towards one another</strong> , i.e. actuated by a common and well-understood feeling of mutual allowance and kindness.

<p><strong> μὴ τὰ ὑψ</strong> .] It is a question, whether τοῖς ταπεινοῖς is neuter or masc. Certainly not <em> necessarily neuter</em> , as De W.: the Apostle’s antitheses do not require such minute correspondence as this. The sense then must decide. In τὰ ὑψηλὰ φρονοῦντες , the ὑψηλά are necessarily <em> subjective</em> , the <em> lofty thoughts of the man</em> . But in τοῖς ταπεινοῖς συναπαγόμενοι the adj. is necessarily <em> objective</em> ; some outward objects with which the persons exhorted are συναπάγεσθαι . And those outward objects are defined, if I mistake not, by the τὸ αὐτὸ <strong> εἰς ἀλλήλους</strong> φρονοῦντες . This spirit towards one another is not to be a spirit of haughtiness, but one of community and sympathy, <strong> condescending to men of low estate</strong> , as E. V. admirably renders it. For <strong> συναπ</strong> ., see reff. and compare Zosimus, Hist. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:6">Romans 12:6</span> , cited by Tholuck, καὶ αὐτὴ ἡ Σπάρτη συναπήγετο τῇ κοινῇ τῆς Ἑλλάδος ἁλώσει . The insertion of the seemingly incongruous μὴ γίνεσθε … ἑαυτοῖς is sufficiently accounted for by reference to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:25">Romans 11:25</span> , where he had stated this frame of mind as one to be avoided by those whose very place in God’s church was owing to His free mercy. <em> Being uplifted one against another</em> would be a sign of this fault being present and operative.</p>
