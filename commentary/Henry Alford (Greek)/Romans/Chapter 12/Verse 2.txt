<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] <strong> συνσχηματίζεσθαι</strong> is not Imperative in sense, but dependent on παρακαλῶ . (Of course, in all such questions betwen ε and αι , the confusing element of itacism comes in: but in no case where both forms are equally admissible in the text, can the mere suspicion of itacism be allowed to decide the question.)

<p><strong> ὁ αἰὼν οὗτος</strong> , here, the <em> whole world of the ungodly</em> , as contrasted with the spiritual kingdom of Christ.

<p>The dat. ἀνακαινώσει is not the instrument by which, but the <em> manner in which</em> the metamorphosis takes place: that wherein it consists: compare περιετμήθητε περιτομῇ ἀχειροποιήτῳ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+2:11">Colossians 2:11</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> εἰς τὸ δοκιμάζειν</strong> <strong> , that ye may prove</strong> , viz. in this process and the active Christian life accompanying it, compare reff. Eph., Phil.: not ‘ <em> that ye may be able to prove</em> ,’ ‘acquire the faculty of proving,’ as Bucer, Olsh., Rückert: the Apostle is not speaking of acquiring wisdom here, but of practical proof by experience.

<p><strong> τὸ ἀγαθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εὐάρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τέλ</strong> . are not epithets of τὸ θέλημα τ . θεοῦ as in E. V., for in that case they would be superfluous, and in part ( τέλειον ) inapplicable: but abstract neuters, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:9">Romans 12:9</span> , <strong> that ye may prove what is the will of God</strong> (viz. that which is) <strong> good and acceptable</strong> (to Him) <strong> and perfect</strong> . The non-repetition of the art. shews that the adjectives all apply to the same thing.</p>
