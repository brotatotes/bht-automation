<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] <strong> λέγω</strong> , a mild expression for ‘I command:’ enforced as a command by διὰ τ . χ .… ‘by means of my apostolic office,’ of the grace conferred on me to guide and exhort the Church:’ reff.

<p><strong> παντὶ τῷ ὄντι ἐν ὑμ</strong> ., a strong bringing out of the <em> individual</em> application of the precept. οὐχὶ τῷ δεῖνι καὶ τῷ δεῖνι μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄρχοντι κ . ἀρχομένῳ , κ . δούλῳ κ . ἐλευθέρῳ , κ . ἰδιώτῃ κ . σοφῷ , κ . γυναικὶ κ . ἀνδρί , κ . νέῳ κ . γέροντι . Chrys. Hom. xx. p. 603.

<p><strong> μὴ ὑπερφρ</strong> . κ . τ . λ .] There is a play on the words φρονεῖν , ὑπερφρονεῖν , and σωφρονεῖν , which can only be clumsily conveyed in another language: ‘not to be highminded, above that which he ought to be minded, but to be so minded, as to be soberminded.’ Wetst. quotes from Charondas in Stobæus, Sentent. xlii., προσποιείσθω δὲ ἕκαστος τῶν πολιτῶν σωφρονεῖν μᾶλλον ἢ φρονεῖον , and from Thucyd. ii. 62, ἰέναι δὲ τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ὁμόσε , μὴ φρονήματι μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ καταφρονήματι .

<p><strong> μέτρον πίστεως</strong> is the <em> receptivity</em> of χαρίσματα , itself no inherent congruity, but the gift and apportionment of God. It is in fact the <em> subjective designation</em> of ἡ χάρις ἡ δοθεῖσα ἡμῖν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:6">Romans 12:6</span> . But we must not say, that (Ewb.) “faith, in this passage, means <em> those gifts or graces which the Christian can only receive through faith</em> :” this is to confound the receptive faculty with the thing received by it, and to pass by the great lesson of our verse, that <em> this faculty</em> is nothing to be proud of, but God’s gift.</p>
