Leitung, &amp;c. 4th ed. p. 460 ff.) that <em> some special reason</em> must have given occasion to these exhortations. We can hardly attribute it to the seditious spirit of the <em> Jews at Rome</em> , as their influence in the Christian Church there would not be great; indeed, from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:0">Acts 28:0</span> the two seem to have been remarkably distinct. But disobedience to the civil authorities may have arisen from mistaken views among the Christians themselves as to the nature of Christâ€™s kingdom and its relation to existing powers of this world. And such mistakes would naturally be rifest there, where the fountain of earthly power was situated: and there also best and most effectually met by these precepts coming from apostolic authority. The way for them is prepared by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:17">Romans 12:17</span> ff. of the foregoing chapter. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:13">1 Peter 2:13</span> ff. is parallel: compare notes there.</p>
