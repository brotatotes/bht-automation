<p>The rec. text here, ἀπέθ . κ . ἀνέστη κ . ἀνέζησεν , may have arisen by the insertion (1) of ἀνέζησεν as clearer than ἔζησεν , and (2) of ἀνέστη from the margin, where it was a gloss ( 1Th 4:14 ) explaining ἀνέζησεν or ἔζησεν . Or, on the other hand, supposing it to have been the original, ἀνέζησεν may have been altered to ἔζησεν and κ . ἀνέστη left out, to conform it to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:7-8">Romans 14:7-8</span> . In such a case of doubt, the weight of early authority must decide. <strong> ἔζησεν</strong> , <strong> lived</strong> , viz. <em> after His death</em> ; = ἀνέζησεν . The historical aorist points to a stated event as the commencement of the reviviscence, viz. the Resurrection.
