<p>The <em> participial construction</em> prevails throughout, the participles standing as direct verbs. This not having been seen, the words ἐλεύσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς have been inserted to fill up what seemed an aposiopesis. <strong> Now, however, I have no longer any business in these parts, but have had for many years past a desire to see you, whenever</strong> (as soon as) <strong> I journey into Spain</strong> . Respecting the question whether this journey into Spain was ever taken, the views of Commentators have differed, according to their conclusion respecting the liberation of the Apostle from his imprisonment at Rome. I have discussed this in the Prolegg. to the Pastoral Epistles, § ii. The reader may see, on the side of the <em> completion of the journey</em> , Neander, Pfl. u. Leit., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:0">Exodus 4:0</span> , pp. 527 552, and on the other side, Dr. Davidson, Introd. to N. T. vol. ii. pp. 96 132, and Wieseler, Chron. der Apost. Zeitalt., Excursus I., where a copious list of books on both sides is given.</p>
