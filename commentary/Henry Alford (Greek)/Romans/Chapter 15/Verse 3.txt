<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] ἐξῆν αὐτῷ μὴ ὀνειδισθῆναι , ἐξῆν μὴ παθεῖν ἅπερ ἔπαθεν , εἴγε ἤθελε τὸ ἑαυτοῦ σκοπεῖν · ἀλλ ʼ ὅμως οὐκ ἠθέλησεν , ἀλλὰ τὸ ἡμέτερον σκοπήσας τὸ ἑαυτοῦ παρεῖδε , Chrys. Hom. xxvii. p. 721

<p>The citation is made <em> directly</em> , without any thing to introduce the formula citandi, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:7">Romans 9:7</span> , where even the formula itself is wanting: there is no ellipsis. The words in the Messianic Psalm are addressed to <em> the Father</em> , not to those <em> for whom</em> Christ suffered: but they prove all that is here required, that He did not please <em> Himself</em> ; His sufferings were undertaken on account of the Father’s good purpose mere work which <em> He gave Him to do</em> .</p>
