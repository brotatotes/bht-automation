<p><strong> 7</strong> .] Ἰουνιᾶν may be fem. ( Ἰουνίαν ), from Ἰουνία (Junia), in which case she is probably the wife of Andronicus, or masc., from Ἰουνιᾶς (Junianus, contr. Junias). It is uncertain also whether συγγενεῖς means <em> fellow-countrymen</em> , or <em> relations</em> . Aquila and Priscilla were Jews: so would Maria be, and probably Epænetus, being an early believer. If so, the word may have its strict meaning of ‘ <em> relations</em> .’ But it seems to occur <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:11">Romans 16:11</span> ; Rom 16:21 in a wider sense.

<p><strong> ἐπίσημοι ἐν τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀποστ</strong> .] Two renderings are given: (1) ‘ <em> of note among the Apostles</em> ,’ so that <em> they themselves are counted among</em> the Apostles: thus the Greek ff. ( τὸ ἀποστόλους εἶναι , μέγα · τὸ δὲ καὶ ἐν τούτοις ἐπισήμους εἶναι , ἐννόησον ἡλίκον ἐγκώμιον , Chrys.), Calv., Est., Wolf, Thol., Kölln., Olsh., al.: or (2) ‘ <em> noted among the Apostles</em> ,’ i.e. <em> well known and spoken of by</em> the Apostles. Thus Beza, Grot., Koppe, Reiche, Meyer, Fritz., De W.
	</p>
<p>But, as Thol. remarks, had this latter been the meaning, we should have expected some expression like διὰ πασῶν τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν ( 2Co 8:18 ). I may besides remark, that for Paul to speak of any persons as <em> celebrated among the Apostles</em> in sense (2), would imply that he had more frequent intercourse with the other Apostles, than we know that he had; and would besides be improbable on any supposition. The whole question seems to have sprung up in modern times from the idea that οἱ ἀπόστολοι must mean <em> the Twelve only</em> . If the wider sense found in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:4">Acts 14:4</span> ; Act 14:14 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23">2 Corinthians 8:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:6">1 Thessalonians 2:6</span> (compare Rom 1:1 ) be taken, there need be no doubt concerning the meaning.

<p><strong> οἳ καὶ</strong> <strong> …</strong> ] refers to Andr [125] and Jun., not to the Apostles. In the use of <strong> γέγοναν</strong> , there is a mixed construction “who have been longer than me,” and “who <em> were</em> before me.”
