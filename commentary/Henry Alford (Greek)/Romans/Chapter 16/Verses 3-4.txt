See Neander, Pfl. u. Leit., p. 441. “ <strong> ὑποτιθέναι</strong> est <em> pignori opponere</em> . Demosth. in Aphobum: ἀπέτισα τὴν λειτουργίαν , ὑποθεὶς τὴν οἰκίαν καὶ τἀμαυτοῦ πάντα .

<p>The ‘ <em> churches of the Gentiles</em> ’ had reason to be thankful to them, for having <em> rescued the Apostle of the Gentiles</em> from danger.

<p>It seems to have been the practice of Aquila and Priscilla (ref. 1 Cor.) and some other Christians (reff. Col., Philem.) to hold assemblies for worship in their houses, which were saluted, and sent salutations as <em> one body</em> in the Lord. Some light is thrown on the expression by the following passage from the Acta Martyrii S. Justini, in Ruinart, cited by Neander, Church Hist. i. 330, Rose’s trans. “The answer of Justin Martyr to the question of the prefect (Rusticus) ‘Where do you assemble?’ exactly corresponds to the genuine Christian spirit on this point. The answer was; ‘Where each one can and will. You believe, no doubt, that we all meet together in one place; but it is not so, for the God of the Christians is not shut up in a room, but, being invisible, He fills both heaven and earth, and is honoured every where by the faithful.’ Justin adds, that when he came to Rome, he was accustomed to dwell in one particular spot, and that those Christians who were instructed by him, and wished to hear his discourse, assembled at his house. (This assembly would accordingly be ἡ κατ ʼ οἶκον τοῦ Ἰουστίνου ἐκκλησία .) He had not visited any other congregations of the Church.”</p>
