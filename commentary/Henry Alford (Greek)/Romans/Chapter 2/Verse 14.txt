<p><strong> 14.</strong> ] <strong> ἔθνη</strong> <strong> , the Gentiles</strong> [in general]; see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:29">Romans 3:29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:13">Romans 11:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:10">Romans 15:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:12">Romans 15:12</span> . In this place, ἔθνη τὰ μὴ νόμ . ἔχοντα is the only way in which the sense required could be expressed, for τὰ ἔθνη τὰ μὴ ν . ἔχ ., would mean ‘ <em> those Gentiles who have not the law</em> ,’ as also would ἔθνη μὴ νόμον ἔχ ., whereas the meaning clearly is, <strong> the Gentiles not having the law.
	</strong></p>
<p><strong> νόμον</strong> ] Again, ‘ <em> the</em> law,’ viz. <em> of Moses. A</em> law, they have; see below.
	</p>
<p><strong> φύσει</strong> <strong> , by nature</strong> , τοῖς φυσικοῖς ἑπόμενα λογισμοῖς , Schol. in Matthaï.
	</p>
<p><strong> τὰ τοῦ νόμου π</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> do things pertaining to the law</strong> [i.e. the things about which the law is concerned], e.g. abstain from stealing, or killing, or adultery. But it by no means follows that the Apostle means that the Gentiles could <em> fulfil</em> the law, do <em> the</em> things, i.e. <em> all</em> the things enjoined by the law (as De Wette): he argues that a conscientious Gentile, who knows not <em> the law</em> , does, when he acts in accordance with requirements of the law, so far set up the (see below on the art.) law to himself.
	</p>
<p>τὰ τοῦ νόμου is interpreted by Beza, Wetst., and Elsner, ‘ <em> that which the law does</em> ,’ i.e. make sanctions and prohibitions: but this can hardly be.
	</p>
<p>The Apostle does not deny certain virtues to the Gentiles, but maintains the inefficiency of those, and all other virtues, towards man’s salvation.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἑαυτοῖς εἰσιν νόμος</strong> ] <strong> are to themselves</strong> (so far) <strong> the law</strong> , not ‘ <em> a</em> law,’ for <em> a law</em> may be just or unjust, God’s law or man’s law: there is <em> but one law of God</em> , partly written in men’s consciences, more plainly manifested in the law of Moses, and fully revealed in Jesus Christ. The art. could not have been here used without stultifying the sentence by distributing the predicate, making the conscientious heathen to be to himself <em> the whole of the law</em> , instead of ‘ <em> the law, so far as he did the works of the law</em> .’ Cf. Aristot. Eth. iv. 14, ὁ δὲ χαρίεις κ . ἐλευθέριος οὕτως ἕξει οἷον νόμος ὢν ἑαυτῷ .</p>
