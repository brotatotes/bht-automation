See also a fine passage in Bourdaloue’s Sermons, Vol. i. Serm. ii. p. 27, ed.

To this it is bound, it appears to me, by the τὰ κρυπτὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων , answering to πᾶσαν ψυχὴν ἀνθρώπου , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:9">Romans 2:9</span> . This affirmation is the <em> last</em> sentence which has been in the dogmatic form: after it we have a series of quasi-parenthetic clauses οὐ γάρ ὅσοι γάρ οὐ γάρ ὅταν γάρ ; i.e., the reasons, necessitated by the startling assertion, are one after another given, and, that having been done, <em> the time is specified when the great retribution shall take place</em> .
