<p><strong> 29.</strong> ] <strong> ἐν τῷ κρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> as belonging to Ἰουδ . is parallel with καρδίας as belonging to περιτομή , both designating the inner and spiritual reality, of which the name of Jew and the carnal circumcision are only the signs.

<p>περ . καρδ . is no new expression: we have it virtually in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+10:16">Deuteronomy 10:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+4:4">Jeremiah 4:4</span> ; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:51">Acts 7:51</span> .

<p><strong> ἐν πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οὐ γρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> in</strong> [ <strong> the</strong> ] <strong> spirit, not in</strong> [ <strong> the</strong> ] <strong> letter</strong> . Not merely ‘spiritually, not externally:’ nor does πν . allude to the <em> necessitating cause</em> of circumcision (the uncleanness of the inner man) (Œc [11] , Grot., Estius, Fritzsche): nor signify the <em> material</em> (‘quæ spiritu constat,’ Erasm.): nor the <em> rule</em> (Meyer), but as De Wette rightly, the <em> living power or element</em> , wherewith that inner sphere of being is filled ἐν being [used] as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:28">Acts 17:28</span> , of that in which any thing lives and moves, compare χαρὰ ἐν πν . ἁγίῳ , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span> , ἀγάπη ἐν πν ., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:8">Colossians 1:8</span> , δουλεύειν ἐν καιν . πν ., ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:6">Romans 7:6</span> , εἶναι ἐν πν ., ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span> . So that πνεῦμα <em> here</em> is not man’s spirit, nor properly the Holy Spirit, but <em> the spirit</em> , as opposed to <em> the letter</em> , of the Jewish law and of all God’s revelation of himself.

<p>The ἔπαινος of such a character, (for ἔπαινος it must be,) can only come from him who sees ἐν τῷ κρυπτῷ (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:4">Matthew 6:4</span> ; Mat 6:6 ), and can discern the heart.</p>
