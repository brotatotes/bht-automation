<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] I am inclined with Lachmann to regard the question as continued. If not, the responsive contrast to the question in Rom 2:4 would begin more emphatically than with κατὰ δὲ …; it would be σὺ δὲ κατὰ .… or θησαυρίζεις δὲ σεαυτῷ κατὰ .… But the enquiry loses itself in the digressive clauses following, and no where comes pointedly to an end. I have therefore not placed a mark of interrogation at ἄγει or at θεοῦ , as Lachm. does, but have left the construction to explain itself.

It belongs to ὀργήν , <strong> wrath in the day of wrath</strong> , ‘wrath which shall come upon thee in that day,’ not to θησαυρίζεις , imagining which has led to the mistake. The ἡμέρα ὀργῆς is the <em> day of judgment</em> , viewed in its relation to <em> sinners</em> : see reff.

The reading ἀποκ . <strong> καὶ</strong> δικαιοκρ . would mean, ‘ <em> the appearance</em> (reff.) <em> of God, and his righteous judgment</em> ,’ not referring merely to <em> the detection of men’s hearts</em> , as Origen, Theophyl., Rückert. But the reading is not strongly upheld, nor is it according to the mode of speaking in the argument see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17-18">Romans 1:17-18</span> .</p>
