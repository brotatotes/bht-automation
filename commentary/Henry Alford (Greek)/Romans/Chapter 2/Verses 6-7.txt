<p><strong> 6, 7.</strong> ] This <em> retribution</em> must be carefully kept in its place in the argument. The Apostle is here speaking <em> generally</em> , of the general system of God in governing the world, the judging according to each man’s works punishing the evil, and rewarding the righteous. No question <em> at present</em> arises, <em> how</em> this righteousness in God’s sight <em> is to be obtained</em> but the truth is only stated broadly at present, to be further specified by and by, when it is clearly shewn that by ἔργα νόμου no flesh can be justified before God. The neglect to observe this has occasioned two mistakes: (1) an idea that by this passage it is proved that not faith only, but works also in some measure, justify before God (so Toletus in Pool’s Syn.), and (2) an idea (Tholuck 1st edn. and Köllner) that by ἔργου ἀγαθοῦ here is <em> meant</em> faith in Christ. However true it be, so much is certainly not <em> meant</em> here, but merely the fact, that <em> every where, and in all, God punishes evil, and rewards good</em> .</p>
