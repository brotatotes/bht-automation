<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] <strong> ἡ καύχησις</strong> <strong> , the boasting</strong> , viz. <em> of the Jews</em> , of which he had spoken before, ch. 2, not ‘ <em> boasting</em> ’ in general, which will not suit <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:29">Romans 3:29</span> .

<p><strong> διὰ π</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ν</strong> <strong> .</strong> κ . τ . λ .] <strong> By what law</strong> (is it excluded)? (is it by that) <strong> of works? No, but by the law</strong> ( <em> norma</em> , the rule) <strong> of faith</strong> . The contrast is not here between <em> the law</em> and <em> the Gospel</em> as two dispensations, but between the <em> law of works</em> and the <em> law of faith</em> , whether found under the law, or the Gospel, or (if the case admitted) any where else. This is evident by the Apostle proving below that <em> Abraham was justified</em> , not by works, so as to have whereof to boast, but by faith.</p>
