<p>There is considerable difficulty in <strong> προεχόμεθα</strong> . The meaning of προέχομαι every where else is <em> passive</em> , ‘to be surpassed,’ and προέχω , act., is to surpass, or have the pre-eminence. So Plut. p. 1038 D (Wetst.), κατ ʼ οὐδὲν προεχομένοις ὑπὸ τοῦ Διός , ‘cum Jove minores non sint:’ and Herod, i. 32, ὁ μὲν δὴ μέγα πλούσιος ἀνόλβιος δέ , δυοῖσι προέχει τοῦ εὐτυχοῦς μόνον , &amp;c. (see Wetst.) Those therefore who have wished to preserve the usage of the word, have variously interpreted it in that attempt: ( α ) Wetst. would render it passively, and understand it (as spoken by a Jew) ‘ <em> Are we surpassed by the Gentiles</em> ?’ But (1) for this inference there is no ground in what went before, but the contrary (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:1">Romans 3:1</span> ff.), and (2) the question if it mean this, is not dealt with in what follows. ( β ) Œcum. (2nd altern.) regards it as said by a Gentile, ‘ <em> Are we surpassed by the Jews</em> ?’ but for this question there is no ground in the preceding, for all has tended to lower the Jews in comparison and reduce all to one level. ( γ ) Reiche and Olsh. take it passively, and render, ‘ <em> Are we preferred</em> ( <em> by God</em> )?’ but no example of this meaning occurs, the above use in Plutarch not justifying it. ( δ ) Koppe and Wahl render, taking it as the middle voice, ‘ <em> What can we then allege</em> ( <em> as an excuse</em> )?’ but this will not suit οὐ πάντως . ( ε ) Meyer, ‘ <em> What then, have we an excuse</em> ?’ but προεχόμ . has not this meaning. ( ζ ) Fritzsche, ‘ <em> What then? do we excuse ourselves</em> (i.e. shall we make any excuse)?’ But (1) προεχ . <em> is put absolutely</em> ; and (2) the answer would rather be μηδαμῶς than οὐ πάντως , which replies to a question on <em> matter of fact</em> . Besides (3) the argument would then go to shew, not that all are <em> sinners, as it does</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:10-20">Romans 3:10-20</span> , but that all are liable to God’s wrath, <em> without excuse</em> , ( η ) The only way left seems (with Theophyl., Œc [13] (1st altern.), Schol. in Matthaï, Pelag., Vulg., Erasm., Luther, Calv., Beza, Grot., Bengel, Tholuck, Köllner, Schrader, De Wette, al.) to take προεχόμεθα as middle, and understand it as προέχομεν <strong> Have we</strong> (Jews) <strong> the</strong> (any) <strong> preference</strong> ? We have an use of παρέχομαι as active, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:24">Acts 19:24</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:7">Titus 2:7</span> .

<p><strong> οὐ πάντως</strong> ] <strong> No, by no means</strong> . This would more naturally be πάντως οὐ , see reff. But we have οὐδὲν πάντως for ‘not at all,’ Herod. v. 34. The meaning ‘not in every way,’ ‘not altogether,’ as 1Co 5:10 and Theophr. de Caus. Plant. vi.24(Wetst.), ποιεῖ γὰρ οὐ πάντως , ἀλλ ʼ ἐὰν οὐλή τις ᾖ ὑπόκαυστος , will not apply, for it does not agree with what follows, where the Apostle proves <em> absolute equality</em> in respect of his argument.

<p><strong> προῃτ</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> εἶναι</strong> ] <strong> we have before proved</strong> (chs. 1. 2.) <strong> both Jews and Gentiles all to be under sin</strong> ; the construction is not acc. and inf., <em> that</em> Jews and Gentiles <em> are</em> under sin, but Ἰουδ .… πάντας is acc. after the verb, and ὑφ ʼ ἁμ . εἶναι the matter of the charge, q. d. ‘we have before brought in guilty Jews and Gentiles all as sinners.’</p>
