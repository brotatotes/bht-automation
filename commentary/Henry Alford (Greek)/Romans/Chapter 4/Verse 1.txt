<p><strong> 1. </strong> <strong> οὖν</strong> ] The Apostle is here contending with those under the law <em> from their own standing-point</em> : and he follows up his νόμον ἱστάνομεν , by <strong> what therefore</strong> (‘hoc concesso,’ ‘seeing that you and I are both upholders of the law’) <strong> shall we say</strong> , &amp;c. This verse, and the argument following, are not a <em> proof</em> , but a <em> consequence</em> , of νόμον ἱστ ., and are therefore introduced, not with <strong> γάρ</strong> , but with <strong> οὖν</strong> .
	</p>
<p><strong> εὑρηκέναι</strong> [if read]] viz. <em> towards his justification</em> , or more strictly, <em> earned</em> as his own, to boast of.
	</p>
<p><strong> κατὰ σάρκα</strong> belongs to <strong> εὑρ</strong> ., not (as Chrys., Theophyl., Erasm.) to <strong> προπάτορα ἡμ</strong> . For the course and spirit of the argument is not to limit the paternity of Abraham to a mere fleshly one, but to shew that he was the spiritual father of all believers. And the question is not one which requires any such distinction between his fleshly and spiritual paternity (as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:3">Romans 9:3</span> , Rom 9:5 ). This being so, <em> what does</em> <strong> κατὰ σάρκα</strong> <em> mean</em> ? It cannot allude to <em> circumcision</em> ; for that is rendered improbable, not only by the parallel expression ἐξ ἔργων in the <em> plural</em> , but also by the consideration, that circumcision was no ἔργον at all, but a <em> seal of the righteousness which he had by faith</em> being yet uncircumcised ( Rom 4:11 ), and by the whole course of the argument in the present place, which is not to disprove the exclusive privilege of the Jew (that having been already done, chs. 2. 3.), but to shew that <em> the father and head of the race himself was justified not by works, but by faith</em> . Doubtless, in so far as circumcision was a mere <em> work of obedience</em> , it might be in a loose way considered as falling under that category: but it came <em> after</em> justification, and so is <em> chronologically</em> here excluded. <strong> κατὰ σάρκα</strong> then is in contrast to κατὰ πνεῦμα , and refers to <em> that department of our being from which spring works</em> , in contrast with <em> that in which is the exercise of faith</em> : see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:4">Romans 8:4</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:5">Romans 8:5</span> .</p>
