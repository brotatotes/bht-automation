<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] <strong> And he received</strong> (from God) <strong> the sign</strong> (token, or symbol) <strong> of circumcision</strong> (gen. of apposition, see reff. The reading περιτομήν appears to have been an alteration on account of σφραγῖδα following), <strong> a seal</strong> (the Targum on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="so+3:8">Song of Solomon 3:8</span> , cited by Tholuck, has the expression, ‘the seal of circumcision,’ and in Sohar, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+6:21">Leviticus 6:21</span> , it is called ‘a holy sign.’ So also Baptism is called in the Acta Thomæ, § 26, ἡ σφραγὶς τοῦ λουτροῦ , and elsewhere in the Fathers simply ἡ σφραγίς . Grabe, Spicil. Patr. i. 333) <strong> of the righteousness</strong> (to stamp, and certify the righteousness) <strong> of the faith</strong> (gen. of apposition (but not <em> in</em> appos. with δικ . by <em> construction</em> ), ‘of the righteousness which consisted in his faith,’ not, ‘of his justification by faith:’ the present argument treats of faith <em> accounted</em> as righteousness) <strong> which was</strong> (or, ‘ <em> which he had</em> :’ τῆς may refer either to δικ . or to πίστ ., but better to the former, because the object is to shew that the righteousness was imputed in uncircumcision) <strong> during his uncircumcision</strong> . In literal historical matter of fact, Abraham received circumcision as a seal of <em> the covenant</em> between God and him ( Gen 17:1-14 ). But this covenant was only a <em> renewal of that very one, on the promise of which Abraham’s faith was exercised</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:5-6">Genesis 15:5-6</span> , and each successive renewal of which was a fresh approval of that faith. The Apostle’s point is, that the righteousness was reckoned, and the promise made, to Abraham, <em> not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision</em> .

<p>Abraham is <em> the father of the faithful</em> . But the triumph and recognition of that faith whereby he was constituted so, was not during his circumcision, but during his uncircumcision: therefore <em> the faithful, his descendants, must not be confined to the circumcised, but must take in the uncircumcised also</em> .

<p>On πατέρα in this sense, Tholuck compares the expression <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:20">Genesis 4:20</span> ; 1Ma 2:54 ( Φινεὲς ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ ζηλῶσαι ζῆλον ), and Maimonides, ‘Moses is the father of all the prophets who succeeded him.’ See also our Lord’s saying, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:37">John 8:37</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:39">John 8:39</span> . The Rabbinical book Michlal Jophi on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mal+2:0">Malachi 2:0</span> . (Thol.) has a sentiment remarkably coincident with that in our text: “Abraham is the father of all those who follow his faith.”
