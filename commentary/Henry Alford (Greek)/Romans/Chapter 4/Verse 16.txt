<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] <strong> For this</strong> (viz. the following) <strong> reason it</strong> (the <em> inheritance</em> , not the <em> promise</em> ; the promise was not strictly speaking ἐκ πίστεως : nor must we supply <em> they</em> , meaning the heirs, who although they might fairly be said to be ἐκ πίστεως (compare οἱ ἐκ νόμου above, and reff.) could hardly be without harshness described as being κατὰ χάριν ) <strong> was by faith that it might be</strong> (strictly the <em> purpose</em> ; not, ‘so that it was’) <strong> according to grace</strong> (free unmerited favour. As the <em> law</em> bringing the <em> knowledge of guilt</em> , works <em> wrath</em> , so the <em> promise</em> , awakening <em> faith</em> , manifests God’s <em> free grace</em> , the end for which it was given); <strong> in order that the promise might be sure</strong> (not, ‘so that the promise was sure:’ this was the <em> result</em> , but the Apostle states this as the aim and end of the inheritance being by faith, quoad <em> the seed of Abraham</em> , that they all might be inheritors, as the manifestation of God’s grace was the higher aim and end) <strong> to all the seed, not only to that</strong> (part of it) <strong> which is of the law</strong> (see Rom 4:14 ), <strong> but to that which is of the faith</strong> (walks in the steps of the faith, Rom 4:12 ) of <strong> Abraham</strong> (it is altogether wrong to make Ἀβραάμ depend on σπέρματι expressed or understood, as Œcum., Koppe, and Fritzsche). The part of the seed which is of the law <em> here</em> is of course confined to <em> believing</em> Jews; <em> the seed</em> being <em> believers only</em> . This has been sometimes lost sight of, and the whole argument of Rom 4:13-16 treated as if it applied to the doctrine of justification by faith without the works of the law, a point <em> already proved, and now presupposed</em> , the present argument being an historical and metaphysical one, proceeding on the facts of Abraham’s history, and the natures respectively of the law and grace, to prove him to be the father of all believers, uncircumcised as well as circumcised.

<p><strong> ὅς ἐστιν πατὴρ πάντων ἡμῶν</strong> ] By the last declaration, the <em> paternity</em> of Abraham, which is co-extensive with the <em> inheritance</em> , has been extended to <em> all who are of his faith</em> ; here therefore it is reasserted: ἡμῶν meaning τῶν πιστευόντων .</p>
