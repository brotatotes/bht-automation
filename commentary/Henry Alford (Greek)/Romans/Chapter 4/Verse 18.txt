Thus here, the hope existed as the necessary concomitant and in some sense the condition of the faith) <strong> hope, in order to his becoming the father of many nations</strong> (i.e. as a step in the process of his becoming, and one necessary to that process going forward. He would never have become, &amp;c., had be not believed. To render εἰς τὸ γεν . ‘that he should become,’ and connect it with ἐπίστευσεν (Theophyl., Beza, all., De Wette) is against Paul’s usage, who never connects πιστεύω with a neut. inf., and not justified by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:10">1 Thessalonians 3:10</span> .

<p>The mere <em> consecutive</em> sense, ‘so that he became,’ here, as every where, is a weakening of the sense (see however note on ch. Rom 1:20 ), and besides, would introduce an objective clause in a passage which all refers subjectively to Abraham).
