<p><strong> 4. </strong> <strong> τῷ ἐργαζομ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] (q. d. τῷ ἐργάτῃ , but the part. is used because of the negative τῷ μὴ ἐργαζ . following) <strong> to the workman</strong> (him that works for hire, that earns wages, compare προσηργάσατο , Luk 19:16 ) <strong> his wages are not reckoned according to</strong> (as a matter of) <strong> grace</strong> (favour), <strong> but according to</strong> (as a matter of) <strong> debt</strong> . The stress is on κατὰ χάριν , not on λογίζεται , which in this first member of the sentence, is used hardly in the strict sense, of <em> imputing</em> or <em> reckoning</em> , but of <em> allotting</em> or <em> apportioning</em> : its use being occasioned by the stricter λογίζεται below. And the sentence is a <em> general</em> one, not with any peculiar reference to Abraham, except that after κατὰ χάριν we may supply ὡς τῷ Ἀβραάμ , if we will; for this is evidently assumed.</p>
