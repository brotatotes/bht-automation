<p><strong> 1</strong> .] It is impossible to resist the strong manuscript authority for the reading ἔχωμεν in this verse. For indeed this may well be cited as the crucial instance of overpowering diplomatic authority compelling us to adopt a reading against which our subjective feelings rebel. Every internal consideration tends to impugn it. If admitted, the sentence is <em> hortatory. ‘Being then justified by faith</em> , let us have <em> peace with God</em> .’ (This is the only admissible sense of the first person subjunctive in an affirmative sentence like the present. The usage is an elliptical one: ἴωμεν , ‘ <em> that we go</em> ,’ i.e. ‘ <em> it is time</em> ,’ or in an address, ‘ <em> permit</em> , &amp;c. that we go.’ Thus Od. χ . 77, ἐλθωμεν ἀνὰ ἄστυ : Il. χ . 450. ἴδωμ ʼ, ἅτιν ʼ ἔργα τέτυκται . See other examples in Kühner, Gramm. § 463. The <em> deliberative</em> sense, attempted to be given by Dr. Tregelles (see Kitto’s Journal of Bibl. Lit. No. xiv. p. 465 ff.) can only have place in an <em> interrogative</em> or <em> dubitative</em> clause, and every example given by Mr. Green, whom he cites for his supposed sense, as well as by Kühner (§ 464), is of this kind. Besides, to call the sense ‘we ought to have,’ <em> deliberative</em> , seems a misnomer.) But how can man be exhorted to <em> have</em> peace with God? To be <em> reconciled</em> to God, he may, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:20">2 Corinthians 5:20</span> ; but of this there is no mention here, and <em> having</em> (been allowed to believe in and enjoy) <em> peace with God</em> , depends on, not <em> our</em> reconciliation to Him, not any thing subjective in ourselves, but the objective fact of <em> His reconciliation to us</em> . If, as tome say, ( ἔχωμεν = κατέχωμεν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:23">Hebrews 10:23</span> , the article would be required before εἰρήνην , and (perhaps) before πρὸς or διὰ . Besides which there are two objections in the <em> form of the sentence</em> to this reading: (1) ἔχ . is coupled by καὶ ( δι ʼ οὗ καί ) to ἐσχήκαμεν , and this connexion necessitates, in my view, that the first verb should <em> assert a fact</em> , as the second undoubtedly does. With the former verb in the subjunctive we should hardly have expected the καί where it is. (2) If ἔχωμεν be hortatory, καυχώμεθα , in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span> , must be so likewise: (for if we were exhorted to the <em> lesser</em> degree of confidence, εἰρήνην ἔχειν , such exhortation can hardly be founded on the existence already of the <em> greater</em> degree, καυχᾶσθαι κ . τ . λ .) which, both as to sense and construction, is very improbable. I believe (but see below) an account of the reading may be sought, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:49">1 Corinthians 15:49</span> , in a tendency of those who transcribed some of our MSS. to give such assertions a <em> hortatory</em> , or, where interrogative, a <em> deliberative form</em> : thus we have σωθησώμεθα in some MSS., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:10">Romans 5:10</span> , ζήσωμεν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:2">Romans 6:2</span> , πιστεύωμεν or πιστεύσωμεν , and συνζήσωμεν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:8">Romans 6:8</span> , ὑπακούσατε , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:17">Romans 6:17</span> , προσεύξωμαι (bis), <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:15">1 Corinthians 14:15</span> , πείθωμεν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:11">2 Corinthians 5:11</span> , πιστεύωμεν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:42">John 4:42</span> , συνζήσωμεν and συμβασιλεύσωμεν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11-12">2 Timothy 2:11-12</span> : or perhaps the whole ground of the account to be given of the <strong> ω</strong> is better shifted to a more general habit of the MSS. (even the greatest and best, see instances in prolegg. to Vol. I. ch. vi. § 1:36, 37) to confound ο and ω : so that in very many cases, such variation can hardly be called a different reading at all.

<p>The whole passage is <em> declaratory of the consequences flowing from justification by faith</em> , and <em> does not exhort, but assert</em> . Nor, would it seem, does the place for exhortation arrive, till these consequences have been in the fullest and freest manner set forth, indeed so fully and freely, that the objection arising from their supposed abuse has first to be answered. <strong> Being therefore justified</strong> (‘ <em> having been justified</em> :’ it is an <em> act past</em> on the Christian, not like sanctification, an abiding and increasing work) <strong> by</strong> (as the ground) <strong> faith, let us</strong> (believers in Christ: I render the <em> existing text</em> ) <strong> have peace</strong> (‘reconcilement;’ the opposite of ὀργή , see Rom 5:9 ) <strong> with</strong> (‘in regard of,’ see reff.) <strong> God through</strong> (by means of) <strong> our Lord Jesus Christ</strong> . With regard to the nature of this peace (= <em> state of reconciliation</em> , ‘no more condemnation,’ as ch. Rom 8:1 ) see above, on the reading ἔχωμεν .</p>
