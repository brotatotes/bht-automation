<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] The same is substantiated in another form: ‘we were enemies (see below) when He died and reconciled us: much more now that we have been reconciled, and He lives, shall we by His life be saved.’ <strong> For if, being enemies</strong> ( ἐχθροί may either be active, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:21">Colossians 1:21</span> , ‘ <em> haters of God</em> ;’ so ἐχθρά , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:7">Romans 8:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span> ; or passive, as ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:28">Romans 11:28</span> , ‘ <em> hated by God</em> .’ But here the latter meaning alone can apply, for the Apostle is speaking of the Death of Christ and its effects as applied to all time, not merely to those believers who then lived: and those unborn at the death of Christ could not have been ἐχθροί in the active sense), <strong> we were reconciled</strong> ( καταλλάσσεσθαί τινι also may be taken of <em> giving up anger against any one</em> , see ref. 1 Cor., and Jos. Antt. vi. 7. 4, οὐ γὰρ ἑώρα τὸν θεὸν διαλλαττόμενον , or of <em> being received into favour by any one</em> , see 1 Kings 29:4, ἐν τίνι διαλλαγήσεται οὗτος τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτοῦ ; and Jos. Antt. v. 2. 8, διαλυσάμενος τὰς μέμψεις , καταλλάττεται πρὸς αὐτήν , the latter of which meanings, <em> were received into favour with God</em> , must for the reason above given be here adopted) <strong> to God by means of the death of His Son</strong> (this great fact is further explained and insisted on, in the rest of the chapter), <strong> much more, having been reconciled</strong> (but here comes in the assumption that the corresponding subjective part of reconciliation has been accomplished, viz. justification by faith: compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19-20">2 Corinthians 5:19-20</span> , θεὸς ἦν ἐν χριστῷ <strong> κόσμον καταλλάσσων ἑαυτῷ</strong> … δεόμεθα ὑπὲρ χριστοῦ , <strong> καταλλάγητε τῷ θεῷ</strong> <strong> .</strong> Both these, the objective reception into God’s favour by the death of Christ, and the subjective appropriation, by faith, of that reception, are included), <strong> we shall be saved by means of His Life</strong> (not here <em> that which he now does</em> on our behalf, but simply <em> the fact of His Life</em> , so much enlarged on in ch. 6: and our sharing in it).</p>
