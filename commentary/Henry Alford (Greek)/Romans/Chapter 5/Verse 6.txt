<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] The text here is in some confusion, see var. readd. The whole may perhaps have arisen from an ecclesiastical portion having begun χριστὸς ὄντων ἡμῶν ἀσθενῶν ἔτι … When this found its <strong> way</strong> into the text, ἔτι was repeated. This offended the transcribers: but the first ἔτι could not be <em> erased</em> , because γάρ followed; it may then have been conjecturally emended to εἰ (and γάρ to γέ as in B, or δέ as in L), or εἰς τί , some retaining ἔτι in both places. The place of ἔτι is often, in the case of absolutes, at the beginning of a sentence, with the subject of the senence between it and the word or words to which it applies; so ἔτι αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46">Matthew 12:46</span> , ἔτι δέ αὐτοῦ μακρὰν ἀπέχοντος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:20">Luke 15:20</span> , &amp;c. On reconsideration, however, seeing that if we follow the most ancient MSS., we must either <em> repeat</em> <strong> ἔτι</strong> , which seems very unlikely to have been originally written, or adopt the reading of B, I have taken the latter alternative. <strong> If, that is</strong> (on <strong> εἴ γε</strong> , see note, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:3">2 Corinthians 5:3</span> , and Eph 3:2 ), <strong> Christ when we were yet weak</strong> (‘powerless for good;’ or even stronger than that: there seems in this verse to be a tacit reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:0">Ezekiel 16:0</span> . See especially Rom 5:7-8 of that chap. in the LXX, σὺ δὲ ἦσθα γυμνὴ καὶ ἀσχημονοῦσα καὶ διῆλθον διὰ σοῦ καὶ ἴδον σε , καὶ ἰδοὺ καιρός σου … καὶ διεπέτασα τὰς πτέρυγάς μου ἐπὶ σέ , καὶ ἐκάλυψα τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην σου , καὶ ὤμοσά σοι · καὶ εἰσῆλθον ἐν διαθήκῃ μετὰ σοῦ , λέγει κύριος ), <strong> in due season</strong> (i.e. at the appointed time; compare reff. and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span> , and καιρός in the quotation above) <strong> Christ died for</strong> (‘on behalf of,’ see reff.) <strong> ungodly men</strong> (not ὑπὲρ <strong> ἡμῶν</strong> , because the Apostle wishes to bring out fully by this strong antithesis, which he enlarges on in the next verses, the greatness of the divine Love to man).</p>
