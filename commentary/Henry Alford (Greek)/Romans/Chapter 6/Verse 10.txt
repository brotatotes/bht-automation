<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] <strong> For</strong> (the proof of the foregoing) <strong> the death which He died</strong> (not ‘ <em> in that He died</em> ,’ as E. V., nor is ὅ for καθ ʼ ὅ , either here or in ref. Gal., but the accus. objective, governed by the verb. So also of ὃ δὲ ζῇ below), <strong> unto sin He died</strong> (De Wette well remarks that we must in <em> expressing</em> this verse abide by the <em> indefinite</em> reference to sin in which the death of Christ is placed; if we attempt to make it more definite, ‘ <em> for sin</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> to that state, in which He suffered the punishment of sin</em> ,’ we shall lose the point of comparison, which lies in ‘ <em> to sin</em> ,’ and ‘ <em> to God</em> .’ If we are to <em> expand</em> the words ‘ <em> died to sin</em> ,’ we must say that our Lord at death passed into a state in which He had ‘ <em> no more to do with sin</em> ’ either as <em> tempting</em> Him (though in vain), or as <em> requiring to be atoned for</em> (this having been now effected), or as <em> met by Him</em> in daily contradiction which He endured from sinners) <strong> once for all</strong> (so that it is not to be repeated: see reff.); <strong> but the life which He liveth</strong> (see above) <strong> He liveth unto God</strong> (indefinite again, but easily filled up and explained: <em> to God</em> , as being glorified by and with the Father, as entirely rid of conflict with sin and death, and having only God’s (properly so called) work to do, as waiting till, in the purposes of the Father, all things are put under Him: and <em> to</em> (for) <em> God</em> , as being the manifestation and brightness of the Father’s glory).</p>
