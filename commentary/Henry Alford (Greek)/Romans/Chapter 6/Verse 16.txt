Then this is applied in the form of a dilemma, implying that there is no third service, q. d. ‘Now this must be true of you <em> with regard either to sin or to God</em> .’ <strong> Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants with a view to obedience, his servants ye are to whom ye obey</strong> , (and in this case) <strong> either</strong> ( ἤτοι ἤ only occurs here in N.
