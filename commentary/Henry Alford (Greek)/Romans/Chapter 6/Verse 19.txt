<p><strong> 19.</strong> ] For the expression <strong> ἐδουλώθητε</strong> the Apostle apologizes: ‘it is not literally so; the servant of righteousness is <em> no slave</em> , under no yoke of bondage; but in order to set the contrast between the former and the new state better before you, I have used this word:’ <strong> I speak as a man</strong> (according to the requirements of rhetorical antithesis) <strong> on account of the</strong> (intellectual, as De W. and Thol.: not moral, as Meyer and Olsh.) <strong> weakness of your flesh</strong> (i.e. ‘because you are σαρκικοί and not πνευματικοί , and want such figures to set the truth before you.’
	</p>
<p>Orig [39] , Chrys., Theodoret, Calv., Estius, Wetst., al., take these words in a totally different sense: ‘ <em> I require of you nothing which your fleshly weakness will not bear</em> ’): <strong> for</strong> (explanatory of ἐδουλώθ .) <strong> like as ye</strong> (once) <strong> rendered up your members (as) servants to impurity and to lawlessness</strong> (two divisions of ἁμαρτία impurity, against a man’s self, lawlessness against God), <strong> unto lawlessness</strong> (both which, ἀκαθ . and ἀνομ ., <em> lead to</em> ἀνομία , <em> result</em> in it: ‘qui justitiæ serviunt, <em> proficiunt</em> : ἄνομοι , iniqui, sunt <em> iniqui, nihil amplius</em> .’ Bengel: not ‘ <em> from one</em> ἀνομία <em> to another</em> ,’ as Œcum., Theophyl., Luth., Grot., Erasm., al.: because (De W.) ἀνομία is not an <em> act</em> , but a principle), <strong> so now render up your members (as) servants to righteousness</strong> (see Rom 6:16 ) <strong> unto</strong> (leading to, having as its result, perfect) <strong> sanctification</strong> (contrast to ἀνομία , and both embracing their respective consequences).
