<p><strong> 9.</strong> ] This and the following verse explain what sort of a life with Christ is meant, by what we know of the Resurrection-life of Christ himself. The only difficulty here is in <strong> οὐκ ἔτι κυριεύει</strong> , as implying that Death <em> had</em> dominion over Christ, which we know it <em> had not</em> : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:17-18">John 10:17-18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:24">Acts 2:24</span> . But this vanishes, when we remember that our Lord, by submitting to Death, virtually, and in the act of death, surrendered Himself into the power of Death. Death could not hold Him, and had no power over Him further than by his own sufferance: but power over Him it <em> had</em> , inasmuch as <em> He died</em> .</p>
