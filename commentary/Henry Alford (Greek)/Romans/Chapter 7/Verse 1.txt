<p><strong> 1.</strong> ] Connect with ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:14">Romans 6:14</span> , which is in fact the sentence immediately preceding. Reiche and Meyer connect with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:23">Romans 6:23</span> ; ‘The gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord: this you can only doubt by being ignorant,’ &amp;c.

<p>Krehl believes ch. 7 to be the expansion of ‘Death is the wages of sin,’ and ch. 8, of ‘the free gift of God is eternal life.’ But not only does this division not hold, for much of ch. 8 regards the conflict with sin and infirmity, but the prominence of νόμος as the subject here forbids the connexion with ὀψώνια τῆς ἁμαρτ θάνατος .

<p>The steps of the proof are these: <em> The law binds a man only so long </em> <strong><em> as</em></strong> <em> he lives</em> ( Rom 7:1 ): e.g. a married woman is only bound to her husband so long as he lives ( Rom 7:2-3 ): so also the Christian <em> being dead</em> with Christ and alive to Him <em> is freed from the law</em> ( Rom 7:4 ).

<p><strong> γινώσκουσιν γ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> νόμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λαλ</strong> <strong> .] For I am speaking</strong> (writing) <strong> to men acquainted with the law</strong> ; i.e. the persons to whom I address this epistle are such as know the law: not ‘I speak to <em> those who know</em> the law,’ as if he were now addressing a different class of persons, which would require τοῖς γὰρ γινώσκουσιν τὸν νόμον τοῦτό φημι , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:21">Galatians 4:21</span> . Nor does the knowledge of the law here affirmed of the Romans prove that the majority of them were Jewish Christians: they may have been Gentile proselytes.
