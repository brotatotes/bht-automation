<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] <strong> Did then the good</strong> (= ‘that which was good,’ i.e. ἡ ἐντολή , but made abstract for the sake of greater contrast) <strong> become death</strong> (so ὁ νόμ ., <strong> ἁμαρτια</strong> , Rom 7:7 <strong> ) to me</strong> ? Was it, after all, <em> the commandment itself</em> that became to me this death of which I speak?
	</p>
<p><strong> Far from it: but</strong> (it was) <strong> sin</strong> (that became death to me.

<p>The construction adopted by Vulg., Luth., al., ἀλλὰ ἡ ἁματρία , ἵνα φανῇ ἁμ ., διὰ τ . ἀγ . μοι κατεργαζομένη [ ἧν ] θάνατον , is hardly admissible); <strong> that it might appear</strong> (be shewn to be) <strong> sin</strong> , (by) <strong> working death to me by means of the good</strong> (that which was good: see above. The misuse and perversion of good is one of the tests whereby the energy of evil is detected; so that sin, by its perversion of the (good) commandment into a cause (evil) of death, was shewn in its real character <em> as sin</em> . That this is the rendering is evident by the following clause, which is parallel with it. Erasm., Valla, Elsner, Dr. Burton, al., make ἁμαρτία the <em> subject</em> : ‘that sin might appear to be working death, &amp;c.’ (‘so that sin <em> appears</em> to <em> have effected</em> my death,’ &amp;c. Dr. Burton, most ungrammatically): there is no objection to this on the ground of ἁμαρτ . being anarthrous, as even Bp. Middleton himself reluctantly acknowledges; the objection lies in the context, as above), <strong> that</strong> (explains and runs parallel with the former ἵνα , as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:3">2 Corinthians 9:3</span> , where he adds to the 2nd ἵνα , καθὼς ἔλεγον ) <strong> by means of the commandment sin might become exceeding</strong> (above measure) <strong> sinful</strong> : i.e. that sin, which was before unknown as such, might, being vivified and brought into energy by (its opposition to) the commandment, be brought out as being (not merely ‘ <em> shewn to be</em> ’) exceedingly sinful (sinful in an exaggerated degree prominent in its true character as the opponent of God).</p>
