<p><strong> 7.</strong> ] <strong> τί οὖν ἐρ</strong> ., see note, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1">Romans 6:1</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ὁ ν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἁμαρτία</strong> <strong> ;</strong> ] <strong> Is the law</strong> (not, as Jowett, ‘ <em> conscience</em> ,’ but in our case, the revealed law of God, which awoke the conscience to action) <strong> sin</strong> ? not ‘ <em> the cause of sin</em> ,’ which in one sense the Apostle would not have denied, but <em> sin</em> , abstract for concrete, <em> sinful</em> , or, as Bengel, ‘causa peccati peccaminosa.’ ὁ νόμος itself being abstract, that which is predicated of it is abstract also. The contrast is, ὁ νόμος ἅγιος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:12">Romans 7:12</span> . The question itself refers back to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5">Romans 7:5</span> , τὰ παθήματα τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν τὰ διὰ τοῦ νόμου . It is asked, <em> not by an objector</em> , but by the Apostle himself, in anticipation of an objection.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀλλά</strong> ] <strong> Is but</strong> here in contrast to ὁ νόμ . ἁμαρτ ., meaning, ‘so far from that,’ or is it a qualification of μὴ γένοιτο , meaning ‘but still it is true, that …?’ Neither explanation exactly suits the context, which is, by a proper elucidation of the law’s working as regards sin, to prove it to be holy. I would rather understand ἀλλά , <strong> but what I mean is …, I say not that, but</strong> … There surely is no <em> contrast</em> to ὁ νόμ . ἁυαρτία , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:8">Romans 7:8</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> οὐκ ἔγνων</strong> ] ‘non cognoscebam, ni …,’ <strong> I was living in a state of ignorance of sin, were it not</strong> … This construction comprehends in it οὐκ ἂν ἔγνων as a consequence, and is therefore often said to be put for it; but it has its propriety, as here, where a historical state is being described, and the unconditional indicative is more appropriate. Tholuck makes it = ‘non cognoveram, ni …’ in which case the indic, expresses more plainly than the conjunctive the absolute dependence of the fact on the condition.
	</p>
<p>There is some difficulty in understanding the mutual relation of the clauses, τὴν ἁμ . οὐκ ἔγνων , and τήν τε γὰρ ἐπιθ . οὐκ ᾔδειν . It is well known that τε differs from καί , in not <em> coupling things co-ordinate</em> , but <em> attaching things subordinate</em> , to a former. Thus Thucyd. i. 9 begins Ἀγαμέμνων τέ μοι δοκεῖ …, on which Poppo remarks (cited by Thol.), ‘Sequitur <em> exemplum</em> auctæ Græcorum opulentiæ … ductum ex rebus Agamemnonis et causis expeditionis Trojanæ;’ an <em> example</em> being a subordinate verification of a general categorical statement. The γάρ also shews that the second clause is subordinated to, and aileged in substantiation of the first. Then <em> what is</em> <strong> ἁμαρτία</strong> ? Is it sin in <em> act</em> , or sin in <em> principle</em> , the principle of sin? Not <em> sin in act</em> , so that ἁμ . οὐκ ἔγν . should mean, ‘ <em> I had not entered into contact with sin</em> ,’ i.e. ‘ <em> had not sinned</em> :’ as Fritz.: for then the law would have truly and actually been the cause of sin: nor, <em> sin in act</em> , so that the meaning were, ‘ <em> I had not known the nature of a sinful act</em> :’ for this would not agree with the subordination of ἐπιθυμία below: the ἐπιθ . being more general ( πᾶσαν ἐπιθ .) than the particular acts which it induced. But the reference must be to <em> sin in principle</em> , the principle of sin: <strong> I had not recognized such a thing as sin, but by means of the law</strong> . So Calv., Melancth., Calov., Rückert, Kölln., Olsh., Thol., De Wette.
	</p>
<p><strong> The law</strong> here is in the full sense of <em> the Mosaic law</em> as regarded <em> himself</em> , not excluding the wider sense on which I have insisted in the former part of the Epistle when applied to <em> others</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> τήν τε γὰρ</strong> <strong> …</strong> ] <strong> For neither</strong> (‘neque enim’) had <strong> I known</strong> (by experience: ‘known any thing of’) <strong> coveting</strong> (the motions of the flesh towards sin, whether acted on or not, whether consented to or not: this <em> motion</em> he would not have <em> perceived</em> , because he was simply <em> moving with it</em> ) <strong> if the law had not said, Thou shalt not covet</strong> (reff. Exod. Deut.). ‘ <em> Covet</em> ,’ in the above sense. The Apostle omits all the objects there specified, and merely lays hold of the idea contained in ἐπιθυμήσεις . And it may well be said and strictly, that the ‘coveting’ there spoken of would lead to all kinds of sin therefore murder, adultery, &amp;c., if carried out: and that the prohibition of desire there serves as an example of what the law actually forbids elsewhere.</p>
