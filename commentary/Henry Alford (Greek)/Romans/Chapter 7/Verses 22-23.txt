<p>συνήδομαι is a stronger expression than σύμφημι , Rom 7:16 ) <strong> the law of God after the inner man</strong> (= νοῦς , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:25">Romans 7:25</span> , see reff. and compare Peter’s ὁ κρυπτὸς τῆς καρδίας ἄνθρωπος , ref. 1 Pet. But not <em> merely</em> the <em> mental and reasoning part of man</em> : for that surely <em> does not</em> delight in the <strong> law</strong> of God: it is <em> absolutely necessary</em> to presuppose the <em> influence of the Holy Spirit</em> , and to place the man in <em> a state of grace before this assertion can be true</em> . And it is surprising to find Commentators like Tholuck and De Wette, while they acknowledge that συνήδομαι is stronger than σύμφημι , yet denying the gradual introduction of the <em> spiritual man</em> in the description of this conflict. True, THE SPIRIT is not yet introduced, because purposely kept back until treated of as the great deliverer from this state of death; the man is as yet described as compounded of the outer and inner man, of ἡ σάρξ and ὁ νοῦς , and the operations of the two are detailed <em> as if unassisted</em> , even the term πνεῦμα for the human spirit being as yet avoided, but all this is done, because <em> the object is to set the conflict and misery, as existing even in the spiritual man, in the strongest light</em> , so that the question in Rom 7:24 may lead the way to the <em> real uses</em> and <em> blessed results</em> of this conflict in ch. 8); <strong> but I see</strong> (= ‘ <em> find</em> :’ as if he were a spectator of that which is going on within) <strong> a different law</strong> (differing in kind and aim, not = ἄλλος merely) <strong> in my members</strong> (= ἐν τῇ σαρκί μου , Rom 7:18 ), <strong> warring against</strong> ([in continual dissension and conflict with] ἀντιστρ . is not to be joined with βλέπω so as to = ἀντιστρατεύεσθαι , though that would be an allowable construction, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:23">Acts 8:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:10">1 Corinthians 8:10</span> , but βλέπω μου forms an independent sentence antithetic to συνήδομαι ἄνθρωπον ) <strong> the law of my mind</strong> (the consent viz., to the law of God, which my mind yields; not = the law of God, any more than the different law in my members = the law of sin, but both meaning the standard or rule set up, which inclination follows: the one in the νοῦς , <em> in harmony with the law of God</em> , the other in the μέλη or σάρξ , <em> subservient</em> , and causing subservience, <em> to the principle or law of sin</em> ), <strong> and bringing me</strong> (the whole complex self the ‘me’ of personality and action) <strong> into captivity with</strong> ( <strong> ἐν</strong> , not exactly ‘ <em> by means of</em> ,’ but pointing out the department in which, the investiture with which, the taking captive has place. Nor would the simple dative be ‘ <em> by means of</em> ,’ as Chrys, Theodoret, Theophyl., but merely ‘ <em> to</em> :’ the dat. commodi aft. αἰχμαλ .) <strong> the law of sin</strong> (the sinful principle, of resistance to God’s law, ἡ ἁμαρτία as awakened and set energizing, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:9">Romans 7:9</span> , by that law) <strong> which is in my members.

<p>Commentators have much disputed whether the ἔτερος νόμος , and the νόμος τῆς ἁμαρτ ., both ἐν τοῖς μέλεσίν μου , are <em> different</em> , or the <em> same</em> . The former view is held by Calv., Beza, Köllner, Rückert, De W.: the latter by Reiche, Meyer, Fritz., Tholuck. It appears to me (see above) that the identity cannot be maintained without introducing great confusion into the sentence.</p>
