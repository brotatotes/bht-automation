<p><strong> 1.</strong> ] <strong> Now</strong> ([in slight] contrast to the last verse [he brings out one point, which might seem to be an exception to the blessed consequences of the life-giving power of Christ indwelling in us]) <strong> if Christ is in you</strong> (= πν . θεοῦ οἰκεῖ ἐν ὑμ ., see 2Co 3:17 ), <strong> the</strong> (your) <strong> body indeed is dead on account of sin</strong> (still remains dead, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:11-14">2 Corinthians 4:11-14</span> , under the power of death physical (and eternal?) because of sin which it, <em> per se</em> , stands in, and serves), <strong> but the</strong> (your) <strong> spirit</strong> ( τὴν ψυχὴν λέγει , ὡς πνευματικὴν ἤδη γεγενημένην . Schol. ap. Matthæi (Thol.): or rather perhaps he [now] uses πνεῦμα , regarding our spirits as possessed and penetrated by God’s Spirit) <strong> is life</strong> (this would hardly be said if <em> only our human spirits</em> were meant, but the description would be in the adjectival form) <strong> on account of righteousness</strong> (not <em> here</em> the imputed righteousness of justification, which is not now under treatment, but the <em> implanted righteousness of the sanctification of the Spirit</em> . This appears not only from the context, but also from the διὰ ἁμαρτίαν , which answers to it).</p>
