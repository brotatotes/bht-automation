<p><strong> 22.</strong> ] <strong> For we know</strong> (said of an acknowledged and patent fact, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:2">Romans 2:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:19">Romans 3:19</span> ; Rom 7:14 ) <strong> that the whole creation groans together and travails together</strong> (not, groans and travails <em> with us</em> or <em> with mankind</em> , which would render the οὐ μόνον δὲ ἀλλά of the next verse superfluous. On the figure in συνωδίνει see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:21">John 16:21</span> , note) [ <strong> until now</strong> (i.e.] <strong> up to this time</strong> = <em> from the beginning till now</em> : no reference to time future, because οἴδαμεν γάρ expresses the results of <em> experience</em> ).</p>
