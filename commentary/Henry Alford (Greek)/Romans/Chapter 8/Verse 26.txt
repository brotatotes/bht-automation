<p><strong> 26.</strong> ] <strong> Likewise</strong> (another help to our endurance, co-ordinate with the last our patience is one help to it, but not the only one) <strong> the Spirit also</strong> (the Holy Spirit of God) <strong> helps our weakness</strong> (not, helps us <em> to bear</em> our weakness, as if the weakness were the burden, which the Spirit lifts for and with us, but, helps <em> our weakness, us who are weak</em> , to bear the burden of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span> . And this weakness is not only inability to pray aright, which is only an <em> example</em> of it, but <em> general weakness</em> . This has been seen, and the reading consequently altered to the plural, which was at first perhaps a marginal gloss). <strong> For</strong> (example of the help above mentioned; the τό binding together the clause, see reff., and here implying ‘exempli gratiâ,’ ‘for <em> this viz</em> . what to &amp;c.’) <strong> what we should pray as we ought</strong> (two things; <em> what we</em> should pray, the <em> matter</em> of our prayer; and <em> how</em> we should pray it, the <em> form</em> and <em> manner</em> of our prayer) <strong> we know not: but the Spirit itself</strong> (Thol. remarks, αὐτό brings into more prominence the idea of the πνεῦμα , so as to express of what dignity our Intercessor is, an Intercessor who knows best what our wants are) <strong> intercedes</strong> ( ὑπέρ here does not intensify the verb, as in ὑπερνικᾷν and the like, and as Œc [53] , Erasm., Luth., Bengel, render it, but implies the <em> advocacy</em> , ‘convenire aliquem super negotio alterius,’ as Grot., to express which the ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν of the rec. has been inserted) <strong> with groanings which cannot be expressed</strong> : i.e. the Holy Spirit of God dwelling in us, knowing our wants better than we, Himself pleads in our prayers, raising us to higher and holier desires than we can express in words, which can only find utterance in sighings and aspirations: see next verse. So De W., Thol., Olsh. Chrys. (Hom, xiv., p. 586) interprets it of the χάρισμα of prayer and adds ὁ γὰρ τοιαύτης καταξιωθεὶς χάριτος , ἑστὼς μετὰ πολλῆς τῆς κατανύξεως , μετὰ πολλῶν τῶν στεναγμῶν τῶν κατὰ διάνοιαν τῷ θεῷ προσπίπτων , τὰ συμφέροντα πᾶσιν ᾔτει : similarly Œc [54] and Theophyl. Calv. understands, that the Spirit suggests to us the proper words of acceptable prayer, which would <em> otherwise have been unutterable by us</em> : and similarly Beza, Grot.

<p>ἀλαλήτοις may bear three meanings 1, <em> unspoken</em> : 2, <em> that does not speak, mute</em> (see LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="job+38:14">Job 38:14</span> ; Sir 18:33 compl.): 3, <em> that cannot be spoken</em> . The analogy of verbals in - τος in the N. T. favours the latter meaning: compare ἀνεκδιήγητος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:15">2 Corinthians 9:15</span> , ἄῤῥητος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:4">2 Corinthians 12:4</span> , ἀνεκλάλητος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:8">1 Peter 1:8</span> (Thol.).

<p>Macedonius gathered from this verse that the Holy Spirit is <em> a creature</em> , and <em> inferior to God</em> , because He <em> prays to God for us</em> . But as Aug [55] Tract. vi. in Joan. 2, vol. iii. p. 1425, remarks, ‘non Spiritus Sanctus in semetipso apud semetipsum in illa Trinitate gemit, sed <em> in nobis</em> gemit, quia gemere nos facit.’ No <em> intercession in heaven</em> is here spoken of, but a <em> pleading in us</em> by the indwelling Spirit, of a nature above our comprehension and utterance.
