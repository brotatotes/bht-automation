<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] <strong> For</strong> (the spiritual man cannot seek the things of the flesh, because) <strong> the mind</strong> ( <em> thoughts, cares</em> , and <em> aims</em> as above) <strong> of the flesh is</strong> (ends in the copula (=), as when it joins the two signs of an algebraic operation; ‘ <em> amounts to, being worked out</em> ’) <strong> death</strong> (not merely <em> physical</em> , nor mere <em> unhappiness</em> , as sometimes in ch. 7, but as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:2">Romans 8:2</span> , in the largest sense, extending to eternity); <strong> but the mind</strong> ( <em> thoughts, cares, and aims</em> ) <strong> of the Spirit, is</strong> (see above) <strong> life and peace</strong> (in the largest sense, as above). In this argument there is a suppressed premiss, to be supplied from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:2">Romans 8:2</span> ; viz. ‘The Spirit is the Spirit of <em> life</em> .’ Hence it follows that the spiritual man cannot mind the things of the flesh, because such mind is <em> death</em> . The addition καὶ εἰρήνη seems to be made to enhance the unlikelihood of such a minding, the peace of the Spirit being a blessed contrast to the tumult of the fleshly lusts, even in this life.</p>
