<p><strong> 33</strong> .] <em> Appeal to the prophecy of Isaiah</em> , as justifying this comparison of Christ to a stone of stumbling. The citation is gathered from two places in Isaiah. The ‘stone of stumbling and rock of offence,’ mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:14">Isaiah 8:14</span> , is substituted for the ‘corner-stone elect, precious,’ of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span> . The solution of this is very simple. Isa 8:14 was evidently interpreted by the Jews themselves of the Messiah: for Simeon, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34">Luke 2:34</span> , when speaking of the child Jesus as the Messiah, expressly adduces the prophecy as about to be fulfilled. Similarly Isa 28:16 was interpreted by the Chaldee Targum, the Babylonish Talmud (Tract Sanhedrin, fol. xxxviii. 1, Stuart), &amp;c. What was there then to prevent the Apostle from giving to this Stone, plainly foretold as to be laid in Zion, that designation which prophecy also justifies, and which bears immediately on the matter here in hand? The translation of Isa 8:14 is after the Heb., the LXX having apparently read differently. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:6-8">1 Peter 2:6-8</span> , where the same two texts are joined, and also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span> (Psalms 117:22).

<p><strong> οὐ καταισχυνθήσεται</strong> , LXX ( Isa 28:16 ), οὐ μὴ καταισχυνθῇ , gives a secondary meaning of the Heb. לֹא יָחִישׁ , ‘shall not <em> make haste</em> .’ i.e. shall not fly in terror, shall not be confounded.</p>
