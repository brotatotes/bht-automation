The rendering, ‘ <em> it is not possible that</em> ,’ would require ordinarily οἷόν τε with an infinitive, and St. Paul is asserting, not the <em> impossibility</em> , however true, of God’s word being broken, but the <em> fact</em> , that it <em> was not broken</em> ) <strong> the word</strong> (i.e. the promise) <strong> of God has come to nothing</strong> (see refif., so Lat., <em> excidit</em> ); viz. by many, the majority of the nominal Israel, missing the salvation which seemed to be their inheritance by promise.

<p><strong> For not all who are sprung from Israel</strong> (= Jacob, according to Tholuck: but this does not seem necessary: Israel here as well as below may mean the <em> people</em> , but here in the popular sense, there in the divine idea), <strong> (these) are Israel</strong> (veritably, and in the sense of the promise).</p>
