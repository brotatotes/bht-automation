<p><strong> 1 5</strong> .] <em> The Apostle’s deep sympathy with his own people Israel</em> . The subject on which he is about to enter, so unwelcome to Jews in general, coupled with their hostility to himself, and designation of him as a πλάνος (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:8">2 Corinthians 6:8</span> ; compare also 2Co 1:17 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:1-2">2 Corinthians 4:1-2</span> ; 2Co 7:2 al.), causes him to begin with a προπαραίτησις or deprecation, bespeaking credit for simplicity and earnestness in the assertion which is to follow. This deprecation and assertion of sympathy he puts in the forefront of the section, to take at once the ground from those who might charge him, in the conduct of his argument, with hostility to his own alienated people.

<p><strong> I say</strong> (the) <strong> truth in Christ</strong> (as a Christian, as united to Christ; the ordinary sense of the expression ἐν χριστῷ , so frequent with the Apostle.

<p>It is not an oath, ‘ <em> by</em> Christ,’ for though ἐν with ὄμνυμι bears this meaning, we have no instance of it where the verb is not expressed), <strong> I lie not</strong> (confirmation of the preceding, by shewing that he was aware of what would be laid to his charge, and distinctly repudiating it), <strong> my conscience bearing me witness of the same</strong> (the σύν in composition, as in reff., denoting <em> accordance with the fact</em> , not <em> joint testimony</em> ) <strong> in the Holy Spirit</strong> (much as ἐν χριστῷ above: a conscience not left to itself but informed and enlightened by the Spirit of God. Strangely enough, Griesb., Knapp, and Koppe take these words also for a formula jurandi, and connect them with οὐ ψεύδομαι ), <strong> that</strong> (not <em> because</em> , or <em> for</em> , as Bengel: ὅτι , as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:10">2 Corinthians 11:10</span> , introducing the <em> matter</em> to which the asseveration was directed, I say the truth, when I say, that.…) <strong> I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart</strong> . The reason of this grief is reserved for a yet stronger description of his sympathy in the next verse.</p>
