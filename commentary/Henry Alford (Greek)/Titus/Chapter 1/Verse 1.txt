<p><strong> 1</strong> .] The occurrence of <strong> δοῦλος θεοῦ</strong> , not elsewhere found in the superscriptions of St. Paul’s Epistles, is a mark of genuineness: a forger would have been sure to suit every expression of this kind to the well-known habits of the Apostle.

<p><strong> ἀπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> δέ</strong> ] <strong> δέ</strong> further defines a servant of God, this is general: <em> but</em> a more particular designation also belongs to the present matter. <strong> κατὰ πίστιν</strong> has been variously rendered: (1) ‘ <em> according to the faith of</em> ,’ &amp;c., so E. V., Luth., Matthies, al.: (2) similarly Calv., Beza, Aret., ‘mutuus est inter meum apostolatum et fidem electorum Dei consensus:’ (3) ‘ <em> so as to bring about faith in</em> ,’ &amp;c., as De W., justifying it by κατὰ τὴν ληΐην ἐκπλώσαντες , Herod. ii. 152, κατὰ θέαν ἥκειν , Thuc. vi. 31, so also Thdrt. ( ὥστε πιστεῦσαι τῆς ἐκλογῆς ἀξίους , Œc. 2, Thl. 1, Jer., Grot., al., but see below). We may at once say that (1) and (2) are inadmissible, as setting up a standard which the Apostle would not have acknowledged for his Apostleship, and as not suiting ἐπίγνωσιν below, which also belongs to the κατά . Nor do the instances given to justify (3) apply here: for as Huther has observed, in them it is the <em> acquisition</em> of the noun which is spoken of: so that here it would be to <em> get</em> , not to <em> produce</em> faith. The best sense seems to be that which he gives, that of <em> reference, ‘with regard</em> to,’ i.e. to bring about, cherish, and perfect: nearly in the same sense as εἰς ὑπακοὴν πίστεως , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5">Romans 1:5</span> . See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:1">2 Timothy 1:1</span> . I would render then ‘ <em> for</em> :’ <strong> Paul, a servant of God, but an Apostle of Jesus Christ, for</strong> (on this sense of <strong> κατά</strong> , <em> destination</em> , see Ellic.’s note) <strong> the faith of the elect of God</strong> (those whom God has chosen of the world reff.: and <em> their</em> faith is the only true faith the only faith which the apostolic office would sub-serve) <strong> and the thorough knowledge</strong> (reff. and notes: subjective, and κατά as before to promote the knowledge. Thl. gives as an alternative, διότι ἐπέγνεν τὴν ἀλή θειαν , διὰ τοῦτο ἐπιστεύθην κ . τ . λ .) <strong> of the truth which is according to</strong> (belongs to, is conversant in and coincident with: for as Chrys., ἐστὶν ἀλήθεια πραγμάτων ἀλλ ʼ οὐ κατ ʼ εὐσέβειαν , οἷον τὸ εἰδέναι τὰ γεωργικά , τὸ εἰδέναι τέχνας , ἀληθῶς ἐστὶν εἰδέναι · ἀλλ ʼ αὕτη κατ ʼ εὐσέβειαν ἡ ἀλήθεια . <strong> κατά</strong> cannot, as De W., import the <em> aim</em> , ‘which <em> leads to</em> εὐσ .:’ it does not <em> lead to</em> it, but rather runs parallel with) <strong> piety</strong> ,</p>
