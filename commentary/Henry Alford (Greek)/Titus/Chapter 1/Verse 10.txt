The joining πολύς with another adjective by καί is a common idiom. So Herod. viii. 61, πολλά τε καὶ κακὰ ἔλεγε : Aristoph. Lys. 1159, πολλῶν κἀγαθῶν : Plato, Rep. x. p. 325, πολλά τε καὶ ἀνόσια εἰργασμένος : Xen. Mem. ii. 9. 6, συνειδὼς αὑτῷ πολλὰ καὶ πονηρά . Matthiæ, § 444) <strong> vain talkers</strong> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:6">1 Timothy 1:6</span> , and ch. Tit 3:9 ) <strong> and deceivers</strong> (see Gal 6:3 deceivers of men’s minds), <strong> chiefly</strong> (not <em> only</em> there were some such of the Gentile converts) <strong> they of the circumcision</strong> (i.e. not Jews, but Jewish Christians: for he is speaking of seducers within the Church: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:11">Titus 1:11</span> . On the Jews in Crete, see Jos. Antt. xvii. 12. 1: B.

Juv. Sat. x. 5: “evertere domos totas optantibus ipsis | Di faciles.” Here it will mean, “pervert whole families.” Thl. says, μοχλοὶ γάρ εἰσι τοῦ διαβόλου , δι ʼ ὧν καθαιρεῖ τοὺς τοῦ θεοῦ οἴκους ), <strong> teaching things which are not fitting</strong> (on the use of ἃ <strong> οὐ</strong> δεῖ (things which are definitely improper or forbidden), and <strong> ἃ μὴ</strong> δεῖ (things which are so either in the mind of the describer, or which, as here, derive a seeming <em> contingency</em> from the mode in which the subject is presented), see Ellic.’s note here and his references to Herm. on Viger, 267, and Krüger, Sprachlehre, § 67. 4. 3) <strong> for the sake of base gain</strong> (cf. 1Ti 6:5 ).</p>
