<p><strong> 15</strong> .] <em> The Apostle’s own answer to those who would enforce these commandments</em> . <strong> All things</strong> (absolutely all things with which man can be concerned) <strong> are pure to the pure</strong> ( οὐδὲν ὁ θεὸς ἀκάθαρτον ἐποίησεν · οὐδὲν γὰρ ἀκάθαρτον , εἰ μὴ ἡ ἁμαρτία μόνη . ψυχῆς γὰρ ἅπτεται καὶ ταύτην ῥυποῖ , Chrys. ‘Omnia externa iis qui intus sunt mundi, munda sunt,’ Bengel. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:26">Matthew 23:26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:41">Luke 11:41</span> . There is no ground whatever for supposing this to be a maxim of the false teachers, quoted by the Apostle, any more than the πάντα μοι ἔξεστιν of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:12">1 Corinthians 6:12</span> , where see note. The maxim here is a truly Christian one of the noblest order.

<p><strong> τοῖς καθαροῖς</strong> is the dat. commodi, ‘for the pure to use,’ not, as often taken, ‘in the judgment of the pure.’ This is plainly shewn by the use of the same dative in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:14">Romans 14:14</span> , where to render it ‘in the judgment of’ would introduce an unmeaning tautology: τῷ λογιζομένῳ τι κοινὸν εἶναι , ἐκείνῳ κοινόν ‘to him (for his use) it is really κοινόν .’ As usual in these Epistles (see Prolegg. § i. 38), <em> purity</em> is inseparably connected with soundness in the faith, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:9">Acts 15:9</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:3">1 Timothy 4:3</span> , where our τοῖς καθαροῖς is expanded into τοῖς πιστοῖς καὶ ἐπεγνωκόσιν τὴν ἀλήθειαν ), <strong> but to the polluted and unbelieving</strong> (cf. the preceding remarks) <strong> nothing is pure, but both</strong> (or ‘ <em> even</em> ,’ as E. V.: but the other seems preferable, on account of the close correspondence of καὶ ὁ νοῦς with καὶ ἡ συνείδ .) <strong> their mind</strong> (their rational part, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17">Ephesians 4:17</span> , which presides over and leads all the determinate acts and thoughts of the man) <strong> and their conscience is polluted</strong> (ef. Dion. Hal. de Thucyd. 8, κράτιστον δὲ πάντων τὸ μηδὲν ἑκουσίως ψεύδεσθαι , μηδὲ μιαίνειν τὴν αὑτοῦ συνείδησιν .

<p>And therefore, uncleanness tainting their rational acts and their reflective self-recognitions, nothing can be pure to them: every occasion becomes to them an occasion of sin, every creature of God an instrument of sin; as Mack well observes, “the relation, in which the sinful subject stands to the objects of its possession or of its inclination, is a sinful one.” Philo de legg. spec. ad 6 <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="es+7:0">Esther 7:0</span> dec. cap. § 337, vol. ii. p. 333 f., has a sentence which might be a comment on our verse: ἀκάθαρτος γὰρ κυρίως ὁ ἄδικος καὶ ἀσεβὴς … πάντα φύρων καὶ συγχέων διά τε τὰς ἀμετρίας τῶν παθῶν καὶ τὰς τῶν κακῶν ὑπερβολάς · ὥστε ὧν ἂν ἐφάψηται πραγμάτων πάντα ἐστὶν ἐπίληπτα τῇ τοῦ δρῶντος συμμεταβάλλοντα μοχθηρίᾳ . καὶ γὰρ κατὰ τὸ ἐναντίον αἱ πράξεις τῶν ἀγαθῶν ἐπαινεταί , βελτιούμεναι ταῖς τῶν ἐνεργούντων ἀρεταῖς , ἐπειδὴ πέφυκέ πως τὰ γινόμενα τοῖς δρῶσιν ἐξομοιοῦσθαι . Here again, the reference of the saying has been variously mistaken ἡ ῥυπαρὰ διάνοια κακῶς περὶ τούτων λογιζομένη ἑαυτῇ συμμιαίνει ταῦτα , Œc.: and similarly Chrys., Thl., al.: ‘non placent Deo quæ agunt etiam circa res medias, quia actiones tales ex animo Deus æstimat,’ Grot.: ‘iis nihil prodest externa ablutio et ciborum dierumque observatio,’ Baldwin, Croc. in De W.).</p>
