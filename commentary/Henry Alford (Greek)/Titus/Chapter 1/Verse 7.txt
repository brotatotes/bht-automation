So Thdrt.: ἐντεῦθεν δῆλον , ὡς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ἐπισκόπους ὠνόμαζον ) <strong> to be blameless, as God’s steward</strong> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span> , to which image, that of a responsible servant and dispensator ( 1Pe 4:10 ) in the house of God, the allusion perhaps is, rather than to that of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:1">1 Corinthians 4:1</span> . There is clearly no allusion to the ἐπίσκ .’s <em> own household</em> , as Heydenr. supposes. Mack well remarks, meaning perhaps however more than the words convey, “ <em> God’s steward</em> ; consequently spiritual superiors are not merely servants and commissioned agents of the Church. According to the Apostle’s teaching, church government does not grow up out of the ground”), <strong> not self-willed</strong> ( ἐπίσκοπος ἑκόντων ἄρχων , οὐκ ὀφείλει αὐθάδης εἶναι ὥστε αὐτογνώμως καὶ αὐτοβούλως καὶ ἄνευ γνώμης τῶν ἀρχομένων πράττειν . τυραννικὸν γὰρ τοῦτο , Thl. σεμνότης δ ʼ ἐστὶν αὐθαδείας ἀνὰ μέσον τε καὶ ἀρεσκείας , ἐστὶ δὲ περὶ τὰς ἐντεύξεις . ὅ τε γὰρ αὐθάδης τοιοῦτός ἐστιν οἷος μηθενὶ ἐντυχεῖν μηδὲ διαλεγῆναι , ἀλλὰ τοὔνομα ἔοικεν ἀπὸ τοῦ τρόπου κεῖσθαι · ὁ γὰρ αὐθάδης αὐτοάδης τίς ἐστιν , ἀπὸ τοῦ αὐτὸς αὐτῷ ἀρέσκειν , Aristot.

Eth. Nic. iv. 5: this meaning, and not Thdrt.’s, ὀργίλον δέ , τὸν μνησίκακον , must be taken), <strong> not a brawler, not a striker</strong> (for both these, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span> , notes), <strong> not greedy of gain</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span> , note), <strong> but hospitable</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span> , note, and 3Jn 1:5 ), <strong> a lover of good</strong> (cf. the opposite ἀφιλάγαθος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:3">2 Timothy 3:3</span> . It is hardly likely to mean a lover of <em> good men</em> , coming so immediately after φιλόξενον . Thl. explains it, τὸν ἐπιεικῆ , τὸν μέτριον , τὸν μὴ φθονοῦντα . Dionys. Areop., Ep. viii. 1, p. 597, calls God τὸν ὑπεράγαθον καὶ φιλάγαθον and Clem.

<p>Then how are we to take the following words? Is <strong> τοῦ κατὰ τὴν διδαχὴν πιστοῦ λόγου</strong> equivalent to (1) τοῦ λόγου τοῦ κατὰ τὴν διδαχὴν πιστοῦ , or (2) τοῦ πιστοῦ λόγου τοῦ κατὰ τὴν διδαχήν ? (1) is taken by Wiesinger and Conyb. ( <em> the words which are faithful to</em> (?) <em> our teaching</em> ): (2) by Chrys., Thl., and almost all Commentators, and I believe rightly. For ( α ) it is hard to believe that even in these Epistles, such a sentence could occur as ἀντεχόμενον ( τοῦ - κατὰ - τὴν - διδαχὴν - πιστοῦ ) λόγου : had this been intended, it would certainly have stood τοῦ λ . τοῦ κατὰ τὴν διδ . πιστοῦ : ( β ) the epithet <strong> πιστός</strong> , absolute, is so commonly attached to λόγος in these Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:1">1 Timothy 3:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:9">1 Timothy 4:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11">2 Timothy 2:11</span> ; ch. Tit 3:8 ) as to incline us, especially with the above reason, to take it absolutely here also. I therefore render accordingly) <strong> the faithful</strong> (true, trustworthy, see note on 1Ti 1:15 ) <strong> word</strong> (which is) <strong> according to</strong> (measured by, or in accordance with) <strong> the instruction</strong> ( <strong> which he has received</strong> ) <strong> διδαχή</strong> may be <em> active</em> , as Calv., ‘qui in ecclesiæ ædificationem sit utilis:’ Luth., ‘ <em> dass lehren kann</em> .’ But thus we should have a tautological sentence, in which the practice, and the result of the practice ( ἵνα κ . τ . λ .) would have the same power to instruct predicated of them: besides that ἀντεχόμενον would require some forcing to make it apply in this sense of ‘constantly <em> using</em> .’ The passive acceptation of διδαχή is therefore preferable: and the meaning will be much the same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:14">2 Timothy 3:14</span> , μένε ἐν οἷς ἔμαθες , cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:6">1 Timothy 4:6</span> , οἱ λόγοι τῆς πίστεως καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας ᾗ παρηκολούθηκας . So Ellic. also), <strong> that he may be able both to exhort</strong> (believers) <strong> in</strong> (the element of his παράκλησις ) <strong> healthy teaching</strong> (the teaching which is healthy), <strong> and to reprove</strong> (see Tit 1:13 below) <strong> the gainsayers</strong> .</p>
