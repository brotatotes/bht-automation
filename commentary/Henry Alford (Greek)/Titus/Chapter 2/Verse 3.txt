<p><strong> 3</strong> .] <strong> The aged women</strong> (= πρεσβύτεραι , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:2">1 Timothy 5:2</span> , there being in this case here no official term to occasion confusion) <strong> likewise</strong> (after the same general pattern, to which the separate virtues above mentioned belong) <strong> in deportment</strong> (cf. Porphyr. de abst. in Wetst., τὸ δὲ σεμνὸν κἀκ τοῦ <strong> καταστήματος</strong> ἑωρᾶτο . πορεία τε γὰρ ἦν εὔτακτος , καὶ βλέμμα καθεστηκὸς ἐπετηδεύετο , ὡς ὅτε βουληθεῖεν μὴ σκαρδαμύττειν · γέλως δὲ σπάνιος , εἰ δέ που γένοιτο , μέχρι μειδιασμοῦ . ἀεὶ δὲ ἐντὸς τοῦ σχήματος αἱ χεῖρες . The κατάστημα would thus iuclude <em> gesture and habit</em> , more than καταστολή of 1Ti 2:9 ), <strong> reverend</strong> (two examples, of those given by Wetst., seem nearest to touch the meaning of the word here as connected with outward deportment: the one from Jos. Antt. xi. 8. 5, describing the High Priest Jaddus going forth to meet Alexander the Great, πυθόμενος δ ʼ αὐτὸν οὐ πόῤῥω τῆς πόλεως , πρόεισι μετὰ τῶν ἱερέων καὶ τοῦ πολιτικοῦ πλήθους , ἱεροπρεπῆ καὶ διαφέρουσαν τῶν ἄλλων ἐθνῶν ποιούμενος τὴν ὑπάντησιν … τὸ μὲν πλῆθος ἐν ταῖς λευκαῖς ἐσθῆσι , τοὺς δὲ ἱερεῖς προεστῶτας ἐν ταῖς βυσσίναις αὐτῶν , τὸν δὲ ἀρχιερέα ἐν τῇ ὑακινθίνῃ καὶ διαχρύσῳ στολῇ : the other from Plato, Theagcs, § 3, p.’ 262, Θεαγὴς ὄνομα τούτῳ , ὦ Σώκρατες . Καλόν γε , ὦ Δημόδοκε , τῷ υἱεῖ τὸ ὄνομα ἔθηκες καὶ <strong> ἱεροπρεπές</strong> ), <strong> not slanderers</strong> (see reff. 1 Tim. and note), <strong> nor yet enslaved</strong> (so προσέχοντας , 1Ti 3:8 ) <strong> to much wine</strong> (this vice may be included in the character given of the Cretans above, ch. Tit 1:12 ), <strong> teachers of that which is good, that they school</strong> (see on σωφρονισμός , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:7">2 Timothy 1:7</span> .

<p>The occurrence of ἵνα here with a pres. indic. in the best MSS. is remarkable especially as the only other instances of this construction in St. Paul, 1Co 4:6 and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:17">Galatians 4:17</span> (see notes there), may be accounted for on the hypothesis of an unusual (provincial) formation of the subjunctive, being both verbs in - όω . If this reading is to stand, it would shew that that hypothesis is unnecessary, and that St. Paul did really write the indic pres. after ἵνα : see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:20">1 John 5:20</span> . Cf. Winer, edn. 6, § 41 b. 1. c. If he did thus write it, it may be questioned whether he intended to convey any sense very distinct from the pres. subj.: perhaps more immediate and assumed sequence may be indicated: but it is hardly possible to join logically in the mind a causal particle with a pres. indic.) <strong> the young women to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children, discreet</strong> (this term certainly applies better to women than <em> self-restrained</em> : there is in this latter, in their case, an implication of <em> effort</em> , which destroys the spontaneity, and brushes off, so to speak, the bloom of this best of female graces. See, however, note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:9">1 Timothy 2:9</span> . The word is one of our greatest difficulties), <strong> chaste, workers at home</strong> (the word is not found elsewhere, and has perhaps on that account been changed to the more usual one οἰκουρούς . It is hardly possible that for so common a word οἰκουργούς should have been substituted. If the rec. is retained, ‘keepers at home’ will be signified: so Dio Cass. lvi. p. 391 (Wetst.), πῶς οὐκ ἄριστον γυνὴ σώφρων , οἰκουρός , οἰκονόμος , παιδοτρόφος ; see Elsner’s note on the word, in which he shews that, as might be expected, the ideas of ‘keeping at home’ and ‘guarding the house’ are both included: so Chrys.: ἡ οἰκουρὸς γυνὴ καὶ σώφρων ἔσται · ἡ οἰκουρὸς καὶ οἰκονομικὴ · οὔτε περὶ τρυφήν , οὔτε περὶ ἐξόδους ἀκαίρους , οὔτε περὶ ἄλλων τῶν τοιούτων ἀσχοληθήσεται ), <strong> good</strong> (Thl. joins this with οἰκουρούς οἰκουρὸς ἀγαθή . So also Syr. But it seems better to preserve the series of single epithets till broken in the next clause by the construction. As a single epithet (reff.) it seems to provide, as Heydenr., that their keeping, or working, at home, should not degenerate into churlishness or niggardliness), <strong> in subjection to their own</strong> (inserted to bring out and impress the duties they owe to them so in Eph 5:22 ) <strong> husbands, that the word of God</strong> (the Gospel) <strong> be not ill-spoken of</strong> ( τὸ γὰρ προφάσει θεοσεβείας καταλιμπάνεν τοὺς ἄνδρας , βλασφημίαν ἔφερε τῷ κηρύγματι , Thdrt.).</p>
