<p><strong> 7</strong> .] <strong> in order that</strong> (this <strong> ἵνα</strong> , in the <em> form</em> of the sentence, <em> may</em> express the aim either of <strong> ἔσωσεν</strong> (Beng., De W., Huther, Ellic.) or of ἐξέχεεν : more naturally, I believe, of the latter (Wiesinger): and for these reasons, that <strong> ἔσωσεν</strong> seeming to have its full pregnant meaning as it stands, (1) does not require any further statement of aim and purpose: but <strong> ἐξέχεεν</strong> being a mere word of action, is more properly followed by a statement of a reason <em> why the pouring out took place</em> : and (2) that this statement of aim and purpose, if it applies to ἔσωσεν , has been already anticipated, if ἔσωσεν be understood as including what is generally known as σωτηρία .

<p>Theologically, this statement of purpose is exact: the effusion of the Spirit has for its purpose the conviction of sin and manifestation of the righteousness of Christ, out of which two spring justifying faith) <strong> having been justified</strong> (the aor. part. here (expressed in English by ‘having been’) is not contemporaneous with the aor. subj. below. Ordinarily this would be so: but the theological consideration of the place of justification in the Christian life, illustrated by such passages as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1">Romans 5:1</span> , δικαιωθέντες οὖν ἐκ πίστεως εἰρήνην ἔχωμεν πρὸς τ . θεόν , κ . τ . λ ., seems to determine here the aor. part. to be antecedent to γενήθωμεν ) <strong> by His</strong> ( <strong> ἐκείνου</strong> , referring to the more remote subject, must be used here not of our Lord, who has just been mentioned, but of the Father: and so, usually, χάρις θεοῦ (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:23">Acts 9:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:32">Acts 20:32</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:4">1 Corinthians 1:4</span> , &amp;c.) is the efficient cause of our justification in Christ) <strong> grace, we might be made</strong> (perhaps passive, see however on 1Th 1:5 ) <strong> heirs</strong> (see especially Gal 3:29 ) <strong> according to</strong> (in pursuance of, consistently with, so that the inheritance does not disappoint, but fully accomplishes and satisfies the hope; not ‘ <em> through</em> ’ (?) as Conyb., referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:24-25">Romans 8:24-25</span> , where, however, the thought is entirely different) <strong> the hope of eternal life</strong> (I cannot consent, although considerable scholars (e.g. De W., Ellic.) have maintained the view, to join the gen. <strong> ζωῆς</strong> with κληρονόμοι , in the presence of the expression, in this very Epistle, ἐπ ʼ ἐλπίδι ζωῆς αἰωνίου , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:2">Titus 1:2</span> . The objection brought against joining ἐλπίδα with ζωῆς here is that thus κληρονόμοι would stand alone. But it <em> does</em> thus stand alone in every place where St. Paul uses it in the spiritual sense; viz. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:14">Romans 4:14</span> ; Rom 8:17 bis ( θεοῦ is a wholly different genitive): <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:29">Galatians 3:29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:1">Galatians 4:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:7">Galatians 4:7</span> ; and therefore why not here? Chrys.’s two renderings, both of which Huther quotes for his view, will suit mine just as well: κατ ʼ ἐλπίδα , τουτέστι , καθὼς ἠλπίσαμεν , οὕτως ἀπολαύσομεν , ἢ ὅτι ἤδη καὶ κληρονόμοι ἐστέ . The former is the one to which I have inclined: the latter would mean, “we might be heirs, according to the hope” i.e. in proportion as we have the hope, realize our heirship “of eternal life”).</p>
