<p><strong> 8</strong> .] <strong> Faithful is the saying</strong> (reff.: viz. the saying which has just been uttered, ὅτε ἡ χρηστότης κ . τ . λ . This sentence alone, of those which have gone before, has the solemn and somewhat rhythmical character belonging for the most part to the “faithful sayings” of the apostolic church quoted <strong> in these Epistles</strong> ), <strong> and concerning these things</strong> (the things which have just been dwelt on; see above) <strong> I would have thee positively affirm</strong> (‘confirmare,’ Vulg.; ‘asseverare,’ Beza: cf. Polyb. xii. 12. 6, διοριζόμενος καὶ διαβεβαιούμενος περὶ τούτων . The <strong> διὰ</strong> implies persistence and thoroughness in the affirmation), <strong> in order that</strong> (not, ‘that,’ implying the <em> purport</em> of that which he is διαβεβαιοῦσθαι , nor is what follows the πιστὸς λόγος , as would appear in the E. V.: what follows is to be the result of thorough affirmation of Tit 3:4-7 ) <strong> they who have believed</strong> (have been brought to belief and endure in it: the present would perhaps express the sense, but the perfect is to be preferred, inasmuch as πιστεύειν is often used of the hour and act of commencing belief: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:2">Acts 19:2</span> ; Rom 13:11 ) <strong> God</strong> (trusted God, learned to credit what God says: not to be confounded with πιστ . εἰς , Joh 14:1 , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:8">1 Peter 1:8</span> ; 1Pe 1:21 or πιστ . ἐν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:15">Mark 1:15</span> (not used of God), or πιστ . ἐπί , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:5">Romans 4:5</span> . There appears no reason for supposing with De W. that these words describe merely the Gentile Christians) <strong> may take care to</strong> ( <strong> φροντίζειν</strong> with an inf. is not the ordinary construction: it commonly has ὅπως , ἵνα , ὡς , εἰ , μή , or a relative clause. We have an instance in Plut. Fab. Max. c. 12, τὰ πραττόμενα γινώσκειν ἐφρόντιζεν . See Palm and Rost, sub voce) <strong> practise</strong> (a workman presides over, is master and conductor of, his work: and thus the transition in προΐστασθαι from presiding over to conducting and practising a business was very easy. Thus we have, tracing the progress of this transition, οὗτοι μάλιστα προειστήκεισαν τῆς μεταβολῆς , Thuc. viii. 75: πῶς οὐ φανερὸν ὅτι προστάντες τοῦ πράγματος τὰ γνωσθένθ ʼ ὑφ ʼ ὑμῶν ἀποστερῆσαί με ζητοῦσιν , Demosth. 869, 2: Ἀσπασία οὐ κοσμίου προεστῶσα ἐργασίας , Plut. Pericl. 24: τέχνης προΐστασθαι , ὣ τοῖσιν ἐχθροῖς … προὐστήτην φόνου , Soph. El. 968: χειρὶ βιαίᾳ προστῆναι τοῦ πανουργήματος , Synes. Ep. 67, p. 211 d.
