 1 .] It is doubtful whether  κλητός is not spurious: see var. readd.
	The words  διὰ θελ  .   θεοῦ point probably to the depreciation of Paul’s apostolic authority at Corinth. In Gal 1:1 we have this much more strongly asserted. But they have a reference to Paul himself also: “ratio auctoritatis ad ecclesias: humilis et prompti animi, penes ipsum Paulum.” Bengel. Chrys., referring it to κλητός , says, ἐπειδὴ αὐτῷ ἔδοξεν , ἐκλήθημεν , οὐκ ἐπειδὴ ἄξιοι ἦμεν . Hom. i. p. 4.
	 Σωσθένης can hardly be assumed to be identical with the ruler of the synagogue in Acts 18:17 ; see note there. He must have been some Christian well known to the church at Corinth. Thus Paul associates with himself Silvanus and Timotheus in the Epistles to the Thessalonians; and Timotheus in 2 Cor. Chrysostom attributes it to modesty: μετριάζει , συντάττων ἑαυτῷ τὸν ἐλάττονα πολλῷ . Some have supposed Sosthenes to be the  writer of the Epistle, see Romans 16:22 . Possibly he may have been one τῶν Χλόης ( 1Co 1:11 ) by whom the intelligence had been received, and the Apostle may have associated him with himself as approving the appeal to apostolic authority. Perhaps some slight may have been put upon him by the parties at Corinth, and for that reason Paul puts him forward.
