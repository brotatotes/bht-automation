 1.] The words<b> through the will of God</b> point probably to the depreciation of Paul’s apostolic authority at Corinth. In Gal. i. 1 we have this much more strongly asserted. But they have a reference to Paul himself also: “as they point in their aspect of authority, towards the churches, so, in their aspect of a humble and earnest mind, they come from Paul himself,” says Bengel. Chrysostom, referring the words to called, says, “Because it was His will we were called, not because we were worthy.”<b> Sosthenes</b> can hardly be assumed to be identical with the ruler of the synagogue in Acts xviii. 17: see note there. He must have been some Christian well known to the church at Corinth. Thus Paul associates with himself Silvanus and Timotheus in the Epistles to the Thessalonians: and Timotheus in 2 Cor. Chrysostom attributes it to modesty, that he associates with himself one by far his inferior. Some have supposed Sosthenes to be the<i> writer</i> (i. e. the amanuensis) of the Epistle, see Rom. xvi. 22. Possibly he may have been one of the household of Chloe (ver. 11) through whom the intelligence had been received, and the Apostle may have associated him with himself as approving the appeal to apostolic authority. Perhaps some slight may have been put upon him by the parties at Corinth, and for that reason St. Paul puts him forward. our brother as 2 Cor. i. 1, of Timothy.
