<b> 12.</b>] Respecting the matter of fact to which the verse alludes, I have given references in the Introduction,§ii. 10, to the principal theories of the German critics, and will only here re-state the conclusions which I have there endeavored to substantiate: (1) that these designations are<i> not used</i> as pointing to<i> actual parties formed and subsisting</i> among the Corinthians, but (2)<i> as representing the</i> SPIRIT WITH WHICH THEY CONTENDED<i> against one another</i>, being the sayings of<i> individuals</i>, and<i> not of parties</i>: as if it were said, ‘You are all in the habit of alleging against one another, some your special attachment to Paul, some to Apollos, some to Cephas, others to no mere human teacher, but barely to Christ, to the exclusion of us his Apostles.’ (3) That these sayings, while they are not to be made the basis of any hypothesis respecting<i> definite parties</i> at Corinth, do nevertheless<i> hint at matters of fact</i>, and are<i> not merely</i> by way of example: and (4) that this view of. the verse, which was taken by Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, and Calvin, is<i> borne out</i>, and indeed<i> necessitated</i>, by ch. iv. 6 (see there).
