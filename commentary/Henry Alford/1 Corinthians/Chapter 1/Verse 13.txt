 13. ] Some (Lachmann has so printed it) take μεμέρισται ὁ χρ . as an assertion, ‘  Christ has been divided (by you),’ or, as Chrys. mentions, διενείματο πρὸς ἀνθρώπους κ . ἐμερίσατο τὴν ἐκκλησίαν . But it is far better to take it, as commonly, interrogatively:  Is Christ (the  Person of Christ, as the centre and bond of Christian unity not, the  Gospel of Christ (Grot., al.), nor the  Church of Christ (Estius, Olsh.): nor the  power of Christ (Theodoret), i.e. his right over all)  divided (not in the primary sense (Meyer, Exodus 1:0 ), against Himself, as Mark 3:24-25 , where we have ἐφ ʼ ἑαυτήν , but ‘  into various parts , one under one leader, another under another, which in fact would amount, after all, to a division against Himself)? The question applies to  all addressed , not to the ἐγὼ χριστοῦ only, as Meyer, Exodus 1:0 . In that case μεμέρισται ῥ χρ . would mean ‘Has Christ become the property of one part only?’ as indeed Dr. Burton renders it.
	Meyer urges against the interrogative rendering, that the questions begin immediately after, with μή . But we may fairly set against this argument, that the μή introduces a new  form of interrogation respecting a new individual, viz. Paul: and that it was natural, for solemnity’s sake, to express the other question differently. In μεμέρισται  ὁ χριστός , the Majesty of Christ’s Person is set against the unworthy insinuation conveyed by μεμέρισται , in μὴ Παῦλος ἐσταυρώθη ὑπὲρ ὑμ ., the meanness of the individual, Paul, is set against the triumph of divine Love implied in ἐστ . ὑπ . ὑμῶν . Two such contrasts could hardly but be differently expressed.
	 μὴ Π  .   ἐστ  . κ . τ . λ .]  Surely Paul was not crucified for you? By repudiating all possibility of  himself being the Head and ἐπώνυμος of their church, he does so  à fortiori for Cephas and Apollos: for  he founded the Church at Corinth. On εἰς τὸ ὄν . ἐβαπτ . see Matthew 28:19 .
