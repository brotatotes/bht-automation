<b> 17</b>.] This verse forms the transition to the description of his preaching among them. His mission was<i> not to baptize</i>:—a trace already, of the separation of the offices of baptizing and preaching.<br><br> Chrysostom says: “To baptize a man under instruction, and already believing, is in the power of any one whatever: for the free will of the candidate does all, and the grace of God: but when the instruction of unbelievers is to be carried on, much toil is needed, and much skill: and in those days personal danger was besides incurred.” It is evident that this is said in no<i> derogation</i> of Baptism, for he did on occasion baptize,—and it would be impossible that he should speak lightly of the ordinance to which he appeals (Rom. vi. 3) as the seal of our union with Christ.<br><br><b> not in wisdom of speech]</b> It seems evident from this apology, and other hints in the two Epistles, e.g. 2 Cor. x. 10, that the<i> plainness and simplicity of Paul’s speech</i> had been one cause among the Corinthians of alienation from him. Perhaps, as hinted above, the eloquence of Apollos was extolled to St. Paul's disadvantage.<br><br><b> in</b> (as the element in which: better than ‘<i>with</i>)<b> wisdom of speech</b> (i. e. the speculations of philosophy: that these are meant, and not mere eloquence or rhetorical form, appears by what follows, which treats of the<i> subject,</i> and not merely of the<i> manner</i> of the preaching),<b> lest the Cross of Christ</b> (the great central point of bis preaching; exhibiting man’s guilt and God’s love in their highest degrees and closest connexion)<b> should be made of none effect</b>.<br><br> This would come to pass rather by<i> philosophical</i><i> speculations</i> than by<i> eloquence</i>.
