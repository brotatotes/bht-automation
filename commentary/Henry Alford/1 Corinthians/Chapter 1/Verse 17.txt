His mission was  not to baptize : a trace already, of the separation of the offices of baptizing and preaching. ἄνθρωπον μὲν γὰρ κατηχούμενον λαβόντας καὶ πεπεισμένον βαπτίσαι , παντὸς οὑτινοσοῦν ἐστιν · ἡ γὰρ προαίρεσις τοῦ προσιόντος λοιπὸν ἐργάζεται τὸ πᾶν , καὶ ἡ τοῦ θεοῦ χάρις · ὅταν δὲ ἀπίστους δέῃ κατηχῆσαι , πολλοῦ δεῖ πόνου , πολλῆς τῆς σοφίας · τότε δὲ καὶ τὸ κινδυνεύειν προσῆν . Chrys. Hom. iii. p. 18. It is evident that this is said in no  derogation of Baptism, for he did on occasion baptize, and it would be impossible that he should speak lightly of the ordinance to which he appeals ( Rom 6:3 ) as the seal of our union with Christ.
	 οὐκ ἐν σοφίᾳ λόγου ] It seems evident from this apology, and other hints in the two Epistles, e.g. 2 Corinthians 10:10 , that the  plainness and simplicity of Paul’s speech had been  one cause among the Corinthians of alienation from him. Perhaps, as hinted above, the eloquence of Apollos was extolled to Paul’s disadvantage.

This would come to pass rather by  philosophical speculations than by  eloquence .
