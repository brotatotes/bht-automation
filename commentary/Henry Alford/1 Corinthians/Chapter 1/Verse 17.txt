<p><strong> 17</strong> .] This verse forms the transition to the description of his preaching among them. His mission was <em> not to baptize</em> : a trace already, of the separation of the offices of baptizing and preaching. ἄνθρωπον μὲν γὰρ κατηχούμενον λαβόντας καὶ πεπεισμένον βαπτίσαι , παντὸς οὑτινοσοῦν ἐστιν · ἡ γὰρ προαίρεσις τοῦ προσιόντος λοιπὸν ἐργάζεται τὸ πᾶν , καὶ ἡ τοῦ θεοῦ χάρις · ὅταν δὲ ἀπίστους δέῃ κατηχῆσαι , πολλοῦ δεῖ πόνου , πολλῆς τῆς σοφίας · τότε δὲ καὶ τὸ κινδυνεύειν προσῆν . Chrys. Hom. iii. p. 18. It is evident that this is said in no <em> derogation</em> of Baptism, for he did on occasion baptize, and it would be impossible that he should speak lightly of the ordinance to which he appeals ( Rom 6:3 ) as the seal of our union with Christ.

<p><strong> οὐκ ἐν σοφίᾳ λόγου</strong> ] It seems evident from this apology, and other hints in the two Epistles, e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span> , that the <em> plainness and simplicity of Paul’s speech</em> had been <em> one cause</em> among the Corinthians of alienation from him. Perhaps, as hinted above, the eloquence of Apollos was extolled to Paul’s disadvantage.

<p><strong> ἐν σοφ</strong> .] <strong> in</strong> (as the element in which: better than ‘ <em> with</em> ’) <strong> wisdom of speech</strong> (i.e. the speculations of philosophy: that these are meant, and not mere eloquence or rhetorical form, appears by what follows, which treats of the <em> subject</em> , and not merely of the <em> manner</em> of the preaching) <strong> in order that the Cross of Christ</strong> (the great central point of his preaching; exhibiting man’s guilt and God’s love in their highest degrees and closest connexion) <strong> might not be deprived of its effect</strong> . This would come to pass rather by <em> philosophical speculations</em> than by <em> eloquence</em> .</p>
