 2.] On the words<b> the church of God which is at Corinth</b>, Calvin remarks; “It may perhaps seem strange that he should call by the name of the Church of God that assembly of men among whom so many corruptions were rife, that Satan seemed to reign there rather than God. And it is certain that he had no design of flattering the Corinthians; for he speaks by the Spirit of God, who does not use flattery. Yet, among so many defilements, what kind of an appearance of a Church can any longer be found? I answer, that, however many vices had crept in, however many corruptions of doctrine and of morals, there were yet some signs of a true Church. This passage is carefully to be noted, to keep us from requiring in this world a Church without any spot or wrinkle; or refusing this title to any assembly in which all is not according to our wish. For this is a dangerous temptation, to think that there is no Church, unless where there appears perfect purity. For whoever persuades himself of this, will at length find it necessary to separate off from all other men, and give himself out for the only holy man in the world, or else to found a peculiar sect with a few hypocrites for his followers. If we ask what cause had St. Paul to recognize the Church at Corinth? the answer is, because he saw among them the doctrine of the Gospel, Baptism, the Supper of the Lord; symbols by which the Church ought to be discerned.” On the words of God, Chrysostom remarks, “not of this man and of that man, but of God,” taking the expression as addressed to the Corinthians to remind them of their position as a congregation belonging to GOD, and<i> not to any head of a party.</i> Perhaps this is too refined, the words “<i>the Church of God</i>” being so usual with St. Paul,—see references.
