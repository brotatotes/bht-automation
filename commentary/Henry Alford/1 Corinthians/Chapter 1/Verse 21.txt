<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] <strong> For</strong> (explanation of ἐμώρανεν ) <strong> when</strong> (not <em> temporal</em> , but illative = ‘since,’ ‘seeing that,’ so Plato, Gorg. p. 454, ἐπειδὴ τοίνυν οὐ μόνη ἀπεργάζεται τοῦτο τὸ ἔργον , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄλλαι …; see Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 259) <strong> in the wisdom of God</strong> ( <em> as part of the wise arrangement of God</em> . De W., Meyer, al., render it ‘ <em> by the revelation of the wisdom of God</em> ,’ which was made to the Gentiles, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:0">Romans 1:0</span> , by creation, and to the Jews by the law, thus connecting ἐν with ἔγνω , and making τῇ σοφ . τ . θ . the medium of knowledge: Chrys. takes it for the wisdom manifest in His <em> works only</em> : τί ἐστιν , ἐν τ . σοφ . τ . θ .; τῇ διὰ τῶν ἔργων φαινομένῃ , δι ʼ ὧν ἠθέλησε γνωρισθῆναι . But I very much doubt the legitimacy of this absolute objective use of σοφία , as = those things by which the σοφία is manifested. I cannot see with Olsh. why the interpretation given above is ‘ <em> ganz unpaulinisch</em> :’ it is merely an expansion of ἐμώρανεν , and agrees much better with Paul’s use of the words ἡ σοφία τ . θεοῦ in reff. and in ch. 1Co 2:7 ) <strong> the world</strong> (Jew and Gentile, see next verse) <strong> by its wisdom</strong> (as a means of attaining knowledge: or, but I prefer the other, “through the wisdom (of God) which I have just mentioned:” so Stanley) <strong> knew not</strong> (could not find out) <strong> God, God saw fit by the foolishness of preaching</strong> (lit., ‘of the proclamation:’ gen. of apposition, by that preaching which is reputed folly by the world) <strong> to save believers</strong> . Rom 1:16 throws light on this last expression as connected with δύναμις θεοῦ in our <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18">1 Corinthians 1:18</span> , and with what follows here. There the two are joined: δύναμις γὰρ θεοῦ ἐστιν ( τὸ εὐαγ . τ . χρ .) εἰς σωτηρίαν παντὶ τῷ πιστεύοντι , Ἰουδαίῳ τε πρῶτον κ . Ελληνι .</p>
