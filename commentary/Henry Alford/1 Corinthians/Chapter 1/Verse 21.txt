 21. ]  For (explanation of ἐμώρανεν )  when (not  temporal , but illative = ‘since,’ ‘seeing that,’ so Plato, Gorg. p. 454, ἐπειδὴ τοίνυν οὐ μόνη ἀπεργάζεται τοῦτο τὸ ἔργον , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄλλαι …; see Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 259)  in the wisdom of God (  as part of the wise arrangement of God . De W., Meyer, al., render it ‘  by the revelation of the wisdom of God ,’ which was made to the Gentiles, as Romans 1:0 , by creation, and to the Jews by the law, thus connecting ἐν with ἔγνω , and making τῇ σοφ . τ . θ . the medium of knowledge: Chrys. takes it for the wisdom manifest in His  works only : τί ἐστιν , ἐν τ . σοφ . τ . θ .; τῇ διὰ τῶν ἔργων φαινομένῃ , δι ʼ ὧν ἠθέλησε γνωρισθῆναι . But I very much doubt the legitimacy of this absolute objective use of σοφία , as = those things by which the σοφία is manifested. I cannot see with Olsh. why the interpretation given above is ‘  ganz unpaulinisch :’ it is merely an expansion of ἐμώρανεν , and agrees much better with Paul’s use of the words ἡ σοφία τ . θεοῦ in reff. and in ch. 1Co 2:7 )  the world (Jew and Gentile, see next verse)  by its wisdom (as a means of attaining knowledge: or, but I prefer the other, “through the wisdom (of God) which I have just mentioned:” so Stanley)  knew not (could not find out)  God, God saw fit by the foolishness of preaching (lit., ‘of the proclamation:’ gen. of apposition, by that preaching which is reputed folly by the world)  to save believers . Rom 1:16 throws light on this last expression as connected with δύναμις θεοῦ in our 1 Corinthians 1:18 , and with what follows here. There the two are joined: δύναμις γὰρ θεοῦ ἐστιν ( τὸ εὐαγ . τ . χρ .) εἰς σωτηρίαν παντὶ τῷ πιστεύοντι , Ἰουδαίῳ τε πρῶτον κ . Ελληνι .
