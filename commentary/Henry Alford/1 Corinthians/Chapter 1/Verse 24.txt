 24. ] This verse plainly is a continuation of the opposition to 1Co 1:22 before begun, but itself springs by way of opposition out of Ἰουδ . μὲν σκάνδ ., ἔθν . δὲ μωρίαν , and carries the thought back to 1 Corinthians 1:18 ; 1 Corinthians 1:21 .
	 αὐτοῖς δὲ τ  .   κλητοῖς ] Not, ‘  but to the elect themselves ,’ which would be either αὐτοῖς δὲ κλητοῖς , or τοῖς δὲ κλητοῖς αὐτοῖς ; but  to these, viz. the elect , the αὐτοῖς serving to identify them with the σωζόμενοι of 1 Corinthians 1:18 . There it was  ἡμῖν , here αὐτοῖς , because by the mention of  preaching joined with ἡμεῖς , he has now separated off the  hearers .
	 δύναμιν  , as fulfilling the requirement of the seekers after a  sign :  σοφίαν , of those who sought  wisdom . The repetition of χριστόν gives solemnity, at the same time that it concentrates the δύναμις and σοφία in the Person of Christ; q. d. ‘  Christ even in His humiliation unto death, the power of God and wisdom of God .’
	The use of δύναμις and σοφία here as applied to Him who was the greatest example of both, would not justify the absolute use of σοφία in this sense in 1 Corinthians 1:21 .
