This is far better than to supply (as E. V., and most Commentators) ἐκλήθησαν after εὐγενεῖς ; and thus Vulg., Chrys., Beza, Meyer, De Wette, al. Olsh. observes: “The ancient Christians were for the most part slaves and men of low station; the whole history of the expansion of the church is in reality a progressive victory of the ignorant over the learned, the lowly over the lofty, until the emperor himself laid down his crown before the cross of Christ.”</p>
