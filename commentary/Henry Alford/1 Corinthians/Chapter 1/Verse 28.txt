the base things</b>, matter of<i> fact</i>—<b>the low-born</b>:<b> the things which are despised</b>, matter of<i> estimation</i>. Omitting the “<i>and</i>” (see the A.V.), which is certainly the true reading,<b> the things which are not</b><i> may</i> belong to all four, the foolish, the weak, the base, and the despised,—but more probably it has reference only to the last two. The expression<b> are not,</b> means,<b> as good as have no existence</b>. Olshausen refines on the expression too much, when he explains it of those who have lost their old carnal life, and have not yet acquired their new spiritual one: it more probably means, things (persons) of absolutely<i> no account</i> in the world, unassignable among men, which the<i> base</i> and<i> despised</i> are—Meyer remarks, that the threefold repetition of<i> God chose</i>, with the three “contrasts to<i> wise, mighty</i>, and<i> noble</i>, announces the fact with a triumphant emphasis.<br><br><b> bring to nought]</b>'reduce to the state of<i> things that are not</i>.’ All the<b> things that are</b>, all the<i> realities</i>, of the world, are of absolutely<i> no account</i>, unassignable, in God’s spiritual kingdom. Literally,<b> That all flesh may have no ground of boasting before God</b>; i.e. may be deprived of all ground of boasting.
