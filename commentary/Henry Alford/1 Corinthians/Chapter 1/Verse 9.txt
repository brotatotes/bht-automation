The mention of<i> fellowship</i> may perhaps have been intended to pre-pare the way, as was before done in ver. 2, for the reproof which is coming.—Chry-sostom remarks respecting verses 1–9, “See how he is always riveting them close with the name of Christ. He makes mention, not of any apostle or teacher, but evermore of Him who is their desire, as if he were endeavoring to bring back men after a debauch to their sound state. For nowhere in any other epistle is the name of Christ so often repeated. Here in a few verses it occurs many times, and is in fact the connecting link of almost all the introductory part of the Epistle.”
