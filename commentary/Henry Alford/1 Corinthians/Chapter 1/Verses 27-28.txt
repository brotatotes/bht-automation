 27, 28 .]  τὰ μωρά , neut. for more generalization, but = τοὺς μωρούς . This is shewn by τοὺς σοφούς following, in that case it being necessary to use the masculine.
	 τοῦ κόσμ .,  of (belonging to)  the world : not  in the eyes of the world , as Theodoret, Luth., Grot., Est., al., which would not fit τὰ ἀγενῆ τ . κόσμ ., nor the  sense : for they were not only  seemingly but  really foolish, when God chose them.
	 καταισχύνῃ , by shewing to the wise and the strong, the foolish and the weak entering the kingdom of heaven before them.
	 τὰ ἀγενῆ , matter of  fact  the low-born :
	 τὰ ἐξουθενημένα , matter of  estimation ,  the despised .
	Without the καί , which is certainly the true reading, τὰ μὴ ὄντα  may belong to all four, the μωρά , ἀσθενῆ , ἀγενῆ , and ἐξουθεν ., but more probably it has reference only to the last two. Nothing (as e.g. μέγα τι ) must be supplied after μὴ ὄντα : it means  as good as having no existence : μή being subjective, and implying that the non-existence is not  absolute but  estimative . Were it absolute  matter of fact , it would be expressed by τὰ οὐκ ὄντα , as in 1 Peter 2:10 , οἱ οὐκ ἠλεημένοι , νῦν δὲ ἐλεηθέντες . See Hartung, Partikellehre, ii. p. 131; Winer, edn. 6, § 55. 5; and Philippians 3:3 ; Ephesians 5:4 . Olshausen refines on the expression too much, when he explains it of those who have lost their old carnal life and have not yet acquired their new spiritual one: it more probably means, things (persons) of absolutely  no account in the world, unassignable among men, which the ἀγενῆ and ἐξουθενημένα are.
	Meyer remarks that the threefold repetition of ἐξελ . ὁ θεός , with the three contrasts to σοφοί , δυνατοί , and εὐγενεῖς , announces the fact with a triumphant emphasis.
	 καταργ .] ‘reduce to the state of οὐκ ὄντα .’ All the ὄντα , the  realities , of the world, are of absolutely  no account , unassignable, in God’s spiritual kingdom.
