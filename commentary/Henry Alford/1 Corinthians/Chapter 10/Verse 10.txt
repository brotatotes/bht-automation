 10.]<b> Murmur</b> has been by some understood of murmuring<i> against their teachers</i>, as the Israelites against Moses and Aaron, Num. xiv. 2; xvi. 41. But not to mention that this was, in fact,<i> murmuring against God</i>, such a reference would require something more specific than the mere word<i> murmur</i>. The warning is substantially the same as the last, but regards more the spirit, and its index, the tongue. As Theophylact says, “they did not bear trials manfully, but murmured, saying, When will the promised good things come, and how long will troubles last?”—The destruction referred to must be that related Num. xvi. 41 ff., when the pestilence (which though it is not so specified<i> there</i>, was administered on another occasion by a destroying angel, 2 Sam. xxiv. 16, 17, see also Exod. xii. 23) took off 14, 700 of the people. The punishment of the unbelieving congregation in Num. xiv., to which this is commonly referred, does not seem to answer to the expression “<i>were destroyed by the destroyer</i>,” nor to the term “<i>some of them</i>,” seeing that all except Joshua and Caleb were involved in it.
