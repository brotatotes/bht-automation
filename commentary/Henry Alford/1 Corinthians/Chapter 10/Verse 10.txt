 10. ]  γογγύζετε has been by Estius, Grot., al., and De Wette, understood of murmuring  against their teachers , as the Israelites against Moses and Aaron, Numbers 14:2 ; Numbers 16:41 . But not to mention that this was in fact  murmuring against God , such a reference would require something more specific than the mere word γογγύζετε . The warning is substantially the same as the last, but regards more the spirit, and its index the tongue. Theophyl.: αἰνίττεται δὲ αὐτοὺς καὶ διὰ τούτου , ὅτι ἐν τοῖς πειρασμοῖς οὐκ ἔφερον γενναίως , ἀλλ ʼ ἐγόγγυζον λέγοντες Πότε ἥξει τὰ ἀγαθά , καὶ ἕως πότε αἱ κακώσεις ; similarly Chrys.
	The destruction referred to must be that related Numbers 16:41 ff. when the pestilence (which though it is not so specified  there , was administered on another occasion by a destroying angel, 2 Samuel 24:16-17 , see also Exo 12:23 ) took off 14,700 of the people. The punishment of the unbelieving congregation in Numbers 14:0 , to which this is commonly referred, does not seem to answer to the expression ἀπώλοντο ὑπὸ τ . ὀλοθρευτοῦ , nor to the τινες , seeing that all except Joshua and Caleb were involved in it.
