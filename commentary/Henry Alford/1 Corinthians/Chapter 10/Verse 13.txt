<b> 13.]</b> There are two ways of understanding the former part of this verse. Chrysostom and others take it as a<i> continuation and urging of the warning of the verse preceding</i>, by the consideration that no temptation had yet befallen them but such as was<i> within the power of human endurance:</i> but<i> a greater temptation is imminent</i>:—while Calvin and others regard it as a<i> consolation</i>, tending to shew them that<i> taking heed not to fall</i>, is within the limits of their power, seeing that their temptation to sin was nothing extraordinary or unheard of, but only ‘<i>according to man</i>:’ and they might trust to God’s loving care, that no temptation should ever befall them which should surpass their power to resist. This latter seems to me beyond doubt the correct view. For, besides the requirements of the construction, &c., the other view restricts the sense of<b> temptation</b> to<i> persecution</i>, which it here does not mean, but<i> solicitation to sin</i>, in accordance with the whole context.<br><br><b> hath taken you</b>, not ‘took you,’ shews that the temptation was<i> still soliciting</i> them.<br><br><b> faithful]</b> He has<i> entered into a covenant</i> with you by<i> calling you:</i> if He suffered temptation beyond your power to overcome you, He would be violating that covenant. Compare 1 Thess. v. 24, “<i>Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it.</i>”<br><br><b> will..... make also the way to escape]</b> Then God<i> makes</i> the temptation too: arranges it in His Providence, and in His mercy will ever set open a door for escape.<br><br><b> the (way to) escape,</b> i.e.<i> which belongs to the particular temptation</i>.<br><br><b> in order that you may be able to bear (it)</b>: observe, not, ‘will<i> remove</i> the temptation?’ but, ‘will make an escape<i> simultaneously with the temptation</i>, to encourage you to<i> bear up against it</i>’
