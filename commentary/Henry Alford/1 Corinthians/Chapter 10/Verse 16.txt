 16.] The analogy of the<i> Lord’s Supper,</i> which, in both its parts, is a<i> participation</i> in Christ. The stress throughout to ver. 20 is on<b> participation</b> and<b> partakers</b>. The<b> cup of blessing</b> is explained immediately by<b> which we bless,—over which we speak</b> a<b> blessing</b>, and is the Christian form of the Jewish cup in the Passover, over which thanks were offered after the feast,—in blessing of which cup, our Lord instituted this part of the ordinance: see note on the history in Matt. xxvii The explanation, the exp which brings a blessing, is wrong, as being against this analogy.<br><br><b> which we bless]</b> i.e. consecrate with a prayer of thanksgiving. Observe, the first person plural is the<i> same throughout</i>: the blessing of the cup, and the breaking of the bread, the acts of consecration, were not the acts of the minister, as by any authority peculiar to himself, but only as the representative of the whole Christian congregation The figment of sacerdotal consecration of the elements by transmitted power, is as alien from the apostolic writings as it is from the spirit of the Gospel.<br><br><b> the participation</b> (i. e. that whereby the act of participation takes place)<b> of the Blood.</b><b> of Christ?</b>—The strong literal sense must here be held fast, as constituting the very kernel of the Apostle’s argument. The wine<i> is the Blood,</i> the bread<i> is the Body</i>, of Christ. (<i>In what sense</i> the Blood and the Body, does not belong to the present argument.)<i> We</i> receive unto us, make by assimilation parts of ourselves, that wine, that bread: we<i> become</i> therefore, by participation of that Bread,<i> one Bread</i>, i. e ONE BODY: hence the close and literal participation in and with Christ. If we are to understand this word<b> is</b> to mean,<i> represents or symbolizes</i>, the argument is made void. On the other hand it is painful to allude to, though necessary to reprobate the caricature of this real union with Christ, which is found in the gross materialism of transubstantiation. See further on ch. xi. 26, 27.<br><br><b> which we break]</b> probably already the<i> breaking</i> of the bread. in the communion was part of the act of consecration, and done after the example of our Lord in its institution. See ch. xi. 24; Acts ii. 42; xx. 7, 11. For the rest, see above.
