 17.]<b> Because we, the</b> (assembled)<b> many</b> (so literally), are one<b> bread</b> (by the assimilation of that one bread partaken: not ‘one loaf’)<b> one Body</b> (by the participation of the Body of Christ, of which that bread is the vehicle);<b> for the whole of us partake of that one bread</b>. By partaking of that bread, we become, not figuratively but literally,<i> one bread</i>: it passes into the substance of our bodies, and there is in every one who partakes, a portion of himself which<i> is that bread</i>. The<i> bread</i> which was<i> before</i>,<i> is now ourselves</i>. But that loaf, broken and blessed, is the medium of participation of the Body of Christ; we then, being that one bread, are<i> one Body</i>;<i> for</i> we all partake of that one bread. The argument is a very simple and direct one;—the bread is the Body of Christ;—we partake of the bread: therefore we partake of the Body of Christ. Of these propositions, the<i> conclusion</i> is implied in the form of a question in ver. 16: the minor stated in the latter clause of ver. 17; its connexion with the<i> major</i> producing the conclusion given in the former clause, “<i>This is my body</i>.” The<i> major</i> itself, “<i>because we being many are one bread, one body,</i>” is suppressed, as being a maxim familiar to Christians.
