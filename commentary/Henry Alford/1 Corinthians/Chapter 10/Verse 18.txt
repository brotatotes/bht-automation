<b> 18.]</b> Another example of<b> Participation</b> from the<i> Jewish feasts after sacrifice.</i><br><br><b> Israel after the flesh,</b> the actual<b> material Israel</b>, as distinguished from “<i>Israel after the Spirit,</i>” see Rom. ii. 29; Gal. iv. 29; and “<i>the Israel of God</i>,” Gal. vi. 16.<br><br><b> they which eat the sacrifices,</b> viz. those parts of the sacrifices which were not offered; see on ch. viii. 1—The parts to be offered are specified, Levit. iii. 3; the practice of eating the remainder of the meat sanctioned and regulated, ib. vii. 15–18.<br><br><b> partakers with the altar</b> (in a strict and peculiar sense,—the<i> altar</i> having<i> part</i> of the animal, the<i> partaker</i><i> another part</i>; and by the fact of the religious<i> consecration</i> of the offered part, this connexion becomes a<i> religious connexion</i>. The question has been raised, and with reason, why the Apostle did not say partakers with<i> God</i>? Meyer answers,—because the Jew was<i> already in covenant with God</i>, and the Apostle wished to express a<i> closer connexion</i>, brought about by the sacrifice in question:—De Wette,—because he was unwilling to ascribe so much to the mere act of sacrifice, see Heb. x. 1 ff: and to this latter view I incline, because, as De Wette remarks, “God” would have<i> suited the analogy better than “altar,</i>” but St. Paul avoids it, and evidently is reluctant to use it. Still the inference lies open, to which our Saviour’s saying points, Matt. xxiii. 20, 21. The altar is GOD’ S altar).
