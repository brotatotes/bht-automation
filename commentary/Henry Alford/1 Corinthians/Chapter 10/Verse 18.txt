	 τ  .   Ἰσρ  .   κατὰ σάρκα ] (= τ . Ἰσρ .  τὸν κατὰ σάρκα : so we have τοῖς κυρίοις κατὰ σάρκα , Eph 6:5 ), the  actual material  Israel , as distinguished from ὁ Ἰσρ . κατὰ πνεῦμα , see Romans 2:29 ; Galatians 4:29 ; and ὁ Ἰσρ . τοῦ θεοῦ , Galatians 6:16 .
	 οἱ ἐσθ  .   τ  .   θυσ .] viz. those parts of the sacrifices which were not offered; see on ch. 1 Corinthians 8:1 .
	The parts to be offered are specified, Leviticus 3:3 ; the practice of eating the remainder of the meat sanctioned and regulated, ib. Leviticus 7:15-18 .
	 κοινωνοὶ τοῦ θυσ .]  partakers with the altar (in a strict and peculiar sense, the  altar having  part of the animal, the  partaker another part ; and by the fact of the  religious consecration of the offered part, this connexion becomes a  religious connexion . The question has been raised, and with reason, why the Apostle did not say κοινωνοὶ τοῦ  θεοῦ ? Meyer answers, because the Jew was  already in covenant with God , and the Apostle wished to express a  closer connexion , brought about by the sacrifice in question: De Wette, because he was unwilling to ascribe so much to the mere act of sacrifice, see Hebrews 10:1 ff.: and to this latter view I incline, because, as De W. remarks, θεοῦ would have  suited the analogy better than θυσιαστηρίου , but Paul avoids it, and evidently is reluctant to use it. But to carry this view further, and suppose with Rückert that he would not concede to the Ἰσρ . κατὰ σάρκα any κοινωνία θεοῦ , is (Meyer) contradicted by Romans 9:4-5 . Still the inference lies open, to which our Saviour’s saying points, Matthew 23:20-21 . The altar is GOD’S  altar ).
