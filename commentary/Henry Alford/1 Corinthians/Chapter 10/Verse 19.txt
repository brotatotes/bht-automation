	 ὅτι εἰδωλόθ  .   τί ἐστιν ]  that a thing sacrificed to an idol is any (real) thing (so sacrificed)? (i.e.  has any real existence as a thing sacrificed ? The accentuation τι ἔστιν ; would come nearer to the sense of ch. 1 Corinthians 8:4 , ὅτι οὐδὲν εἴδωλον ἐν κόσμῳ , ‘  that there is any (such thing as an)  offering to an idol ?’ and in a matter so ambiguous it is impossible to decide between the two)  or that an idol is any thing (  real ? e.g. that Jupiter  is Jupiter in the sense of a living power)? (  Not so : this ellipsis of the negative, taken up by ἀλλά , is found in classical Greek: e.g. Xen. Mem. i. 2. 2, πῶς οὖν αὐτὸς ὢν τοιοῦτος ἄλλους ἂν ἀσεβεῖς … ἐποίησεν ; ἀλλ ʼ ἔπαυσε μὲν τούτων πολλούς , ἀρετῆς ποιήσας ἐπιθυμεῖν , &c. See Hartung, Partikellehre, ii. 37.)  But (I say)  that the things which they (i.e. the Gentiles)  sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God ( δαιμ ., not ‘  false-gods ,’ nor in the sense in which it is used in the mouth of idolaters themselves, Acts 17:18 , and Xen. Mem. i. 1. 1,  deities (see Stanley’s note, in which this idea is ingeniously combined with the Christian sense given below), but, as always in LXX and N. T. when used by worshippers of the true God, ‘DEVILS,’ ‘  evil spirits .’ The words are from Deut. (ref.), see also Psalms 95:5 ( Bar 4:7 , θύσαντες δαιμονίοις κ . οὐ θεῷ ). Heathendom being under the dominion of Satan ( ὁ ἄρχων τοῦ κόσμου τούτου ), he and his angels are in fact the powers honoured and worshipped by the heathen, however little they may be aware of it):  but (the inference being suppressed ‘and ye therefore by partaking in their sacrifices would be partakers with devils: but’)  I would not have you become partakers with devils ( τῶν generic).
