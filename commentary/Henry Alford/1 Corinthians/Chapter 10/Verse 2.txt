<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] <strong> εἰς τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Μωυς</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐβαπτ</strong> ., <strong> received baptism</strong> (lit. baptized themselves: middle, not passive, see var. read.) <strong> to Moses</strong> ; entered by the act of such immersion into a solemn covenant with God, and became His church under the law as given by Moses, God’s servant, just as we Christians by our baptism are bound in a solemn covenant with God, and enter His Church under the Gospel as brought in by Christ, God’s eternal Son: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:5-6">Hebrews 3:5-6</span> . Others (Syr., Beza) explain it ‘ <em> per Mosen</em> ,’ or (Calv., al.) ‘ <em> auspiciis Mosis</em> ,’ which εἰς will not bear, not to mention that the formula βαπτίζω εἰς was already fixed in meaning, see reff.

<p><strong> ἐν τῇ ν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> καὶ ἐν τῇ θ</strong> .] The cloud and the sea were both <em> aqueous</em> ; and this point of comparison being obtained, serves the Apostle to indicate the outward symbols of their initiation into the church under the government of Moses as the servant of God, and to complete the analogy with our baptism. The allegory is obviously not to be pressed minutely: for neither did they <em> enter</em> the cloud, nor were they <em> wetted by the waters</em> of the sea; but they <em> passed under</em> both, as the baptized passes under the water, and it was said of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:31">Exodus 14:31</span> , “ <em> Then the people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord and his servant Moses</em> .” To understand, as Olsh., the <em> sea</em> and <em> cloud</em> , of <em> water</em> and the <em> Spirit</em> respectively, is certainly carrying the allegory too far: not to mention that thus the baptism by the Spirit would precede that by water.</p>
