 2. ]  εἰς τ  .

Others (Syr., Beza) explain it ‘  per Mosen ,’ or (Calv., al.) ‘  auspiciis Mosis ,’ which εἰς will not bear, not to mention that the formula βαπτίζω εἰς was already fixed in meaning, see reff.
	 ἐν τῇ ν  .   καὶ ἐν τῇ θ .] The cloud and the sea were both  aqueous ; and this point of comparison being obtained, serves the Apostle to indicate the outward symbols of their initiation into the church under the government of Moses as the servant of God, and to complete the analogy with our baptism. The allegory is obviously not to be pressed minutely: for neither did they  enter the cloud, nor were they  wetted by the waters of the sea; but they  passed under both, as the baptized passes under the water, and it was said of them, Exodus 14:31 , “  Then the people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord and his servant Moses .” To understand, as Olsh., the  sea and  cloud , of  water and the  Spirit respectively, is certainly carrying the allegory too far: not to mention that thus the baptism by the Spirit would precede that by water.
