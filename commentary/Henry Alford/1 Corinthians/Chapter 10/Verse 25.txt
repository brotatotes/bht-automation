 25. ] The key to understanding this and the following verse is, to remember that  συνείδησις is used in each case of the conscience of the  person spoken of , i.e. in the two first cases, that of the  reader , in the third, as explained by the Apostle, that of the  weak brother : see there.  Every thing which is being sold (offered for sale)  in the flesh-market (  μάκελλον is adopted from the Latin. It was also used by the Rabbis, in the form מקולין . See Stanley, and examples in Wetst.),  eat, making no enquiry (whether it is meat offered to idols or not),  on account of your conscience (to be joined with ἐσθίετε μηδ . ἀνακ ., not with ἀνακρίνοντες only, as is shewn by the parallel below, 1 Corinthians 10:28 , where the  reason given is joined to ἐσθίετε ). The meaning being, ‘  eat without enquiry, that your conscience may not be offended ,’ If you  made enquiry , and heard in reply, that the meat  had been offered to idols,  your conscience would be offended , and you would eat διὰ προσκόμματος to  yourselves . De Wette, al., understand τὴν συν .,  all through , of the  conscience of another , and apply to all the explanation of 1 Corinthians 10:29 . But as Meyer well observes, no reader could possibly refer τὴν συνείδ . to any one but himself,  no other person having been mentioned , until 1 Corinthians 10:28 , where ἐκεῖνον τὸν μηνύσαντα is introduced, and τὴν συνείδησιν is to be referred (but even then not without  special explanation given ) to the  new subject.
