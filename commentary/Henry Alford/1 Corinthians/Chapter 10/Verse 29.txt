 29 .] Explanation of the last διὰ τὴν συνείδησιν , as meaning  not your own , but  that of the informer . True to his interpretation (see above), De W. supposes τοῦ ἑτέρου not to refer to τὸν μηνύσαντα , but to ‘  your weak Christian brother ;’ but then how very harsh and clumsy are the various references to understood persons; and how simple, on the other interpretation, is the reference in each case of τὴν συν . to the subject of the clause.
	 ἵνα τί γάρ ]  For why is my freedom judged by a conscience not mine own? i.e. ‘  Why should I be to treated (hazard by my actions such treatment)  that the exercise of my Christian freedom, eating as I do and giving thanks, should become matter of condemnation to another, who conscientiously disapproves of it ?’  If (no copula)  I partake thankfully ([not, as E. V., ‘  by grace ’] dat. of the manner, cf. Soph. Antig. 616, σοφίᾳ γὰρ ἔκ του κλεινὸν ἔπος πέφανται , and Bernhardy, Syntax, p.101),  why am I to be spoken ill of for that for which I give thanks ? These words have been misunderstood. It has been generally supposed that the Apostle is  impressing a duty , not to  give occasion for the condemnation of their liberty by another’s conscience. But the ground on which he is  here arguing, is the unfitness, absurdity,  injustice to oneself and the cause of God, 1 Corinthians 10:31 , of  so acting as to be condemned for that in which a man not only allows himself, but for which he  gives thanks to God . The sentiment is the same as in Romans 14:16 , μὴ βλασφημείσθω ὑμῶν τὸ ἀλαθόν .
