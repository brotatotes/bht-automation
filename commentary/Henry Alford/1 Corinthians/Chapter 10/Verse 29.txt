<b> 29.</b>] Explanation of the last words,<b> for conscience sake</b>, as meaning<i> not your own, but that of the informer.</i><br><br><b> for why is my freedom judged by a conscience not mine own?</b>—i. e.<i> Why should I be so treated</i> (hazard by my actions such treatment)<i> that the exercise of my Christian freedom, eating as I do and giving thanks, should become matter of condemnation to another, who conscientiously disapproves of it?</i><b>—If I partake thankfully</b> (not, as A.V., “<i>by grace</i>”)<b> why am I to be evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?</b> These words have been misunderstood. It has been generally supposed that the Apostle is<i> impressing a duty, not to give occasion</i> for the condemnation of their liberty by another’s conscience. But the ground on which he is<i> here</i> arguing, is the unfitness, absurdity,<i> injustice to oneself</i> and the cause of God, ver. 31, of<i> so acting as to be condemned</i> for that in which a man not only allows himself, but for which he<i> gives thanks</i><i> to God</i>. The sentiment is the same as in Rom. xiv. 16, “<i>Let not your good be evil spoken of.</i>”
