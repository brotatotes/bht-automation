 3.] They had what answered to the one Christian sacrament, Baptism:—now the Apostle shews, that they were not without a symbolic correspondence to the: other, the Lord’s Supper. ‘The two elements in this Christian sacrament were anticipated in their ease by the manna and the miraculous stream from the rock: these elements, in their case, as well as ours, symbolizing THE BODY AND BLOOD OF CHRIST. The whole passage is a standing testimony, incidentally, but most<i> providentially</i>, given by the great Apostle to the<i> importance of the Christian Sacraments as necessary to membership of Christ</i>, and<i> not mere signs or remembrances;</i> and an inspired protest against those who, whether as individuals or sects, would lower their dignity, or deny their necessity.<br><br><b> spiritual meat]</b> The manna is thus called from its being no mere physical production, but miraculously given by God—the work of His Spirit. ‘Thus Isaac is called, Gal. iv. 29, “<i>he that was born after the Spirit</i>,” in opposition to Ishmael, “<i>him that was born after the flesh.</i>” Josephus calls the manna “<i>a divine and marvellous food,</i>” Antt. iii. 1. 6; and in Ps. lxxviii. 24 it is said, “<i>he had given them of the corn of heaven.</i>” We can scarcely avoid recognizing in these words a tacit reference to our Lord’s discourse, or at all events to the substance of it,—John vi. 31–58.
