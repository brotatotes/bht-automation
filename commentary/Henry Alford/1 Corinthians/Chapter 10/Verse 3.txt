 3. ] They had what answered to the one Christian sacrament, Baptism: now the Apostle shews that they were not without a symbolic correspondence to the other, the Lord’s Supper. The two elements in this Christian sacrament were anticipated in their case by the manna and the miraculous stream from the rock: these elements, in their case, as well as ours, symbolizing THE BODY AND BLOOD OF CHRIST. The whole passage is a standing testimony, incidentally, but  most providentially , given by the great Apostle to the  importance of the  Christian sacraments , as  necessary to membership of Christ , and  not mere signs or remembrances : and an inspired protest against those who, whether as individuals or sects, would lower their dignity, or deny their necessity.
	 βρῶμα πνευματικὸν κ.τ.λ. ] The manna is thus called, from its being no mere physical production, but miraculously given by God the work of His Spirit. Thus Isaac is called, Galatians 4:29 ,  ὁ κατὰ πνεῦμα γεννηθείς , in opposition to Ishmael, ὁ κατὰ σάρκα γεννηθείς . Josephus calls the manna θεῖον βρῶμα καὶ παράδοξον , Antt. iii. 1. 6: and in Ps. 77:24, it is said ἄρτον οὐρανοῦ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς .
	We can scarcely avoid recognizing in these words a tacit reference to our Lord’s discourse, or at all events to the substanee of it, John 6:31-58 . “For the sense of πνευματικός , as ‘  typical ,’ ‘seen in the light of the spirit,’ cf. Revelation 11:8 , ἥτις καλεῖται πνευματικῶς Σόδομα .” Stanley.
