 4.] It is hardly possible here, without doing violence to the words and construction, to deny that the Apostle has adopted the tradition current among the Jews, that the<i> rock followed the Israelites</i> in their journeyings, and gave forth water all the way. Thus Rabbi Solomon, on Num. xx. 2: “<i>Throughout all the forty years it was to them a well:</i>” and Schéttgen cites from the Bammidbar Rabba, “How came that well, which is mentioned Num. xxi. 16? Answer. It was like a stone, or a swarm of bees, and it rolled on, and accompanied them in their journeys. When they encamped, and the tabernacle was set up, the rock came and rested in the entrance of the tent. Then came the Princes and stood by it, saying ‘Spring up, O well, &c.,’ and it sprung up.” He also gives other testimonies.—The only ways of escaping this inference are (1) by setting aside the natural sense altogether, as Chrysostom does, understanding the saying, not of water at all, but of the spiritual rock, i.e. Christ, who went with them and wrought wonders; or (2) by taking the rock as equivalent to the<i> water from the rock:</i> so Calvin, who says, “How could the rock, which stood fixed in its place, have accompanied the Israelites? As if it were not plain that by the word<i> ‘rock’</i> is denoted the flow of water, which never deserted the people.” But against both of these we have the plain assertion, representing matter of physical fact, they drank from the<b> Spiritual (or, miraculous) rock which followed them:</b> and I cannot consent to depart from what appears to me the only admissible sense of these words. How extensively the traditionary reliques of unrecorded Jewish history were adopted by the apostolic men under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit the apology of Stephen may bear witness.<br><br><b> But</b> (distinction between what<i> they</i> saw in the rock and what we see in it: they drank from it and knew not its dignity:<i> but</i>)<b> the rock was Christ</b>.—In these words there appear to be three<i> allusions:</i> (1)<i> to the ideas of the Jews themselves:</i> so the Targum on Isa. xvi. 1: “They shall bring gifts to the Messiah of the Israelites, who shall be strong, inasmuch as in the desert he was the Rock, the Church of Zion:” so also in Wisd. x. 15 ff., the wisdom of God (see note on John i. 1) is said to have been present in Moses, to have led them through the wilderness, &c. That the MESSIAH, the ANGEL OF THE COVENANT, was present with the church of the Fathers, and that his upholding power was manifested in miraculous interferences for their welfare, was a truth acknowledged no less by the Jew than by the Christian. (2)<i> To the frequent use of this appellation</i>, A ROCK, for the God of Israel. See, among other places, Deut. xxxii. 4, 15, 18, 30, 31, 37; 1 Sam. ii. 2; 2 Sam. xxii. 2 and passim xxiii. 8, &c.; Psalms passim, and especially lxxviii. 20, compared with v. 35; see also Rom. ix. 33; 1 Pet. ii. 8. Hence it became more natural to apply the term<i> directly to Christ</i>, as the ever present God of Israel. (3)<i> To the sacramental import of the water</i> which flowed from the rock, which is the point here immediately in the Apostle’s mind. As well in sacramental import as in upholding physical agency,<i> that rock was Christ.</i> The miraculous (spiritual) food was (sacramentally) the flesh of Christ: the miraculous (spiritual) drink was the blood of Christ: so that the Jews’ miraculous supplies of food and drink were<i> sacramentally significant of the Body and Blood of Christ</i>, in kind analogous to the two great parts of the Christian Supper of the Lord. In the contents prefixed to the chapters in the A.V., we read as the import of these verses, “<i>The Sacraments of the Jews are types of ours</i>,’ which though perhaps correctly meant, is liable to be erroneously understood; inasmuch as no sacramental ordinance can be<i> a type of another,</i> but all alike, though in different degrees of approximation, and by different representations,<i> types of Him</i>, who is the fountain of all grace. The difference between their case and ours is<i> generally</i>, that they were unconscious of the sacramental import, whereas we are conscious of it: “<i>they knew not that I healed them</i>,” Hos. xi. 3: and<i> in this particular case,</i> that Christ has come to us “not by water only, but by water and blood,” 1 John v. 6: HIS DEATH having invested our sacramental ordinance with another and more deeply significant character. To enter more minutely into the import of the words, “<i>the rock was Christ</i>, would be waste of time and laboUr. ‘The above reasons abundantly justify the assertion, without either pressing the verb<b> was</b> beyond its ordinary acceptation, or presuming to fix on the Apostle a definiteness of meaning which his argument does not require.
