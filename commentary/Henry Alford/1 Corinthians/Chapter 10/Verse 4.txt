 4.] It is hardly possible here, without doing violence to the words and construction, to deny that the Apostle has adopted the tradition current among the Jews, that the<i> rock followed the Israelites</i> in their journeyings, and gave forth water all the way. Thus Rabbi Solomon, on Num. xx. 2: “<i>Throughout all the forty years it was to them a well:</i>” and Schéttgen cites from the Bammidbar Rabba, “How came that well, which is mentioned Num. xxi. 16? Answer. It was like a stone, or a swarm of bees, and it rolled on, and accompanied them in their journeys. When they encamped, and the tabernacle was set up, the rock came and rested in the entrance of the tent. Then came the Princes and stood by it, saying ‘Spring up, O well, &c.,’ and it sprung up.” He also gives other testimonies.—The only ways of escaping this inference are (1) by setting aside the natural sense altogether, as Chrysostom does, understanding the saying, not of water at all, but of the spiritual rock, i.e. Christ, who went with them and wrought wonders; or (2) by taking the rock as equivalent to the<i> water from the rock:</i> so Calvin, who says, “How could the rock, which stood fixed in its place, have accompanied the Israelites? As if it were not plain that by the word<i> ‘rock’</i> is denoted the flow of water, which never deserted the people.” But against both of these we have the plain assertion, representing matter of physical fact, they drank from the<b> Spiritual (or, miraculous) rock which followed them:</b> and I cannot consent to depart from what appears to me the only admissible sense of these words. How extensively the traditionary reliques of unrecorded Jewish history were adopted by the apostolic men under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit the apology of Stephen may bear witness.
