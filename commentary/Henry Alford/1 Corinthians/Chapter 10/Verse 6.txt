<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] <strong> Now</strong> ( <strong> δέ</strong> transitional; the contrast being, between the events themselves, and their application to us) <strong> these things happened as figures</strong> (not ‘types’ as we now use the word, meaning by type and antitype, the <em> material representation</em> , and the <em> ultimate spiritual reality</em> , but <em> figures</em> , as one imperfect ceremonial polity may figure forth a higher spiritual polity, but still this latter may not itself be the ultimate antitype) <strong> of us</strong> (the spiritual Israel as distinguished from the literal), <strong> in order that we might not be</strong> (God’s purpose in the τύποι : of course an <em> ulterior</em> purpose, for they had their <em> own immediate purpose</em> as regards the literal Israel) <strong> lusters</strong> [the use of the substantive forcibly depicts the habit] <strong> after evil things</strong> ( <em> generally:</em> no special reference yet to the Corinthian feasters, as Grot. supposes. So Theophyl. rightly: καθολικῶς περὶ πάσης κακίας λέγει , ἐπειδὴ καὶ πᾶσα κακία ἐξ ἐπιθυμίας . εἶτα καὶ κατ ʼ εἶδος τίθησι τὰς κακίας . Similarly Chrys.) <strong> as they also</strong> ( καί , i.e. supposing us to be like them) <strong> lusted</strong> . The construction ( ταῦτα … ἐγενήθησαν ) may be a verb substantive attracted into the plur. (or sing.) by the predicate, one often found: so Herod. i. 93, ἡ μὲν περίοδος , … εἰσὶ στάδιοι ἕξ : and ii. 15, αἱ Θῆβαι Αἴγυπτος ἐκαλέετο : so in Latin, Ter. Andr [42] iii. 3. 23, ‘Amantium iræ amoris integratio est:’ see many other examples in Kühner, § 429: or, which is perhaps better, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:11">1 Corinthians 10:11</span> , where see note.

<p>The rendering, ‘ <em> Now in these things they were figures of us</em> ’ (I know not by whom suggested, but I find it in Dr. Peile’s notes on the Epistles), is inconsistent both with the arrangement of the words, in which ταῦτα has the primary emphasis, and with ἐγενήθησαν , which should be ἦσαν .</p>
