 6. ]  Now (  δέ transitional; the contrast being, between the events themselves, and their application to us)  these things happened as figures (not ‘types’ as we now use the word, meaning by type and antitype, the  material representation , and the  ultimate spiritual reality , but  figures , as one imperfect ceremonial polity may figure forth a higher spiritual polity, but still this latter may not itself be the ultimate antitype)  of us (the spiritual Israel as distinguished from the literal),  in order that we might not be (God’s purpose in the τύποι : of course an  ulterior purpose, for they had their  own immediate purpose as regards the literal Israel)  lusters [the use of the substantive forcibly depicts the habit]  after evil things (  generally: no special reference yet to the Corinthian feasters, as Grot. supposes.
