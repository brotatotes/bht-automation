<b> 10.</b>]<b> For this cause</b>,<i> on account of what has just been said</i>, by which the subordination of the woman has been proved:—refers to vv. 7–9.<br><br><b> the woman ought to have power on her head</b> (i. e. the<i> sign of power</i> or<i> subjection:</i> shewn by the context to mean<i> a veil</i>). So Diodorus Siculus speaks of an image of a queen, having three kingdoms on its head, to signify that she was daughter and wife and mother of a king; where ‘kingdoms’ evidently mean<i> crowns</i>, the<i> tokens of kingdom</i>. And as there from the context it is plain that they indicated<i> participation</i> in the glory of the kingdoms, so here it is as evident from the context that the token of<b> power</b> indicates being<i> under</i> power: and such token is the covering. In this meaning all the principal Commentators agree, both ancient and modern. See some of the differing views discussed in my Greck Test.<br><br><b> because of the angels</b>] i.e. because in the Christian assemblies the holy angels of God are present, and delighting in the due order and subordination of the ranks of God’s servants,—and by a violation of that order we should be giving offence to them. So Chrysostom,— “Knowest thou not that thou standest with angels? with them thou singest, with them thou praisest: and wilt thou stand laughing?” And in another place he says, “To shew that the whole air is full of angels, only hear what the Apostle says, when he is rebuking the women and ordering them to wear a veil on their heads.” Some, with a modification of this rendering, take<b> the angels</b> to mean the<i> guardian angels</i>, appointed, one to take charge of each Christian. So Theophylact and Theodoret. But though such angels<i> certainly do</i><i> minister</i> to the heirs of salvation, see Matt. xviii. 10 and note,—there does not appear to be any immediate allusion to them<i> here</i>. Others again understand ‘<i>bad angels,</i>’ who might<i> themselves</i> be lustfully excited (so Tertullian),—or might<i> tempt men so to be</i>,—or might<i> injure the unveiled themselves.</i><b> But the angels</b>,<i> absolute</i>, never means any thing in the N.T. except<i> the holy angels of God</i>. See some other explanations in my Greek Test. But still a question remains, WHY<i> should the Apostle have here named the angels, and adduced them as furnishing a reason for women being veiled in the Christian assemblies?</i> I believe the account given above to be the true one, and the<i> reason</i> of adducing it to be that the Apostle<i> has before his mind the order of the universal church</i>, and prefers when speaking of the assemblies of Christians to adduce those beings who, as not entering into the gradation which he has here described, are conceived as<i> spectators</i> of the whole, delighted with the decency and order of the servants of God. Stanley thinks the most natural explanation of the reference to be, that the Apostle was led to it by a train of association familiar to his readers, but lost to us: and compares the intimations of a similar familiarity on their part with the subjects of which he was treating in 2 Thess. ii. 5–7.
