<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] <em> Yet is neither sex insulated and independent of the other in the Christian life</em> . <strong> ἐν κυρίῳ</strong> is not the predicate (as Grot., &amp;c.), ‘neque viri exclusis mulieribus … participes sunt beneficiorum per Christum partorum:’ nor does it mean <em> according to the ordinance of God</em> , as Chrys., Beza, Olsh., for the phrase ἐν κυρίῳ is well known as applying to the <em> Christian state</em> , <strong> in the Lord</strong> . See e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:2">Romans 16:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:8">Romans 16:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:11-12">Romans 16:11-12</span> (bis), &amp;c.</p>
