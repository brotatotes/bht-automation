<b> 14. nature itself</b>] i.e. the mere fact of<i> one sex</i> being by nature unveiled, i.e. having short hair,—the other,<i> veiled</i>, i.e. having long hair. This plainly declares that<i> man</i> was intended to be<i> uncovered</i>,—<i>woman, covered.</i> When therefore we deal with the proprieties of the<i> artificial</i> state, of<i> clothing the body</i>, we must be<i> regulated by nature’s suggestion</i>: that which she has indicated to be left uncovered, we must so leave: that which she has covered, when we clothe the body, we must cover likewise. This is the argument. The word<b> nature</b> does not mean<i> sense of natural propriety</i>, but NATURE,—<i>the law of creation</i>.<br><br><b> have long hair</b>] “To have long or beautiful hair is a sign of effeminacy. Paris in Homer is reproached as having long hair,” Eustathius.—The Apostle (see above) makes no allusion to the<i> customs of nations</i> in the matter, nor is even the mention of them relevant; he is speaking of the dictates of nature herself.
