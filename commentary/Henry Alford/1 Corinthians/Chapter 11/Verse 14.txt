 14. ]  ἡ φύσις αὐτή  , nature herself : i.e. the mere fact of  one sex being  by nature unveiled , i.e. having short hair, the  other, veiled , i.e. having long hair. This plainly declares that  man was intended to be  uncovered, woman, covered . When therefore we deal with the proprieties of the  artificial state, of  clothing the body , we must be  regulated by nature’s suggestion : that which she has indicated to be left uncovered, we must so leave: that which she has covered, when we clothe the body, we must cover likewise. This is the argument. φύσις is not  sense of natural propriety , but NATURE, the  law of creation .
	 κομᾷ ] So Eustathius, Il. γ . 288, in Wetst., κόμην δὲ ἔχειν , καὶ εὔκομον εἶναι , γυναικώτερόν ἐστιν . διὸ καὶ ὁ Πάρις ὀνειδίζεται ὡς κόμην ἔχων . On φύσις and κομᾷ Pool observes, ‘locus est vexatissimus doctorum sententiis;’ and gives a note of four folio columns; and Bengel has a long discussion on the lawfulness of wigs.
	The Apostle (see above) makes no allusion to the  customs of nations in the matter, nor is even the mention of them relevant [: he is speaking of the dictates of nature herself.]
