<p><strong> 14.</strong> ] <strong> ἡ φύσις αὐτή</strong> <strong> , nature herself</strong> : i.e. the mere fact of <em> one sex</em> being <em> by nature unveiled</em> , i.e. having short hair, the <em> other, veiled</em> , i.e. having long hair. This plainly declares that <em> man</em> was intended to be <em> uncovered, woman, covered</em> . When therefore we deal with the proprieties of the <em> artificial</em> state, of <em> clothing the body</em> , we must be <em> regulated by nature’s suggestion</em> : that which she has indicated to be left uncovered, we must so leave: that which she has covered, when we clothe the body, we must cover likewise. This is the argument. φύσις is not <em> sense of natural propriety</em> , but NATURE, the <em> law of creation</em> .

<p><strong> κομᾷ</strong> ] So Eustathius, Il. γ . 288, in Wetst., κόμην δὲ ἔχειν , καὶ εὔκομον εἶναι , γυναικώτερόν ἐστιν . διὸ καὶ ὁ Πάρις ὀνειδίζεται ὡς κόμην ἔχων . On φύσις and κομᾷ Pool observes, ‘locus est vexatissimus doctorum sententiis;’ and gives a note of four folio columns; and Bengel has a long discussion on the lawfulness of wigs.

<p>The Apostle (see above) makes no allusion to the <em> customs of nations</em> in the matter, nor is even the mention of them relevant [: he is speaking of the dictates of nature herself.]</p>
