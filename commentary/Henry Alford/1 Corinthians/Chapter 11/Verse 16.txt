<b> 16.</b>] cuts off the subject, already abundantly decided, with a settlement of any possible difference by appeal to universal apostolic and ecclesiastical custom.<b> But if any man seemeth to be contentious</b>,—i. e. ‘if any arises who appears to dispute the matter, who seems not satisfied with the<i> reasons</i> I have given, but is still disputations.’ Before what follows, we must supply “<i>let him know, that.</i>”<br><br><b> we</b> (emphatic)—the Apostles and their immediate company,—including the women who assembled in prayer and supplication with them at their various stations, see Acts xvi. 13.<br><br><b> no such custom</b>] The best modern Commentators agree with Chrysostom in understanding this, “<i>no such custom as that of being contentious.</i>” But surely it would be very unlikely, that<i> after so long a treatment of a particular subject</i>, the Apostle should wind up all by merely a censure of a fault<i> common</i> to their behaviour on<i> this and all the other</i> matters of dispute. Such a rendering seems to me almost to<i> stultify the conclusion</i>:— “If any will dispute about it still, remember that it is neither our practice, nor that of the Churches,<i> to dispute.</i>” It would seem to me, but for the weighty names on the other side, hardly to admit of a question, that the<b> custom</b> referred to alludes to<i> the practice of women praying uncovered.</i> So Theodoret and many others. He thus cuts off all further disputation on the matter, by<i> appealing to universal Christian usage:</i> and to make the appeal more solemn, adds the words<b> of God</b> to “<i>the Churches,</i>”—the assemblies which are held in honour of and for prayer to God, and are<i> His own Churches</i>. Observe “<i>the Churches,</i>” not “<i>the Church.</i>” The<i> plurality of independent testimonies to the absence of the custom</i>, is that on which the stress is laid. This appeal, ‘TO THE CHURCHES,’ was much heard again at the Reformation: but has been since too much forgotten.
