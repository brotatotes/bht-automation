<b> 18.</b>]<b> in the first place</b>—where is the second<i> particular</i> found, answering to this<i> first one</i>? Ordinarily, it is assumed that the<i> schisms</i> are the<i> first</i> abuse, the disorders in the Agapæ (love-feasts: beginning with ver. 20), the<i> second.</i> But I am convinced that this view is wrong. For (1) neither special blame, nor correction of an abuse, is conveyed in vv. 18, 19: nor is it so much as intimated, on the ordinary hypothesis, what the character of these divisions was. And (2) the words of ver. 22, “<i>shall I praise you in this? I praise you not,</i>” plainly refer back to ver. 17, and shew that the whole is continuous. The<b> divisions</b> before the Apostle’s mind are,<i> specifically</i>, those occurring at the Agapæ, but on the mention of them he breaks off to shew that such divisions were to be no matters of surprise, but were ordained to test them,—and in ver. 20 he returns with the very words, “<i>when ye come together,</i>”–to the immediate matter in hand, and treats it at length. See more on ver. 21, ff.—But the question still remains, where is the<i> second</i> point, answering to this<i> first</i> one? Again (with Meyer and Macknight) I answer,—<i>at</i> ch. xii. 1. The ABUSE OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS,<i> which also created disorder in their assemblies</i>, ch. xiv. 23 al., and concerning which he concludes, xiv. 40, “<i>let all things be done decently and in order,</i>” was the<i> other point</i> before his mind, when he wrote this first. That he takes no notice in ch. xii. 1, by any word implying that it was a<i> second</i> point, of what has gone before, will be no objection to the above view to any one who is acquainted with our Apostle’s style.<br><br><b> in assembly</b>] not<i> local</i>, as A.V., ‘<i>in the Church,</i>’ but equivalent to “<i>in one place,</i>” ver. 20. In ver. 16, where the same word (ecclesia) was used of distinct bodies of Christians, it was not possible to keep the word<i> assemblies</i>: but it should be done where the sense admits it, and it suits the matter in hand.<br><br><b> divisions</b>] of what sort, is specified below; viz. that he does not here refer to the party dissensions of ch. i. 10, nor could he say of them “<i>I partly believe it,</i>” but strictly to<i> divisions</i> which took place at<i> their meetings together</i>, viz. that each takes before other his own supper, &c.<br><br><b> and I partly believe it</b>] Said in gentleness: as if it were, “I am unwilling to believe<i> all</i> I hear concerning the point, but,<i> some</i> I cannot help believing.”
