Chrysostom and Tertullian give an ample description of these feasts, which were of the nature of mutual contributions, where each who was able brought his own portion,—and the rich additional portions for the poor.<i> During</i> and<i> after</i> this feast, as shewn by the institution, by the custom at the Passover, by the context here, and by the remnants of the ancient custom and its abuse until forbidden by the council of Carthage,—the ancient Christians partook of the Supper of the Lord. It was necessary for the celebration of the Lord’s Supper, that all should eat of the same bread and drink of the same cup; and in all probability, that a prayer should be offered, and words of consecration said by the appointed ministers. Hence cessation of the feast itself, and solemn order and silence, would be necessitated even by the outward requirements of the ordinance. These could not be obtained, where each man was greedily devouring that which he had brought with him: where the extremes were seen, of one craving, and another being drunken. This being their practice, there could be no possibility, and at the same time<i> no intention</i> of celebrating the<i> Lord’s</i> Supper,—no provision for it, nor discernment of the solemnity of it.
