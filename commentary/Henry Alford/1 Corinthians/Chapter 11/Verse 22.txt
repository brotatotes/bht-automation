There is no reason for rendering with the majority of Commentators τοὺς μὴ ἔχοντας , ‘the  poor ;’ the μὴ ἔχοντας has a distinct reference to the ἔχετε before. Meyer refers in support of the meaning, ‘the poor,’ to Wetst. on 2 Corinthians 8:13 , where nothing on the subject is found: De Wette, to Luke 3:11 , where the case is as here, the preceding ἔχων being referred to. The meaning is  allowable , e.g. πρὸς γὰρ  τὸν ἔχονθ  ʼ ὁ φθόνος ἕρπει , Soph. Aj. 157: πρὸς τῶν ἐχόντων , Φοῖβε , τὸν νόμον τίθης , Eurip. Alc. 57: πότε μὲν ἐπ ʼ ἦμαρ εἶχον , εἶτ ʼ οὐκ εἶχον ἄν , where however it is qualified by ἐπ ʼ ἦμαρ )?  What must I say to you? Shall I praise you in this matter? I praise you not . (See 1 Corinthians 11:17 .)
