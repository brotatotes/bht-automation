<b> 23.</b>]<b> For I</b> (no emphasis on “<b>I</b>”)<b> received from the Lord</b> (<i>by special revelation</i>, see Gal. i. 12. If the Apostle had referred only to the Evangelic tradition or writings (?) he would not have used the first person<i> singular</i>, but would have said, “<i>we</i> received.” I may remark, that the similarity between this account of the Institution, and that in St. Luke’s Gospel, is only what might be expected on the supposition of a special revelation made to St. Paul, of which that Evangelist, being St. Paul’s companion, in certain parts of his history availed himself)<b> that which I also delivered</b> (in my apostolic testimony)<b> unto you,</b> (viz.)<b> That the Lord Jesus, &c.</b><br><br> Literally,<b> He was being betrayed.</b> “There is an appearance of fixed order, especially in these opening words, which indicates that this had already become a familiar formula.” Stanley. In the original there is no word inserted between<b> is</b> and<b> for</b>, such as<i> broken</i> or<i> given</i>. See note on Matt. xxvi. 26.
