<p><strong> ὡσαύτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> καὶ τὸ π</strong> .] “viz. ἔλαβεν καὶ εὐχ . ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς . These last words are implied in ἔκλασεν above.” Meyer.

<p><strong> ἡ καιν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> δ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐστὶν ἐν τῷ ἐμῷ αἵμ</strong> . is the <strong> new covenant in</strong> (ratified by the shedding of, and therefore <em> standing in</em> , as its conditioning element) <strong> my blood</strong> : = ἐστὶν ἡ καιν . δ . ἡ ἐν τῷ ἐμῷ αἵμ . The position of ἐστιν is no objection to this, nor the omission of the art. Meyer would render it, ‘ <em> is the N. C. by means of my blood</em> :’ i.e. by virtue of its contents, which are my blood: and this solely on account of the position of ἐστιν . But the meaning is as harsh, as the rendering is unrequired.

<p><strong> ὁσάκις ἐὰν πίν</strong> .] Not a <em> general</em> rule for all common meals of Christians; but a precept that as often as <em> that cup</em> is drunk, it should be <em> in remembrance of Him</em> : on these last words is the emphasis: see below.</p>
