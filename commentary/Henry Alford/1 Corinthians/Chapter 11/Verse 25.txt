	 ὡσαύτ  .   καὶ τὸ π .] “viz. ἔλαβεν καὶ εὐχ . ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς . These last words are implied in ἔκλασεν above.” Meyer.
	 ἡ καιν  .   δ  .   ἐστὶν ἐν τῷ ἐμῷ αἵμ . is the  new covenant in (ratified by the shedding of, and therefore  standing in , as its conditioning element)  my blood : = ἐστὶν ἡ καιν . δ . ἡ ἐν τῷ ἐμῷ αἵμ .

C. by means of my blood :’ i.e. by virtue of its contents, which are my blood: and this solely on account of the position of ἐστιν . But the meaning is as harsh, as the rendering is unrequired.
	 ὁσάκις ἐὰν πίν .] Not a  general rule for all common meals of Christians; but a precept that as often as  that cup is drunk, it should be  in remembrance of Him : on these last words is the emphasis: see below.
