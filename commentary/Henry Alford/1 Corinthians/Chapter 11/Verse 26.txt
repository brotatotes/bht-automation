 26. ]  γάρ gives an explanatory reason for εἰς τ . ἐμὴν ἀνάμν ., viz. that the act of eating and drinking is a  proclamation of the death of the Lord till His coming . The rendering of καταγγέλλετε  imperative , as Theophyl.?, Luth., Grot., Rückert, is evidently wrong. The Apostle is substantiating the application of the Lord’s words by the acknowledged nature of the rite. It is a  proclamation of His death : and thus is a  remembrance of Him . It is so, by our making mention of in it, and seeing visibly before us and partaking of,  His body broken, and His blood shed .
	 ἄχρις οὗ ἔλθῃ ] The καταγγ . is addressed  directly to the Corinthians , not  to them and all succeeding Christians ; the Apostle regarding the coming of the Lord as near at hand, in  his own time, see notes on 2 Corinthians 5:1-10 . Thdrt. remarks, μετὰ γὰρ τὴν αὐτοῦ παρουσίαν , οὐκέτι χρεία τῶν συμβόλων τοῦ σώματος , αὐτοῦ φαινομένου τοῦ σώματος · διὰ τοῦτο εἶπεν , ἄχρις οὗ ( ἂν ) ἔλθῃ .
	The ἄν has been inserted from not being aware that its absence implies the  certainty of the event. See examples in Lobeck on Phrynichus, pp. 15, 16, note.
