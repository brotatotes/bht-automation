<p><strong> 26.</strong> ] <strong> γάρ</strong> gives an explanatory reason for εἰς τ . ἐμὴν ἀνάμν ., viz. that the act of eating and drinking is a <em> proclamation of the death of the Lord till His coming</em> . The rendering of καταγγέλλετε <em> imperative</em> , as Theophyl.?, Luth., Grot., Rückert, is evidently wrong. The Apostle is substantiating the application of the Lord’s words by the acknowledged nature of the rite. It is a <em> proclamation of His death</em> : and thus is a <em> remembrance of Him</em> . It is so, by our making mention of in it, and seeing visibly before us and partaking of, <em> His body broken, and His blood shed</em> .

<p><strong> ἄχρις οὗ ἔλθῃ</strong> ] The καταγγ . is addressed <em> directly to the Corinthians</em> , not <em> to them and all succeeding Christians</em> ; the Apostle regarding the coming of the Lord as near at hand, in <em> his own</em> time, see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1-10">2 Corinthians 5:1-10</span> . Thdrt. remarks, μετὰ γὰρ τὴν αὐτοῦ παρουσίαν , οὐκέτι χρεία τῶν συμβόλων τοῦ σώματος , αὐτοῦ φαινομένου τοῦ σώματος · διὰ τοῦτο εἶπεν , ἄχρις οὗ ( ἂν ) ἔλθῃ .

<p>The ἄν has been inserted from not being aware that its absence implies the <em> certainty</em> of the event. See examples in Lobeck on Phrynichus, pp. 15, 16, note.</p>
