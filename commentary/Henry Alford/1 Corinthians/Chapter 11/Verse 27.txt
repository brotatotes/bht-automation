 27 .] A  consequence , from the nature of the ordinance being,  to proclaim the death of the Lord: the guilt of the unworthy participation of either of the elements . The death of the Lord was brought about by the breaking of His body and shedding His blood: this Death we proclaim in the ordinance by the bread broken the wine poured out, of which we partake: whoever therefore shall  either eat the bread  or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily (see below 1Co 11:29 ) shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord: i.e. “  crimini et pœnæ corporis et sanguinis Christi violati obnoxius erit :” Meyer. Such an one proclaims the death of Christ, and yet  in an unworthy spirit with no regard to that Death as  his atonement, or a proof of Christ’s love: he proclaims that Death  as an indifferent person : he therefore  partakes of the guilt of it . Chrysostom strikingly says, σφαγὴν τὸ πρᾶγμα ἀπέφηνεν , οὐκέτι θυσίαν , p. 247. But the idea ὡς καὶ αὐτὸς ἐκχέας τὸ αἷμα , Theophyl. (and Chrys., τί δήποτε ; ὅτι ἐξέχεεν αὐτό , καὶ σφαγ ., &c., as above), is irrelevant here, see 1 Corinthians 11:29 . The Romanists absurdly enough defend by this ἤ (the meaning of which is not to be changed to καί , as is  most unfairly done in our E. V., and the completeness of the argument thereby destroyed) their practice of  communicating only in one kind . Translated into  common language , and applied to the ordinary sustenance of the body, their reasoning stands thus: ‘Whoever eats to excess,  or drinks to excess, is guilty of sin:  therefore eating, without drinking, will sustain life.’
