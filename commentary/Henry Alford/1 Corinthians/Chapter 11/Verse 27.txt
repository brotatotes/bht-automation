<b> 27.</b>]<i> A consequence,</i> from the nature of the ordinance being,<i> to proclaim the Death of the Lord: the guilt of the unworthy participation of either of the elements.</i> The Death of the Lord was brought about by the breaking of His body and shedding His blood: this Death we proclaim in the ordinance by the bread broken—the wine poured out, of which we partake: whoever therefore shall either eat the bread<i> or</i> drink the cup of the Lord unworthily (see below, ver. 29) shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord: i.e. shall be subject to the penalty of offence against the Body and Blood of Christ. Such an one proclaims the Death of Christ, and yet in<i> an unworthy spirit</i>—with no regard to that Death as<i> his</i> atonement, or a proof of Christ’s love: he proclaims that Death<i> as an indifferent person:</i> he therefore<i> partakes of the guilt of it.</i> Chrysostom strikingly says, “He makes that Death a murder, and not a sacrifice” The Romanists absurdly enough defend by this or (the meaning of which is not to be changed to<i> and</i>, as<i> is most unfairly</i> done in our A.V., and the completeness of the argument thereby destroyed) their practice of<i> communicating only in one kind.</i> Translated into<i> common language</i>, and applied to the ordinary sustenance of the body, their reasoning stands thus: “Whoever eats to excess,<i> or</i> drinks to excess, is guilty of sin:<i> therefore</i> eating, without drinking, will sustain life.”
