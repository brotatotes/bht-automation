<b> 3.</b>] “It appears, that the Christian women at Corinth claimed for their sex an equality with the other, taking occasion by the doctrine of Christian freedom and abolition of sexual distinctions in Christ (Gal. iii. 28). The gospel unquestionably did much for the emancipation of women, who in the East and among the Ionian Greeks (not among the Dorians and the Romans) were kept in unworthy dependence. Still this was effected in a quiet and gradual manner: whereas in Corinth they seem to have taken up the cause of female independence somewhat too eagerly. The women overstepped the bounds of their sex, in coming forward to pray and to prophesy in the assembled church with uncovered heads. Both of these the Apostle disapproved,—as well their coming forward to pray and to prophesy, as their removing the veil: here however he blames the latter practice only, and reserves the former till ch. xiv. 34. In order to confine the women to their true limits, he reminds them of their subjection to the<i> man</i>, to whom again he assigns his place in the spiritual order of creation, and traces this precedence up to God Himself.” De Wette.
