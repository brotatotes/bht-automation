 31. ]  δέ contrasts with this state of sicknesses and deaths:  it might be otherwise . This  διεκρινόμεθα (parallel with δοκιμαζέτω before) should be rendered by the  same word as διακρίνων before, the idea being the same. ‘  Appreciate, ’ if etymologically understood, is the nearest to the meaning: in Latin  dijudico , which the Vulg. has, is an excellent rendering, preserving also the ‘judico,’so essential to the following clause. In the E. V. ‘  If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged, ’ the tenses are wrong: it should be, ‘  If we had judged ourselves, we should not have been judged :’ ‘no such punishments would have befallen us.’
	Thus I wrote in some former editions: and so also Stanley. But this collocation of the (imperfect) tenses may be rendered either way. Donaldson, Gr. Gr., p. 204, renders εἴ τι εἶχεν , ἐδίδου ἄν , ‘  si quid haberet, daret :’ and so we have it in Æschyl. Suppl. 244, καὶ τἄλλα πόλλ ʼ ἐπεικάσαι δίκαιον ἦν , εἰ μὴ παρόντι φθόγγος ἦν ὁ σημανῶν : Æschin. Ctes. p. 86, εἰ δ ʼ ἦν ἀναγκαῖον ῥηθῆναι , οὐ Δημοσθένους ἦν ὁ λόγος : and other places (Bernhardy, p. 376). But as certainly, we find the other sense: e.g. Herod. iii. 25, of Cambyses, εἰ … ἀπῆγε ὀπίσω τὸν στρατὸν … ἦν ἂν σοφὸς ἀνήρ . So that the E. V. may  here be kept, if thought desirable. In John 5:46 , our translators have adopted the other rendering: ‘Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me:’ but in ib. John 8:39 ; John 8:42 , have rendered as here.
