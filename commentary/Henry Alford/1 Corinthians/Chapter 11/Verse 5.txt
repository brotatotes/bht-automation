<b> 5.</b>] The case of the woman is just the converse. She, if she<i> uncovers</i> herself (on the manner of covering, see below ver. 15 note) in such an assembly, dishonours her head (<i>the man</i>; not literally, her<i> own head</i> [except as above]: of this<i> kind of dishonour</i> there is no mention at all in our passage, and ver. 3 has<i> expressly guarded us against making the mistake</i>) by apparently casting off his headship: and if this is to be so, the Apostle proceeds, why not go further, and cut off her hair, which of itself is a token of this subjection? But if this be acknowledged to be shameful (it was a punishment of adulteresses), let the further decency of the additional covering be conceded likewise.
