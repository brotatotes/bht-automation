<b> 7.</b>]<b> For</b> refers back to and gives a reason for the words “<i>let her be covered,</i>” the difference between the sexes being assumed,—that one<i> should be</i> and the other should<i> not</i> be veiled.<br><br><b> the image... of God,</b> Gen. i. 26. This the<i> man</i> is, having been created first,—<i>directly</i>, and in a special manner: the woman indirectly, only<i> through the man</i>.<br><br><b> and</b> (the representative of the)<b> glory of God:</b> on account of his superiority and<i> godlike</i> attributes among other created beings. This is obviously<i> the point</i> here brought out, as in Ps. viii. 6; not that he is<i> set to shew forth God’s glory</i>, because God<i> glories in him</i>.<i> Man</i> is<i> God’s glory:</i> He has put in him His Majesty, and he represents God on earth:<i> woman is man’s glory:</i> taken (ver. 8) from the<i> man</i>, shining not with light direct from God, but with light derived from<i> man</i>. This of course is true only as regards her place in creation, and her providential subordination, not in respect of the dependence of every woman’s individual soul directly on God,<i> and not on man</i>, for supplies of grace and preparations for glory. The Apostle omits in this case<i> the image</i>, because anthropologically the woman is not the<i> image</i> of the man, on account of the difference of the sexes: and also perhaps because thus he would seem to deny to the woman the being created in the<i> divine</i> image, which she is as well as the man, Gen. i. 26, 27. The former reason appears the more probable.
