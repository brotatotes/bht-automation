<p><strong> 1.</strong> ] <strong> δέ</strong> transitional. Some have thought that the Corinthians had referred this question to the Apostle’s decision: but from the οὐ θέλω ὑμ . ἀγνοεῖν , it rather looks as if, like the last, it had been an abuse which he had <em> heard of</em> , and <em> of his own instance corrects</em> .

But surely the <em> things</em> are the main subject, enounced here, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4-11">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</span> , and treated of through the rest of the chapter; the inspired <em> persons</em> being mentioned only incidentally to <em> them</em> . Others, as Storr, Billroth, Wieseler cited by Meyer, and De W., limit τὰ πν , to the <em> speaking with tongues</em> , which indeed is mainly treated of in the latter part of the section (see ch. 1Co 14:1 ): but <em> here</em> the gifts of the Spirit <em> generally</em> are the subject.
