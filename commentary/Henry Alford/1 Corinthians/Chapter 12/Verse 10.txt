The<i> prophet</i> differs from the<i> speaker with tongues</i>.... in that he speaks<i> with the understanding</i>, not ecstatically: from the<i> teacher</i>, thus: ‘He that prophesies speaks all that he utters, from the Spirit: whereas he that teaches, sometimes speaks of his own mind.” Chrysostom.”<br><br><b> discernings of spirits</b>] i.e. the power of distinguishing between the operation of the Spirit of God, and the evil spirit, or the unassisted human spirit: see 1 John iv. 1, and compare “<i>giving heed to seducing spirits,</i>” 1 Tim. iv. 1.
