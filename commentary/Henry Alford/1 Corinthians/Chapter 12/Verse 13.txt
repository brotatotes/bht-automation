 13. ] This shewn from our being  baptized into one body, and  receiving one Spirit.  For in (see on 1Co 12:9 )  one Spirit also (the emphasis on ἑνὶ πν ., to which words καί belongs)  we all were baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or freemen; and we all were made to drink of one Spirit (or, ‘  all watered by one Spirit ,’ viz. the  water of baptism , here taken as identical with the Spirit whose influence accompanied it). So (understanding the whole verse of  baptism ) Chrys., Theophyl., Œc [56] , Rückert, Meyer, De Wette. Luther, Beza, Calv., Estius, Grot., al., refer the latter half to the  Lord’s Supper: and this is  mentioned by Chrys. and Theophyl.: Bilhoth and Olsh. to the abiding influence of the Spirit in strengthening and refreshing. But the aor.  ἐποτίσθημεν , referring to a  fact gone by , is fatal to both these latter interpretations: besides that it would be  harsh to understand even  εἰς ἓν πν . ἐποτίσθ . (see var. readd.) and  impossible to understand  ἓν πν . ἐποτ ., of the cup in the Lord’s Supper.
