<b> 13.</b>] This shewn from our being<i> baptized into one</i> body, and<i> receiving one</i> Spirit.—<b>For in</b> (see on ver. 9)<b> one Spirit also</b> (the emphasis on “<b>one</b><i> Spirit,</i>” to which words<b> also</b> belongs)<b> we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or freemen; and we all were made to drink of one Spirit</b> (or, ‘<i>all watered by one Spirit, viz. the water of baptism</i>, here taken as identical with the Spirit whose influence accompanied it).—So (understanding the whole verse of<i> baptism</i>) Chrysostom and others refer the latter half to the<i> Lord’s Supper</i>: and this is<i> mentioned</i> by Chrysostom, Luther, and others. Olshausen, and others, to the abiding influence of the Spirit in strengthening and refreshing. But the past tense “<b>we were made</b><i> to drink,</i>”... referring to a<i> fact</i><i> gone by</i>, is fatal to both these latter interpretations: besides that it would be<i> harsh</i> to understand even “<i>we were made to drink</i><b> into</b><i> one Spirit,</i>’ and impossible to understand “<i>we were made to drink</i><b> of</b><i> one Spirit,</i>” of the cup in the Lord’s Supper.
