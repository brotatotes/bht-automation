<b> 14.</b>]<i> Analogy, by which this multiplicity in unity is justified</i>: it is even so in the<i> natural body</i>, which, though<i> one</i>, consists of<i> many members</i>. The object of the continuation of the simile seems to be, to convince them that their various gifts had been bestowed by God on them as members of the Christian body, and that they must not, because they did not happen to possess the gifts of<i> another</i>, consider themselves<i> excluded</i> from the<i> body</i>,â€”in which the weaker as well as the stronger, the less comely as well as the more comely members were necessary. The reader will remember the fable of the belly and members, spoken by Menenius Agrippa to the mutinous plebeians of Rome, when they seceded to the Mons Sacer.
