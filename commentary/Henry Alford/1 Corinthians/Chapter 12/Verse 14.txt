<p>The student will remember the fable spoken by Menenius Agrippa to the mutinous plebs in Livy ii. 32. The passage is also illustrated by Seneca de Ira, ii. 31, ‘Quid si nocere velint manus pedibus, manibus oculi? Ut omnia inter se membra consentiunt, quia singula servari totius interest: ita homines singulis parcent, quia ad cœlum geniti sumus: salva autem esse societas nisi amore et custodia partium non potest:’ and by Marc [57] Antonin. ii. 1, where in his morning meditations on the duty of repressing anger through the day, he says, γεγόναμεν γὰρ πρὸς συνεργίαν , ὡς πόδες , ὡς χεῖρες , ὡς βλέφαρα , ὡς οἱ στοῖχοι τῶν ἄνω καὶ τῶν κάτω ὀδόντων · τὸ οὖν ἀντιπράσσειν ἀλλήλοις , παρὰ φύσιν .
