 15. ] The  ὅτι is rightly rendered in E. V.  because .
	 οὐ παρὰ τ . κ . τ . λ .] These words [may be taken, here and in the next verse, “  it is not therefore not of the body .” But they] are best taken as a question, appealing to the sense of the reader: they thus have more of the vigour of the Apostle’s style.
	 παρά , see reff.
	 ἐκ τ  .   σ .,  belonging to the body as an aggregate; so εἷς ἐκ τῶν δώδεκα , ἧσαν ἐκ τῶν Φαρισαίων . The double negation strengthens, see Winer, edn. 6, § 55. 9 b (he takes the two,  in this case , as destroying one another (?), see ib. a).
