 27. ]  Application of all that has been said of the physical body, to the Corinthians as the mystical body of Christ: and to  individuals among them, as  members in particular , i.e. each according to his allotted part in the body.  Each church is said to be  the body of Christ , as each is said to be  the temple of God (see ch. 1 Corinthians 3:16 , note): not that there are many bodies or many temples; but that each church is an image of the whole aggregate, a microcosm, having the same characteristics. Chrys. would understand ἐκ μέρους ὅτι ἡ ἐκκλησία ἡ παρ ʼ ὑμῖν μέρος ἐστὶ τῆς πανταχοῦ κειμένης ἐκκλησίας , καὶ τοῦ σώματος τοῦ διὰ πασῶν συνισταμένον τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν (Hom. xxxii. p. 285): but this, though true, does not appear to have been here before the Apostle, only  the whole Corinthian church as the body of Christ , and its individual components as members, each in his appointed place.
