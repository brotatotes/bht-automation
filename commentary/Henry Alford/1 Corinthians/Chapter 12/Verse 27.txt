<b> 27.</b>]<i> Application of all that has been said of the physical body, to the Corinthians, as the mystical body of Christ:</i> and to<i> individuals</i> among them, as<i> members in particular</i>, i.e. each according to his allotted part in the body.<i> Each church</i> is said to be<i> the body of Christ</i>, as each is said to be<i> the temple of God</i> (see ch. iii. 16, note): not that there are many bodies or many temples; but that each church is an image of the whole aggregate, a microcosm or little world, having the same characteristics.
