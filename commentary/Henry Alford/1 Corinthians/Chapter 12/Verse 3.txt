<b> 3.</b>]<i> The negative and positive criteria of inspiration by the Spirit of God:</i> viz.<i> the rejection, or confession, of Jesus as the Lord.</i><br><br><b> Wherefore</b>, ‘<i>because ye have been hitherto in ignorance of the matter</i>.’<br><br><b> in the Spirit of God—in the Holy Ghost</b>] The Spirit of God, or the Holy Ghost, is the<i> Power pervading</i> the speaker, the<i> Element in which he</i> speaks.<br><br><b> Jesus is accursed</b>]<b> Jesus</b> (not<i> Christ</i>, the<i> Name of office</i>, itself in some measure the<i> object of faith</i>,—but Jesus, the personal Name,—the historical Person whose life was<i> matter of fact:</i> the curse, and the confession, are in this way far deeper)<b> is accursed</b> (see Rom. ix. 3, note). So,<b> Jesus is Lord</b> (all that is implied in<b> lord</b> being here also implied: and we must not forget that the Greek word Kyrios, here used, is the solemn accustomed name in the Septuagint version for the Hebrew JEHOVAH). By these last words the influence of the Holy Spirit is widened by the Apostle from the supernatural gifts to which perhaps it had been improperly confined, to the faith and confession of every Christian.—It is remarkable that in 1 John iv. 1, 2, where a test to try the spirits is given, the<i> human</i> side of this confession is brought out,— ‘<i>that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh,</i>’—St. John having to deal with those who denied the reality of the Incarnation.
