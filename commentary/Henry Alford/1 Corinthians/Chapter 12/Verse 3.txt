 3. ]  The negative and positive criteria of inspiration by the Spirit of God : viz. the  rejection, or confession, of Jesus as the Lord .
	 διό , ‘  because ye  have been hitherto in ignorance of the matter .’
	 ἐν πν  .   θεοῦ    ἐν πν  .   ἁγ  . ] The Spirit of God, or the Holy Ghost, is the  Power pervading the speaker, the  Element in which he speaks. So Schöttgen, on Matthew 22:43 , quotes from the Rabbis, ‘  David saw, ברוח הקדש in the Holy Spirit.’
	 λαλῶν λέγει ] On the difference of meaning between λαλῶ , ‘to  discourse ,’ ‘to  speak ,’ and λέγω , ‘to  say ,’ the former of the  act of utterance absolutely, the latter having for its object that which is uttered, see note on John 8:25 . In all the seeming exceptions to this, λαλῶ may be justified as keeping its own meaning of ‘to discourse:’ we may safely deny that it is ever ‘  to say ’ simply.
	 ἀνάθ  .   Ἰης  . ]  Jesus (not  Christ , the  Name of office , itself in some measure the  object of faith , but Jesus, the personal Name, the historical Person whose life was  matter of fact : the curse, and the confession, are in this way far deeper)  is accursed (see ref. Rom. note). So κύρ . Ἰης .,  Jesus is Lord (all that is implied in  κύριος , being here also implied: and we must not forget that it is the LXX verbum solenne for the Heb. JEHOVAH). By these last words the influence of the Holy Spirit is widened by the Apostle from the supernatural gifts to which perhaps it had been improperly confined, to the faith and confession of every Christian.
	It is remarkable that in 1 John 4:1-2 , where a test to try the spirits is given, the  human side of this confession is brought out, Ἰησοῦν χριστὸν ἐν σαρκὶ ἐληλυθότα , John having to deal with those who denied the reality of the Incarnation. Or also, as Bengel: “Paulus præbet criterium veri contra  gentes: Johannes, contra  falsos prophetas .”
