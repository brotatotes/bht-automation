<p><strong> 31.</strong> ] <strong> But</strong> (he has been shewing that <em> all</em> gifts <em> have their value:</em> and that all are <em> set in the church by God: some</em> however are <em> more valuable</em> than <em> others</em> ) <strong> do ye aim at the greater gifts</strong> ( μείζ . is explained ch. 1Co 14:5 ). This exhortation is not inconsistent with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:11">1 Corinthians 12:11</span> ; but, as we look for the divine blessing on tillage and careful culture, so we may look for the aid of the Spirit on carefully cultivated powers of the understanding and speech; and we may notice that the greater gifts, those of προφητεία and διδασκαλία , consisted in <em> the inspired exercise of the conscious faculties</em> , in which culture and diligence would be useful accessories. “Spiritus dat, ut vult ( 1Co 12:11 ): sed fideles tamen libere aliud præ alio possunt sequi et exercere, c. xiv. 26.” Bengel. Compare also xiv. 39. There is thus no need to explain away ζηλοῦτε , as Grot. (“ <em> agite cum Deo precibus ut accipiatis</em> ”) and others: or to depart from the known usage of χαρίσματα , and explain it to mean <em> faith, hope, and love</em> , as Morus, or the <em> fruits of love</em> , as Billroth.

<p><strong> καθ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ὑπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὁδ</strong> .] <strong> An eminently excellent way</strong> , viz. <em> of emulating the greatest gifts:</em> so Theophyl.: καὶ μετὰ τούτων ( τοῦτο γὰρ δηλοῖ τὸ καὶ ἔτι ), ἐὰν ὅλως ζηλωταὶ ὑπάρχητε χαρισμάτων , δείξω ὑμῖν μίαν ὁδὸν καθ ʼ ὑπερβολήν , τουτέστιν , ὑπερέχουσαν , <strong> ἥτις φέρει ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ χαρίσματα</strong> <strong> ·</strong> τὴν ἀγάπην δὲ λέγει .

<p><strong> καθ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ὑπερβ</strong> .] must not be joined with the verb, ‘est adhuc via quam vobis diligentissime demonstro’ (Pagnini’s version, and some mentioned by Estius): see reff. and cf. ἡ μάλιστα ἀναγνώρισις , Arist. Poet. ii. 6, μάλα στρατηγόν , Xen. Hell. vi. 2. 39, εὖ πρᾶξις , Æsch. Agam. 262, σφόδρα γυναικῶν , Plato, Legg. i. p. 639 c, and other examples in Bernhardy, Syntax, p. 338.

<p>The explanation of Estius and Billroth, that the way which he is about to shew them is ‘multo excellentiorem iis donis de quibus hactenus egit’ (Est.), is clearly wrong: the opening verses of ch. 13 shewing, that he does not draw a <em> comparison between love and gifts</em> , but only shews that it is <em> the only</em> WAY, in which <em> gifts</em> can be made effectual in the highest sense. See also on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:1">1 Corinthians 14:1</span> .</p>
