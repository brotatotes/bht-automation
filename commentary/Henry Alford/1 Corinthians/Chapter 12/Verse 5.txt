<b> 5.</b>]<b> And there are varieties of ministries</b> (appointed<i> services</i> in the church, in which as their channels of manifestation the<i> gifts</i> would work),<b> and the same Lord</b> (Christ, the Lord of the church, whose it is to appoint all ministrations in it. These ministrations must not be narrowed to the<i> ecclesiastical orders</i>, but kept commensurate in extent with the gifts which are to find scope by their means, see verses 7â€“10: and)<b> varieties of operations</b> (effects of divine working: not to be limited to<i> miraculous</i> effects, but understood again commensurately with the gifts of whose working they are the results),<b> and the same God, Who worketh all of them in all persons</b> (all the gifts in all who are gifted). Thus we have GOD THE FATHER, the First Source and Operator of all spiritual influence in all: GOD THE SON, the Ordainer in His Church of all ministries by which this influence may be legitimately brought out for edification: GOD THE HOLY GHOST, dwelling and working in the church, and effectuating in each man such measure of His gifts as He sees fit.
