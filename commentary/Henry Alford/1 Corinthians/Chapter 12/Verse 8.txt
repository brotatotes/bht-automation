<b> 8.</b>]<b> For</b> appeals to<i> matter of fact</i>, as the ground of the assertion in ver. 7, both as to the<i> giving</i>, and as to the gift<i> being for profit</i>.<br><br><b> the word of wisdom</b>.....<b> the word of knowledge</b>]<i> What is the distinction?</i> According to Neander,<b> wisdom</b> represents the<i> skill</i>, which is able to reduce the whole<i> practical</i> Christian life into its due order in accordance with its foundation principles;<b> knowledge</b>, the<i> theoretical insight</i> into divine things. But Bengel and others take them conversely,<b> knowledge</b> for the practical,<b> wisdom</b> for the theoretical. Meyer says, “<b>Wisdom</b> means the<i> higher Christian</i><i> wisdom</i> (see on ch. ii. 6) in and of itself;—so that discourse which expresses its truths, makes them clear, applies them, &c. is the<i> word of wisdom</i>. But this does not necessarily imply the speculative penetration of these truths,—the philosophical treatment of them by deeper and more scientific investigation, in other words,<b> knowledge</b>: and discourse which aims at this is<i> the word of knowledge.</i>” This last view is most in accordance with the subsequently recognized meaning of<i> knowledge</i> (gnosis) and the<i> gnostic</i>, and with the Apostle’s own use of<i> wisdom</i> in the passage referred to, ch. ii. 6.<br><br> These are bestowed<b> according to</b> (the disposition,—see ver. 11,—of)<b> the same Spirit.</b>
