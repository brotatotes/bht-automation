 8. ]  γάρ appeals to  matter of fact , as the ground of the assertion in 1 Corinthians 12:7 , both as to the δίδοται and as to the πρὸς τὸ συμφέρον .
	 ᾧ μὲν  …   ἄλλῳ δέ , a loose construction, as in 1 Corinthians 12:28 .
	 λόγος σοφίας  …   λόγος γνώσεως ]  What is the distinction ? According to Neander,  σοφία is the  skill , which is able to reduce the whole  practical Christian life into its due order in accordance with its foundation principles (see Pfl. u. Leit. p. 247);  γνῶσις , the  theoretical insight into divine things: and similarly Olsh. and Billroth. But Bengel, al., take them conversely,  γνώσ . for the practical,  σοφ  . for the theoretical. Both, as De W. remarks, have their grounds in usage: σοφία is  practical Colossians 1:9 , as is γνῶσις Romans 15:14 , but they are  theoretical respectively in ch. 1 Corinthians 1:17 ff. and 1 Corinthians 8:1 . Estius explains  λόγος σοφίας , ‘gratiam de iis quæ ad doctrinam religionis ac pietatis spectant disserendi ex causis supremis,’ as ch. 1 Corinthians 2:6 f.: and  λόγ  .   γνώσεως , he says, “gratia est disserendi de rebus Christianæ religionis, ex iis quæ sunt humanæ scientiæ vel experientiæ.” Meyer says, “ σοφία is the  higher Christian wisdom (see on ch. 1Co 2:6 ) in and of itself; so that discourse which expresses its truths, makes them clear, applies them, &c. is λόγος σοφίας . But this does not necessarily imply the speculative penetration of these truths, the philosophical treatment of them by deeper and more scientific investigation, in other words, γνῶσις : and discourse which aims at this is λόγος γνώσεως .” This last view is most in accordance with the subsequently recognized meaning of γνῶσις and γνωστικός , and with the Apostle’s own use of σοφία in the passage referred to, ch. 1 Corinthians 2:6 .
