<b> 9.</b>]<b> faith,</b> as Chrysostom explains it, “He does not here mean faith in doctrines, but that which works miracles, of which our Lord said, ‘If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, &c.’ (Matt. xvii. 20), and respecting which the Apostles offered their petition, ‘add unto us faith’ (Luke xvii. 5): for this faith is the mother of miracles.” This seems to be the meaning here; a faith, enabling a man to place himself beyond the region of mere moral certainty, in the actual realization of things believed, in a high and unusual manner.
