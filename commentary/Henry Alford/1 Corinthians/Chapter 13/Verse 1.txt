It is hardly possible to understand tongues here of any thing but<i> articulate forms of speech:</i> i.e.<i> languages</i>. See note on Acts ii, 4.—<b>Of men</b> (generic)<b> and of angels</b> (generic): i.e. of<i> ‘all</i> men and<i> all</i> angels,’ whatever those tongues may be.<br><br><b> love</b>] LOVE<i> to all,</i> in<i> its most general sense</i>, as throughout the chapter: no distinction being here drawn between love to<i> man</i> and to<i> God</i>, but the<i> general principle</i> dealt with,<i> from which both</i><i> spring.</i> The ‘<i>caritas</i>’ of the Latin versions has occasioned the rendering ‘<i>charity</i>’ in most modern versions. Of this word Stanley remarks, “The limitation of its meaning on the one hand to mere almsgiving, or on the other to mere toleration, has so much narrowed its sense, that the simpler term ‘Love,’ though too general exactly to meet the case, is now the best equivalent.”<br><br><b> I am become</b>] the case supposed is regarded as present: ‘if<i> I can speak....

The larger kind would be here meant.
