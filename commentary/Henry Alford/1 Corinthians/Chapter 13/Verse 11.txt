<b> 11.</b>]<i> Analogical illustration of ver.</i> 10.<br><br> The<b> child</b> (or<i> babe</i>) and the<i> perfect</i> are used in contrast, ch. ii. 6; iii. 1; xiv. 20.<br><br><b> I spake, I thought</b> (<i>was minded,</i> or<i> felt</i>),<b> I reasoned</b> (or<i> judged</i>). There can hardly be an allusion, as some think, to the<i> three gifts</i>, of<i> tongues</i> (I<i> spoke</i>),<i> prophesy</i> (I<i> thought</i>, which suits but very lamely), and<i> knowledge</i> (I<i> reasoned</i>).<br><br><b> now that I am become a man, I have brought to an end the ways of a child:</b> not, as A.V., ‘<i>when I became a man I put away....</i>,’ as if it were done<i> on a set</i><i> day</i>;—this rendering is ungrammatical.
