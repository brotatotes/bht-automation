	 νήπιος and  τέλειος are used in contrast ch. 1Co 2:6 to 1Co 3:1 ; 1 Corinthians 14:20 .
	 ἐλάλουν  ,   ἐφρόνουν  ,   ἐλογιζόμην  I spoke, I [  thought ] (felt, was minded),  I [  reasoned (or]  judged ). There can hardly be an allusion, as Theophyl., Œc [60] , Bengel, Olsh., al., think, to the  three gifts , of  tongues ( ἐλάλ .),  prophecy ( ἐφρόν ., which suits but very lamely), and  knowledge ( ἐλογιζ .).

	 ὅτε γέγ . κ . τ . λ .]  Now that I am become a man, I have brought to an end the ways of a child : not, as E. V., ‘  when I became a man, I put away …,’ as if it were done  on a set day , and as if γέγ . and κατήργ . were aorists. For this use of ὅτε , cf. Demosth. Olynth. 1, init. ὅτε τοίνυν ταῦθ ʼ οὕτως ἔχει , προσήκει προθύμως ἐθέλειν ἀκούειν : see Kühner, § 813. 2.
