<p><strong> ἐλάλουν</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> ἐφρόνουν</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> ἐλογιζόμην</strong> <strong> I spoke, I</strong> [ <strong> thought</strong> ] (felt, was minded), <strong> I</strong> [ <strong> reasoned</strong> (or] <strong> judged</strong> ). There can hardly be an allusion, as Theophyl., Œc [60] , Bengel, Olsh., al., think, to the <em> three gifts</em> , of <em> tongues</em> ( ἐλάλ .), <em> prophecy</em> ( ἐφρόν ., which suits but very lamely), and <em> knowledge</em> ( ἐλογιζ .).

<p><strong> ὅτε γέγ</strong> . κ . τ . λ .] <strong> Now that I am become a man, I have brought to an end the ways of a child</strong> : not, as E. V., ‘ <em> when I became a man, I put away</em> …,’ as if it were done <em> on a set day</em> , and as if γέγ . and κατήργ . were aorists. For this use of ὅτε , cf. Demosth. Olynth. 1, init. ὅτε τοίνυν ταῦθ ʼ οὕτως ἔχει , προσήκει προθύμως ἐθέλειν ἀκούειν : see Kühner, § 813. 2.</p>
