<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] <em> Contrast between our present sight and knowledge, and those in the future perfect state</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> γάρ</strong> justifies the analogy of the former verse: for it is just so with <em> us</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἄρτι</strong> , in our <em> present condition</em> , until the Lord’s coming.

<p><strong> δι</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἐσόπτρου</strong> , <strong> through a mirror</strong> : i.e. as Billroth, Meyer, and De W. <em> according to the popular illusion</em> , which regards the object, really seen <em> behind</em> the mirror, as seen through it. We must think, not of our mirrors of glass, but of the imperfectly-reflecting metallic mirrors of the ancients. The idea of the <em> lapis specularis</em> , placed in windows, being meant, adopted by Schöttgen from Rabbinical usage (e.g. ‘omnes prophetæ viderunt per specular obscurum, et Moses doctor noster vidit per specular lucidum’(Wetst.): and see numerous examples in his Hor. Hebr. i. 646 ff.), and followed by many Commentators, is inconsistent with the usage of <strong> ἕσοπτρον</strong> , which (Meyer) is <em> always a</em> MIRROR (Pind. Nem, vii. 20: Anacr. xi. 2; xx. 5. Lucian, Amor. xliv. 48: see also reff.): the window of <em> lapis specularis</em> being <strong> δί</strong> οπτρα (Strabo, xii. 2, p. 540).

<p><strong> ἐν αἰνίγματι</strong> ] There is a reference to ref. Num., στόμα κατὰ στόμα λαλήσω αὐπῷ ἐν εἴδει , καὶ οὐ δι ʼ αἰνιγμάτων . Many take the words adverbially, ‘ <em> enigmatically</em> ’ (so E. V., ‘ <em> darkly</em> ’ [and so we are almost obliged to do in an English version]): but this cannot be [the strict rendering], because αἴνιγμα is objective, not subjective: ‘ <em> a dark hint given by words</em> .’ I agree with Meyer, notwithstanding De Wette’s strong objections, in believing ἐν αἰνίγματι to mean ‘ <em> in a dark discourse</em> ,’ viz. <em> the revealed word</em> , which is <em> dark</em> , by comparison with our future <em> perfect knowledge</em> . So also Luther: <em> in einem bunteln Wort</em> . Thus, as M [61] observes, <strong> ἐν</strong> will denote, as ἐν τῷ κρυπτῷ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:4">Matthew 6:4</span> , the <em> local department, in which</em> the βλέπειν takes place.

<p><strong> τότε</strong> = ὅταν ἔλθῃ τὸ τέλειον , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:10">1 Corinthians 13:10</span> ; ‘ <em> at the Lord’s coming, and after</em> .’
	</p>
<p><strong> πρόσωπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πρὸς πρόσωπ</strong> .] <strong> Face towards face</strong> , i.e. by immediate intuition: so Heb. in reff.

<p><strong> I shall thoroughly know even as I was</strong> (during this life: he places himself <em> in that state</em> , and uses the aor. as of a thing gone by) <strong> thoroughly known</strong> . In this life we <em> are known by</em> God, rather than <em> know</em> Him: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:9">Galatians 4:9</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:3">1 Corinthians 8:3</span> , note, and cf. Philo de Cherub. 32, vol. i. p. 159, νῦν ὅτε ζῶμεν , κρατούμεθα μᾶλλον ἢ ἄρχομεν , κ . γνωριζόμεθα μᾶλλον ἢ γνωρίζομεν . The sense of this aor. ἐπεγνώσθην must not be forced, as in E. V., to a present, or to a future, as by some Commentators.</p>
