<b> 13.</b>]<i> Superiority of Love to the other great Christian graces.</i>—Some gifts shall pass away,—but<i> these three</i> great graces<i> shall remain for ever,</i>—FAITH, HOPE, LOVE.<i> This is necessarily the meaning,—</i>and<i> not that love alone shall abide for ever, and the other two merely during the present state.</i> For (1) the words<b> but now</b> do not mean in this present state, as opposed to what has just been said, ver. 12,—but<i> as things have been shewn to be</i>,—at this stage of our argument:—and the inference from them is just the contrary of that implied in the other rendering: viz. that<i> since tongues, prophesyings, knowledge, will all pass away,</i> we have left<i> but</i> THESE THREE. (2) From the position of the verb<b> abideth</b>, it has a<i> strong emphasis</i>, and carries the weight of the clause, as opposed to the previously-mentioned things which<i> shall be done away.</i> (3) From the expression,<b> these three</b>, a<i> preeminence</i> is obviously pointed out for<i> faith</i>,<i> hope</i>, and<i> love</i>, distinct from aught which has gone before.—This being the plain sense of the words, how can<i> faith</i> and<i> hope</i> be said to endure to eternity, when faith will be lost in sight, and hope in fruition? With<i> hope</i>, there is but little difficulty:<i> but one place</i> has inscribed over its portals, “<i>Leave hope behind, all ye that enter here.</i>” New glories, new treasures of knowledge and of love, will ever raise, and nourish, blessed hopes of yet more and higher,—hopes which no disappointment will blight. But how can<i> faith</i> abide,—faith, which is the evidence of things<i> not seen</i>,—where all things once believed are seen? In the form of.<i> holy confidence and trust</i>, faith will abide even there. The stay of all conscious created being, human or angelie, is<i> dependence on God:</i> and where the faith which<i> comes by hearing</i> is out of the question, the faith which<i> consists in trusting</i> will be the only faith possible. Thus<i> Hope</i> will remain, as anticipation certain to be fulfilled:<i> Faith</i> will remain, as trust, entire and undoubting:—the anchor of the soul, even where no tempest comes.
