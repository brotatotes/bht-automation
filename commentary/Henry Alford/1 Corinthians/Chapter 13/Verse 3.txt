<b> 3.</b>] “The true and most significant sense is ‘though I dole away in mouthfuls all my property or estates.’ Who that has witnessed the almsgiving in a Catholic monastery, or the court of a Spanish or Sicilian bishop’s or archbishop’s palace, where immense revenues are syringed away in farthings to herds of beggars, but must feel the force of the Apostle’s half-satirical expression?” MS. note by Coleridge, quoted by Stanley.<br><br><b> give up my body that I may be burned</b>] So in Dan, iii. 28, “they yielded their bodies,” the Septuagint has, “to the burning,” but the Hebrew and A.V. omit this. See also 2 Macc. vii. 37. He evidently means in<i> self-sacrifice</i>: for country, or friends. Both the deeds mentioned in this verse are such as ordinarily are held to be the fruits of love, but they may be done<i> without it</i>, and if so are worthless. The variation indicated in the margin is the reading of three of our oldest MSS. It differs only by one letter from that in the text: the verb for “<i>be burned</i>” being “<i>kauthesōmai</i>,” that for “<i>boast</i>” being “<i>kauchesōmai.</i>” It is not easy to decide between the two. The objection to “<i>that I may boast</i>” seems to be that it introduces an irrelevant and confusing element, a<i> boastful motive</i>, into a set of hypotheses which put forward merely an act or set of acts on the one side, and the absence of love on the other, and indeed, worse still, that it makes an hypothesis which would reduce the self-sacrifice to nothing, and would<i> imply</i> the absence of love; and so would render the “<i>yet have not love</i>” unnecessary.
