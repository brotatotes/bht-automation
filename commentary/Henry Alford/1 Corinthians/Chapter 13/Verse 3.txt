 3. ] The double accus. after ψωμίζω is found in the reff. to LXX: but here the accus. of the  person is omitted, and left to be supplied from the context:  If I bestow in food all my substance . See the quotation from Coleridge in Stanley’s note.
	 παραδ  .   τὸ σῶμ  .   μ  .   ἵνα καυθ .] So ref. Dan., καὶ παρέδωκαν τὰ σώματα αὐτῶν εἰς ἐμπυρισμόν , LXX. Theod.: see also 2Ma 7:37 . He evidently means  in self-sacrifice : for country, or friends. Both the deeds mentioned in this verse are such as ordinarily are held to be the fruits of love, but they may be done  without it , and if so, are worthless. Stanley prefers καυχήσωμαι and Lachmann has edited it. The objections to it seem to me to be, (1) It leaves παραδῶ standing in a very vague and undefined meaning “deliver,  to what ?” (2) It introduces an irrelevant and confusing element, a  boastful motive , into a set of hypotheses which put forward merely an act or set of acts on the one side, and the absence of love on the other: and indeed, worse still, (3) it makes an hypothesis which would reduce the self-sacrifice to nothing, and would  imply the absence of love; and so would render ἀγάπην δὲ μὴ ἔχω unnecessary.
