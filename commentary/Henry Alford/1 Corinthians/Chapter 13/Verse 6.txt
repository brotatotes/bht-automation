<p><strong> 6.</strong> <strong> οὐ χ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐπὶ τῇ ἀδ</strong> <strong> .] rejoices not at (the) iniquity</strong> , i.e. at its commission by others, as is the habit of the unloving world.
	</p>
<p><strong> συγχαίρει τῇ ἀλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Most Commentators, as the E. V., altogether overlook the force of the verb and the altered construction, and render, ‘ <em> rejoiceth in the truth</em> :’ others, who respect the verb, make τῇ ἀληθ . = τοῖς εὐδοκιμοῦσι (Chrys.), those to whom, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:12">3 John 1:12</span> , μεμαρτύρηται ὑπ ʼ αὐτῆς τῆς ἀληθείας . But Meyer’s rendering is the only one which preserves the force of both words: <strong> rejoices with the Truth</strong> , ἡ ἀλήθ . being personified, and meaning especially <em> the spread among men</em> (as opposed to ἀδικία ) of <em> the Truth of the Gospel</em> , and indeed of <em> the truth in general</em> , in opposition to those who (ref. Rom.) τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἐν ἀδικίᾳ κατέχουσι , who (ref. 2 Tim.) ἀνθίστανται τῇ ἀληθείᾳ .</p>
