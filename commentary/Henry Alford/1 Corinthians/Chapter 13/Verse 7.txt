But unquestionably the time alluded to is that of<i> the coming of the Lord:</i> see ver. 12. and this applies to<i> all these</i>, not to the last (<i>knowledge</i>) only. The two first,<b> prophesyings</b> and<b> tongues</b>, shall be<i> absolutely</i> superseded:<b> knowledge</b><i> relatively</i>: the imperfect, by the perfect.
