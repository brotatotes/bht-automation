 1 13. ] THE PANEGYRIC OF LOVE;  as the principle without which all gifts are worthless (1 3):  its attributes (4 7):  its eternity (8 12):  its superior dignity to the other great Christian graces (13). Meyer quotes from Valcknaer, p. 299: “Sunt figuræ oratoriæ, quæ hoc caput illuminant, omnes sua sponte natæ in animo heroico, flagrante amore Christi et huic amori divino omnia postponente.” “It may,” he adds, “without impropriety be called ‘a Psalm of Love:’ ” the שִׁיר יְדִידֹת of the New Test. (see Psalms 45:0 title). “On each side of this chapter the tumult of argument and remonstrance still rages: but within it, all is calm: the sentences move in almost rhythmical melody: the imagery unfolds itself in almost dramatic propriety: the language arranges itself with almost rhetorical accuracy. We can imagine how the Apostle’s amanuensis must have paused to look up in his master’s face at the sudden change of his style of dictation, and seen his countenance lighted up as it had been the face of an angel, as the sublime vision of divine perfection passed before him.” Stanley.
