<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] <strong> εἰ τύχοι</strong> , <strong> if it should so happen</strong> , i.e. <strong> peradventure:</strong> it is commonly found with numerical nouns; but sometimes with hypothetical sentences in general, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:37">1 Corinthians 15:37</span> . See reff. and examples in Wetst. It will not bear the rendering ‘ <em> for example</em> ,’ though in meaning it nearly approaches it. It belongs here to <strong> τοσαῦτα</strong> , itself representing some fixed number, but not assignable by the information which the writer possesses, or not worth assigning. See similar expressions, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:8">Acts 5:8</span> , and 2Sa 12:8 in E. V.

But the common rendering is both simpler, and better sense: <strong> none of them is without signification</strong> , as E. V.: or, <strong> is inarticulate</strong> .</p>
