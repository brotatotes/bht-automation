 11. ]  οὖν ,  seeing that none is without meaning: for if any  were , the imputations following would not be just. We assume that a tongue which we do not understand  has a meaning , and that it is the way of expression of some  foreign nation .
	 βάρβαρος  , a foreigner , in the sense of one who is ignorant of the speech and habits of a people. So Ovid, Trist. 1 Corinthians 14:10 , ‘Barbarus hic ego sum, quia non intelligor ulli:’ and Herod. ii. 158, βαρβάρους δὲ πάντας οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι καλέουσι τοὺς μή σφισι ὁμογλώσσους . (Wetst.) The appellation always conveyed a certain contempt, and such is evidently intended here. So Ovid, in the next line, ‘Et rident stolidi verba Latina Getæ.’
	 ἐν ἐμοί ,  in my estimation : so Eurip. Hippol. 1335, σὺ δ ʼ ἔν τ ʼ ἐκείνῳ κἂν ἐμοὶ φαίνῃ κακός , ‘in his judgment and in mine:’ see Kühner, ii. 275.
