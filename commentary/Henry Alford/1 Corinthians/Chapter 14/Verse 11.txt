<p><strong> βάρβαρος</strong> <strong> , a foreigner</strong> , in the sense of one who is ignorant of the speech and habits of a people. So Ovid, Trist. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:10">1 Corinthians 14:10</span> , ‘Barbarus hic ego sum, quia non intelligor ulli:’ and Herod. ii. 158, βαρβάρους δὲ πάντας οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι καλέουσι τοὺς μή σφισι ὁμογλώσσους . (Wetst.) The appellation always conveyed a certain contempt, and such is evidently intended here. So Ovid, in the next line, ‘Et rident stolidi verba Latina Getæ.’

<p><strong> ἐν ἐμοί</strong> , <strong> in my estimation</strong> : so Eurip. Hippol. 1335, σὺ δ ʼ ἔν τ ʼ ἐκείνῳ κἂν ἐμοὶ φαίνῃ κακός , ‘in his judgment and in mine:’ see Kühner, ii. 275.</p>
