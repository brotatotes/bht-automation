 12. ]  Application of the analogy , as in 1 Corinthians 14:9 . The  οὕτως is evidently meant as in 1 Corinthians 14:9 , but is rendered somewhat difficult by the change of the construction into a direct exhortation. It is best therefore to suppose an ellipsis; and give to οὕτως the pregnant meaning,  after the lesson conveyed by this example . Meyer’s rendering,  since in such a manner (i.e. so as to be barbarians to one another)  ye also are emulous , &c., is very harsh, besides making the second clause, standing as it does without a μᾶλλον or any disjunctive particle, mean (and I do not see that it will bear any other meaning),  seek this βαρβαροφωνία  to the edifying of the Church .  Thus likewise ye (i.e. after the example of people who would not wish to be barbarians to one another, avoiding the absurdity just mentioned),  emulous as ye are of spiritual gifts (reff.),  seek them to the edifying of the church, that ye may abound : or  perhaps (but I can find no instance of ζητῶ ἵνα thus used: ch. 1Co 4:2 is no case in point, see note there) as in E. V. ‘  seek that ye may excel (abound in them)  to the edifying of the church .’
