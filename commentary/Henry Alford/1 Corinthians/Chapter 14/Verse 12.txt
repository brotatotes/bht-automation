<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] <em> Application of the analogy</em> , as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:9">1 Corinthians 14:9</span> . The <strong> οὕτως</strong> is evidently meant as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:9">1 Corinthians 14:9</span> , but is rendered somewhat difficult by the change of the construction into a direct exhortation. It is best therefore to suppose an ellipsis; and give to οὕτως the pregnant meaning, <em> after the lesson conveyed by this example</em> . Meyer’s rendering, <em> since in such a manner</em> (i.e. so as to be barbarians to one another) <em> ye also are emulous</em> , &amp;c., is very harsh, besides making the second clause, standing as it does without a μᾶλλον or any disjunctive particle, mean (and I do not see that it will bear any other meaning), <em> seek this</em> βαρβαροφωνία <em> to the edifying of the Church</em> . <strong> Thus likewise ye</strong> (i.e. after the example of people who would not wish to be barbarians to one another, avoiding the absurdity just mentioned), <strong> emulous as ye are of spiritual gifts</strong> (reff.), <strong> seek them to the edifying of the church, that ye may abound</strong> : or <em> perhaps</em> (but I can find no instance of ζητῶ ἵνα thus used: ch. 1Co 4:2 is no case in point, see note there) as in E. V. ‘ <em> seek that ye may excel</em> (abound in them) <em> to the edifying of the church</em> .’</p>
