(i. e. as our ‘<i>What then?</i>’ See Rom. iii. 9; vi. 15.— ‘What is my determination thereupon?’)—<b>I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray also with my mind</b> (i. e. will interpret my prayer for the benefit of myself and the church), &c. This resolution, or expression of self-obligation, evidently leads to the inference by and by clearly expressed, ver. 28, that<i> if he could not</i> pray with his mind, he would<i> keep silence.</i><br><br><b> I will sing</b>] hence we gather that the two departments in which the gift of tongues was exercised were<i> prayer and praise</i>. On the day of Pentecost it was confined to the latter of these.
