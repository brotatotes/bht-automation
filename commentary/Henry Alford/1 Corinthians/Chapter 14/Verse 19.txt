 19. ]  ἐκ ἐκκλησίᾳ ,  in (the) assembly, ‘in the congregation’ [this is the better rendering here, and wherever there is a chance of the word  church being mistaken as meaning a building], not ‘in  an assembly,’ as Meyer. The art. is omitted after a preposition: so Middleton, ch. vi. § 1; the logical account of which is, that the prep. serves to  categorize the substantive following it, and so make it general instead of particular.
	 οέλω  …,   ἤ , as βούλομαι , ἤ , 11. α . 117: similarly ἐπιθυμέω , ζητέω , see Hartung, ii. p. 72.
	 διὰ τοῦ νοός has probably been a correction, because  λαλεῖν τῷ νοΐ was found harsh, the understanding being only the indirect instrument.
