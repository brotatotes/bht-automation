<b> 21.</b>]<b> In the law</b> is here in the wider sense, as in John x. 84; xii. 34; xv. 25;—where the<i> Psalms</i> are thus quoted. The context of the passage quoted is thus: The scoffers in Jerusalem (see ver. 14) are introduced as scorning the simplicity of the divine commands, which were line upon line, precept upon precept, as if to children (vv. 9, 10). Jehovah threatens them that, since they would not hear these simple commands, He would speak to them by men of other tongues, viz. the Assyrians, their captors.—Here, as in many other cases, the historical sense is not so much considered, as the aptness of the expressions used for illustrating the matter in hand; viz. that belief would not be produced in the unbelieving by speaking to them in strange tongues.
