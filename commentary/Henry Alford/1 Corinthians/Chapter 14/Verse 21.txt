 21. ]  έν τῷ νόμῳ , as John 10:34 ; John 12:34 ; John 15:25 ; where the  Psalms are thus quoted. The passage stands in the LXX: διὰ φαυλισμὸν χειλέων , διὰ γλώσσης ἑτέρας ὅτι λαλήσουσι τῷ λαῷ τούταῳ … κ . οὐκ ἠθέλησαν ἀκούειν . The context is thus: The scoffers in Jerusalem (see 1Co 14:14 ) are introduced as scorning the simplicity of the divine commands, which were line upon line, precept upon precept, as if to children ( 1Co 14:9-10 ). Jehovah threatens them that, since they would not hear these simple commands, He would speak to them by men of other tongues, viz. the Assyrians, their captors.
	Here as in many other cases, the historical sense is not so much considered, as the aptness of the expressions used for illustrating the matter in hand; viz. that belief would not be produced in the unbelieving by speaking to them in strange tongues. The ὅτι answers in the LXX to כִּי , ‘  for ;’ or ‘  yea verily ,’ as Louth. It forms part of the citation, not of the text.
	 ἐν ἑτερ .]  in (in the person of)  men of other tongues : Heb.  with another tongue ; and it is placed  second . The Apostle personifies it and gives it the prominence.
	 ἐν χ  .   ἑτ  . ]  in (as speaking in, using as the organ of speech)  lips of others (strangers, see reff.): Heb.  in (by)  stammerers of lip : Louth,  with a stammering lip .
	 τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ ] in Isa.,  the Israelites : here taken generally for the unbelieving world.
	 οὐδ  ʼ   οὕτως εἰσακούσ .] This is the point of the passage for St. Paul’s argument: see 1 Corinthians 14:23 : “for them, and not for us: but  even for them , profitless in the main:”  not even under such circumstances will they listen to me: even this sign will be for them ineffectual.
