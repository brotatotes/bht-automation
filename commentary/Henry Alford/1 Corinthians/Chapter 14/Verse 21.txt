<b> 21.</b>]<b> In the law</b> is here in the wider sense, as in John x. 84; xii. 34; xv. 25;—where the<i> Psalms</i> are thus quoted. The context of the passage quoted is thus: The scoffers in Jerusalem (see ver. 14) are introduced as scorning the simplicity of the divine commands, which were line upon line, precept upon precept, as if to children (vv. 9, 10). Jehovah threatens them that, since they would not hear these simple commands, He would speak to them by men of other tongues, viz. the Assyrians, their captors.—Here, as in many other cases, the historical sense is not so much considered, as the aptness of the expressions used for illustrating the matter in hand; viz. that belief would not be produced in the unbelieving by speaking to them in strange tongues.<br><br><b> With</b> (literally, in: in the person of)<b> men of other tongues</b>: A.V., and Hebrew, have it<i> with another tongue;</i> and it is placed<i> second</i>. The Apostle personifies it, and gives it the prominence.<br><br><b> in</b> (as speaking in, using as the organ of speech)<b> lips of others</b> (strangers, see ref.). Hebrew, ‘<i>in</i> (by)<i> stammerers of lip</i>:’ A.V. ‘<i>with stammering lips.</i>’<br><br><b> unto this people</b>] in Isa.,<i> the Israelites:</i> here taken generally for the unbelieving world. v<br><br><b> for all that they will not hear me</b>] This is the point of the passage for St. Paul’s argument: see yer. 23:— “for them, and not for us: but even for them, protitless in the main:”—<i>not even under such circumstances will</i><i> they listen to me: even this sign</i> will be for them ineffectual.
