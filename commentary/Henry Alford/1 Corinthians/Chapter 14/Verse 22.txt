<b> 22.</b>]<b> So then,</b> viz. according to the words of the foregoing prophetic passage.<br><br><b> the tongues</b>, in the<i> then</i> acceptation of the term. He is not interpreting the prophecy, nor alluding to the tongues<i> there</i> spoken of, but returns back to the subject in hand—<i>the tongues</i> about which his argument was concerned:<br><br><b> are for a sign:</b> but there is no emphasis on the words,—the meaning being much the same as if “<i>for a sign</i>” were omitted, and it stood “<i>so then the tongues are not for,”&c.</i> Not seeing this, Commentators have differed widely about the meaning of the word<b> sign</b>. But all dwelling on this word would introduce an element foreign to the argument, which is,<i> that tongues are</i> (sign)<i> for the unbelieving, not for the believing.</i><br><br><b> not to them that believe, but to unbelievers,</b> i.e. ‘men who do not believe;’ not, as Neander, and others, ‘men who<i> will</i> not believe;’ the word “<i>unbelievers</i>” must be kept to the same sense through this whole passage, and plainly by ver. 23, it is<i> not one who</i> will<i> not believe</i>, but<i> an unbeliever</i>,<i> open to conviction.</i> The mistake has been occasioned by regarding<i> those to whom the prophecy was directed</i>, and interpreting Paul by Isaiah, instead of by himself.<br><br> Prophecy, i. e,<i> inspired and intelligent exposition of the word and doctrine,</i> was eminently<i> for</i> believers, but, as below, would be also profitable<i> to</i> unbelievers, furnishing a token that God was truly among his assembled servants.
