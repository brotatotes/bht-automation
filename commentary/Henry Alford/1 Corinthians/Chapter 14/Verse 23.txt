It is obvious that the hypothesis of  all being assembled, and  all having the gift, must not be pressed to infer that no such ἰδιώτης could be found: no one hypothesizes thus rigidly. If any will have it so, then, as Meyer, we may suppose the ἰδιῶται to come  from another congregation : but the whole difficulty seems to me mere trifling.
