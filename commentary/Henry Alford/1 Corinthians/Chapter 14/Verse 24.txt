<b> 24.</b>]<b> But if all</b> (see above)<b> prophesy</b> (i. e. intelligibly lay forth, in the power of the Spirit, the Christian word and doctrine),<b> and there enter any</b> (singular now, setting forth that this would be the effect<i> in any case:</i> plural<i> before</i>, to shew that however many there might be,<i> not one could appreciate the gift</i>)<b> unbeliever or plain man</b> (the<i> unbeliever</i> is mentioned<i> first now,</i> because the great stress is on the power of prophecy<br><br> in its greatest achievement, the<i> conversion of the unbeliever;</i> but<i> the private persons</i> were first<i> before</i>, because the stress there was on the unprofitableness of tongues,<i> not only to the unbeliever, but to</i> the<i> “plain men”</i> also),<b> he is convicted by all</b> (the inspired discourse penetrating, as below, into the depths of his heart,—by<i> all</i>, i.e. by each in turn):<b> he is searched into by all</b> (each inspired speaker opening to him his character):<b> the hidden things of his heart become manifest</b> (those things which he had never before seen are revealed,—his whole hitherto unrecognized personal character laid out. Instances of such revelations of a man to himself by powerful preaching have often occurred, even since the cessation of the prophetic gift):<b> and thus</b> (thus convicted, searched, revealed to himself:—in such a state of mind)<b> having fallen on his face he will worship God, announcing</b> (<i>by that his act,</i> which is a public submission to the divine Power manifest among you: or, but not. so well,<i> aloud,</i> by declaration of it in words)<b> that of a truth</b> (implying that previously he had regarded the presence of God among, them as an idle tale; or, if a plain Christian, had not sufficiently realized it)<b> God is among you</b> (or in each of you: by His Spirit).—In this last description the “<i>private person</i>” is thrown into the background, and (see above) the greater achievement of prophecy, the conviction and conversion of the unbeliever, is chietly in view. “For a similar effect of the disclosure of a man’s secret self to himself, compare the fascination described as exercised by Socrates over his hearers by the ‘conviction” and ‘judgment’ of his questions in the Athenian market-place. Grote’s Hist. of Greece, 609–611.” Stanley.
