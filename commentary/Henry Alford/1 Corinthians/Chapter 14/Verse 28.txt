But this would exclude the possibility of <em> others</em> interpreting, which we know from ch. 1Co 12:10 might be the case. And thus the preceding εἷς could hardly bear its proper meaning. Wieseler tries to make it mean ‘ <em> one at a time</em> .’ Besides, the emphatic position of ᾖ seems to require more stress than this sense would give, which would be better expressed by ἐὰν δὲ διερμηνευτὴς μὴ ᾖ ), <strong> let him</strong> (the speaker in a tongue, see reff.) <strong> be silent in the church: but</strong> (as if σιγάτω had been μὴ λαλείτω ) <strong> let him speak for himself and for God</strong> : i.e. in private, with only himself and God to witness it. Chrys. καθ ʼ ἑαυτὸν φθεγγέσθω : which Theophyl. enlarges to τουτέστιν ἀψοφητὶ καὶ ἠρέμα καθ ʼ ἑαυτόν : which does not seem to agree with λαλείτω , the <em> speaking</em> being essential to the exercise of the gift.</p>
