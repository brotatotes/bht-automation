<b> 33.</b>]<i> Reason of the above regulations.</i> The premiss,<i> that the church is God’s church</i>, is suppressed. He is the God of peace, not confusion: therefore those assemblies which are His, must be peacefully and orderly conducted. And this character of God is not one dependent for its truth on preconceived views of Him:—we have a proof of it wherever a church of the saints has been gathered together. ‘<i>In all the churches of the saints</i>, God is a God of peace: let Him not<i> among you</i> be supposed to be a God of confusion” I am compelled to depart from the majority of modern critics of note, who join these words, “<i>As in all the churches of the saints,</i>” with what follows,—and to adhere to the common arrangement of this latter clause. My reason is, that taken as beginning the next paragraph, the clause would be harsh beyond example, and superfluous, as anticipating the reason about to be given, “<i>for it is not permitted,</i>”&c. Besides which, it is more in accordance with St. Paul’s style, to place the main subject of a new sentence first, see 1 Tim. iii. 8, 11, 12; and we have an example of reference to general usage coming in last, in aid of other considerations, ch. xi. 16: but it seems unnatural that it should be placed first in the very forefront of a matter on which he has so much to say.
