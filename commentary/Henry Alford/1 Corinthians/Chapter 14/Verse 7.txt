<p><strong> 7.</strong> ] <strong> ὅμως</strong> occurs here and in the two other places where it is used in the N. T. (reff.) at the beginning of the sentence, out of its logical order, which would be before ἐὰν διαστολὴν …, thus: <strong> Things without life which yield sound, whether flute or harp, yet, if they do not</strong> , &amp;c.
	</p>
<p>The renderings, ‘ <em> even</em> things without life’ (E. V.), or ‘things which, though without life, yet give sound’ (Winer, edn. 6, § 61. 5. f.), are inadmissible, the former because of the usage of ὅμως the latter because no such idea as any surprise at a thing without life yielding sound is here in place.

<p><strong> ἐὰν διαστ</strong> <strong> .] If they</strong> (the ἄψυχα φ . δ .) <strong> shall not have yielded a distinction</strong> (of musical intervals) <strong> in their tones, how shall be known that which is being played on the flute or that which is being played on the harp</strong> (i.e. <em> what tune is played</em> in either case: the art. being repeated to shew that two distinct instances are contemplated, not necessarily ‘ <em> one tune, either piped, or harped</em> ’ = τὸ αὐλούμενον ἢ κιθαριζόμενον ;)? The observation of Meyer, that this example is decisive against <em> foreign languages</em> being spoken in the exercise of this gift, is shewn to be irrelevant by the next example, from which the contrary might be argued the ἄδηλος φωνή of the trumpet being exactly analogous to an <em> unknown language</em> , not to an <em> inarticulate sound</em> . But the fact is that all such inferences, from pressing analogies close, are insecure.</p>
