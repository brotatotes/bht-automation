<b> 7.</b>] The renderings, ‘<i>even</i> things without life’ (A. V.), or ‘things which, though without life, yet give sound,’ are inadmissible.<br><br> Literally,<b> If they shall not have yielded a distinction</b> (of musical intervals)<b> in their tones, how shall be known that which is being played on the flute, or that which is being played on the harp</b> (i. e.<i> what tune is played</i> in either case: repetition being made to shew that two distinct instances are contemplated, not necessarily ‘<i>one tune, either</i><i> piped, or harped</i>’)<b>?</b> The observation of Meyer, that this example is decisive against<i> foreign languages</i> being spoken in the exercise of this gift, is shewn to be irrelevant by the next example, from which the contrary might be argued—the<i> uncertain sound</i> of the trumpet being exactly analogous to an<i> unknown language</i>, not to an<i> inarticulate sound</i>. But the fact is that all such inferences, from pressing analogies close, are insecure.
