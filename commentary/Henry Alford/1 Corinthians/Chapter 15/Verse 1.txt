<b>I make known:</b> not, as most Commentators, ‘<i>I remind you,</i>’ nor, ‘<i>I direct your attention to</i>’ (both which meanings are inadmissible, from the usage of the word); but as text,<b> I make known,</b> i.e. ‘<i>make known anew:</i>’ not without some intimation of surprise, and reproach to them:—<b>the (whole) gospel;</b> not merely the Death and Resurrection of Christ, which were primary parts of it; the reproach still continues; as if he had said, ‘I am constrained to begin again, and declare to you the whole gospel which I preached to you.’
