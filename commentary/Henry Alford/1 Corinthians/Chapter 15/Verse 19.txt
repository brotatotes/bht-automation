It has perhaps not been enough seen that there are here  two emphases , and that μόνον belongs to the aggregate of both. According to the ordinary interpretation, ‘If  in this life only we have hope in Christ …,’ it would be implied that in reality we  shall have hope in Christ in another state also, which would not agree with the perfect ἠλπικότες ἐσμέν . The right arrangement of the Greek gives the key to the sentence: εἰ ( ἐν τῇ ζωῇ ταύτῃ ἐν χριστῷ ἠλπικότες ἐσμὲν ) μόνον , ‘if all we have done is merely  having hoped in Christ in this life ,’ ‘if it is there to end, and that hope have no result …’
