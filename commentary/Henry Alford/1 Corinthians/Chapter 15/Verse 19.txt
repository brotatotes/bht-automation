<b> 19.</b>] Assuming this<i> perdition</i> of the dead in Christ, the state of Christians is indeed miserable. It has perhaps not been enough seen that there are here<i> two emphases</i>, and that<b> only</b> belongs to the aggregate of both. According to the ordinary interpretation, ‘If<i> in this life</i><i> only</i> we have hope in Christ...,’ it would be implied that in reality we s<i> hall have</i> hope in Christ in another state also, which would not agree with the perfect tense,<b> we have had hope.</b> The right arrangement gives the key to the sentence: ‘If only [in this life we have had hope in<br><br> Christ],’ i.e., ‘if all we have done is merely<i> having hoped in Christ in this life,</i>’ ‘if it is there to end, and that hope have no result...’—The perfect tense,<b> we have had hope</b>, implies the endurance of the hope through our lives.<br><br> Literally,<b> we are more to be pitied</b> (more miserable)<b> than all men</b>, viz. because they, all other men, live at ease,—we on the contrary are ever exposed to danger and death: because our hope is more intense than that of all others, and leads us to forego more: and to be disappointed<i> in it</i>, would be the height of misery.
