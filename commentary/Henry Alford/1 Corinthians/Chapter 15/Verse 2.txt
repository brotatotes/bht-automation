which also ye received</b>] The thrice repeated also indicates a climax:—<b>which ye also received, in which moreover ye stand, by means of which ye are even being saved</b> (in the course of salvation).<br><br> Literally,<b> if ye hold fast, with what discourse I preached to you.</b> He is speaking of the<i> import</i>, not of the<i> grounds</i> ot his preaching: for<i> of this</i> he reminds them below, not<i> of the arguments.</i><br><br><b> unless ye believed</b>] The only chance if you hold fast what I have taught you, of your missing salvation, is the hardly supposable one, that your<i> faith is vain</i>, and the gospel a fable; see ver. 14, of which this is an anticipation:<b>—unless</b> (perchance)<b> ye believed</b> (not as A.V. ‘<i>have believed,</i>’ which confuses the idea: it is, ‘<i>became believers</i>’)<b> in vain.</b> So Chrysostom, who remarks: “At first he says this softly and cautiously, but he kindles as he goes on, and presently bares his head and shouts out, ‘If Christ is not risen, &c.’” This explanation of the words appears to me the only tenable one. Some understand them of a<i> vain and dead faith</i>, which the Apostle will not suppose them to have. But surely if the previously expressed condition, not holding fast what they had heard, were fulfilled, their faith<i> could not be vain or dead;</i> and again the accurate rendering of the verb is against this interpretation:<b> unless ye became believers in vain</b>, not, “<i>unless, faith has been a vain one.</i>” A still further reason is, the parallelism of “<i>believed in vain</i>” here and “<i>so ye believed,</i>” ver. 11: leading to the inference that the term “<i>in vain</i>” here relates not to the subjective insufficiency of their faith, but to the (hypothetical) objective nullity of that on which their faith was founded.
