<b> 20.</b>]<b> now</b>, ‘as matters now stand:’ see note on ch. xiii. 13.<br><br><b> as</b> (the)<b> firstfruits of them that sleep</b>] The sense is, ‘Christ, in rising from the dead, is but the firstling or earnest of the resurrection of the whole number of those that sleep.’ There does not appear to be any intended reference to the legal ordinance of the firstfruits (Lev. xxiii. 10, 11): but however general the application of the analogy may be, it ean hardly fail to have been suggested to the mind of a Jew by the Levitical ordinances, especially as our Lord rose on the very morrow after the Paschal Sabbath, when (l. c.) the firstfruits were offered.<br><br><b> of them that sleep</b>] from the logical connexion, should mean, not the dead<i> in Christ,</i> but<i> all the dead;</i> see next verse: but it is the<i> Christian dead</i> who are before the Apostle’s mind.
