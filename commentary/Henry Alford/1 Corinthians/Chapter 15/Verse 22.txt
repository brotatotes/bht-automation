<b> 22.</b>] (2)<i> In that He is</i> (and here the fact of His being the Lord of Life and Righteousness, and the second and spiritual Head of our nature, are assumed)<i> to us the bringer-in of</i> LIFE,<i> as Adam was the bringer-in of</i> DEATH.<br><br><b> in Adam... in Christ</b>]<b> in community with</b>, as partakers in a common nature with<b> Adam</b> and<b> Christ:</b> who are respectively the sources,<i> to the whole of that nature</i> (<b>all</b> men),<i> of death,</i> and<i> life,</i> i.e.<i> (here) physical death,</i> and<i> rescue from physical death.</i> The practice of St. Paul to<i> insulate the objects of his present attention</i> from all ulterior considerations, must be carefully here borne in mind. The antithesis is<i> merely</i> between the bringing in of death by Adam, and of life (its opposite) by Christ. No<i> consequence</i>, whether on the side of death or of life, is brought into consideration. That death physical involved death eternal—that life eternal (in its only worthy sense) involves bliss eternal, is not so much as thought of, while the two great opposites, Death and Life, are under consideration. This has been missed by many Interpreters, and the reasoning thereby marred. But the ancients, and the best of the moderns, keep to the<i> universal</i> reference. Theophylact’s note is clear and striking: “He adds the argument by which what has been said is confirmed. It was needful, he says, for the same nature which was defeated, itself to triumph, and for him who was stricken, himself to be victorious. For in Adam, i.e. because of Adam’s transgression, all men fell under death; and therefore in like manner in Christ all shall rise again: i.e. because Christ was found sinless, and not subject to death, because He died voluntarily, and rose again, because it was not possible that He should be holden of death, being the Prince of Life.’ See on the great antithesis, Rom. v. 12 ff., and notes.
