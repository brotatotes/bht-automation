<p><strong> 22</strong> .] (2) <em> In that He is</em> (and here the fact of His being the Lord of Life and Righteousness, and the second and spiritual Head of our nature, is assumed) <em> to us the bringer-in of</em> LIFE, <em> as Adam was the bringer-in of</em> DEATH.

<p><strong> ἐν τῷ Ἀδ</strong> <strong> ., </strong> <strong> ἐν τῷ χριστῷ</strong> ] <strong> in community with</strong> , as partakers in a common nature with, <strong> Adam</strong> and <strong> Christ</strong> : who are respectively the sources, <em> to the whole of that nature</em> ( πάντες ), of <em> death</em> , and <em> life</em> , i.e. ( <em> here</em> ) <em> physical death</em> , and <em> rescue from physical death</em> . The practice of Paul to <em> insulate the objects of his present attention</em> from all ulterior considerations, must be carefully here borne in mind. The antithesis is <em> merely</em> between the bringing in of death by Adam, and of life (its opposite) by Christ. No <em> consequence</em> , whether on the side of death or of life, is brought into consideration. That death physical involved death eternal that life eternal (in its only worthy sense) involves bliss eternal, is not so much as thought of, while the two great opposites, Death and Life, are under consideration. This has been missed by many Interpreters, and the reasoning thereby marred. But the ancients, Chrys., Theophyl., Theodoret, Œcum., and Olsh., De Wette, and Meyer, keep to the <em> universal</em> reference. Theophylact’s note is clear and striking: αἰτίαν προστίθησι δι ʼ ἧς πιστοῦται τὰ εἰρημένα · ἔδει γάρ , φησιν , αὐτὴν νικῆσαι τὴν ἡττηθεῖσαν φύσιν , καὶ τὸν καταβληθέντα , αὐτὸν ἐκνικῆσαι · καὶ γὰρ ἐν τῷ Ἀδάμ , τουτέστι διὰ τὸ τοῦ Ἀδὰμ πταῖσμα , πάντες τῷ θανάτῳ ὑπέπεσον · οὕτως οὖν ἐν χριστῷ πάντες ἀναστήσονται · τουτέστι διὰ τὸ εὑρεθῆναι τὸν χριστὸν ἀναμάρτητον κ . ἀνένοχον τῷ θανάτῳ , καὶ ἑκόντα μὲν ἀποθανεῖν , ἀναστῆναι δέ , καθὸ οὐκ ἦν δυνατὸν αὐτὸν κρατεῖσθαι ὑπὸ τῆς φθορᾶς , τὸν ἀρχηγὸν τῆς ξωῆς .
