<b> 23.</b>]<i> But in this universal Resurrection</i> ALL SHALL NOT HOLD THE SAME RANK. The word used does not mean<i> order of priority,</i> but rank, or ‘<i>troop in an army.</i>’ The three ranks are<i> mentioned in order of priority</i>, but this does not constitute their distinctive character: Christ is the<i> firstfruits</i>—this is His<i> own rank</i>, see Col. i. 18:—<i>they that are Christ’s</i> follow at His coming, who are the<i> lump</i> (as understood by the context, and implied by the term<i> firstfruits</i>), in the proper and worthiest sense, made like unto Him and partaking of His glory; then (after how long or how short a time is not declared, and seems to have formed no part of the revelations to St. Paul, but was afterwards revealed,—see Rey. xx. 4–6: compare also 1 Thess. iv. 15–17) shall come THE END, viz. the resurrection of the rest of the dead, here veiled over by the general term,<b> the end</b>,—that resurrection not being in this argument specially treated, but only that of Christians. The<i> key</i> to the understanding of this passage is to be found in the prophecy of our Lord, Matt. xxiv. xxv., but especially in the latter chapter. The resurrection and judgment of<i> them that are</i><i> Christ’s</i> forming the subject of vv. 1–30 there, and<b> the end</b>,—the great final gathering of<i> all the nations</i>, of vv. 31–46.<br><br><b> the firstfruits</b>, therefore necessarily<i> the first</i><b> rank:</b> and hence the word stands first.<br><br><b> they that are Christ’s</b>] The same as “<i>the dead in Christ,</i>” 1 Thess. iv. 16, No mention occurs here of any<i> judgment</i> of these his<i> own servants</i>, as in Matt. xxv., for it does not belong to the present subject.<br><br><b> at his coming</b>] Literally, “<b>in</b><i> his coming,</i>” as<i> forming part of, involved in</i>, His appearing,—which, as the great event of the time, includes their resurrection in it. It ought to be needless to remind the student of the distinction between this “coming of Christ” and the final judgment: it is here peculiarly important to bear it in mind.
