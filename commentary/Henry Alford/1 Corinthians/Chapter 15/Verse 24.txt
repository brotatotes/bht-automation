<b> 24. Then</b>] next in succession, introducing the third rank,—see above.<br><br><b> the end</b>]<b> the end</b><i> of all:</i> not the end<i> of the resurrection</i>, as some:—nor,<i> of this present world</i>, as Chrysostom and others,—which properly happens at the coming of Christ: nor exactly of the<i> Kingdom of Christ,</i> as Grotius and Billroth: but generally THE END, when all shall be accomplished, the bringing in and fulness of the kingdom by the subjugation of the last enemy, the whole course of the mediatorial work of Christ, the salvation of the elect; the time indicated by Matt. xxv. ult.:<br><br><b> when he</b> (Christ)<b> delivereth up</b> (the present tense is used for that which is certainly attached to the event as its accompaniment. When is literally whenever, indicating the uncertainty of the time when)<b> the kingdom to God and the Father</b>, i.e., to him who is God and His Father.—Then the rest of the section as far as ver. 28, is in explanation of the giving up the kingdom. And it rests on this weighty verity: THE KINGDOM oF CHRIST<i> over this world</i>, in its beginning, its furtherance, and its completion, has one great end,—THE GLORIFICATION OF THE FATHER BY THE SON.<i> Therefore</i>, when it shall be fully established, every enemy overcome, every thing subjected to Him, He will,—not, reign over it and abide its King, BUT DELIVER IT UP TO THE FATHER. Hence, as in ver. 25, His reign will endure, not like that of earthly kings, WHEN HE shall have put all enemies under His feet, but only TILL He shall have, &c.,—and then will be absorbed in the all-pervading majesty of Him for whose glory it was from first to last carried onward. It may be observed (1) that the whole of this respects the mediatorial work and kingdom: the work of redemption, and that Lordship over dead and living, for which Christ both died and rose. Consequently nothing is here said which can affect either (1) His co-equality and co-eternity with the Father in the Godhead, which is prior to and independent of this mediatorial work, and is not limited to the mediatorial kingdom: or (2) the eternity of His Humanity: for that Humanity ever was and is subordinate to the Father; and it by no means follows that when the mediatorial kingdom shall be given up to the Father, the Humanity in which that kingdom was won, shall be put off: nay, the very fact of Christ in the body being the firstfruits of the resurrection, proves that His body, as ours, will endure for ever: as the truth that our humanity, even in glory, can only subsist before God<i> by virtue of</i> HIS Humanity, makes it plain that He will be VERY MAN to all eternity,<br><br><b> the kingdom</b>] That kingdom, which in its fullest sense is then<i> first</i> His. At this very time of<i> the end</i>, Matt. xxv. 34, He first calls Himself by the title of THE KING. The name will no sooner be won, than laid at the feet of the Father, thus completing by the last great act of Redemption the obedience which he manifested in his Incarnation, and in His death.<br><br><b> all rule, &c.,</b> not<i> only hostile</i> power and government, but as the<i> context necessitates</i>, ALL power. Christ being manifested as universal King,<i> every</i> power co-ordinate with His must come under the category of<i> hostile</i>: all<i> kings</i> shall submit to Him: the<i> kingdoms</i> of the world shall become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of His Christ:—and see the similar expressions Eph. i. 21, where speaking by anticipation, the Apostle clearly indicates that<i> legitimate</i> authorities, all the powers that he, are included. Compare by all means Rev. xi. 15.
