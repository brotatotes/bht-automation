 27 .]  Scriptural proof of the above declaration .
	 ὑπέταξ . viz., from the Psalm, GOD,  the Father .
	See on the Psalm itself, Hebrews 2:6 ff. notes.
	 εἴπῃ , scil. ὁ θεός , the same subject as ὑπέταξεν . Meyer alone, as it seems to me, gives the right construction of ὅταν … ὑποτέτακται . “The aor. εἴπῃ must be rendered regularly, not in the  present sense, but as a  futurum exactum : see Luke 6:26 ; Plato, Parm. p. 143, c ( τί δ ʼ ὅταν εἴπω οὐσία τε καὶ ἕν , ἆρα οὐκ ἀμφοτέρω ;), Ion, p. 535, B ( ὅταν εὖ εἴπῃς ἔπη καὶ ἐκπλήξῃς μάλιστα τοὺς θεωμένους ). The time referred to, is that when the as yet unfulfilled πάντα ὑπέταξεν shall be fulfilled and completed: hence it is no longer the aor., but the perf. ὑποτέτακται . The meaning then is: ‘when God, who in Psa 8:6 has announced the ὑπόταξις , shall hereafter have declared that this ὑπόταξις is  come to pass ,’ … This  form of expression was suggested to the Apostle by his having already expressed himself in the words of a  saying of God .” I render then,  But when God shall have declared that all things have been subjected to Him, it is evident that they have been subjected (ellipsis of the predicate of the foregoing sentence after δῆλον ὅτι and οἶδ ʼ ὅτι is common; so Plato, Gorg. p. 475, c, ‘ οὐκοῦν κακῷ ὑπερβάλλον τὸ ἀδικεῖν κάκιον ἂν εἴη τοῦ ἀδικεῖσθαι ,’ ‘ δῆλον δὴ ὅτι ,’ scil. κάκιον ἂν εἴη . Kühner, § 852, d)  with the exception of Him who subjected all things to Him.
