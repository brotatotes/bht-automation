<b> 28.</b>] On the sense, see above. “The interpretations, that<i> subjection</i> is only an hyperbolical expression for the<i> entire harmony of Christ with the Father</i> (Chrysostom and others): the limitation of it to His human nature (Theodoret, Augustine, and others), with the<i> declarative</i> explanation that it will then<i> become plain to all,</i><i> that Christ even in regard of His kingship is, on the side of His Humanity, dependent</i><i> on the Father,</i>—and the addition,<i> that Christ will then in his divine nature reign with the Father</i> (so Calvin): the interpretation (of the words<b> the Son Himself</b>!), as referring to Christ’s<i> mystical Body</i>, i.e.<i> the Church</i> (Theodoret),—are idle subterfuges.” De Wette. The refutation of these and all other attempts to explain away the doctrine here plainly asserted, of the<i> ultimate subordination of the Son, is</i> contained in the three precise and unambiguous words,<b> the Son Himself.</b><br><br><b> that God</b> (alone)<b> may be all [things] in all</b>,—i. e. recognized as sole Lord and King: “all things will be subordinated to the Son,—the Son to the Father.” Bengel.
