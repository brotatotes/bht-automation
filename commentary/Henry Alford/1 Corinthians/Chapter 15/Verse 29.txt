<b> 29.</b>]<b> Else</b> resumes the main argument, which has been interrupted by the explanation since ver. 23 of “<i>each in his own order.</i>” After it is an ellipsis of ‘if it be as the adversaries suppose.’<br><br><b> what shall they do</b>] There is in these words a tacit reprehension of the practice about to be mentioned, which it is hardly possible altogether to miss. Both by the third person and by the words they which are, he indirectly separates himself and those to whom he is writing from participation in or approval of the practice:—the meaning being,<b> what will become of</b>— ‘what account can they give of their practice?’<br><br> The participle is<i> present</i>,<b> those who are</b> [<b>in the habit of being</b>]<b> baptized</b>—not past, “<i>those who have been baptized.</i>” The distinction is important as affecting the interpretation. See below.<br><br><b> on behalf of the dead</b>] viz.<i> the same</i><b> dead</b> who are spoken of in the next clause and throughout the chapter as the subjects of<i> the resurrection</i>—not<i> dead</i> in any figurative sense.<br><br><b> the</b><i> dead</i>, the article marking the particular dead persons on behalf of whom the act took place. Before we pass to the explanation, it will be well to go through the next question:<b> If dead men are not raised at all, why do they trouble themselves to be baptized for them</b> (so, and not as in A.V., is the sentence to be arranged)? Thus much being said as to the plain meaning of the words used, there can be no doubt as to their interpretation. The only<i> legitimate reference</i> is, to a practice, not otherwise known to us, not mentioned here with any approval by the Apostle, not generally prevalent, but in use by some, of<i> survivors allowing themselves to be baptized on behalf of</i> (believing?)<i> friends who had died without baptism.</i> With the subsequent similar practices of the Cerinthians and Marcionites this may or may not have been connected. All we clearly see from the text, is that it unquestionably<i> did exist</i>. The other principal interpretations are discussed in my Greek Test. Bengel well says that “even to catalogue all of them would require a dissertation.” I may briefly say here that all labour under one of the following fatal faults, either: (1) they make the word<b> dead</b> figurative in meaning; (2) they give an unnatural sense to<b> for</b>, or<b> in behalf of;</b> or (3) they make the appeal to refer to some feature common to the baptism of all Christians. The only justifiable rendering, as given above, is adopted by Ambrose, and by Anselm, Erasmus, Grotius, &c., and recently by some of the principal modern expositors. The ordinary objection to it is, that thus the Apostle would be giving his sanction to a superstitious usage, or at all events mentioning it without reprobation. But this is easily answered, by remembering that if the above view is correct, he does<i> not</i> mention it without a slur on it;—and more completely still, by observing that he thus uses a custom which otherwise would displease him, to shew the untenableness of the error which he is combating: reserving, perhaps, the reprehension of the practice for its proper season. Stanley’s concluding remarks are worth quoting: “On the whole, therefore, this explanation of the passage (<i>that given above</i>) may be safely accepted, (1) as exhibiting a curious relic of primitive superstition, which, after having, as the words imply (?), prevailed generally in the apostolic church, gradually dwindled away till it was only to be found in some obscure sects, where it lost its original significance: (2) as containing an example of the Apostle’s mode of dealing with a practice, with which he could have no real sympathy; not condemning or ridiculing it, but appealing to it as an expression, however distorted, of their better feelings.”
