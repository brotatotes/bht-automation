 3.  ἐν πρώτοις ]  in primis , with relation not to order of time (as Chrys.: ἐξ ἀρχῆς ), but to  importance (as Theophyl.: οἱονεὶ γὰρ θεμέλιός ἐστι πάσης τῆς πίστεως ). So Plato, Rep. vii. 6; p. 522: τοῦτο τὸ κοινὸν .… ὃ καὶ παντὶ ἐν πρώτοις ἀνάγκη μανθάνειν .
	 ὃ καὶ παρέλαβον ] viz. (see ch. 1Co 11:23 and note)  from the Lord himself , by special revelation. Before his conversion he may have known the bare fact of the  death of Jesus, but the nature and reason of that Death he had to learn from revelation: the Resurrection he regarded as a fable, but revelation informed him of its reality, and its accordance with prophecy. On the following clauses, ‘the earliest known specimen of what may be termed the creed of the early Church,’ see Stanley’s notes, and [his] dissertation at the end of the section.
	 ὑπὲρ τ  .   ἁμ  .   ἡμ .] ON BEHALF OF OUR SINS: viz. to atone for them. Meyer makes the important remark, that this use of ὑπέρ with  τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμ . shews, that when Paul uses it in speaking of Christ’s sufferings with  ἡμῶν  only , he  does not mean by it ‘loco nostri.’ He also quotes from Buttmann (Index to Meidias, p. 188), on the distinction between ὑπέρ and περί : “id unum interest, quod περί usu frequentissimo teritur, multo rarius usurpatur ὑπέρ , quod ipsum discrimen inter Lat. præp.  de et  super locum obtinet.”
	It may be noticed, that in 3 Kings 1 Corinthians 16:19 , where it is said that Zimri ἀπέθανεν ὑπὲρ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτοῦ ὧν ἐποίησεν , it is for his own sins, as their punishment, that he died. So that ὑπέρ  may bear the meaning that Christ’s death was the punishment of the sins of that our nature which he took upon Him. But its undoubtedly inclusive vicarious import in other passages where ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν and the like occur, seems to rule it to have that sense here also.
	 κατὰ τὰς γρ .] This applies to Christ’s  Death, Burial , and  Resurrection on the third day : see reff.
