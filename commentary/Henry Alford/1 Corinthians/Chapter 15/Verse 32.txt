<b> 32.</b>] The stress of the first clause is on the words<b> after the manner of men</b>, and its meaning,<b> merely as man</b>, i.e. ‘<i>according to this world’s views,</i>’ ‘as one who has no hope beyond the grave;’ see ref. If<i> thus</i> only he fought, &c., where was his profit (seeing he despised all those things which, with such a view, might compensate for such a fight,—fame, praise, &c.)?<br><br><b> I fought with beasts</b> (not as A.V. “<i>I have fought:</i>” he refers to<i> one special occasion</i>). How? and when? Most ancient and modern Commentators take the expression figuratively: of which use I have cited examples i in my Greek Test. And this explanation must be right: for his Roman citizenship would have precluded his ever being literally thrown to beasts: and even supposing him to have waived it, and been miraculously rescued, as many suppose, is it conceivable that such an event should have been altogether unrecorded in the Acts?—Adopting the figurative rendering,—we cannot fix on any recorded conflict which will suit the words. His danger from Demetrius and his fellow-craftsmen (Acts xix.) had not. yet happened (see Introduction,§vi. 2): but we cannot tell what opposition, justifying this expression, the “<i>many adversaries</i>” of ch. xvi. 9, may ere this have made to his preaching.<br><br><b> If dead men rise not,</b> i.e. ‘<i>if none of the dead rise.</i>’ These words are best joined with the following, as Chrysostom and most of the Commentators: Theophyl., Beza, Bengel, Griesb., Meyer, De Wette, al.,—not with the preceding, as A.V. and others. For the expression “<i>after the manner of men</i>” already expresses their meaning in the preceding sentence: and the form of ver. 29 seems to justify this arrangement, besides that otherwise “<i>Let us eat and drink, &c.</i>” would stand awkwardly insulated.<br><br><b> Let us eat and drink...</b>] In Isa. the words represent the recklessness of those who utterly disregard the call of God to weeping and mourning, and feast while their time lasts.
