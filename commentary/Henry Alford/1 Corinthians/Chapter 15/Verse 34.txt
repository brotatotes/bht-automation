 34.  ἐκνήψ  .] Awake out of (your moral)  intoxication , already possessing you by the influence of these men.
	 δικαίως ] either,  as is just, as you ought (Wahl, al.), or,  in a proper manner (Olsh., al.), or, ἐπὶ συμωέροντι καὶ χρησίμῳ (Chrys. p. 382, al.), or  so as to be  δίκαιοι [i.e. so as to recover your righteousness, which you are in danger of losing], as E. V.,  Awake to righteousness . The last meaning is well defended by Dr. Peile from Thuc. i. 21: ἀπίστως ἐπὶ τὸ μυθῶδες ἐκνενικηκότα , ‘so as to become incredible;’ and seems to be the best. The aor. imper. ἐκνήψατε marks the quick momentary awaking; the pres. imper. μὴ ἁμαρτάνετε , on the other hand, the enduring practice of abstinence from sin (Meyer). But that this must not always be rigidly pressed, see Kühner, § 445. 2. Anm. 1.
	 ἀγνωσίαν ] The stress is on this word:  for some (the τινές of 1 Corinthians 15:12 , most probably, are hinted at, and the source of their error pointed out)  have (are affected with)  ignorance (an absence of all true knowledge)  of God . See ref. to Wisd.
	 πρὸς ἐντ  .   ὑμ  .   λ  . shews that these τινές were ἐν ὑμῖν , not the heathen without: the existence of such in the Corinthian church was a disgrace to the whole.
	 λαλᾶ  ] I am speaking ; not merely  I say this ; it refers to the spirit of the whole passage.
