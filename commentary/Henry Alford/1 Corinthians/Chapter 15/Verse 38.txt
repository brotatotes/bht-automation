 38. ]  ἠθέλησεν ,  willed , viz. at the creation: the aor. setting forth the  one act of the divine Will giving to the particular seed the particular development at first, which the species retains: whereas θέλει would imply a fresh act of the divine Will giving to every individual seed (not ἑκάστῳ τῶν σπερμάτων , but ἐκάστῳ σπέρματι , or rather ἑκάστῳ κόκκῳ ) his own body. But the  whole gift to the species being God’s, to continue or withhold, the pres. δίδωσιν still holds good.
	 ἑκάστ  .   τῶν σπερμ  .] to each of the (kinds of) seed ; see above: τῶν is generic.
	 ἵδιον σῶμα  ] a body of its own . Such then being the case with all seeds, why should it be thought necessary that the  same body should rise  as was sown , or that God cannot give to each a resurrection-body, as in nature?
