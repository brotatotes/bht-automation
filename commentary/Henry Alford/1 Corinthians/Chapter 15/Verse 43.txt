 43.  ἐν ἀτιμίᾳ  ,   ἐν δόξῃ  ] in dishonour ( τί γὰρ εἰδεχθέστερον νεκροῦ διαῤῥυέντος ; Chrys. Hom. xli. p. 390. Cf. Xen. Mem. i. 2. 53, τῆς ψυχῆς ἐξελθούσης ,.… τὸ σῶμα τοῦ οἰκειοτάτου ἀνθρώπου τὴν ταχίστην ἐξενέγκαντες ἀφανίζουσιν ,  in glory : regarding, as throughout this argument (see on 1Co 15:23 ), only the  resurrection of the just : see Philippians 3:21 .
	 ἐν ἀσθενείᾳ  ] in weakness , the characteristic of the lifeless body, which is relaxed and powerless. Chrys. understands ἀσθ . of its  inability to resist corruption : De Wette would refer it to the previous state of pain and disease: but it seems better to understand it of the  powerlessness of the corpse, contrasted with  ἐν δυν  ., in vigour, viz. the fresh and eternal energy of the new body free from disease and pain. “That which Grot. adds: ‘cum sensibus multis, quos nunc non intelligimus,’ is very likely in itself  true , but is not implied in ἐν δυνάμει .” Meyer.
