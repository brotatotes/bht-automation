<b> 44, a natural body</b>]<b> an animal body</b>, of which the “<i>psyché,</i>” the animal soul, was the acting and informing power. This soul having departed out of it, does not do away with the correctness of the predicate: its whole organism which still remains<i> when it is sown,</i> is arranged to suit this predominance of the animal soul.<br><br><b> a spiritual body</b>] Theophylact, having explained<i> a natural body</i> as above, proceeds, “A spiritual body is one rich with the working of the Holy Spirit, and administered in all things by Him. For though now the Spirit worketh in us, yet not as it shall then, nor continuously. For when we commit sin, He departeth from us. And even when the Spirit is present, the<i> soul</i> administereth the body: but then the Spirit shall for ever abide in the body of the just.” But: this is not quite enough:—for thus the body might remain as it is, sin only being removed: whereas it shall be no longer a body in which the<i> soul</i> predominates to the subordination of the higher part, the<i> spirit</i>, but one in which the<i> spirit</i>, and that informed fully by the Spirit of God, shall predominate,—its organism being conformed not to an animal, but to a spiritual life: see on ch. vi. 13.—Some have understood<b> spiritual</b> to mean,<i> æthereal, aery,</i> but the other is certainly right.<br><br><b> 44</b> b–<b>49.</b>] REASSERTION AND CONFIRMATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE SPIRITUAL BODY.<br><br><b> 44</b> b.]<b> If there exists an animal body, there exists also a spiritual</b>; i.e. it is no more wonderful a thing, that there should be a body fitted to the capacities and wants of man’s highest part, his spirit, than (which we see to be the case) that there should be one fitted to the capacities and wants of his subordinate animal soul.
