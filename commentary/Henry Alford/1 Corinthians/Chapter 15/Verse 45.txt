<p><strong> οὕτως</strong> , <strong> thus</strong> , viz. in accordance with what has been just said. The citation extends only to the words ἐλένετο ὁ ἄνθρ . εἰς ψυχ . ζῶσαν : πρῶτος and Ἀδάμ are supplied, as are also the concluding words, in which lies the real confirmation. The words quoted serve therefore rather for the illustration of man being a ψυχή , than for a proof of the existence of the spiritual body.

<p><strong> ὁ ἔσχ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἀδάμ</strong> ] This expression was well known among the Jews as indicating the Messiah. The Rabbinical work Neve Shalom ix. 9 (Schöttgen), says: “Adamus postremus est Messias:” see other instances in Schöttg. ad loc.

<p><strong> εἰς πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ζωοπ</strong> .] scil. ἐγένετο <strong> became a quickening</strong> (life bestowing) <strong> spirit</strong> . <em> When</em> ? This has been variously answered: see De Wette and Meyer. The principal periods selected are his <em> Incarnation</em> , his <em> Resurrection</em> , and his <em> Ascension</em> . But it seems to me that the question is not one to be pressed: in the union of the two natures, the second Adam <em> was constituted a life-bestowing Spirit</em> , and is such now in heaven, yet having the resurrection-body. The whole complex of his suffering and triumphant state seems to be embraced in these words. That His resurrection-state <em> alone</em> is not intended, is evident from ἐξ οὐρανοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:47">1 Corinthians 15:47</span> . He was a πνεῦμα ζωοποιοῦν , even while in the σῶμα ψυχικόν ; and is still such in the σῶμα πνευματικόν . The <em> life</em> implied in ζωοποιοῦν , is the <em> resurrection-life</em> : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21">John 5:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28">John 5:28</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span> .</p>
