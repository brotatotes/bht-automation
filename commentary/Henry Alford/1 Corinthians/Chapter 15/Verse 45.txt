<b> 45.</b>] Confirmation of this from Scripture.<br><br><b> So</b>, viz. in accordance with what has been just said.—The citation extends only to the words “<i>man became a living soul;</i>” “<i>first</i>” and “<i>Adam</i>” are supplied, as are also the concluding words, in which lies the real confirmation.

The principal periods selected are His<i> Incarnation,</i> His<i> Resurrection,</i> and His<i> Ascension.</i> But it seems to me that the question is not one to be pressed: in the union of the two natures, the second Adam<i> was constituted a life-bestowing Spirit,</i> and is such now in heaven, yet having the resurrection-body. The whole complex of His suffering and triumphant state seems to be embraced in these words. That his resurrection-state<i> alone</i> is not intended, is evident from the words “<i>from heaven,</i>” ver. 47. He was a “<i>life-giving spirit,</i>” even while in the “<i>natural</i> (animal)<i> body;</i>’ and is still such in the “<i>spiritual body.</i>” The<i> life</i> implied in the word<b> life-giving</b>, is the<i> resurrection-life</i>: see John v. 21, 28; Rom. viii, 11.
