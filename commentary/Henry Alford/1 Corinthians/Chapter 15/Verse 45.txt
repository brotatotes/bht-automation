 45 .] Confirmation of this from Scripture.
	 οὕτως ,  thus , viz. in accordance with what has been just said. The citation extends only to the words ἐλένετο ὁ ἄνθρ . εἰς ψυχ . ζῶσαν : πρῶτος and Ἀδάμ are supplied, as are also the concluding words, in which lies the real confirmation. The words quoted serve therefore rather for the illustration of man being a ψυχή , than for a proof of the existence of the spiritual body.
	 ἐγένετο ] by his creation, by means of God breathing into him the breath of life.
	 εἰς ψ  .   ζῶσ .] becoming thereby a σῶμα ψυχικόν .
	 ὁ ἔσχ  .   Ἀδάμ ] This expression was well known among the Jews as indicating the Messiah. The Rabbinical work Neve Shalom ix. 9 (Schöttgen), says: “Adamus postremus est Messias:” see other instances in Schöttg. ad loc.
	 ἔσχατος , as being the  last HEAD of humanity, to be manifested in the  last times : or merely in contrast to the  first .
	 εἰς πν  .   ζωοπ .] scil. ἐγένετο  became a quickening (life bestowing)  spirit .  When ? This has been variously answered: see De Wette and Meyer. The principal periods selected are his  Incarnation , his  Resurrection , and his  Ascension . But it seems to me that the question is not one to be pressed: in the union of the two natures, the second Adam  was constituted a life-bestowing Spirit , and is such now in heaven, yet having the resurrection-body. The whole complex of his suffering and triumphant state seems to be embraced in these words. That His resurrection-state  alone is not intended, is evident from ἐξ οὐρανοῦ , 1 Corinthians 15:47 . He was a πνεῦμα ζωοποιοῦν , even while in the σῶμα ψυχικόν ; and is still such in the σῶμα πνευματικόν . The  life implied in ζωοποιοῦν , is the  resurrection-life : see John 5:21 ; John 5:28 ; Romans 8:11 .
