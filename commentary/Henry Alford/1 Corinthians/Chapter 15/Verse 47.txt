<b> 47.</b>] So exactly in Gen. ii. 7. God made man of the<i> dust of the ground</i>. Meyer has some excellent remarks here, with which I entirely agree:— “Since the body of Adam is thus characterized as a psychical (animal) body, as ver. 45, and animal organism involves<i> mortality</i> (ver. 44), it is clear that Paul treats of Adam<i> not as created exempt from death</i>: in strict accordance with Gen. ii. 7; iii. 19. Nor does this militate against his teaching that<i> death came into the world through sin</i>, Rom. v. 12. For had our first parents not sinned, they would have remained in Paradise, and would, by the use of the<i> Tree of Life</i>, which God<i> had not forbidden them</i> (Gen. ii, 16, 17), have become immortal (Gen. iii. 22). But they were driven out of Paradise,<i> ere yet they had tasted of this tree</i> (Gen. iii. 22), and so, according to the record in Genesis also, Death came into the world by sin.”
