 55 .] TRIUMPHANT EXCLAMATION  of the Apostle realizing in his mind that glorious time : expressed nearly in the terms of the prophetic announcement of Hosea, ποῦ ἡ δίκη σου , θάνατε ; ποῦ τὸ κέντρον σου , ᾅδη ;
	The figure of death as a  venomous beast is natural, from the  serpent , Genesis 3:0 Numbers 21:0 .
	The souls in Hades being freed by the resurrection, Death’s victory is gone: sin being abolished by the change of the animal body (the source of sin) to the spiritual, his sting is powerless. For a discussion of the quotation, see Stanley’s note.
