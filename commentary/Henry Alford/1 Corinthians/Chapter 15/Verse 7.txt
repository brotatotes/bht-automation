<b> 7. to James</b>] Probably, from no distinguishing epithet being added,<i> the celebrated</i> James,<i> the brother of the Lord:</i> see Gal. i. 19. So Chrysostom, See notes on ch. ix. 5, Matt. xiii. 55, and the Introduction to the Epistle of James.—This appearance cannot however be identical with that additional one quoted by Jerome from the<i> Gospel according to the Hebrews:</i> “James had vowed that he would not eat bread, from the hour when he had drunk the cup of the Lord, until he should see him rising from the dead.” This would imply that the appearance was very soon after the Resurrection, and before any of those to large collections of believers, in which James would naturally be present.
