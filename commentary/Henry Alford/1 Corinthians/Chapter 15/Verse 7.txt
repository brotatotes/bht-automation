 7.  Ἰακώβῳ ] Probably, from no distinguishing epithet being added,  the celebrated James,  the brother of the Lord : see Galatians 1:19 . So Chrys.: ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ , τῷ ἀδελφῷ τῷ ἑαυτοῦ , p. 355. See notes on ch. 1 Corinthians 9:5 , Matthew 13:55 , and the Prolegg. to the Epistle of James. On Wieseler’s view that this is the appearance on the road to Emmaus, see note on Luke 24:13 . This appearance cannot however be identical with that traditional one quoted by Jerome (from the Gospel according to the Hebrews), Catal. Script. Eccles. ii. vol. ii. p. 831 f.: “Juraverat enim Jacobus, se non comesturum panem ab illa hora qua biberat calicem Domini, donec videret eum resurgentem a mortuis.” This would imply that the appearance was very soon after the Resurrection, and before any of those to large collections of believers, in which James would naturally be present.
	 ἀποστ  .   πᾶσιν ] This is decisive for the much wider use of the term ἀπόστολος than as applying to the Twelve only: and a strong presumption that James, just mentioned, and evidently here and Galatians 1:19 , included among the ἀπόστολοι , was not one of the Twelve. Chrys. (ubi supra) extends the term to the Seventy of Luke 10:0 and others: ἦσαν γὰρ καὶ ἄλλοι ἀπόστολοι , ὡς οἱ ἑβδομήκοντα .
