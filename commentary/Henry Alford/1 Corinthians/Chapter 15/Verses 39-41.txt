 39 41 .] And the more, because we have examples from analogy of  various kinds of bodies ; viz. (1) in the  flesh of animals ( 1Co 15:39 ): (2) in  celestial and terrestrial bodies ( 1Co 15:40 ): (3) in the  various characters of light given by the sun, moon, and stars.
	 σάρξ ]  animal organism (De W.). Dean Stanley’s former rendering (corrected in his 3rd edn.) of οὐ πᾶσα σάρξ , ἡ αὐτὴ σάρξ , ‘no flesh is the same flesh,’ is contrary to the usage of the passages which he alleged to defend it, where  the negative is always attached to the verb ; οὐ δικαιωθήσεται πᾶσα σάρξ , Romans 3:20 ; Galatians 2:16 . See Matthew 24:22 [75] ; Acts 10:14 ; ch. 1 Corinthians 1:29 ; 1 John 3:15 ; Revelation 7:16 ; Revelation 9:4 . On the other hand,  where the negative is attached to   πᾶς  , as here , the sentence is a particular negative, not an universal: e.g. Romans 10:16 , ἀλλ ʼ οὐ πάντες ὑπήκουσαν : 1 Corinthians 9:6-7 ; Hebrews 3:16 ; Matthew 7:21 , οὐ πᾶς ὁ λέγων μοι κύριε κύριε εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν , where the rendering in question would involve portentous consequences indeed. I observe that Conyb, also, although disapproving on the ground of the sense, adds, “the words of the Greek text no doubt admit of such a rendering.”

When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
