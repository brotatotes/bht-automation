(1) in the <em> flesh</em> of animals ( 1Co 15:39 ): (2) in <em> celestial and terrestrial bodies</em> ( 1Co 15:40 ): (3) in the <em> various characters of light</em> given by the sun, moon, and stars.

<p><strong> σάρξ</strong> ] <em> animal organism</em> (De W.). Dean Stanley’s former rendering (corrected in his 3rd edn.) of οὐ πᾶσα σάρξ , ἡ αὐτὴ σάρξ , ‘no flesh is the same flesh,’ is contrary to the usage of the passages which he alleged to defend it, where <em> the negative is always attached to the verb</em> ; οὐ δικαιωθήσεται πᾶσα σάρξ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:16">Galatians 2:16</span> . See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:22">Matthew 24:22</span> [75] ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:14">Acts 10:14</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:29">1 Corinthians 1:29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:15">1 John 3:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+7:16">Revelation 7:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+9:4">Revelation 9:4</span> . On the other hand, <em> where the negative is attached to </em> <em> πᾶς</em> <em> , as here</em> , the sentence is a particular negative, not an universal: e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:16">Romans 10:16</span> , ἀλλ ʼ οὐ πάντες ὑπήκουσαν : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:6-7">1 Corinthians 9:6-7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:16">Hebrews 3:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:21">Matthew 7:21</span> , οὐ πᾶς ὁ λέγων μοι κύριε κύριε εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν , where the rendering in question would involve portentous consequences indeed. I observe that Conyb, also, although disapproving on the ground of the sense, adds, “the words of the Greek text no doubt admit of such a rendering.”

When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .
