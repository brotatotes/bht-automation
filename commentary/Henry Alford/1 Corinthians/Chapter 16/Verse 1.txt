<b> 1. for the saints</b>] i.e., the poor among the saints who were in Jerusalem, Rom. xv. 26. See also 2 Cor. viii. 1 ff.; ix. 1 ff; and on the poverty of the church at Jerusalem, note on Acts ii. 44. That poverty was no doubt increased by the continual troubles with which Jerusalem was harassed in this, the distressful close of the Jewish national history. See other causes in Stanley. That the mother church of Christendom should be thus, in its need, sustained by the daughter churches, was natural; and it is at the same time an affecting circumstance, to find<i> him</i> the most anxious to collect and bear to them this contribution whose former persecuting zeal had doubtless (see Acts xxvi. 10) made not a few of those saints<i> widows and orphans.</i><br><br><b> as I gave order</b>] We do not find any such order in the Epistle to the Galatians: ch. ii. 10 there being merely incidental. It had probably been given during his journey among them, Acts xviii. 23,—or perhaps by message (?) from Ephesus. Not as A.V., ‘<i>as I have given order,</i>’ but<b> as I gave order.</b><br><br><b> He</b> refers to the occasion, whatever it was, when that order was. given.—Bengel remarks: “He proposes. the example of the Galatians to the Corinthians, that of the Corinthians and Macedonians to the Romans.” 2 Cor. ix. 2. Rom. xv. 26.
