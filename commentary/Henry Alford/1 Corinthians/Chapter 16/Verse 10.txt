His  youth occurs to us, mentioned 1 Timothy 4:12 ; but even that is not enough, and would hardly be intended here, without some reference to it. De Wette’s conjecture may not be without foundation, that he was perhaps of a  timid disposition . Meyer objects that we have no historical trace of this: but I think some are to be found in 1 Tim.: e.g. 1 Timothy 3:15 ; 1 Timothy 5:22-23 .
