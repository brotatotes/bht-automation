<b> 13.</b>] “To shew them that not on their teachers but on themselves depended their hopes of salvation, he says, watch, for that they were sleeping: stand, for that they were wavering: quit you like men, be strong, for they were shewing themselves cowards: let all you do be done in love, for that they were in strife.’ Chrysostom.
