<b> 2.</b>] On the observance of the first day of the week, see notes, Acts xx. 7, and Rom. xiv. 5. Here there is no mention of their<i> assembling</i>, which we have in Acts xx. 7, but a plain indication that the day was already considered as a special one, and one more than others fitting for the performance of a religious duty.<br><br> Literally,<b> let each of</b><b> you lay up at home whatsoever he may by prosperity have acquired</b> ( ‘<i>whatsoever he may be prospered in:</i>’ i.e. the pecuniary result of any prosperous adventure, or dispensation of Providence),<b> that there may not, when I come,</b> THEN<b> be collections to be made.</b> His time would be better employed in imparting to them a spiritual benefit than in urging them to and superintending this duty.
