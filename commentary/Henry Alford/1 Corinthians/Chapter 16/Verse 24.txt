<b> 24. My love be with you</b>] Because the Epistle had contained so much that was of a severe character, he concludes it with an expression of affection; so Chrysostom, “After so much fault-finding he does not turn away from them, but loves and embraces them, far off as they were:” i.e. “<b>my love</b> has nothing in it of human or carnal, but is spiritual, and in Christ.” Theophylact.
