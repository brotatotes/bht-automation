<p><strong> 5</strong> .] This plan was a <em> change from his former intention</em> , which had been (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:15-16">2 Corinthians 1:15-16</span> , and note), to <em> pass through them to Macedonia</em> , and <em> again return to them from Macedonia</em> , and thence to Judæa. This he had apparently announced to them in the <em> lost Epistle</em> alluded to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:9">1 Corinthians 5:9</span> (or in some other), and he now tacitly drops this scheme, and announces another. For this he was charged (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:17">2 Corinthians 1:17</span> ff.) with <em> levity of purpose</em> : but his real motive was, <em> lenity towards them</em> , that he might not come to them in sorrow and severity (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:23">2 Corinthians 1:23</span> ; 2Co 2:1 ). The second plan <em> he adhered to</em> : we find him already in Macedonia when 2 Cor. was written (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:13">2 Corinthians 2:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:1">2 Corinthians 8:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:2">2 Corinthians 9:2</span> ; 2Co 9:4 ), and on his way to Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:14">2 Corinthians 12:14</span> ; 2Co 13:1 ); and in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:1-2">Acts 20:1-2</span> , the journey is briefly narrated.

<p>The pres. implies, as in E. V., his <em> now matured plan</em> , not, as in the erroneous subscription of the Epistle, that he was <em> on his way</em> through Macedonia, when he wrote the word.</p>
