<b> 5.</b>] This plan was a<i> change from his</i><i> former intention,</i> which had been (see 2 Cor. i. 15, 16, and note)<i> to pass through them to Macedonia,</i> and<i> again return to them from Macedonia</i>, and thence to Judæa. This he had apparently announced to them in the lost Epistle alluded to ch. v. 9 (or in some other), and he now tacitly drops this scheme, and announces another. For this he was charged (2 Cor. i. 17 ff.) with<i> levity of purpose:</i>—but his real motive was,<i> lenity towards them,</i> that he might not come to them in sorrow and severity (2 Cor. i. 23; ii. 1). The second plan<i> he adhered to:</i> we find him already in Macedonia when 2 Cor. was written (2 Cor. ii. 13; viii. 1; ix. 2, 4), and on his way to Corinth (2 Cor. xii. 14; xiii. 1);—and in Acts xx. 1, 2, the journey is briefly narrated.
