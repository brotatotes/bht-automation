 5 .] This plan was a  change from his former intention , which had been (see 2 Corinthians 1:15-16 , and note), to  pass through them to Macedonia , and  again return to them from Macedonia , and thence to Judæa. This he had apparently announced to them in the  lost Epistle alluded to ch. 1 Corinthians 5:9 (or in some other), and he now tacitly drops this scheme, and announces another. For this he was charged (2 Corinthians 1:17 ff.) with  levity of purpose : but his real motive was,  lenity towards them , that he might not come to them in sorrow and severity (2 Corinthians 1:23 ; 2Co 2:1 ). The second plan  he adhered to : we find him already in Macedonia when 2 Cor. was written (2 Corinthians 2:13 ; 2 Corinthians 8:1 ; 2 Corinthians 9:2 ; 2Co 9:4 ), and on his way to Corinth (2 Corinthians 12:14 ; 2Co 13:1 ); and in Acts 20:1-2 , the journey is briefly narrated.

	The pres. implies, as in E. V., his  now matured plan , not, as in the erroneous subscription of the Epistle, that he was  on his way through Macedonia, when he wrote the word.
