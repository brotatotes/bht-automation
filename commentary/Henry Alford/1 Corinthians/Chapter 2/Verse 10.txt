 10.  τὸ πνεῦμα ] the Holy Spirit of God but working in us and with our Spirits, Romans 8:16 . “Sufficiat nobis Spiritum Dei habere testem: nihil enim tam profundum est in Deo quo non penetret.” Calvin.
	 ἐραυνᾷ ] a word of active research, implying accurate knowledge: so Chrys., οὐκ ἀγνοίας , ἀλλ ʼ ἀκριβοῦς γνώσεως ἐνταῦθα τὸ ἐρευνᾷν ἐνδεικτικόν .
	 τὰ βάθη ] see reff. There is a comparison here between the  Spirit of God and the  spirit of a man , which is further carried out in the next verse. And thus as the  spirit of a man knows the βάθος of a man, all that is in him, so the  Spirit of God searches and knows τὰ βάθη , the manifold and infinite depths, of God His Essence, His Attributes, His Counsels: and being τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἐν ἡμῖν , besides being τὸ πν . τοῦ θεοῦ (De Wette well observes that the Apostle purposely avoids using the expression τὸ πνεῦμα  τὸ ἐν αὐτῷ of the  Spirit of God , keeping the way open for the expression in 1 Corinthians 2:12 , τὸ πν . τὸ  ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ),  teaches us according to our capacity,  those depths of God .
