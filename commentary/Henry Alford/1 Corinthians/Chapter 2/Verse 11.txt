 11. ]  For who among MEN  knoweth the things of a MAN ( τοῦ ἀνθρώπου , generic, see reff.
	The emphasis is on ἀνθρώπων and ἀνθρώπου , as compared with θεοῦ )  except the spirit of a man which is in him? Thus the things of God also none knoweth, except the Spirit of God . We may remark, (1) that nothing need be supplied (as βάθη ) after τά in each case, see reff. (2) that the comparison here must not be urged beyond what is intended by the Apostle. He is speaking of the impossibility of any but the  Spirit of God conferring a knowledge of the  things of God . In order to shew this, he compares human things with divine, appealing to the fact that none but the spirit of a man knows  his matters . But further than this he says nothing of the  similarity of relation of God and God’s Spirit with  man and man’s spirit : and to deduce more than this, will lead into error on one side or the other. In such comparisons as these especially, we must bear in mind the constant habit of our Apostle, to contemplate the thing adduced,  for the time, only with regard to that one point for which he adduces it, to the disregard of all other considerations.
