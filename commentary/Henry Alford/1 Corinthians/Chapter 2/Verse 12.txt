<p><strong> τὸ πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κόσμ</strong> .] Not merely, the mind and sentiments of unregenerate mankind, ‘sapientia mundana et sæcularis,’ as Estius, al., but <strong> the Spirit</strong> (personally and objectively taken) <strong> of the world</strong> , = τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ νῦν ἐνεργοῦν ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς τῆς ἀπειθείας , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span> , where it is strictly personal.
	</p>
<p><strong> τὸ πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τὸ ἐκ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Not only, ‘ <em> the Spirit of God</em> ,’ but <strong> the Spirit which is</strong> FROM <strong> God</strong> , to shew that we have received it only by the will and imparting of Him whose Spirit it is. And this expression prepares the way for the <em> purpose</em> which God has in imparting to us His Spirit, <strong> that we may know the things freely given to us by God</strong> , i.e. the treasures of wisdom and of felicity which are the free gifts of the gospel dispensation, = ὅσα ἡτοίμασεν ὁ θεὸς τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:9">1 Corinthians 2:9</span> .</p>
