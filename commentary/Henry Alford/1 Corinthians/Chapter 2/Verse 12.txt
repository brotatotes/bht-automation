	 τὸ πν  .   τ  .   κόσμ .] Not merely, the mind and sentiments of unregenerate mankind, ‘sapientia mundana et sæcularis,’ as Estius, al., but  the Spirit (personally and objectively taken)  of the world , = τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ νῦν ἐνεργοῦν ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς τῆς ἀπειθείας , Ephesians 2:2 , where it is strictly personal.
	 τὸ πν  .   τὸ ἐκ τ  .   θ  . ] Not only, ‘  the Spirit of God ,’ but  the Spirit which is FROM  God , to shew that we have received it only by the will and imparting of Him whose Spirit it is. And this expression prepares the way for the  purpose which God has in imparting to us His Spirit,  that we may know the things freely given to us by God , i.e. the treasures of wisdom and of felicity which are the free gifts of the gospel dispensation, = ὅσα ἡτοίμασεν ὁ θεὸς τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν , 1 Corinthians 2:9 .
