<b> 12. the spirit of the world</b>] Not merely, the mind and sentiments of unregenerate mankind, but<b> the spirit</b> (personally and objectively taken)<b> of the world,</b>—the spirit which now worketh in the children of disobedience, Eph. ii. 2, where it is strictly personal. On the other hand, we have received, not only ‘<i>the Spirit of God</i>,’ but<b> the Spirit which is FROM God</b>,—shewing that we have received it only by the will and imparting of Him whose Spirit it is. And this expression prepares the way for the<i> purpose</i> which God has in imparting to us His Spirit, that we may know the things freely given to us by God, i. e, the treasures of wisdom and of felicity which are the free gifts of the gospel dispensation, “the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him,” ver. 9.
