	The acceptation of πάντα as masc. sing., “convincere potest quemlibet profanum,” as Rosenm., is against the context, which speaks of  things , τὰ τοῦ πν ., besides that πάντα would not be used absolutely, for ‘every man,’ but either πάντα ἄνθρωπον , as Colossians 1:28 , or τὸν πάντα ),  but himself is judged of by none (who is not also πνευματικός , see ch. 1 Corinthians 14:29 ; 1 John 4:1 , where such judgment is expressly attributed to Christian believers). καὶ γὰρ ὁ βλέπων , πάντα μὲν αὐτὸς καθορᾷ καὶ τοῦ μὴ βλέποντος , τὰ δὲ ἐκείνου τῶν μὴ βλεπόντων οὐδείς .
