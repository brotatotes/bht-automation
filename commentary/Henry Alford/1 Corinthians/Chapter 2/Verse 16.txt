 16. ] PROOF OF  αὐτὸς δὲ ὑπ  ʼ   οὐδ  .   ἀνακρίνεται . In order for an  unassisted man , not  gifted from Christ , to judge the πνευματικός , he must  know the  νοῦς κυρίου , the intent and disposition of Christ;  yea more , must be  able to teach, to instruct, Christ being not, as the πνευματικός ,  taught by Him , he must have an  independent wisdom of his own , which Christ  has not : and  who is there, of whom this can be said ?  But we ( πνευματικοί , among whom he includes himself and the other Apostles)  have (not a wisdom independent of Christ, nor do we know His mind, nor can we teach Him, but)  the mind of Christ : the same mind, in our degree of apprehensiveness of it, by the imparting of His Spirit, which is in Him, and so can judge all things. The νοῦς κυρίου is  the spiritual intent and designs of Christ.
	κυρίου in the prophecy is spoken of JEHOVAH; but in the whole of Isaiah 40:0 , the  incarnate Jehovah is the subject. The meaning of συμβιβάζω ,  to teach , belongs to the LXX: in the N. T. it is  to conclude, to prove, to confirm , see reff.
