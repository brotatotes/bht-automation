In order for an<i> unassisted</i> man, not<i> gifted from Christ</i>, to judge the spiritual man, he must<i> know the</i><b> mind of the Lord</b>, the intent and disposition of Christ;<i> yea more,</i> must be<i> able to teach, to instruct, Christ</i>—being not, as the spiritual man,<i> taught by Him</i>, he must have an<i> independent wisdom of his own</i>, which Christ<i> has not</i>:—<i>and who is there, of whom this can be said</i>?<b> But we</b> (<i>the spiritual</i>, among whom he includes himself and the other Apostles)<b> have</b> (not a wisdom independent of Christ, nor do we know His mind, nor can we teach Him, but)<b> the mind of Christ</b>: the same mind, in our degree of apprehensiveness of it, by the imparting of His Spirit, which is in Him:—and so can judge all things.<b> The mind of the Lord</b> is<i> the spiritual intent</i> and designs of Christ.—THE LORD, in the prophecy, is spoken of JEHOVAH; but in the whole of Isa. xl.,<i> the incarnate Jehovah</i> is the subject.
