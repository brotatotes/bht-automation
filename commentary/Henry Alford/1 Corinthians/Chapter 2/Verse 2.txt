<b> 2.</b>] Literally,<b> For I did not resolve to know any thing</b> (meaning, “<i>the only thing that I made it definitely my business to know, was”)</i><b> among you, save Jesus Christ</b> (His Person),<b> and Him</b> (as)<b> crucified</b> (His Office). It would seem that the historical facts of redemption, and especially the crucifixion of Christ, as a matter of offence, had been kept in the background by these professors of human wisdom. “We must not overlook, that Paul does not say ‘to know<i> any thing of</i> or<i> concerning</i> Christ,’ but to know HIM HIMSELF, to preach HIM HIMSELF. The<i> historical Christ</i> is also the<i> living Christ</i>, who is<i> with His own till the end of time;</i> He works personally in every believer, and forms Himself in each one. Therefore it is universally CHRIST HIMSELF, the Crucified and the Risen One, who is the subject of preaching, and is also Wisdom itself: for His history evermore lives and repeated itself in the whole church and in every member of it: it never waxes old, any more than does God Himself;—it retains at this day that fulness of power, in which it was revealed at the first foundation of the church.” Olshausen.
