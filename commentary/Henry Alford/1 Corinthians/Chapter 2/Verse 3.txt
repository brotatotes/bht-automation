<b> 3.</b>]<b> And I;</b> in the original the personal pronoun is repeated for emphasis, the<i> nature of his own preaching</i> being the leading subject-matter here.—The<b> weakness and fear and much trembling</b> must not be exclusively understood of his<i> manner of speech</i> as contrasted with the rhetorical preachers, for these follow in the next verse,—but partly of this, and principally of his<i> internal</i> deep and humble<i> persuasion</i> of his own weakness, and the mightiness of the work which was entrusted to him. So in Phil. ii. 12, 13, he commands the Philippians to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, for it was God that wrought in them. The<i> weakness</i> may have reference to the<i> weak bodily</i> presence of 2 Cor. x. 10. Chrysostom and others understand it of<i> persecutions</i>: but in the places to which he refers, it has a far wider meaning,—viz.<i> infirmities</i>, including those resulting from persecution.
