That this is the right interpretation, the whole following context shews, and especially ch. iii. 1, 2, where a difference is laid down between the<i> milk administered to babes</i>, and the<i> strong meat to men</i>. ‘The difference is in the<i> matter of the teaching itself</i>: there is a lower, and there is a higher teaching. On the other hand, Chrysostom and many others understand the difference to be merely in the<i> estimate formed of the same</i> teaching according as men were spiritual or unspiritual, interpreting<b> among the perfect</b> to mean ‘<i>in the estimation of the perfect</i>,’ which is allowable, but plainly irreconcilable with the whole apologetic course of the chapter, and most of all with ch. iii. 1, where he asserts that<i> he did not speak this wisdom</i> to the Corinthians.—We are then brought to the enquiry,—<i>what was this</i><b> wisdom</b>? “Meyer limits it too narrowly to<i> consideration of the future kingdom of Christ</i>. Riickert adds to this,<i> the higher views of the divine ordering of the world</i> with respect to the unfolding of God’s kingdom,—of the meaning of the preparatory dispensations before Christ, e.g. the law,—of the manner in which the death and resurrection of Christ promoted the salvation of mankind. According to ver. 12, the knowledge of the blessings of salvation, of the glory which accompanies the kingdom of God, belongs to this higher species of teaching. Examples of it are found in the Epistle to the Romans, in the setting forth of the doctrine of justification,—of the contrast between Christ and Adam,—of predestination (compare the word<i> ‘mystery</i>,’ Rom. xi. 25), and in the Epistles to the Eph. and Col. (where the word<i> ‘mystery’</i> often occurs) in the declarations respecting the divine plan of Redemption and the Person of Christ; nay, in our Epistle, ch. xv. Of the same kind are the considerations treated, Heb. vii.—x.: cf. iv. 11 ff” De Wette.<br><br><b> but a wisdom not of this world,</b>—not, as A.V., ‘<i>not the wisdom of this world,</i>’ which loses the peculiar force of the negative—These<b> rulers</b> are parallel with the “<i>wise</i>,” “<i>mighty</i>,” “<i>noble</i>,” of ch. i. 26, and are connected with them expressly by the words<b> that are coming to nought</b>, referring to “<i>that He might bring to nought the things that are</i>,” ch. i. 28.
