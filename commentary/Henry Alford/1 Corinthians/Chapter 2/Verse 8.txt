 8. ]  ἥν is in apposition with the former ἥν , and does not refer to δόξαν , as Tert [1] contra Marc [2] 1 Corinthians 2:6 , vol. ii. p. 483, “subjicit de gloria nostra, quod eam nemo ex principibus hujus ævi scierit …,” for this would be departing from the whole sense of the context, which is, that the  wisdom of God was  hidden from men.

	 εἰ γὰρ ἔγν . κ . τ . λ ., is a  proof from experience , that the rulers of this world, of whom the Jewish rulers were a representative sample, were ignorant of the wisdom of God. Had they known it, they would not have put to a disgraceful death ( ὁ σταυρὸς ἀδοξίας εἶναι δοκεῖ , Chrys.) Him who was the Lord of glory (reff.), i.e. who possesses in his own right glory eternal, see John 17:5 ; John 17:24 .
	These words are not a parenthesis, but continue the sense of the foregoing, completing the proof of man’s ignorance of God’s wisdom; even this world’s  rulers know it not, as they have shewn: how much less then the rest.
