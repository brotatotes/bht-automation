Origen says, “that it is found in no canonical book, but in the ‘secrets of Elias the prophet,’” a lost apocryphal book:—Chrysostom and Theophylact give the alternative, either that the words are a paraphrase of Isa. lii. 15, or that they were contained in some lost book, of which Chrysostom argues that there were very many, and that but few remain to us. Jerome believes the words to be those of Isa. lxiv. 4, paraphrased.—I own that probability seems to me to incline to Jerome’s view, especially when we remember, how freely St. Paul is in the habit of citing. The words of Isa. Ixiv. 4, are quite as near to the general sense of the citation as is the case in many other instances, and the words<b> have not entered into the heart of man</b> may well be a reminiscence from Isa. Ixv. 17, not far from the other place: see A.V., in the margin of that place. Such minglings together of clauses from various parts are not unexampled with the Apostle, especially when, as here, he is not citing<i> as authority</i>, but merely<i> illustrating his argument by</i> Old Test.<i> expressions</i>.
