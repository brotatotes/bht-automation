<b> 1.]</b><b> And I</b>, or as it may be rendered,<b> I also</b>; i.e. as well as the<i> natural</i> man, was compelled to stand on this lower ground,—he, because<i> he cannot understand</i> the things of the Spirit of God: 1, because<i> you could not</i> receive them. But it is perhaps better to render as in the text, and understand it, with Stanley,<b> And I</b>, as in ch. ii, 1, “What I have just been saying, was exemplified in our practice.”<br><br><b> as unto</b><b> men of flesh]</b> The Apostle uses two different words here and in ver. 3 to convey the idea of carnality. Here it is the more gross and material word, signifying<i> made</i><i> of flesh</i>: there it is the finer and figurative word<i> carnal</i>, partaking of the character, and under the influence of the flesh. And there is a propriety in this distinction. Here, he says that he was compelled to speak to them as if they were<i> only of flesh</i>,—as if they were<i> babes</i>, using in both cases the material comparison, and the particle of comparison, “<b>as</b>.” But in ver. 3 he drops comparison, and asserts matter of fact— ‘Are ye not<i> still</i> fleshly, carnal, living after the flesh, resisting the Spirit?’ as if it had been said, ‘I was obliged to regard you as mere<i> men of flesh</i>, without the Spirit: and it is not far different even now: ye are yet<i> fleshly</i>—ye retain the same character.’<br><br><b> as unto babes in Christ]</b> The opposite term, “<i>perfect in Christ</i>,” is found Col. i. 28 and in connexion with this, Heb. v. 13, 14. The Jews called the novices in their schools “sucking babes.” A recent proselyte also was regarded by them as a new-born infant.—He speaks of his first visit to Corinth, when they were recently admitted into the faith of Christ.—and excuses his merely elementary teaching by the fact that they then required it.<i> Not this</i>, but their<i> still requiring it</i>, is adduced as matter of blame to them.
