 10. ]  κατὰ τ  .   χάρ . &c., as an expression of humility (reff.), fitly introduces the σοφός which follows. So Chrys.: ὅρα γοῦν πῶς μετριάζει . εἰπὼν γὰρ σοφὸν ἑαυτόν , οὐκ ἀφῆκεν αὐτοῦ τοῦτο εἶναι , ἀλλ ʼ ὅλον ἑαυτὸν πρότερον ἀναθεὶς τῷ θεῷ τότε ἑαυτὸν οὕτως ἐκάλεσε . Hom. viii. p. 69. The  χάρις is not  the peculiar grace of his apostleship for an apostle was not always required to lay the foundation, e.g. in Rome: but that given to him in common with all Christians ( 1Co 3:5 ), only in a degree proportioned to the work which God had for him to do.
	 σοφός  , skilful , see reff., and many examples in Wetstein. The proof of this skill is given, in his  laying a foundation : the unskilful master-builder  lays none , see Luke 6:49 . The foundation ( 1Co 3:11 ) was and must be, JESUS CHRIST: the facts of redemption by Him (obj.), and the reception of Him and His work by faith (subj.).
	The mascul. form ὁ θεμέλιος (sc. λίθος ) is said by Thomas Mag. (in Wetst.) to belong to the κοινὴ διάλεκτος the Attic form is θεμέλιον , or, if in the plur., οἱ θεμέλιοι : οἱ γὰρ θεμέλιοι παντοίων λίθων ὑπόκεινται , Thucyd. i. 93.
	 ἄλλος , ‘  whoever comes after me ,’  another : not only Apollos.
	 ἐποικοδομεῖ ,  pres. , as the necessary state and condition of the subsequent teacher, be he who he may. The  building on, over the foundation , imports the carrying them onward in knowledge and intelligent faith.
	 πῶς , emphatic, = here,  with what material . De Wette imagines that it also conveys a caution not to  alter the foundations , and that the  γάρ in 1Co 3:11 refers to this. But the identity of the foundation is surely implied in ἐποικοδομεῖ . On the γάρ , see below.
