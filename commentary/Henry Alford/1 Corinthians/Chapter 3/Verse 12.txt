<b> 12.]</b> The but implies that though there can be but one foundation, there are<i> many ways of building upon it.</i> To the right understanding of this verse it may be necessary to remark, (1) that the similitude is, not of<i> many buildings,</i> but of one, see ver. 16,—and that one, raised<i> on Christ as its foundation</i>:—different parts of which are built by the ministers who work under Him,—some well and substantially built, some ill and unsubstantially (2) That gold, silver, &c., refer to the<i> matter</i> of the ministers’ teaching<i> primarily</i>; and by inference, to those whom that teaching penetrates and builds up in Christ, who should be the living stones of the temple: not, as many of the ancients thought, to the moral fruits produced by the preaching in the individual members of the church: (3) that the builder of the worthless and unsubstantial<i> is in the end SAVED</i> (see below): so that even<i> his</i> preaching was<i> preaching of Christ,</i> and<i> he himself was in earnest</i>. (4) That what is said does not refer, except, by accommodation,<i> to the religious life of believers in general</i>;—but to the DUTY AND REWARD OF TEACHERS. At the same time, such accommodation is legitimate<i> in so far as each man is a teacher and builder of himself</i>. (5) That the various materials specified must not be fancifully pressed to indicate<i> particular doctrines or graces</i>, as e.g. Schrader (in his life of St. Paul) has done, “Some build with the gold of faith, with the silver of hope, with the imperishable costly stones of love,—others again with the dead wood of unfruitfulness in good works, with the empty straw of a spiritless, ostentatious knowledge, and with the bending reed of a continually-doubting spirit.” This, however ingenious, is beside the mark, not being justified by any indications furnished in our Epistle itself.<br><br><b> costly stones]</b> Not,<i> precious stones</i>, as commonly understood, i.e. ‘gems,’ but ‘costly stones,’ as marbles, porphyry, jasper, &c.: compare 1 Kings vii. 9 ff—<b>By the wood, hay, straw</b>, he indicates the various perversions of true doctrine, and admixtures of false philosophy which were current: so Estius, “not heretical and pernicious doctrine, for such would destroy the foundation: but that which wanted purity and solidity: as for example that which was too much mingled with human and philosophical or even Jewish opinions: that which was more curious than useful: that which occupied Christian men’s minds with vain amusement.”
