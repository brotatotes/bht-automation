<b> 13.] The work of each man</b> (i. e. that which he has built:<i> his part</i> in erecting the building of God)<b> shall</b> (at some time)<b> be made manifest</b> (shall not always remain in the present uncertainty but be tested, and shewn of what: sort it is):<b> for the day shall declare it</b> (the<i> day of the Lord</i>: so most Commentators ancient and modern. The other interpretations are (1) ‘<i>the day of the destruction of Jerusalem</i>, which shall shew the vanity of Judaizing doctrines: but this is against both the context, and our Apostle’s habit of speaking, and goes on the assumption, that nothing but Jewish errors are spoken of.— (2) ‘<i>the lapse of time</i>, as in the Latin proverb ( “<i>the day shall teach”</i>), which is still more inconsistent with the context, which necessitates a definite<i> day</i>, and a definite fire:— (3) ‘<i>the light of day</i>,’ i.e. of clear knowledge, as opposed to the present time of obscurity and night:—but the fire here is not a<i> light-giving</i>, but a<i> consuming</i> flame: and, as Meyer remarks, even in that case the “<i>day</i>” would be that of Christ’s appearing, see Rom. xiii. 12:— (4) “<i>the day of tribulation</i>:’—so Augustine: but this again is not definite enough: the words “<i>shall receive wages</i>” can hardly be said of mere abiding the test of tribulation):—<b>because it</b> (the day—not, the<i> work</i>, which would introduce a mere tautology with the next clause)<b> is</b> [<b>to be</b>]<b> revealed</b> (in the original,<b> is revealed</b>, the present tense, expressing the definite certainty of prophecy: or perhaps rather the<i> attribute</i> of that day, which is, to be revealed, &c.)<b> in fire</b> ( ‘accompanied,’ ‘clothed,’ ‘girt,’ ‘with fire;’ i.e. fire will be<i> the element</i> in which the day will be revealed. See 2 Thess. i. 8, and Mal. iii. 2, 3, iv. 1, to which latter place the reference is. But notice, that this is not<i> the fire of hell</i>, into which the gold, silver, and costly stones will never enter, but the<i> fire of judgment</i>, in which Christ will appear, and by which<i> all works will be tried</i>. This<i> universality</i> of trial by fire is equally against the idea of a<i> purgatorial</i><i> fire</i>, which most convenient and lucrative fiction has been mainly based by the Romanists on a perversion of this passage. Their own Commentators are divided on the question whether there is any allusion to it in this passage);<b> and each man’s work, of what sort it is, the fire itself shall prove (the fire itself</b>, of its own power, being a<i> consuming</i> fire).
