<b> 15.]</b><b> if any man’s work shall be burned up</b> (i. e. consist of such materials as the fire will destroy: Stanley adds, “It is possible that this whole image, as addressed to the Corinthians, may have been suggested, or at least illustrated, by the conflagration of Corinth under Mummius: the stately temples [one of them remaining to this day] left standing amidst the universal crash and destruction of the meaner buildings”),<b> he shall suffer loss</b> (literally,<b> be</b><b> mulcted</b>, viz. of the wages which would otherwise have been his):<b> but he himself shall be saved</b> (having held, and built on, the true foundation Jesus Christ, he shall not be excluded from that salvation which is the free gift of God to all who believe on Christ, but shall get no<i> especial reward</i> as a faithful and effectual teacher. Compare 2 John 8, “<i>Look to yourselves that we lose not the things which we have wrought, but receive full wages</i>:” so literally. Meyer remarks, that our Lord hints at such persons under the name of “the last,” Matt. xx. 16: Mark x. 31),<b> yet so as through fire</b>:—i. e. as a builder whose building was consumed would escape with personal safety, but with the loss of his work.—Chrysostom, and others of the ancients, strangely understand it, that he shall not be consumed like his works, but shall be saved from this, and burnt for ever in the fire of Hell, unconsumed. But (1)<i> the fire of Hell</i> is quite alien from the context (see above),—and (2) the meaning<i> thus</i> given to<i> being saved</i> is unexampled,—and least of all could be intended where the coming of the Lord is spoken of: compare among other places, ch. v. 5. Grotius and others explain the words as a proverb, ‘<i>as out of a fire</i>, i.e. ‘with difficulty.’ But this is needless here, as the<i> figure itself</i> is that of a fire. The whole imagery of the passage will be best understood by carefully keeping in mind the<i> key</i>, which is to be found in the words<i> God’s building</i>, and the<i> temple of God</i>, as connected with the prophecy of Malachi iii. 1–3 and iv. 1. The Lord thus coming to His temple in flaming fire, all the parts of the building which will not stand that fire will be consumed the builders of them will escape with personal salvation, but with the loss of their work, through the midst of the conflagration.
