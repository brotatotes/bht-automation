So there would be, not many temples, but many churches, each of which is, ideally, the same temple of God.” And, we may add, if the figure is to be strictly justified in its widest acceptation, that all the churches are built together into one vast temple: cf. ἐν  ᾧ καὶ ὑμεῖς συνοικοδομεῖσθε , Ephesians 2:22 .
