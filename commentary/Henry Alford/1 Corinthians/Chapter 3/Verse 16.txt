<b> 16.]</b> The foregoing figures, with the occasion to which they referred, are now dropped, and the<b> building of God</b> recalled, to do further service. This<i> building</i> is now, as in Mal. iii. 1, and as indeed by implication in the foregoing verses, the<i> temple</i> of God (the stress on the word<i> temple</i>, not on “God”), the<i> habitation of His Spirit</i>.<br><br><b> Are ye ignorant that</b>... an expression of surprise arising out of their conduet.—Meyer rightly remarks, that “the expression is<i> the temple</i> of God, not<i> a</i> temple of God: for St. Paul does not conceive of the various churches as<i> various temples</i> of God, which would be inconsistent with a Jew’s conception of God’s temple, but of each Christian church as, in a mystical sense,<i> the temple of Jehovah</i>. So there would be, not many temples, but many churches, each of which is, ideally, the same temple of God.” And, we may add, if the figure is to be strictly justified in its widest acceptation, that all the churches are built together into one vast temple: compare Eph. ii. 22.
