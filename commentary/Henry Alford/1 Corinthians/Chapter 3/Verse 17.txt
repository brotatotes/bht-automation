 17. ]  φθείρει , [  destroys , or]  mars , whether as regards its  unity and beauty , or its  purity and sanctity : here, the meaning is left indefinite, but the latter particulars are certainly hinted at, by ἅγιος below.
	 φθερεῖ , either by  temporal death (Mey.), as in ch. 1 Corinthians 11:30 ; or by  spiritual death , which is more probable, seeing that the  figurative temple is spoken of, not (as Mey.) the material temple: and as  temporal death was the punishment for defiling the material temple (Exodus 28:43 . Lev 16:2 al. fr.), so  spiritual death for marring or defiling of God’s spiritual temple.
	 ἅγιος , the constant epithet of ναός in the O. T., see Psalms 5:7 ; Psalms 10:5 (LXX). Habakkuk 2:20 , and passim.
	 οἵτινες , i.e. ἅγιοι , not, ‘  which temple are ye ,’ which would be tautological after 1 Corinthians 3:16 , and would hardly be expressed by οἵτινες , ‘  ut qui ,’ or ‘  quales .’ Meyer well remarks, that οἵτινές ἐστε ὑμεῖς is the minor proposition of a syllogism: ‘Whoever mars the temple of God, him will God destroy, because His temple is  holy ; but ye also, as His ideal temple, are holy: therefore, whoever mars you, shall be destroyed by God.’
