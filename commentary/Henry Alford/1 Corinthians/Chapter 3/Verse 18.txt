<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] <strong> ἐξαπατάτω</strong> , not, as Theophyl., νομίζων ὅτι ἄλλως ἔχει τὸ πρᾶγμα καὶ οὐχ ὡς εἶπον : it is far more naturally referred to what follows, viz. thinking himself wise, when he must become a fool in order to be wise. <strong> If any man</strong> [ <strong> seemeth to be</strong> (i.e.,] <strong> thinks that he is</strong> ) <strong> wise among you in this world</strong> ( ἐν τῷ αἰ . τούτῳ belongs to δοκεῖ σοφ . εἶν . ἐν ὑμ ., to the whole assumption of wisdom made by the man, which as made in <em> this present world</em> , must be false: not (1) merely to σοφός , Grot., Rückert, al., as the arrangement of the words shews, nor (2) to μωρὸς γενέσθω , Orig [9] , Chrys., Luther, Rosenm., al., in which case, the stress being on μωρός , it must have been μωρὸς γενέσθω ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τούτῳ ), <strong> let him become a fool</strong> (by receiving the gospel in its simplicity, and so becoming foolish in the world’s sight), <strong> that he may become</strong> (truly) <strong> wise</strong> .
