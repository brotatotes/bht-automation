 18. ]  ἐξαπατάτω , not, as Theophyl., νομίζων ὅτι ἄλλως ἔχει τὸ πρᾶγμα καὶ οὐχ ὡς εἶπον : it is far more naturally referred to what follows, viz. thinking himself wise, when he must become a fool in order to be wise.  If any man [  seemeth to be (i.e.,]  thinks that he is )  wise among you in this world ( ἐν τῷ αἰ . τούτῳ belongs to δοκεῖ σοφ . εἶν . ἐν ὑμ ., to the whole assumption of wisdom made by the man, which as made in  this present world , must be false: not (1) merely to σοφός , Grot., Rückert, al., as the arrangement of the words shews, nor (2) to μωρὸς γενέσθω , Orig [9] , Chrys., Luther, Rosenm., al., in which case, the stress being on μωρός , it must have been μωρὸς γενέσθω ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τούτῳ ),  let him become a fool (by receiving the gospel in its simplicity, and so becoming foolish in the world’s sight),  that he may become (truly)  wise .
