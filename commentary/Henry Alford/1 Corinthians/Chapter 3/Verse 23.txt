<b> 23.]</b> On the change of the possessives see above:—<i>Christ</i> is not<i> yours</i>, in the sense in which<i> all things are</i>,—not<i> made for and subserving you—but you</i><i> are His</i>—and even that does not reach the Highest possession: He possesses not you<i> for Himself: but the Head of Christ</i> is God, ch. xi. 3—CHRIST HIMSELF, the Incarnate God the Mediator,<i> belongs to</i> God, is subordinate to the Father, see John xiv. 28; and xvii. But this mediatorial subordination is in no way inconsistent with His eternal and co-equal Godhead: see note on Phil. ii. 6–9; and on ch. xv. 28, where the subjection of all things to Christ, and His subjection to the Father, are similarly set forth—There is a striking similarity in the argument in this last verse to that in our Lord’s prohibition Matt, xxiii. 8–10.
