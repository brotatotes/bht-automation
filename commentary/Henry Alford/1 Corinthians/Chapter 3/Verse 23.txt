 23. ] On the change of the possessives, see above:  Christ is not  yours , in the sense in which πάντα are, not  made for and subserving you but ( δέ )  you are His , and even that does not reach the Highest possession: He possesses not you  for Himself ; but ( δέ again) κεφαλὴ χριστοῦ ὁ θεός , ch. 1 Corinthians 11:3 .
	CHRIST HIMSELF, the Incarnate God the Mediator,  belongs to God, is subordinate to the Father, see John 14:28 ; John , 17 passim. But this mediatorial subordination is in no way inconsistent with His eternal and co-equal Godhead: see notes on Philippians 2:6-9 ; and on ch. 1 Corinthians 15:28 , where the subjection of all things to Christ, and His subjection to the Father, are similarly set forth.
	There is a striking similarity in the argument in this last verse to that in our Lord’s prohibition, Matthew 23:8-10 .
