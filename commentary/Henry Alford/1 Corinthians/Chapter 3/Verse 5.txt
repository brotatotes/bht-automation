 5. ]  οὖν follows on the assumption of the truth of the divided state of things among them: ‘  Who then (  What then ) …,  seeing that ye exalt them into heads over you ?’ The question is not asked by an objector, but by Paul himself; when an objector is introduced, he notifies it, as ch. 1 Corinthians 15:35 ; Romans 9:19 .
	 ἐπιστεύσατε , as in reff.:  ye became believers .
