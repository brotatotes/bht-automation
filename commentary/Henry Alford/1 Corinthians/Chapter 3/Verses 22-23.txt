But having enumerated Paul, Apollos, Cephas, he does not say εἴτε χριστός , but adding the world itself and its events and circumstances, he reiterates the πάντα ὑμῶν as if to mark the termination of this category, and changing the form, concludes with ὑμεῖς δὲ (not only one part of you) χριστοῦ · χριστὸς δὲ θεοῦ (see below). The expressions ζωή , θάνατος , ἐνεστῶτα , μέλλοντα , have nothing to do with the  teachers , as Chrys., Theophyl., Grot., ἡ ζωή , φησι , τῶν διδασκάλων δι ʼ ὑμᾶς ἔστιν ἵνα ὠφελῆσθε διδασκόμενοι · κ . ὁ θάνατος αὐτῶν δι ʼ ὑμᾶς · ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν γὰρ κινδυνεύουσι καὶ τῆς ὑμετέρας σωτηρίας , Theophyl., and “  præsentia , … linguarum et sanationum dona …  futura , … rerum futurarum revelationes,” Grot., but are perfectly general.
	 ἐνεστῶτα is  things actually present , see note on 2 Thessalonians 2:2 .
