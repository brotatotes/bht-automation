<b> 1.] so</b>, emphatic, preparatory to “<i>as</i>,” in ch. iii. 15.<br><br><b> a man</b> is used in the most general and indefinite sense, as<i> ‘man’</i> in German.—The whole is opposed to glorying in men: the ministers of Christ are but subordinates to Him, and accountable to God.<br><br><b> us</b>,<i> here</i>, not ‘<i>us ministers generally</i>,’ see below, ver. 6, but ‘<i>myself and Apollos</i>,’ as a sample of such.<br><br><b> ministers of Christ</b>, see ch. iii. 5, 22, 23. But in the words,<b> stewards of the mysteries of God</b>, we have a new figure introduced. The Church, 1 Tim. ili. 15, is the “<i>house of God</i>,”—and those appointed to minister in it are<i> stewards</i> and<i> dispensers</i> of the property and stores of the<i> Master of the house</i>. These last are the mysteries, hidden treasures, of God,—i. e. the riches of his grace,<i> now manifested</i> in Christ, ch. ii. 7; Rom. xvi. 25, 26, which<i> they</i> announce and distribute to all, having received them from the Spirit for that purpose. “These mysteries are those of the Incarnation, Passion, and Resurrection of Christ, of our Redemption, of the calling of the Gentiles, and the rest which is included in Evangelical doctrine.” Estius: who also, as a Romanist, attempts to include the<i> sacraments</i> among the mysteries in this sense. The best refutation of this is given by himself: “Since Paul himself has said in the first chapter, Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel, it is more correct to understand by these mysteries of God the doctrines of our faith.’ It may be doubted, whether,<i> in the</i> New Test.<i> sense</i> of<b> mysteries</b>, the sacraments can be in any way reckoned as such: for the word signifies a (usually<i> divine) proceeding, once hidden, but now revealed, or now hidden, and to be revealed</i>; under neither of which categories can the sacraments be classed.
