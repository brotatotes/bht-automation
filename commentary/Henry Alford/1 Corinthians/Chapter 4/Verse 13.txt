<b> 13.] we intreat</b>, i.e. we answer with mild and soothing words.<br><br><b> as the filth of the world]</b> A climax of disgrace and contempt summing up the foregoing particulars: we are become as it were the refuse of the whole earth. The original word means that which is removed by a thorough purification, the<b> offal</b> or<b> refuse</b>. Some suppose it to imply that they were the<i> expiation</i> of the world, and shew that it was used of persons offered to the gods as expiation in a pestilence or other public calamity.<br><br><b> the offscouring of all things</b>, means much the same as the former designation,â€”but the expression is more contemptuous.
