	 παιδαγ .] He was their spiritual  father : those who followed, Apollos included, were but  tutors , having the care and education of the children, but not the rights, as they could not have the peculiar affection of the father. He evidently shews by μυρίους , that these παιδαγωγοί were  more in number than he could wish , including among them doubtless the false and party teachers: but to refer the word  only to them and their despotic leading (as Beza, Calvin, al., and De Wette), or to confine its meaning to the stricter sense of παιδαγωγός ,  the slave who led the child to school , is not here borne out by the facts.
