<p><strong> παιδαγ</strong> .] He was their spiritual <em> father</em> : those who followed, Apollos included, were but <em> tutors</em> , having the care and education of the children, but not the rights, as they could not have the peculiar affection of the father. He evidently shews by μυρίους , that these παιδαγωγοί were <em> more in number than he could wish</em> , including among them doubtless the false and party teachers: but to refer the word <em> only</em> to them and their despotic leading (as Beza, Calvin, al., and De Wette), or to confine its meaning to the stricter sense of παιδαγωγός , <em> the slave who led the child to school</em> , is not here borne out by the facts.

Ἰησοῦ δ . τ . εὐ . ὑμ . ἐγέννησα ) <strong> by means of the gospel</strong> (the preached word being the instrument) <strong> I</strong> (emphatic) <strong> begat you</strong> (there is also an emphasis on ὑμᾶς , as coming before the verb, q. d. in <em> your case, I</em> it was who begat you).</p>
