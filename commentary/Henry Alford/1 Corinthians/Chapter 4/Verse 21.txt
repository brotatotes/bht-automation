 21 .] He offers them, with a view to their amendment, the alternative: ‘shall his coming be in a judicial or in a friendly spirit?’ as depending on themselves.  τί not for πότερον (as Meyer, De W.), but general, and afterwards confined to the two alternatives:  What will ye (respecting my coming)?
	 ἔλθω ,  must I come ?
	 ἐν ῥάβδῳ ,  with a rod ; but not  only ‘with,’ as  accompanied with : the prep. gives the idea of the element  in which , much as ἐν δόξῃ : not only  with a rod, but  in such purpose as to use it . There is no Hebraism: see Passow under ἐν , No. 3 and 4. He speaks  as a father : τί ἐστιν , ἐν ῥάβδῳ ; ἐν κολάσει , ἐν τιμωρίᾳ , Chrys.
	 πνεύμ  .   τ  .   πραΰτητος ] Generally, and by De Wette, explained,  a gentle spirit , meaning by πνεύμ . his own spirit: but Meyer has remarked, that in every place in the N. T. where πνεῦμα is joined with an abstract genitive, it imports the Holy Spirit, and the abstract genitive refers to the specific working of the Spirit in the case in hand. So πν . τῆς ἀληθείας (John 15:26 ; Joh 16:13 ; 1Jn 4:6 ), υἱοθεσίας ( Rom 8:15 ), τῆς πίστεως ( 2Co 4:13 ), σοφίας ( Eph 1:17 ), ἁγιωσύνης ( Rom 1:4 ). (This does not however appear to be without exceptions: ef. πνεῦμα ἀσθενείας , Luke 13:11 ; δουλείας , Romans 8:15 ; κατανύξεως , Romans 11:8 ; δειλίας , 2 Timothy 1:7 ; τῆς πλάνης , 1 John 4:6 . We may indeed say, that in none of these cases is the πνεῦμα subjective, or the phrase a mere periphrasis: but the πνεῦμα is objective, a possessing, indwelling spirit, whether of God or otherwise.) And so Chrys., Theophyl., ἔνι γὰρ καὶ πνεῦμα αὐστηρότητος κ . τιμωρίας , ἀλλ ʼ ἀπὰ τῶν χρηστοτέρων αὐτὸ καλεῖ · ὡς καὶ τὸν θεὸν οἰκτίρμονα κ . ἐλεήμονά φαμεν , ἀλλ ʼ οὐ κολαστήν , καίτοιγε καὶ τοῦτο ὄντα . Theophyl.
