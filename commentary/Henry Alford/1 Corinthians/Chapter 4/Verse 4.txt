<b> 4.] for I know nothing against myself</b> (the A.V., ‘<i>I know nothing by myself</i>, was a phrase commonly used in this acceptation at the time; compare Ps. xv. 4, Com. Prayer Book version, ‘He that<i> setteth not by himself</i>, i.e. is not wise in his own conceit. ‘I know no harm by him,’ is still a current expression in the midland counties See Deut. xxvii. 16; Ezek. xxii. 7, in A.V. So Donne, Serm. lvii., “If thine own spirit, thine own conscience, accuse thee of nothing, is all well? why,<i> I know nothing by myself, yet am I not thereby Justified</i>.” This meaning of ‘by’ does not appear in our ordinary dictionaries),<b> yet am I not hereby justified</b> (i. e. it is not<i> this circumstance</i> which clears me of blame—<i>this</i> does not decide the matter. There can be no reference to<i> forensic justification</i> here, by the very conditions of the context: for he is speaking of that<i> wages</i> of the teacher, which may be lost, and yet personal salvation be attained, see ch. iii. 15);<b> but he that judgeth</b> (holds an enquiry on)<b> me is the Lord</b> (Christ, the judge).
