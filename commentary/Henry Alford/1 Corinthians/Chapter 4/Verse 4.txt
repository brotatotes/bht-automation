 4. ]  for I [  know nothing against myself (i.e.)]  am conscious to myself of no (official)  delinquency ; so Plato, Apol. p. 21, οὔτε μέγα οὔτε σμικρὸν ξύνοιδα ἐμαυτῷ σοφὸς ὤν , ib., Rep. i. (Wetst.), τῷ δὲ μηδὲν ἑαυτῷ ἀδίκων ξυνειδότι ἡδεῖα ἐλπὶς ἀεὶ πάρεστι , and Hor., Epist. i. 1. 61, ‘Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.’
	The E. V., ‘I know nothing by myself,’ was a phrase commonly used in this acceptation at the time; cf. Psalms 15:4 , Com. Prayer Book version, ‘He that  setteth not by himself ,’ i.e. is not wise in his own conceit. ‘I know no harm by him’ is still a current expression in the midland counties. See Deuteronomy 27:16 ; Ezekiel 22:7 , in E. V. So Donne, Serm. lvii., “If thine own spirit, thine own conscience, accuse thee of nothing, is all well? why,  I know nothing by myself, yet am I not thereby justified .” This meaning of ‘by’ does not appear in our ordinary dictionaries),  but I am not hereby justified (i.e. it is not  this circumstance which clears me of blame  this does not decide the matter. There can be no reference (as Meyer) to  forensic justification here, by the very conditions of the context: for he is speaking of that μισθός of the teacher, which may be lost, and yet personal salvation be attained, see ch. 1Co 3:15 );  but he that judges (holds an enquiry on)  me is the Lord (Christ, the judge).
