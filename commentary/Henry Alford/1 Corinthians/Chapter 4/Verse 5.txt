 5. ]  So then (because the Lord is the sole infallible dijudicator)  decide nothing (concerning us, of merit or demerit)  before the time, until the Lord shall have come (explains πρὸ καιρ .),  who shall also ( καί ,  inter alia : as part of the proceedings of that Day:  or both )  bring to light (throw light on)  the hidden things of darkness (general  all things which are hidden in darkness),  and shall make manifest the counsels of the hearts (then first shewing, what your teachers really are, in heart),  and then shall the (fitting) praise accrue to each from God.  ἔπαινος is not a  vox media , praise or blame, as the case may be, but strictly  praise . Theophyl., Grot., Billr., Rück., Olsh., suppose the word to be used euphemistically, “unde et contrarium datur intelligi, sed mavult εὐφημεῖν ,” Grot.: Calv., Meyer, al., think that he speaks without reference to those who will obtain  no praise : “hæc vox ex bonæ conscientiæ fiducia nascitur.” Calv. But I agree with De Wette, in thinking that he refers to καυχᾶσθαι ἐν ἀνθρώποις : they, their various parties, gave  exaggerated praise to certain teachers: let them wait till the day when the  fitting praise (be it what it may) will be adjudged to each from God; Christ as the Judge being the ὡρισμένος ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ κριτής , Acts 10:42 , and so His sentences being ἀπὸ θεοῦ . See also Acts 17:31 , and Romans 2:16 , κρινεῖ ὁ θεὸς τὰ κρυπτὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων , … διὰ Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ .
