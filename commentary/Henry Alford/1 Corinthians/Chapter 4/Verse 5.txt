<b> 5.] So then</b> (because the Lord is the sole infallible dijudicator)<b> judge nothing</b> (concerning us, of merit or demerit)<b> before the time, until the Lord [shall have] come, who shall both bring to light</b> (throw light on)<b> the hidden things of darkness</b> (general—<i>all things</i> which are hidden in darkness),<b> and ma</b> ke manifest the counsels of the hearts (then first shewing, what your teachers really are, in heart):<b> and then shall each man have his (fitting) praise from God</b>.—<b>Praise</b> is not a word which may be taken either way, praise or blame, as the ease may be, but strictly<i> praise</i>. He refers to glorying in men:—they, their various parties, gave<i> exaggerated praise</i> to certain teachers: let them wait till the day when the fitting praise (be it what it may) will be adjudged to each from God; Christ being the Judge appointed by God, Acts x. 42, and so His sentences being from God. See also Acts xvii. 31, and Rom. ii. 16,<i> God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ</i>.
