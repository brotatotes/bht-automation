<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] <strong> So then</strong> (because the Lord is the sole infallible dijudicator) <strong> decide nothing</strong> (concerning us, of merit or demerit) <strong> before the time, until the Lord shall have come</strong> (explains πρὸ καιρ .), <strong> who shall also</strong> ( καί , <em> inter alia</em> : as part of the proceedings of that Day: <strong> or both</strong> ) <strong> bring to light</strong> (throw light on) <strong> the hidden things of darkness</strong> (general <em> all things</em> which are hidden in darkness), <strong> and shall make manifest the counsels of the hearts</strong> (then first shewing, what your teachers really are, in heart), <strong> and then shall the (fitting) praise accrue to each from God.</strong> <strong> ἔπαινος</strong> is not a <em> vox media</em> , praise or blame, as the case may be, but strictly <em> praise</em> . Theophyl., Grot., Billr., Rück., Olsh., suppose the word to be used euphemistically, “unde et contrarium datur intelligi, sed mavult εὐφημεῖν ,” Grot.: Calv., Meyer, al., think that he speaks without reference to those who will obtain <em> no praise</em> : “hæc vox ex bonæ conscientiæ fiducia nascitur.” Calv. But I agree with De Wette, in thinking that he refers to καυχᾶσθαι ἐν ἀνθρώποις : they, their various parties, gave <em> exaggerated praise</em> to certain teachers: let them wait till the day when the <em> fitting</em> praise (be it what it may) will be adjudged to each from God; Christ as the Judge being the ὡρισμένος ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ κριτής , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:42">Acts 10:42</span> , and so His sentences being ἀπὸ θεοῦ .
