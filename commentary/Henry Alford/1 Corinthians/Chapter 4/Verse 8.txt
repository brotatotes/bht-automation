The three verbs form a climax. Any interpretation which stops short of the full meaning of the words as applied to the triumphant final state (<i>explaining them of Knowledge, of security, of the lordship of one sect over another</i>), misses the force of the irony, and the meaning of the latter part of the verse.<br><br><b> without us]</b> or, apart from us: ‘because<i> we</i>, as your fathers in Christ, have ever looked forward to<i> present you</i>, as our glory and joy, in that day.’—There is an exquisite delicacy of irony, which Chrysostom has well caught: “He shews their unreasonableness and their exceeding folly. In trials and troubles, he says, all has been in common to us both: but in the reward and the crown, ye are first.”—The latter part of the verse is said bonā fidē and with solemnity;<b> And I would indeed that ye did reign</b> (that the Kingdom of the Lord was actually come, and ye reigning with Him),<b> that we also might reign together with you</b> (that we, though deposed from our<i> proper place</i>, might at least be vouchsafed a humble share in your kingly glory).
