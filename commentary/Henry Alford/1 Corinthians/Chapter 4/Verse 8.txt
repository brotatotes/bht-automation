 8. ] The admonition becomes ironical: ‘You behave as if the trial were past, and the goal gained; as if hunger and thirst after righteousness were already filled, and the kingdom already brought in.’ κωμῳδῶν αὐτοὺς ἔλεγεν Οὕτω ταχέως πρὸς τὸ τέλος ἐφθάσατε , ὅπερ ἀδύνατον ἦν γενέσθαι διὰ τὸν καιρόν . Chrys. Hom. xii. p. 138. The emphases are on ἤδη in the two first clauses, and χωρὶς ἡμῶν in the third. The three verbs form a climax. Any interpretation which stops short of the full meaning of the words as applied to the triumphant final state (so Grot., Est., Calvin., Wetst., al., interpreting them of  knowledge, of  security, of the  lordship of one sect over another ), misses the force of the irony, and the meaning of the latter part of the verse.
	 χωρὶς ἡμῶν ] ‘because  we, as your fathers in Christ, have ever looked forward to  present you , as our glory and joy, in that day.’ There is an exquisite delicacy of irony, which Chrys. has well caught: πολλὴ ἔμφασις ἐνταῦθα καὶ πρὸς τοὺς διδασκάλους κ . πρὸς τοὺς μαθητάς . καὶ τὸ ἀσυνείδητον δὲ αὐτῶν δείκνυται κ . τὸ σφόδρα ἀνόητον . ὃ γὰρ λέγει , τοῦτό ἐστιν . ἐν μὲν τοῖς πόνοις φησὶν εἶναι πάντα κοινὰ καὶ ἡμῖν κ . ὑμῖν , ἐν δὲ τοῖς ἐπάθλοις κ . τοῖς στεφάνοις ὑμεῖς πρῶτοι . p. 99.
	The latter part of the verse is said  bonâ fide and with solemnity:  And I would indeed ( γε strengthens the wish; so ἡ δ ʼ εἵλεθ ʼ … ὥς γε μήποτ ʼ ὤφελεν λαβεῖν … Μενέλαον , Eur. Iph. Aul. 70. Hartung, i. 373.
	 ὄφελον is used in LXX and N. T. as a particle, with the indic.: also with optative. See, for both, reff.)  that ye did reign (that the kingdom of the Lord was actually come, and ye reigning with Him),  that we also might reign together with you (that we, though deposed from our  proper place , might at least be vouchsafed a humble share in your kingly glory).
