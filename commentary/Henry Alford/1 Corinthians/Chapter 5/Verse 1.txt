<b> 1</b>.]<b> hath</b> (as wife most probably, not merely<i> as concubine</i>: the word in Such cases universally in the New Test. signifying<i> to possess in marriage</i>: and the words,<i> he that did this deed</i>, ver. 2,<i> and him that hath so done this deed</i>, ver. 3, seem to point to a consummation of marriage, not to mere concubinage)<b> his father’s wife</b> (i. e. his step-mother, see Lev. xviii. 8: the Apostle uses the designation,<i> his father's wife</i>, to point out the disgrace more plainly. It may seem astonishing that the authorities in the Corinthian church should have allowed such a case to escape them, or if known, should have tolerated it. Perhaps the universal laxity of morals at Corinth may have weakened the severity even of the Christian elders: perhaps as has often been suggested, the offender, if a Jewish convert, might defend his conduct by the Rabbinical maxim that in the case of a proselyte, the forbidden degrees were annulled,<i> a new birth</i> having been undergone by him. This latter however is rendered improbable by the fact that the Apostle says nothing of the<i> woman</i>, which he would have done, had she been a Christian:—and that Jewish maxim was taxed with the condition, that a proselyte might marry any of his or her former relatives, only provided they came over to the Jewish religion. The father was living, and is described in 2 Cor. vii. 12, as “he that suffered wrong;” and from the Apostle saying there that he did not write on<i> his account</i>, he was probably a Christian.
