<p><strong> 11. </strong> <strong> νῦν δὲ ἔγραψα</strong> ] <strong> But my meaning was</strong> …; ‘but, the case being so, that ye must needs consort with fornicators among the heathen, I wrote to you, not to consort, &amp;c.’
	</p>
<p>That this is the meaning and not ‘But <em> now</em> I write (the epistolary aorist), &amp;c.,’ seems plain, from the use of ἔγραψα twice so close together, and therefore probably in the same reference, from the fact noticed by Meyer, that if a contrast had been intended between ἐν τῇ ἐπιστολῇ and νῦν , ἐν τῇ ἐπ . must have <em> preceded</em> ἔγραψα : and from the usage of νῦν δέ , of which Hartung, Partikellehre, ii. 25, gives examples, e.g. Plut. Protag. p. 347, νῦν δὲ σφόδρα γὰρ καὶ περὶ τῶν μεγίστων ψευδόμενος δοκεῖς ἀληθῆ λέγειν , διὰ ταῦτά σε ἐγὼ ψέγω , and Lycurg. Leocr. p. 138, ἐβουλόμην δ ʼ ἂν , ὦ ἄνδρες … νῦν δὲ … See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:16">Hebrews 11:16</span> . Thus by the right rendering, we escape the awkward inference deducible from the ordinary interpretation, that the Apostle had previously given a command, and now retracted it.

<p><strong> ἐάν τις</strong> ] <strong> If one who is called a brother be</strong> , &amp;c. Œcumenius, Augustine, Ambrose, Estius, al., join ὀνομαζόμενος with πόρνος , and understand it either as = ὀνομαστός , ‘ <em> be a notorious</em> πόρνος , <em> &amp;c</em> .,’ or ‘ <em> be named a</em> πόρνος <em> &amp;c.</em> ’ But ὀνομαζόμ . or even ὀνομαστός , in the bad sense, is hardly admissible, and in either case Paul would have written ἀδελφός τις , the stress on ἀδελφός in that case requiring it to precede τις , as it now precedes ὀνομαζόμενος .
	</p>
<p><strong> εἰδωλολάτρης</strong> ] One who from any motive makes a compromise with the habits of the heathen, and partakes in their sacrifices: Chrys. well remarks, προκαταβάλλεται τὸν περὶ τῶν εἰδωλοθύτων λόγον ὃν μετὰ ταῦτα μέλλει γυμνάζεσθαι .
	</p>
<p><strong> μέθυσος</strong> was, in pure Greek, not used of a man, but of a woman only. So Phrynichus, p. 151 (but see Lobeck’s note), <strong> μέθυσος ἀνὴρ</strong> οὐκ ἐρεῖς , ἀλλὰ <strong> μεθυστικός</strong> <strong> ·</strong> γυναῖκα δὲ ἐρεῖς μέθυσον κ . μεθύσην : and Pollux, vi. 25 (Wetst.), μέθυσος ἐπὶ ἀνδρῶν Μενάνδρῳ δεδόσθω .
	</p>
<p>Seeing that μηδὲ συνεσθίειν must imply a <em> more complete separation</em> than μὴ συναναμίγνυσθαι , it cannot be applied to the ἀγάπαι (as Mosheim, al.), but must keep its general meaning, <strong> not even to sit at table with such an one</strong> . This rule, as that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:14">2 Thessalonians 3:14</span> , regards only their <em> private</em> intercourse with the offending person: nothing is <em> here</em> said of public excommunication, though for some of these crimes it would be implied.</p>
