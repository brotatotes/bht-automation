<b> 11. as it is, I wrote unto you]</b> i.e.<b> my</b><b> meaning was....;— ‘but</b>, the case being so, that ye must needs consort with fornicators among the heathen, I wrote to you, not to consort, &c.’—That this is the meaning, and not, as A.V., ‘But<i> now I have written</i>, &c., seems plain; I have given the reasons in my note in the Greek Test. Thus by the right rendering, we escape the awkward inference deducible from the ordinary interpretation,—that the Apostle had previously given a command, and now retracted it.<br><br><b> an idolater]</b> One who from any motive makes a compromise with the habits of the heathen, and partakes in their sacrifices: Chrysostom well remarks, “He introduces by anticipation the subject of things offered to idols, which he is about to treat by and by.” Seeing that<b> no not to eat</b> must imply<i> a more</i><i> complete separation</i> than<i> not to company</i>, it cannot be applied to the<i> agape</i>, or<i> love</i>-<i>feasts</i> only, but must keep its general meaning,—<b>not even to sit at table with such an one</b>.—This rule, as that in 2 Thess. iii. 15, regards only their<i> private</i> intercourse with the offending person: nothing is<i> here</i> said of public excommunication, though for some of these crimes it would be implied.
