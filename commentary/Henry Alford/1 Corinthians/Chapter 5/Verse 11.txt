<b> 11. as it is, I wrote unto you]</b> i.e.<b> my</b><b> meaning was....;— ‘but</b>, the case being so, that ye must needs consort with fornicators among the heathen, I wrote to you, not to consort, &c.’—That this is the meaning, and not, as A.V., ‘But<i> now I have written</i>, &c., seems plain; I have given the reasons in my note in the Greek Test. Thus by the right rendering, we escape the awkward inference deducible from the ordinary interpretation,—that the Apostle had previously given a command, and now retracted it.
