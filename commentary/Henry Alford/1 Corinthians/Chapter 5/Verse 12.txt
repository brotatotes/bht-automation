 12. ]  Ground of the above limitation .
	 τί γάρ μοι  .… ]  for what concern of mine is it …? So Ælian, Var. H. vi. 11, τοὺς δὲ ἄλλους ἐῶ . τί γάρ μοι κωφοῖς κ . ἀνοήτοις συμβουλεύειν τὰ λυσιτελέστατα ; see other examples in. Wetst.
	 τοὺς ἔξω ] reff. It was among the Jews the usual term for the Gentiles. Cf. Schöttgen in loc.
	He means, ‘this might have been easily understood to be my meaning: for what concern have I with pronouncing sentence on the world without, or with giving rules of discipline for  them? I could only have referred to persons  among yourselves .’
	 οὐχὶ τοὺς ἔσω ] “Ex eo, quod in ecclesia fieri solet, interpretari debuistis monitum meum, 1 Corinthians 5:9 . Cives judicatis, non alienos: quanto magis ego.” Bengel. But I am not quite certain of this interpretation, which is also that of De Wette and Meyer, because it would more naturally correspond to οὐχὶ τοὺς ἔσω καὶ ὑμεῖς κρίνετε ; A preferable way seems to be this; ‘My judgment was meant to  lead your judgment. This being the case, what concern had I with  those without? Is it not on  those within, that your judgments are passed?’ The arrangement mentioned by Theophylact, and adopted by Knatchbull, Hammond, Michaelis, Rosenm., al., οὐχί · τοὺς ἔσω ὑμεῖς κρίνετε , ‘  No: those within do ye (imper.)  judge,’ is clearly wrong, for οὐχί is no answer to τί , and would require ἀλλά after it, even supposing μοι τοὺς ἔξω κρίνειν and τοὺς ἔσω ὑμεῖς κρίνετε formed any intelligible logical contrast, which they do not.
