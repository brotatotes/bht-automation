<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] <strong> But those who are without</strong> GOD <strong> judgeth.</strong> The pres. κρίνει both expresses better the attribute and office of God, and answers better to the other <em> presents</em> than the future κρινεῖ . I have therefore retained it. The future perhaps came from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:4">Hebrews 13:4</span> . <em> ‘To judge those without, is God’s matter</em> .’ These remarks about <em> judging</em> form a transition point to the subject of the next chapter. But having now finished his explanation of the prohibition formerly given, and with it the subject of the fornicator among them, he gives, before passing on, a plain command in terms for the excommunication (but no more: <em> not the punishment</em> mentioned in 1Co 5:3-5 ) of the offender. And this he does in the very words of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+24:7">Deuteronomy 24:7</span> (from which the reading καὶ ἐξαρεῖτε has come).

<p><strong> ὑμῶν αὐτῶν</strong> is in Deut., but need not therefore lose its emphatic force: <strong> from among your own selves</strong> .</p>
