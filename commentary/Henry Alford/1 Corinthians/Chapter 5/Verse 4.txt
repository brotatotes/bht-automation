<b> 4.]</b> ‘This sentence stands thus: In the name of our Lord Jesus belongs to the clause to<b> deliver such an one</b>,<b>&c.</b>, that which intervenes being parenthetical<b> (when ye have been assembled together and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus)</b>.<br><br><b> my spirit,</b> i.e. ‘<b>I</b> myself, in spirit, endowed by our Lord Jesus with apostolic power:’ and then the words<b> with the power of</b> our<b> Lord Jesus Christ</b> belong to<b> my spirit</b>, and are not to be taken as indicating a mere element in the assembly.<i> What does the sentence here prescribed import</i>? Not mere excommunication, though it is doubtless included. It was a delegation to the Corinthian church of a<i> special power, reserved to the Apostles themselves, of inflicting corporeal death or disease</i> as a punishment for sin. Of this we have notable examples in the case of Ananias and Sapphira, and Elymas, and another hinted at 1 Tim. i. 20. The congregation itself could<i> expel from among themselves</i>,—but it could not<i> give over to Satan for the</i><i> destruction of his flesh</i>, without the authorized concurrence of the Apostle’s<i> spirit, with the power of the Lord Jesus Christ</i>. What the<i> destruction of his flesh</i> was to be, does not appear: certainly more than the mere destruction of his pride and lust by repentance, as some suppose: rather, as Chrysostom suggests, “that Satan might afflict him with a malignant ulcer, or other disease.” Estius’s objection to this, that in 2 Cor. ii. and vii. we find no trace of such bodily chastisement is not to the point,—because we have no proof that this delivering to Satan<i> was ever inflicted</i>,—nor does the Apostle<i> command it,</i> but only describes it as his own determination, held as it were<i> in terrorem</i> over the offender. See note on ver. 13.—Observe, destruction of his<b> flesh</b>, the offending element, not of his body. St. Paul could not say this, seeing that the body is to partake of the salvation of the spirit;—but not the<i> flesh</i>, see ch. xv. 50.
