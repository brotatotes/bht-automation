<b> 7.] The</b> old leaven is not the<i> man</i>, but the<i> crime</i>, attaching to their character as a church, which was a remnant of their unconverted state, their “<i>old man</i>.” This they are to purge out from among them. The command alludes to the careful ‘purging out’ from the houses of every thing leavened before the commencement of the feast of unleavened bread.—<b>That ye may be a new lump</b> (opposed to the “<i>old man</i>” of old and dissolute days),<b> as ye are</b> (normally, and by your Christian profession)<b> unleavened</b> (i. e. dead to sin and free from it). This indicating the state by profession the<i> normal state,</i> as a fact, and the<i> grounding of exhortations on it</i>, is common enough with our Apostle,—see Rom. vi. 3, 4: ch. iii. 16, and other places, and involves no tautology here, any more than elsewhere.—An unfortunate interpretation has been given to these words,—as ye are<i> now celebrating the feast of unleavened bread</i>;’ and has met with some recent defenders. See in my Greek Test. the reasons which have led me to decide against this view. I can only say here, that the reference is one<i> wholly alien from the habit and spirit of our Apostle</i>. The ordinances of the old law are to him<i> not</i><i> points on whose actual observance to ground spiritual lessons</i>, but things passed in, their literal acceptance, and become<i> spiritual verities</i> in Christ. He thus regards the Corinthian church as (normally)<i> the unleavened lump</i> at the Passover; he beseeches them to put away the old leaven from among them, to correspond with this their normal state:<b> for</b>, he adds, it is high time for us to be unleavened in very deed, seeing that<b> our passover was sacrificed</b> (see reff.: and compare Heb. ix. 26, 28),<b> even Christ</b> (the days of unleavened bread<i> began</i> with the Passover-sacrifice):<b> so then let us keep the feast</b> (not the<i> actual</i> Passover, but the continued Passover-feast of Christians on whose behalf Christ has died. There is no change of metaphor: the Corinthians are the living<i> loaves of bread</i>, as believers are the living stones of the spiritual temple),<b> not with</b> (literally,<b> in</b>, as our element) t<b> he old leaven</b> (general—our old unconverted state),<b> neither</b> (particular)<b> with</b> (<b>in</b>, see al ove)<b> the leaven of malice and wickedness</b> (the genitives are of apposition,— ‘the leaven which is vice and wickedness’);<b> but with (in) the unleavened bread</b> (literally, unleavened things, see Exod. xii. 15, 18)<b> of sincerity and truth.</b><b> 9–18.]</b><i> Correction of their misunderstanding of a former command of his respecting keeping company with fornicators</i>.
