 9. ]  I wrote to you in my letter (not  this present epistle , which  τῇ ἐπιστολῇ  might mean, see reff., for there is nothing in the preceding part of this Epistle which can by any possibility be so interpreted, certainly not either 1Co 5:2 or 1 Corinthians 5:6 , which are commonly alleged by those who thus explain it and ἐν τῇ ἐπιστολῇ would be a superfluous and irrelevant addition, if he meant the letter on which he was now engaged: but, a  former epistle , which has not come down to us: cf. the similar expression, ref. 2 Cor. used with reference to  this Epistle, and see note on 2 Corinthians 1:15-16 . So Ambrose, Calvin, Beza, Estius, Grot., Calov., Bengel, Wetst., Mosh., De Wette, Meyer: so also Lightfoot, understanding however an Epistle  committed to Timothy , see ch. 1 Corinthians 4:17 ; which could not be, as Timothy was not coming to them till after they had received this Epistle, ch. 1 Corinthians 16:10 , and thus the words would be unintelligible to them: on the other side are Chrys., Theodoret, Theophyl., Erasm., Corn.-a-lapide, Wolf, al. It has been suggested (see Stanley, in loc.) that the whole passage, ch. 1Co 5:9 to 1 Corinthians 6:8 , may have been a postscript or note inserted subsequently to the rest of the Epistle, and referring especially to ch. 1Co 6:9-20 )  not to keep company with fornicators.
