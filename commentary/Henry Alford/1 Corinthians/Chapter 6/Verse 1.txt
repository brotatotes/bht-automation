He points at no particular<i> individual</i>, but any one: for he proceeds in the plural, in verses 4, 7. Chrysostom remarks that the Apostle uses the term the<b> unjust</b>, and not. the<i> unbelievers</i>, to put the matter before them in its strongest light, seeing that it was<i> justice</i> of which they were in search in going to law.â€”The Rabbinical books prohibited the going to law before Gentiles In adding, and<b> not before the saints,</b> the Apostle does not mean that the Christians had their<i> courts of law,</i> but that they should submit their differences to<i> courts of arbitration</i> among themselves. Such courts of arbitration were common among the Jews.
