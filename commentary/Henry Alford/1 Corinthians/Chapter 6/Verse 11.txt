<p><strong> 11</strong> .] ‘These things were the <em> former state</em> of some among you: but ye are now in a far different state.’ <strong> These things</strong> (I cannot think with Meyer that ταῦτα is used with an implication of contempt, <em> such a horde</em> , or <em> rabble</em> : it is rather ‘ <em> of such a kind</em> ,’ see Winer, Gr. § 23.5) <strong> were some of you</strong> ( τινες limits the ὑμεῖς which is the suppressed subject of <strong> ἦτε</strong> <strong> ): but ye washed them off</strong> (viz. at your baptism. The 1 aor. mid. cannot by any possibility be passive in signification, as it is generally, for doctrinal reasons, here rendered. On the other hand the middle sense has no doctrinal import, regarding merely the fact of their having submitted themselves to Christian baptism. See ref. Acts), <strong> but</strong> (there is in the repetition of ἀλλά , the triumph of one who was under God the instrument of this mighty change) <strong> ye were sanctified</strong> (not in the dogmatic sense of <em> progressive</em> sanctification, but so that whereas before you were unholy, by the reception of the Holy Ghost you became <em> dedicated to God</em> and <em> holy</em> ), <strong> but ye were justified</strong> (by faith in Christ, you received the δικαιοσύνη θεοῦ , Rom 1:17 ), <strong> in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and in the</strong> (working of the) <strong> Spirit of our God</strong> . These two last clauses must not be fancifully (as Meyer, al.) assigned amongst the preceding. They belong to <em> all,</em> as De Wette rightly maintains. The spiritual washing in baptism, the sanctification of the children of God, the justification of the believer, are all wrought in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and are each and all the work of the Spirit of our God.
