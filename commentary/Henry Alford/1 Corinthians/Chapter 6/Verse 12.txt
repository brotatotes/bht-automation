<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] <em> Statement of the true doctrine of Christian freedom</em> . <strong> πάντα μοι ἔξεστιν</strong> are <em> the bona fide words of the Apostle himself</em> , not, as some have understood them, the saying of an opponent cited by him. For (1) the sentiment is a true Christian axiom: πάντα being of course understood, as it evidently was even by the abusers of the doctrine, of things (supposed by them) ἀδιάφορα . (2) It is not introduced by any clause indicative of its being the saying of another, which is Paul’s habit in such cases, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:19">Romans 11:19</span> . (3) The Apostle does not either deny or qualify the ἔξεστιν , but takes up the matter from another point of view, viz. the συμφέρει . The μοι is spoken in the person of Christians generally. “Sæpe Paulus prima persona singulari eloquitur quæ vim habent gnomes: in hac præsertim epistola, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:15">1 Corinthians 6:15</span> , ch. 1Co 7:7 , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:13">1 Corinthians 8:13</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:23">1 Corinthians 10:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:29-30">1 Corinthians 10:29-30</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:11">1 Corinthians 14:11</span> .” Bengel.

<p><strong> συμφέρει</strong> <strong> are advantageous</strong> in the most general sense: distinguished from οἰκοδομεῖ , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:23">1 Corinthians 10:23</span> , where the words again occur. Meyer cites from Theodor. Mops [13] , ἐπειδὴ γὰρ οὐ πάντα συμφέρει , δῆλον ὡς οὐ πᾶσι χρηστέον , ἀλλὰ τοῖς ὠφελοῦσι μόνοις .

<p><strong> ἀλλ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> οὐκ ἐγὼ ἐξ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Meyer thinks that the ἐγώ here has an emphasis, as meaning <em> the real I</em> , my moral personality. But this can hardly be so: the real emphasis is on οὐκ , and ἐγώ corresponds to μοι , expressed more to bring out the first person as the <em> sample of Christians in general</em> , than for any such formal distinction.

<p><strong> ἐξουσιασθήσομαι</strong> ] <strong> I will not be deprived of my freedom by any practice</strong> ; i.e. indulge in any practice which shall mar this liberty and render it no real freedom, making me to be one under ἐξουσία , instead of one exercising it. The play on ἔξεστι and ἐξουσία cannot be given in English.</p>
