<b> 12.]</b><i> Statement of the true doctrine of Christian freedom</i><br><br><b> All things are lawful unto me</b> are the bona fide words of the Apostle himself, not, as some have understood them, the saying of an opponent cited by him. For (1) the sentiment is a true Christian axiom: all things being of course understood, as it evidently was even by the abusers of the doctrine, of things (supposed by them) indifferent. (2) It is not introduced by any clause indicative of its being the saying of another, which is St. Paul’s habit in such cases, see Rom. xi. 19. (3) The Apostle does not either deny or qualify the<i> lawfulness</i>, but takes up the matter from another point of view, the<i> expediency</i>. The “<i>me</i>” is spoken in the person of Christians generally. So also in ver. 15, ch. vii. 7, viii. 13, x. 23, 29, 30, xiv.<br><br><b> 11. not all things are expedient, or advantageous</b>—in the most general sense: distinguished from “<i>are edifying</i>,” ch. x. 23, where the words again occur. The assertion is equivalent to<b> I will not be deprived of my freedom by any practice</b>;—i. e. indulge in any practice which shall mar this liberty and render it no real freedom, making me to be one<i> under power</i>, instead of one exercising it.
