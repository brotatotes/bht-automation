 12. ]  Statement of the true doctrine of Christian freedom .  πάντα μοι ἔξεστιν are  the bona fide words of the Apostle himself , not, as some have understood them, the saying of an opponent cited by him. For (1) the sentiment is a true Christian axiom: πάντα being of course understood, as it evidently was even by the abusers of the doctrine, of things (supposed by them) ἀδιάφορα . (2) It is not introduced by any clause indicative of its being the saying of another, which is Paul’s habit in such cases, see Romans 11:19 . (3) The Apostle does not either deny or qualify the ἔξεστιν , but takes up the matter from another point of view, viz. the συμφέρει . The μοι is spoken in the person of Christians generally. “Sæpe Paulus prima persona singulari eloquitur quæ vim habent gnomes: in hac præsertim epistola, 1 Corinthians 6:15 , ch. 1Co 7:7 , 1 Corinthians 8:13 , 1 Corinthians 10:23 ; 1 Corinthians 10:29-30 , 1 Corinthians 14:11 .” Bengel.
	 συμφέρει  are advantageous in the most general sense: distinguished from οἰκοδομεῖ , ch. 1 Corinthians 10:23 , where the words again occur. Meyer cites from Theodor. Mops [13] , ἐπειδὴ γὰρ οὐ πάντα συμφέρει , δῆλον ὡς οὐ πᾶσι χρηστέον , ἀλλὰ τοῖς ὠφελοῦσι μόνοις .
	 [13] Theodore, Bp. of Mopsuestia, 399 428
	 ἀλλ  ʼ   οὐκ ἐγὼ ἐξ  . ] Meyer thinks that the ἐγώ here has an emphasis, as meaning  the real I , my moral personality. But this can hardly be so: the real emphasis is on οὐκ , and ἐγώ corresponds to μοι , expressed more to bring out the first person as the  sample of Christians in general , than for any such formal distinction.
	 ἐξουσιασθήσομαι ]  I will not be deprived of my freedom by any practice ; i.e. indulge in any practice which shall mar this liberty and render it no real freedom, making me to be one under ἐξουσία , instead of one exercising it. The play on ἔξεστι and ἐξουσία cannot be given in English.
