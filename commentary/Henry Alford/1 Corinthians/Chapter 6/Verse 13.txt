 13. ]  τῇ κοιλ  . , scil. ἐστιν . The belly is their appointed receptacle they, its appointed pabulum. Of course even this part of the argument must be understood within the limits of οὐ πάντα συμφέρει .
	 ὁ δὲ θ  .…   καταργ  . ] viz.  at the appearing of the Lord : when, ch. 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 , we shall be changed from a σῶμα ψυχικόν , to be a σῶμα πνευματικόν : not,  at death .
	 τῇ πορν  . ] The body was not made for the practice of fornication. The reciprocal subserviency of the belly and meats is shewn by their coextensiveness in duration, and perishing together: but when πορνεία (and even that lawful use which is physically the same, but which is not  here contemplated) shall have for ever passed away, the body shall be subserving  its real use that of being an instrument for the Lord’s work.
	 κ  .   ὁ κύρ  .   τῷ σώμ  . ] not,  only for the body: but  for the body; to sanctify our bodies by His Spirit, and finally to glorify them for Himself, see Romans 8:11 . This final reference must not be  excluded here, though it is not the principal thought: rather, the redemption of the body from sin, and making it into a member of Himself by the Spirit.
