<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] <strong> τῇ κοιλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , scil. ἐστιν . The belly is their appointed receptacle they, its appointed pabulum. Of course even this part of the argument must be understood within the limits of οὐ πάντα συμφέρει .

<p><strong> ὁ δὲ θ</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> καταργ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] viz. <em> at the appearing of the Lord</em> : when, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:51-52">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</span> , we shall be changed from a σῶμα ψυχικόν , to be a σῶμα πνευματικόν : not, <em> at death</em> .

<p><strong> τῇ πορν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The body was not made for the practice of fornication. The reciprocal subserviency of the belly and meats is shewn by their coextensiveness in duration, and perishing together: but when πορνεία (and even that lawful use which is physically the same, but which is not <em> here</em> contemplated) shall have for ever passed away, the body shall be subserving <em> its real use</em> that of being an instrument for the Lord’s work.

<p><strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὁ κύρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τῷ σώμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] not, <em> only</em> for the body: but <strong> for the body;</strong> to sanctify our bodies by His Spirit, and finally to glorify them for Himself, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span> . This final reference must not be <em> excluded</em> here, though it is not the principal thought: rather, the redemption of the body from sin, and making it into a member of Himself by the Spirit.</p>
