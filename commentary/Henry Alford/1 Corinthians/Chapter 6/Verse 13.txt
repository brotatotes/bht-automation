<b> 13.]</b> The belly is the appointed receptacle for meats—they, its appointed nourishment.<br><br><b> God shall destroy</b>…] viz.<i> at the appearing of the Lord</i>: when, ch. xv. 51, 52, we shall be changed from a<i> spiritual body</i>, to be a<i> natural body</i>: not,<i> at death.</i> But, on the other hand, the body was not made for the practice of fornication. The reciprocal subserviency of the belly and meats is shewn by their coextensiveness in duration, and perishing together: but when<i> fornication</i> (and even that lawful use which is physical the same, but which is not ere contemplated) shall have for ever passed away, the body shall be subserving its real use—that of being an instrument for the Lord’s work.<br><br><b> and the Lord for the body]</b> not,<i> only</i> for the body; but for the body; to sanctify our bodies by His Spirit, and finally to glorify them for Himself, see Rom. viii. 11. This final reference must not be<i> excluded</i> here, though it is not the principal thought:—rather the redemption of the body from sin, and making it into a member of Himself by the Spirit.
