<p><strong> 14</strong> .] So far from the case of the Lord and the body answering to the other, God <strong> raised up the Lord</strong> (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span> , al. fr.), <strong> and will raise up us too by His power</strong> . I cannot adopt here the reading ( ἐξήγειρεν ), or the view, of Meyer. He holds, that all reference to the <em> resurrection</em> , as a thing <em> future</em> , is out of place: that the Apostle refers to the virtual and proleptic resurrection which <em> has already taken place</em> in the case of the believer, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:6">Ephesians 2:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span> , and thinks that the reading ἐξεγερεῖ has arisen from not seeing this. But how unnatural will the construction thus be ὁ δὲ θεὸς καὶ τὸν κύριον ἤγειρεν , καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐξήγειρεν , διὰ τ . δυν . αὐτοῦ ! I can conceive no account of such a sentence, except that some emphasis is meant to be laid on the distinction between ἤγειρεν and <strong> ἐξ</strong> ήγειρεν which idea (maintained by Bengel, al.) Meyer himself very properly repudiates: see below. The future corresponds to καταργήσει , and is used with ἡμᾶς , contrary to the usual practice of Paul, who expected to be alive at the παρουσία , as the expression, in the first person, of the truth of the future <em> resurrection, not destruction</em> of the body. <strong> ἤγειρεν</strong> , viz. ἐκ νεκρῶν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:15">Acts 3:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:24">Romans 4:24</span> , and passim: <strong> ἐξεγερεῖ</strong> , viz. ἐκ νεκρῶν . So that there is no real difference between the two words.</p>
