 14 .] So far from the case of the Lord and the body answering to the other, God  raised up the Lord (Romans 8:11 , al. fr.),  and will raise up us too by His power . I cannot adopt here the reading ( ἐξήγειρεν ), or the view, of Meyer. He holds, that all reference to the  resurrection , as a thing  future , is out of place: that the Apostle refers to the virtual and proleptic resurrection which  has already taken place in the case of the believer, as Ephesians 2:6 ; Colossians 2:12 , and thinks that the reading ἐξεγερεῖ has arisen from not seeing this. But how unnatural will the construction thus be ὁ δὲ θεὸς καὶ τὸν κύριον ἤγειρεν , καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐξήγειρεν , διὰ τ . δυν . αὐτοῦ ! I can conceive no account of such a sentence, except that some emphasis is meant to be laid on the distinction between ἤγειρεν and  ἐξ ήγειρεν which idea (maintained by Bengel, al.) Meyer himself very properly repudiates: see below. The future corresponds to καταργήσει , and is used with ἡμᾶς , contrary to the usual practice of Paul, who expected to be alive at the παρουσία , as the expression, in the first person, of the truth of the future  resurrection, not destruction of the body.  ἤγειρεν , viz. ἐκ νεκρῶν , Acts 3:15 ; Romans 4:24 , and passim:  ἐξεγερεῖ , viz. ἐκ νεκρῶν . So that there is no real difference between the two words.
