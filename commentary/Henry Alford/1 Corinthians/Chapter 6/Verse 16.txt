	 κολλ  . “  ublicher Vusdrud fur Geschlechtsvereinigung. ” De Wette.
	 τῇ πόρνῃ ]  with a harlot , generic: or which in fact amounts to the same, with ‘the harlot,’ presupposed in the hypothesis.
	 ἓν σῶμα , viz. ‘  with her .’ The full construction would be ὅτι ὁ κολλ . τῇ πόρ . καὶ ἡ πόρ . ἓν σ . εἰσιν , but he is here bringing out the criminality of the  fornicator , and leaves the other out of view.

To render φησιν impersonal, ‘it says,’ ‘  heißt es ,’ though justified by classical usage, see Winer, edn. 6, § 58. 9, would, as Meyer remarks, be altogether without precedent in the citations of Paul. The words  οἱ δύο are not in the Heb., but in the LXX and the Samaritan Pentateuch, and are found in the Rabbinical citations of the passage. See note on Matthew 19:5 .
