<p><strong> 16</strong> .] Explanation and justification of the expression πόρνης μέλη . ἤ , as De Wette well, “Do you think the expression ποιήσω πόρν . μέλη too strong?”

<p><strong> τῇ πόρνῃ</strong> ] <strong> with a harlot</strong> , generic: or which in fact amounts to the same, with ‘the harlot,’ presupposed in the hypothesis.

The words <strong> οἱ δύο</strong> are not in the Heb., but in the LXX and the Samaritan Pentateuch, and are found in the Rabbinical citations of the passage. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:5">Matthew 19:5</span> .</p>
