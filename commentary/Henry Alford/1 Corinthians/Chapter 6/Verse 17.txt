<p><strong> 17</strong> .] Union to God, His service, and His ways, is often expressed by this word ( κολλ .) in the LXX (reff.): but here <em> that inner union with Christ in spirit</em> is meant, which is the normal state of every believer, and of which it may be said that he ἓν πν . ἐστιν with Christ. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21">John 17:21</span> , and the parable of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:1-7">John 15:1-7</span> . Meyer rightly remarks, that the mystical marriage between Christ and His Church must not (as Olsh. from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:23">Ephesians 5:23</span> ff.) be pressed here, as the relations of the compared are not correspondent. Still, however, the inner verity of that mystical relation is the <em> ground</em> of both passages.</p>
