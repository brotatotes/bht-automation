See John 17:21 , and the parable of John 15:1-7 . Meyer rightly remarks, that the mystical marriage between Christ and His Church must not (as Olsh. from Ephesians 5:23 ff.) be pressed here, as the relations of the compared are not correspondent. Still, however, the inner verity of that mystical relation is the  ground of both passages.
