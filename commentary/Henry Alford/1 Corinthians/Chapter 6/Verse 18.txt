But fornication is the  alienating that body which is the Lord’s, and making it a harlot’s body it is sin  against a man’s own body , in its very nature, against  the verity and nature of his body; not an  effect on the body from participation of things without, but a  contradiction of the truth of the body, wrought  within itself . When  man and  wife are one in the Lord, united  by His ordinance , no such alienation of the body takes place, and consequently no sin.
