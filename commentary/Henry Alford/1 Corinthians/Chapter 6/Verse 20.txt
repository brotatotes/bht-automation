<b> 20.]</b><i> Proof, that ye are not your own.</i> The<i> possession</i> of your body as His temple, by the Holy Ghost, is a<i> presumptive proof</i> that ye are not; but there is also a proof in<i> matter of fact</i>:<b> For ye were bought</b> (not, as A.V.,<i> are bought</i>, which destroys the historic reference)<b> with a price</b> (viz. the<i> blood of Christ</i>, see 1 Pet. i. 18, 19; Matt. xx. 28; Gal. iii. 18. This<i> buying</i> is here mentioned mainly with reference to the<i> right of possession</i>, which Christ has thereby acquired in us. In other places it is alleged as a freeing from other services: e.g. that of sin [Rom. vi. 17, 18], of the law and its curse [Gal. iii] of Satan [Col. i. 13]):<br><br><b> glorify therefore God</b> (i. e. not<i> praise</i> God, but glorify Him by your acts)<b> in your body</b> (not,<i> by means of</i> your body, but<i> in your body</i>, as the temple of God; see John xiii. 32). The words “<i>and in your spirit, which are God’s</i>,” added in the A.V., are wanting in almost all our earliest authorities.
