The <em> possession</em> of your body as His temple, by the Holy Ghost, is a <em> presumptive proof</em> that ye are not; but there is also a proof in <em> matter of fact</em> : <strong> For ye were bought</strong> (not, as E. V. <em> are bought</em> , which destroys the historic reference) <strong> with a price</strong> (viz. the <em> blood of Christ</em> , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18-19">1 Peter 1:18-19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span> , not as Vulg. <em> prelio magno</em> : τιμῆς merely recalls the fact <em> here</em> , that <em> a price</em> was paid and so the purchase completed). This <em> buying</em> is here mentioned mainly with reference to the <em> right of possession</em> , which Christ has thereby acquired in us. In other places it is alleged as a freeing from other services: e.g. that of sin ( Rom 6:17-18 ), of the law and its curse (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:0">Galatians 3:0</span> .), of Satan ( Col 1:13 ).
