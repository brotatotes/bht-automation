 10.   οὐκ ἐγώ  ,   ἀλλὰ ὁ κύριος ]  Ordinarily , the Apostle ( ἐγώ ) writes, commands, gives his advice,  under conscious inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God . See 1 Corinthians 7:40 . He claims expressly. ch. 1 Corinthians 14:37 , that the things ἃ γράφω ὑμῖν should be recognized as κυρίου ( ἐντολή ). But here he is about to give them a command resting, not merely on  inspired apostolic authority , great and undoubted as that was, but on that of THE LORD HIMSELF. So that all supposed distinction between the Apostle’s own writing  of himself and  of the Lord , is quite irrelevant. He  never wrote  of himself , being a vessel of the Holy Ghost, who ever spoke by him to the church. The distinction between that which is imperative, and that which is optional, that which is more and that which is less weighty in his writings, is to be made by the cautious and believing Christian, from a wise appreciation of the  subject-matter , and of the  circumstances under which it was written. ALL  is the outpouring of the Spirit , but  not all for all time, nor  all on the primary truths of the faith.
	 Not I, but the Lord , viz. in ref. Matt. See also Mark 10:12 , where the  woman’s part is brought out. That  it occupies the  principal place here, is perhaps because the  Christian women at Corinth may have been the most ready to make the separation: or perhaps, because the woman, from her place in the matrimonial union, may be more properly said ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς χωρισθῆναι than the man ἀπὸ γυναικὸς χωρισθῆναι .
	 χωρισθ  . ,  be separated , whether by  formal divorce or  otherwise ; the καταλλαγήτω below, is like this, an  absolutepassive ; undefined whether by her own or her husband’s doing.
