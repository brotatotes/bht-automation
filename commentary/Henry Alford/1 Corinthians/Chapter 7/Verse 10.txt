<b> 10. not I, but the Lord</b>]<i> Ordinarily</i>, the Apostle (I) writes, commands, gives his advice,<i> under</i><i> conscious inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.</i> See ver. 40. He claims expressly, ch. xiv. 37, that the things “<i>which I write unto you</i>” should be recognized as “<i>the Lord's commandment</i>.” But here he is about to give them a command resting, not merely on<i> inspired apostolic authority</i>, great and undoubted as that was, but on that of THE LORD HIMSELF. So that all supposed distinction between the Apostle’s own writing<i> of himself and of the Lord</i>, is quite irrelevant. He<i> never</i> wrote<i> of himself</i>, being a vessel of the Holy Ghost, who ever spoke by him to the church. The distinction between that which is imperative, and that which is optional, that which is more and that which is less weighty in his writings, is to be made by the cautious and believing Christian, from a wise appreciation of the s<i> ubject-matter,</i> and of the<i> circumstances under which</i> it was written. ALL<i> is the outpouring of the Spirit, but not all for all time, nor all on the primary truths</i> of the faith.—<b>Not I, but the Lord</b>, viz. in the reff. especially Matt. See also in Mark, where the<i> woman’s</i> part is brought out. That it occupies the<i> principal place</i> here, is perhaps because the<i> Christian women</i> at Corinth may have been the most ready to make the separation: or perhaps, because the woman, from her place in the matrimonial union, may be more properly said to be separated from the man, than the man to be separated from the woman.<br><br><b> be separated,</b> whether by<i> formal divorce or otherwise</i>; the “<i>let her be reconciled</i>” below, is like this, an<i> absolute passive</i>; undefined whether by her own or her husband’s doing.
