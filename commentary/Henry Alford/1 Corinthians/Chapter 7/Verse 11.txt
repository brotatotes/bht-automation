<b> 11.</b>] The former part of the verse, as far as “<i>husband</i>,” is parenthetical. It supposes a case of<i> actual</i> separation, contrary of course to Christ’s command: if such have really taken place, the additional sin of a new marriage (Matt. v. 32) must not be committed, but the breach healed as soon as possible.<br><br><b> and that the husband leave not his wife]</b> The Apostle does not add the qualification “except for the cause of fornication,” found in Matt. v. 32 (xix. 9), but not in Mark x. 11 or Luke xvi. 18. But we cannot hence infer that he was not aware of it. The<i> rule</i>, not the exception, here was in his mind: and after what had been before said on the subject of fornication, the latter would be understood as a matter of course.
