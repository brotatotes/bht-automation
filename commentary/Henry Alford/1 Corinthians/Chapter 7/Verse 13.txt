 13 .] The change of construction καὶ γυνὴ ἥτις … καὶ οὗτος …, is found frequently with καί : so Il. α . 78, ἦ γὰρ ὀΐομαι ἄνδρα χολωσέμεν , ὃς μέγα πάντων | Ἀργείων κρατέει καί οἱ πείθονται Ἀχαιοί . See reff., and Kühner, ii. 526 (§ 799).
	Meyer remarks, that the Apostle uses the  vox media ἀφιέναι here, of  both parties , the husband and wife, not ἀπολύειν (as Matthew 5:31 , &c.), which would apply only to the husband. In the E. V. this identity of terms is unfortunately neglected. The same word,  part from , would well have expressed ἀφιέτω in both cases.
	By the Greek as well as Roman customs the  wife had the power of effecting a divorce . At Athens, when the divorce originated with the wife, she was said ἀπολείπειν the house of her husband: when with the husband, ἀποπεμπέσθαι . At Rome, the only exception to the wife’s liberty of effecting a divorce appears to have been in the case of a freedwoman who had married her patronus. See Smith’s Dict, of Gr. and Rom. Antt. artt. Divortium, and ἀπολείψεως δίκη . Olsh. thinks that Paul puts both alternatives, because he regards the  Christian party as the  superior one in the marriage. But, as Meyer remarks, this would be inconsistent with the fundamental law of marriage, Genesis 3:16 , and with the Apostle’s own view of it, ch. 1 Corinthians 11:3 , 1 Corinthians 14:34 ; Ephesians 5:22-23 ; 1 Timothy 2:11-12 .
