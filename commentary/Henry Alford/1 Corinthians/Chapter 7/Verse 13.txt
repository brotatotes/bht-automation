<b> 13.]</b> Meyer remarks, that the Apostle uses the general term leave here, of<i> both parties</i>, the husband and wife, not “<i>put away</i>” (as Matt. v. 31, &c.), which would apply only to the husband. In the A.V. this identity of terms is unfortunately neglected. The same word,<b> leave</b>, or<b> part from</b>, would well have expressed both cases.—<i>By the Greek as well as Roman customs, the wife had the power of effecting a divorce.</i> At Athens,—when the divorce originated with the wife, she was said to<i> leave</i> the house of her husband: when with the husband to<i> be sent away</i>. At Rome, the only exception to the wife’s liberty of effecting a divorce appears to have been in the case of a freedwoman who had married her patronus. Olshausen thinks that St. Paul puts both alternatives, because he regards the<i> Christian party as the superior one</i> in the marriage. But, as Meyer remarks, this would be inconsistent with the fundamental law of. marriage, Gen 16, and with the Apostle’s own view of it, ch. xi. 3, xv. 34; Eph. v. 22; 1 Tim, ii. 11, 12.
