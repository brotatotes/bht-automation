<b> 14.]</b><i> Ground of the above precept</i>.<br><br><b> is sanctified</b>] The meaning will best be apprehended by remembering (1) that<i> holiness</i>, under the Gospel, answers to dedication to God under the law; (2) that the sanctified under the Gospel are the<i> body of Christian men</i>, dedicated to God, and thus become His in a peculiar manner: (3) that this being so, things belonging to, relatives inseparably connected with,<i> the people of God</i>, are said to be<i> hallowed by their holiness</i>: not holy in themselves, but sanctified, i.e. included in the holiness of the faithful relative. Chrysostom well shews the distinction between this case and that in ch. vi. 15, that being an<i> impious</i> connexion,—in and under the condition of the<i> very state,</i> in which the other party is<i> impure</i>: whereas this is a connexion according to a pure and holy ordinance, by virtue of which, although the physical unity in both cases is the same, the<i> purity overbears the impurity</i>.<br><br><b> in the wife... in the brother]</b><i> in</i>, i.e. his or her<i> sanctity is situated</i> in, rests in,<i> the other</i>.<br><br> else; literally,<b> since in that case</b> (i. e. as understood, the<i> other</i> alternative,—the<i> non-hallowing</i>).<br><br><b> are]</b> not<i> would be</i>, nor<i> were</i>, as A.V., but<i> present</i>: because the supposed case is assumed and the ind. pres. used of what<i> has</i><i> place</i> on its assumption.<br><br><b> holy</b>] as above:<b> holy to the Lord</b>. On this<i> fact</i>,<i> Christian children being holy</i>, the argument is built. This being so,—they being hallowed, because the children of Christians,—it follows<i> that that union out of</i><i> which</i> they sprung, must as such have the same hallowed character; i.e. that the<i> insanctity</i> of the one parent is in it<i> overborne</i> by the<i> sanctity</i> of the other. The<i> fact</i> of the children of Christians, God’s spiritual people,<i> being holy</i>, is tacitly assumed as a matter of course, from the precedent of God’s ancient covenant people—With regard to the bearing of<i> this verse</i> on the subject of Infant Baptism,—it seems to me to have<i> none</i>, further than this: that it establishes the so far, between Christian and Jewish children, as to shew, that if the initiatory rite of the old covenant was administered to the one,—that of the new covenant, in so far as it was regarded as corresponding to circumcision would probably as a matter of course be administered to the other. Those who deny any such inference, forget, as it seems to me, that it is not<i> personal</i> holiness which is here predicated of the children, any more than of the unbelieving husband or wife, but<i> holiness of dedication</i>, by strict dependence<i> on one dedicated</i>. Notwithstanding this<i> holiness</i>, the Christian child is individually born in sin and a child of wrath; and individually needs the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, just as much as the Jewish child needed the typical purifying of circumcision and the sacrificial atonements of the law. So that in this<i> holiness</i> of the Christian child, there is nothing inconsistent with the idea, nor with the practice, of Infant Baptism.
