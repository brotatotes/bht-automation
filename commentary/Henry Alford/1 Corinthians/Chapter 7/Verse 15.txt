In this latter case, to abide in the union is imperative; in the other, if the unbeliever wishes to dissolve the union, it may be dissolved.<br><br><b> in peace]</b> Not the same as “<i>to peace</i>” (A. V.), but signifying the moral element<i> in which</i> we are called to be: see ver. 22 below.—The meaning is, “let the unbeliever depart, rather than by attempting to retain the union, endanger that peace of household and peace of spirit, which is part of the calling of a Christian.’—Observe, (1) that there is no contradiction in this license of breaking off such a marriage, to the command of our Lord in Matt. v. 32,—because the Apostle expressly asserts, ver. 12, that<i> our Lord’s words do not apply</i> to such marriages as are here contemplated. They were spoken to those<i> within the covenant</i>, and as such apply immediately to the wedlock of<i> Christians</i> (ver. 10), but<i> not to mixed marriages.</i> (2) That the question of re-marrying after such a separation, is here<i> left open</i>: on this, see note on Matt. v. 32. (3) That not a word here said can be so strained as to imply any license to<i> contract</i> marriages with unbelievers. Only those<i> already contracted</i> are dealt with: the<i> being unequally yoked with unbelievers</i> is expressly forbidden, 2 Cor. vi. 14, and by implication below, ver. 39.
