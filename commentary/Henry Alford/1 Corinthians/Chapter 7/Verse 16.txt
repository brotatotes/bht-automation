<b> 16.]</b> This verse is generally understood as a ground for remaining united, as ver. 13, in hope that conversion of the unbelieving party may follow. thus ver. 15 is regarded altogether parenthetical. But (1) this interpretation is harsh as regards the context, for ver. 15 is evidently<i> not parenthetical</i>,—and (2) (see my Greek Test.) it is hardly grammatically admissible. The fact is, that the verse is not a ground for remaining united, in hope, &c.,—but a ground for consummating a separation, and not marring the Christian’s peace for so uncertain a prospect as that of converting the unbelieving party. The question thus preserves its strict sense,<b> How knowest thou</b> (about the question)<b> whether....?</b> and the verse coheres with the words immediately preceding, “<i>God hath called us in peace.</i>” The meaning then of the verse will be as follows: (Let the unbeliever depart: hazard not for an uncertainty the peace in which you ought to be living as Christians:)<b> for what assurance hast thou, O wife, whether thou shalt be the means of thy husband’s conversion? Or what assurance hast thou, O husband, whether thou shalt be the means of thy wife’s conversion</b> “This interpretation is the only one compatible with the obvious sense of ver. 15, and of the expression how knowest: thou whether thou shalt save; and is also in exact harmony with the general tenor of the Apostle’s argument, which is not to urge a union, but to tolerate a separation Stanley; the rest of whose note is deeply interesting as to the historical influence of the verse as commonly misunderstood.
