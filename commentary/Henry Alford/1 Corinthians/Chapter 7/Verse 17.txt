 17. ]  εἰ μή takes an exception, by way of caution, to the foregoing motive for not remaining together ( 1Co 7:16 ). The Christian partner might carry that motive  too far , and be tempted by it to  break the connexion  on his own part ; a course already prohibited ( 1Co 7:12-14 ). Therefore the Apostle adds,  But (q. d. only be careful not to make this a ground for  yourselves causing the separation)  as to each ( ἑκάστ . ὡς = ὡς ἑκάστ ., reff.)  the Lord distributed (his lot), as (i.e.  ᾖ κλήσει , 1Co 7:20 )  God has called each, so (in that state, without change)  let him walk (reff.). The  εἰ μή has raised considerable difficulties. (1) some cursives, with syr-marg and Sevrn., read εἰ τὴν γυναῖκα σώσεις ,  ἢ μή ; and Knatchbull, al., join  εἰ μή similarly to the foregoing; εἰ .… σώσεις , εἰ μή . But as De W. remarks, this would be, as Matthew 22:17 , ἢ οὐ : and then we should have the strictly parallel clauses of 1Co 7:16 rendered unequal, by an appendage being attached to the second, which the first has not: besides that 1Co 7:17 would be disjoined altogether. (2) Pott would supply χωρίζεται , Mosheim, Vater, and Rückert, σώσεις , after εἰ μή . But so, to say nothing of the irrelevancy of the idea thus introduced, εἰ δὲ μή , or εἰ δὲ καὶ μή (as Meyer), would be required. (3) Theodoret, al., join all as far as κύριος to the foregoing: ‘  What knowest thou, &c., except in so far as the Lord has apportioned to each ?’ But thus the evidently parallel members, ἑκάστ . ὡς ἐμ . ὁ κύρ ., and ἑκάστ . ὡς κέκλ . ὁ θ ., would be separated, and a repetition occasioned which, except in the case of intended parallelism, would be alien from St. Paul’s habit of writing.
