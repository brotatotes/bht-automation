<b> 2.]</b> The former course is expedient—would avoid much ‘trouble in the flesh: but as a general rule<i> it may not be</i>, seeing that for a<i> more weighty reason</i> the contrary course is to be recommended.—<b>But</b><b> on account of [the] fornications</b> (the many instances of fornication current),<b> let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.</b> The saying is<i> not concessive, but imperative</i>; not, “<i>may</i> have,” but “<i>must</i> have.” So the other expressions, “<i>let them marry</i>,” ver. 9, “<i>let her remain,</i>” ver. 11, &c. With regard to the idea of some, that the Apostle here gives a very low estimate of marriage, as solely a remedy against fornication\the true answer is, that St. Paul does not either here, or in this chapter at all, give any<i> estimate</i> of marriage in the abstract. His estimate,<i> when he does</i>, is to be found Eph. v. 25–32.
