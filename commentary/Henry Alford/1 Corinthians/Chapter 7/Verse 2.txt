<p><strong> 2</strong> .] The former course is expedient would avoid much trouble’ in the flesh:’ but as a general rule <em> it may not be</em> , seeing that for a <em> more weighty reason</em> the contrary course is to be recommended. <strong> But on account of [the] fornications</strong> (the many instances of fornication current. The plur. of an abstract noun implies repetition, or varieties of the occurrence: so Herod. vii. 158, ὑμῖν μεγάλαι ὠφελίαι τε κ . ἐπαυρέσεις γεγόνασι : iii. 40, ἐμοὶ δὲ αἱ σαὶ μεγάλαι εὐτυχίαι οὐκ ἀρέσκθυσι , see reff., and Kühner, Gramm. ii. 28 (§ 408, γ )) <strong> let each man possess her own wife, and let each woman possess his own husband</strong> . The ἐχέτω is (1) <em> not concessive</em> , but <em> imperative</em> ; not ‘ <em> habere liceat</em> ,’ but ‘ <em> habeto</em> .’ So the other expressions, γαμησάτωσαν <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:9">1 Corinthians 7:9</span> , μενέτω <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:11">1 Corinthians 7:11</span> , &amp;c. (2) not here in the sense of ‘ <em> utatur, eigue commisceatur</em> ,’ as Estius, al., which does not come into consideration till the next verse. (3) not emphatic, let each <em> retain</em> , according to the mistaken idea mentioned on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span> , that he is speaking to the <em> married</em> , who though they are not to cohabit are yet to <em> remain together</em> .

<p>Had either of the two latter senses been meant, the sentence would rather have stood ἐχέτω ἕκ . τ . ἑαυτ . γυναῖκα , κ . ἐχέτω ἑκάστη τ . ἴδ . ἄνδρ .

<p>With regard to the assertion of Rückert, that the Apostle here gives a very low estimate of marriage, as solely a remedy against fornication, the true answer is, that Paul does not either here, or in this chapter at all, give any <em> estimate</em> of marriage in the abstract. His estimate, <em> when he does</em> , is to be found <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25-32">Ephesians 5:25-32</span> .</p>
