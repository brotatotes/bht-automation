<b> 22.]</b><i> Ground of the above precept</i>.<b> For</b><b> the slave who was called in the Lord</b> (not as A.V., ‘<i>He who is called in the Lord being a slave.’</i><br><br><i><b> in the Lord:</b></i> as the<i> element which</i> what is about to be stated takes place)<b> is the Lord's freed man.</b> The Lord’s freed man is not here in the ordinary Roman sense ‘the Lord’s manumitted slave:’ for the<i> former master was sin or the devil</i>, see on ch. vi. 20;—but<i> only, a freed man belonging to Christ,</i> viz. freed by Christ from the service of another. This the reader would understand as a matter of course:<b> in like manner he that was called, being free</b> (not the freeman being called),<b> is the slave of Christ.</b> Christ’s service is perfect<i> freedom,</i> and the Christian’s freedom is the<i> service of Christ</i>. But here the Apostle takes, in each case,<i> one member</i> of this double antithesis from the<i> outer world</i>,<i> one from the spiritual</i>. The (actual) slave is (spiritually) free: the (actually) free is a (spiritual) slave. So that the two are so mingled, in the Lord, that the slave need not trouble himself about his slavery, nor seek for this world’s freedom, seeing he has a more glorious freedom in Christ, and seeing also that his brethren who seem to be free in this world are in fact Christ’s servants, as<i> he</i> is a servant. It will be plain that the reason given in this verse is quite inconsistent with the prevalent modern rendering of ver. 21.
