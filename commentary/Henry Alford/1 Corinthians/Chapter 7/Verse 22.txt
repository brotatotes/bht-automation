 22 .]  Ground of the above precept .  For the slave who was called in the Lord (not, as E. V. and De Wette, ‘  He who is called in the Lord, being a slave ,’ which would be δοῦλος κληθείς , see above, δοῦλος ἐκλῆθης :
	 ἐν κυρίῳ , as the  element in which what is about to be stated takes place)  is the Lord’s freedman (“ ἀπελεύθερος with genit. is not here in the ordinary sense of ‘libertus alicujus,’ ‘any one’s manumitted slave:’ for the  former master was  sin or  the devil , see on ch. 1 Corinthians 6:20 ; but only a  freedman belonging to Christ , viz. freed by Christ from the service of another. This the reader would understand as a matter of course.” Meyer):  similarly he that was called being free (not here, κληθεὶς ἐλεύθερος , see above)  is the slave of Christ . Christ’s service is perfect  freedom , and the Christian’s  freedom is the service of Christ. But here the Apostle takes, in each case,  one member of this double antithesis from the  outer world, one from the  spiritual . The (actual) slave is (spiritually) free: the (actually) free is a (spiritual) slave. So that the two are so mingled, in the Lord, that the slave need not trouble himself about his slavery, nor seek for this world’s freedom, seeing he has a more glorious freedom in Christ, and seeing also that his brethren who seem to be free in this world are in fact Christ’s servants, as  he is a servant. It will be plain that the reason given in this verse is quite inconsistent with the prevalent modern rendering of 1 Corinthians 7:21 .
