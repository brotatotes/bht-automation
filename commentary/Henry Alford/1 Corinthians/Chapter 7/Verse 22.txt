<p><strong> 22</strong> .] <em> Ground of the above precept</em> . <strong> For the slave who was called in the Lord</strong> (not, as E. V. and De Wette, ‘ <em> He who is called in the Lord, being a slave</em> ,’ which would be δοῦλος κληθείς , see above, δοῦλος ἐκλῆθης :
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν κυρίῳ</strong> , as the <em> element in which</em> what is about to be stated takes place) <strong> is the Lord’s freedman</strong> (“ ἀπελεύθερος with genit. is not here in the ordinary sense of ‘libertus alicujus,’ ‘any one’s manumitted slave:’ for the <em> former master</em> was <em> sin</em> or <em> the devil</em> , see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:20">1 Corinthians 6:20</span> ; but only a <em> freedman belonging to Christ</em> , viz. freed by Christ from the service of another. This the reader would understand as a matter of course.” Meyer): <strong> similarly he that was called being free</strong> (not here, κληθεὶς ἐλεύθερος , see above) <strong> is the slave of Christ</strong> . Christ’s service is perfect <em> freedom</em> , and the Christian’s <em> freedom</em> is the service of Christ. But here the Apostle takes, in each case, <em> one member</em> of this double antithesis from the <em> outer world, one</em> from the <em> spiritual</em> . The (actual) slave is (spiritually) free: the (actually) free is a (spiritual) slave. So that the two are so mingled, in the Lord, that the slave need not trouble himself about his slavery, nor seek for this world’s freedom, seeing he has a more glorious freedom in Christ, and seeing also that his brethren who seem to be free in this world are in fact Christ’s servants, as <em> he</em> is a servant. It will be plain that the reason given in this verse is quite inconsistent with the prevalent modern rendering of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:21">1 Corinthians 7:21</span> .</p>
