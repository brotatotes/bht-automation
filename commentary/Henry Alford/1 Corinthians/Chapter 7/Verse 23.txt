<b> 23.]</b><i> Following out of the idea</i>,<b> the slave of Christ</b>,<i> by reminding them of the</i> PRICE PAID<i> whereby Christ</i> PURCHASED<i> them for His</i> (eh. vi. 20):<i> and precept thereupon</i>, BECOME NOT SLAVES OF MEN: i.e. ‘do not allow your relations to human society, whether of freedom or slavery, to bring you into bondage so as to cause you anxiety to change the one or increase the other.’ Chrysostom and others think the precept directed against<i> eye-service,</i> and general regard to men’s opinion. But it is better to restrict it (however it may legitimately<i> be applied</i> generally) to the case in hand. Others understand it as addressed to the<i> free</i>, and meaning that<i> they</i> are not to<i> sell</i><i> themselves into slavery</i>: but this is evidently wrong: as may be seen by the change to the<i> second person plural</i> as<i> addressing all his readers</i>: besides that a new example would have been marked as in vv. 18, 21.
