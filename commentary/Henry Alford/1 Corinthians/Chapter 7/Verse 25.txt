<b> 25.</b>]<b> virgins</b> is not to be understood<i> unmarried persons of both sexes</i>, a meaning which, though apparently found in Rev. xiv. 4 (see note there), is perfectly unnecessary here, and appears to have been introduced from a mistaken view of vv, 26–28. The emphasis is on<b> commandment</b>—<b>command of the Lord have I none,</b> i.e.,<i> no expressed precept;</i> so that, as before, there is no marked comparison between “<i>the Lord,</i>” and “<i>I</i>.”<br><br><b> to be faithful</b>, ie., as a steward and dispenser of the hidden things of God, and, among them, of such directions as you cannot make for yourselves, but require one so entrusted to impart to you. This sense, which has occurred in the estimate given of himself in this very Epistle, is better than the more general ones of<i> true or believing.</i>
