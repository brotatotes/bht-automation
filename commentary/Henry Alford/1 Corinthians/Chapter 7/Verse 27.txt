 27 .] τὸ οὕτως εἶναι  restated and  illustrated : neither the married nor the unmarried are to  seek for a change . The general recommendation here is referable alike to  all cases of marriage, and does not touch on the prohibition of 1 Corinthians 7:10 , only  dissuading from a spirit of change, in consideration of the  ἐνεστῶσα ἀνάγκη . It seems better to take the verse thus, than with Meyer and De Wette, to regard it as inserted to guard against misunderstanding of the preceding γνώμη of the Apostle.
	 λέλυσαι does not imply  previous marriage , but as Phot [30] , οὐχὶ πρὸς τοὺς συναφθέντας , εἶτα διαλυθέντας , … ἀλλα ʼ ἁπλῶς πρὸς τοὺς μὴ συνελθόντας ὅλως εἰς γάμου κοινωνίαν , ἀλλὰ λελυμένους ὄντας τοῦ τοιούτου δεσμοῦ , and Estius, “intelligit liberum a conjugio, sive uxorem aliquando habuerit, sive non.”
