<b> 34</b>.] The literal rendering is—<b>Divided also is the</b> (married)<b> woman and the virgin</b>,<i> divided in interest</i> [i. e. in cares and pursuits] from one another: not merely,<i> different from one another</i> as would seem at first sight from the words of the text. On the question arising from different readings, see my Greek ‘Test—The judgment of marriage here pronounced by the Apostle must be taken, as the rest of the chapter,<i> with its accompanying conditions.</i> He is speaking of a pressing and quickly shortening period, which he regards as yet remaining before that day and hour of which neither he, nor any man knew. He wishes his Corinthians, during that short time, to be as far as possible<i> totally</i> undistracted. He mentions as an objection to marriage, that which is an<i> undoubted</i><i> fact of human experience</i>:—which is necessarily bound up with that relation; and<i> without which the duties of the relation could not be fulfilled.</i> Since he wrote, the unfolding of God’s Providence has taught us more of the interval before the coming of the Lord than it was given even to an inspired Apostle to see. And as it would be perfectly reasonable and proper to urge on an apparently dying man the duty of abstaining from contracting new worldly obligations,—but both unreasonable and improper, should the same person recover his health, to insist on this abstinence any longer; so now, when God has manifested His will that nations should rise up and live and decay, and long centuries elapse before the day of the coming of Christ, it would be manifestly unreasonable to urge,—except in so far as every man’s<i> time</i> is<i> getting shorter and shorter</i>, and similar arguments are applicable,—the considerations here enforced. Meanwhile they stand here on the sacred page as a lesson to us how to regard, though in circumstances somewhat changed, our worldly relations: and to teach ns, as the coming of the Lord may be as near now, as the Apostle then believed it to be, to act at least in the spirit of his advice, and be, as far as God’s manifest will that we should enter into the relations and affairs of life allows, without distraction. The duty of ver. 35 is incumbent on all Christians, at all periods.
