 38 .] The latter καί has been altered to δέ because a contrast seemed to be required between καλῶς and κρεῖσσον . One account might be (as M [35] and De W.) that Paul had intended to write καλῶς ποι . twice, but  currente calamo , intensified the expression to κρεῖσσον ποιῆσει . Perhaps a better one will be found by referring the καὶ καί to that which καλῶς and κρεῖσσον have in common: ‘  both he who gives in marriage does well, and he who gives not in marriage shall do well, even in a higher degree .’ I need hardly remind the tiro that ‘both and’ here does not, as Bloomf. objects, represent τε καί , each subject being accompanied by its own predicate. Observe the ποιήσει ποιεῖ ποιήσει ; the pres., of the mere act itself, the fut., of its enduring results.
