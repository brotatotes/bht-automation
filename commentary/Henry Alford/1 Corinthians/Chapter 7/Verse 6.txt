 6. ]  But this I say by way of allowance (for you),  not by way of command .
	 τοῦτο refers, not to 1 Corinthians 7:2 , as Beza, Grot., and De Wette, because the precept there given depends on a  reason also given, διὰ τὰς πορνείας , from the nature of which reason it  must be κατ ʼ ἐπιταγήν : nor to the whole since 1 Corinthians 7:2 , as Billroth, Rückert, al., because the precept in 1Co 7:3 depends on the general truth in 1 Corinthians 7:4 , and is also a command: nor to πρὸς καιρόν , as Theophyl.: nor as the ascetics, Orig [14] , Tert [15] , Jerome, Estius (also Calvin), to ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἦτε , because both these are but subordinate members of the preceding sentence: still less to  what follows , as Rosenm., al.: but, as the context ( 1Co 7:7 ) shews, to the whole recommendation given in 1 Corinthians 7:5 . This recommendation all depended on the possibility of their being tempted by incontinence: he gives it not then  as a command in all cases, but  as an allowance for those to whom he was writing, whom he knew, and assumes, to  be thus tempted . The meaning ‘  by permission, ’ E. V., is ambiguous, appearing as if it meant  by permission of the Lord (  to say it ): that given by Hammond, al., κατὰ τὴν ἐμὴν γνώμην , is philologically inadmissible.
