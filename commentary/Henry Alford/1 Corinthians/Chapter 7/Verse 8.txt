 8.   λέγε δέ ] taking up the former λέγω , 1 Corinthians 7:6 , and bringing this advice under the same category as 1 Corinthians 7:7 , viz. his own wish that all were as himself. The stress is on λέγω , not on τοῖς ἀγ . κ . ταῖς χ ., which would in that case be placed first, as τοῖς γεγαμηκόσιν below.
	 τοῖς ἀγάμοις  , the unmarried , of both sexes: not as usually interpreted,  widowers , or  unmarried males alone : this is shewn by the contrasted term γεγαμηκόσιν , which embraces (see 1Co 7:10-11 )  both sexes .
	 καὶ ταῖς χήραις may be added as singling out widows  especially ; or more probably, because τοῖς ἀγάμοις would naturally be taken as those who  never were married , and thus widows would not be understood to be included.
	 καλόν , see on 1 Corinthians 7:1 ,  it is good for them , i.e. ‘their best way.’
	 ὡς κἀγώ ] i.e. ἄγαμος . This brings the Apostle’s own circumstances more clearly before us than 1 Corinthians 7:7 , which might be misunderstood: and there can be little doubt from this, that he  never was married . Grot. says, “ex h. l. non improbabiliter colligitur, Paulo fuisse uxorem, quod et Clemens Alex. putat, sed cum hæc scriberentur, mortuam.” But this rests on the mistaken interpretation of ἀγάμοις noticed above. The passage of Clem [16] Alex. (Strom. iii. [6.] 53, p. 535 P., alluded to in Euseb. iii. 30) is grounded on Paul’s having in a certain epistle addressed τὴν αὐτοῦ σύζυγον , ἣν οὐ περιεκόμιζε , διὰ τὸ τῆς ὑπηρεσίας εὐσταλές . But the words σύνζυγε γνήσιε , Philippians 4:3 , certainly have no reference to a wife: see note there.
