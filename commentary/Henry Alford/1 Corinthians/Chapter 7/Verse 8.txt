<b> 8.</b>]<b> the unmarried</b>, of both sexes: not as usually interpreted,<i> widowers</i>, or<i> unmarried males alone</i>: this is shewn by the contrasted term, “the married,” which embraces (see vv. 10, 11) both sexes.<br><br><b> and to the widows</b> may be added as singling out widows<i> especially</i>;—or more probably, because “<i>the unmarried</i>” would naturally be taken as those who<i> never were married</i>, and thus widows would not be understood to be included,<b> It is good for them</b>, i.e. ‘it is their best way:’ see on ver. 1.<br><br><b> even as I]</b> i.e. unmarried. This brings the Apostle’s own circumstances more clearly before us than ver. 7, which might be misunderstood: and there can be little doubt from this, that he<i> never was married</i>. There is a passage of Clement of Alexandria which says that St. Paul in a certain epistle addressed “his yokefellow, whom he did not carry about with him on grounds expedient for his ministry.” But the words “<i>true yokefellow,</i>” Phil. iv. 3, certainly have no reference to a wife: see note there.
