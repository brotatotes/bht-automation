<b> VIII. 1—XI. 1.</b>] ON THE PARTAKING OF MEATS OFFERED TO IDOLS, AND ASSISTING AT FEASTS HELD IN HONOUR OF IDOLS.<br><br><b> 1.</b>] The<b> things sacrificed to idols</b> were those portions of the animals offered in sacrifice which were not laid on the altar, and which belonged partly to the priests, partly to those who had offered them. These remnants were sometimes eaten at feasts holden in the temples (see ver. 10), or in private houses (ch. x. 27 f.), sometimes sold in the markets, by the priests, or by the poor, or by the niggardly. Theophrastus describes it as characteristic of an illiberal man, that when giving his daughter in marriage he sells those portions of the victim which were over after the sacrifice. ‘They were sometimes also reserved for future use. ‘Theophrastus mentions it as belonging to the shameless man, that when he has offered a sacrifice to the gods, he salts away the remnants, and goes to dine with a neighbour. Christians were thus in continual danger of meeting with such remnants. Partaking of them was an abomination among the Jews: see Numb. xxv. 2; Ps. cvi. 28; Rey. ii. 14; Tobit. 10–12; and was forbidden by the Apostles and elders assembled at Jerusalem, Acts xv. 29; xxi. 25. That St. Paul in the whole of this passage makes no allusion to that decree, but deals with the question on its own merits, probably is to be traced to his wish to establish his position as an independent Apostle, endowed with God’s Holy Spirit sufficiently himself to regulate such matters, But it also shews,<i> how little such decisions were at that time regarded as lastingly binding on the whole church</i>: and how fully competent it was, even during the lifetime of the Apostles, to Christians to open and question on its own merits, a matter which<i> they</i> had, for a special purpose, once already decided.
