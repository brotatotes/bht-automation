</b> ‘The general deductions, (1) from<i> a profession of knowledge</i>, and (2) from<i> the presence of love,</i> in a man:—expressed sententiously and without connecting particles, more, as Meyer observes, after the manner of St. John in his Epistles.—The case supposed is the only one which can occur where love is absent and conceit present; a man can then<i> only think he knows,—no real knowledge</i> being accessible without humility and love. Such a man<b> knows not yet, as he ought to know</b>: has had no real practice in the art of knowing.
