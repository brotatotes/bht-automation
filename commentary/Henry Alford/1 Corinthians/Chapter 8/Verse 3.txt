—<b>But if a man loves God</b> (which is the highest and noblest kind of love, the source of brotherly love, 1 John y. 2),<b> this man</b> (and not the wise in his own conceit)<b> is known by Him</b>. The explanation of this latter somewhat difficult expression is to be found in Gal. iv. 9, “<i>Now that ye know God, or rather are known of God</i>.” So that here we may fairly assume that<i> he</i> chooses the expression is<b> known by Him</b><i> in preference</i> to that which<i> would have been</i>, had any object of knowledge but the Supreme been treated of, the<i> natural one, viz. the same knoweth Him.</i> We cannot be said to Know God, in any full sense (as here) of the word to<i> know</i>. But those who become acquainted with God by love,<b> are known by Him:</b> are the especial objects of the divine Knowledge,—their being is pervaded by the Spirit of God, and the wisdom of God is shed abroad in them. So in 2 Tim. ii. 19, “<i>The Lord knoweth them that are His.</i>” See also Ps. i. 6, and ch. xiii. 12.
