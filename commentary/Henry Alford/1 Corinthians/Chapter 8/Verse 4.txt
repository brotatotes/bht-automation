<b> 4.</b>] The subject is resumed, and further specified by the insertion of<b> the eating of</b>.<br><br><b> we know that there is no idol in the world</b>, i.e. that the idols of the heathen (meaning not strictly the<i> images, but the persons represented by them</i>)<i> have no existence in the world.</i> That they who worship idols, worship devils, the Apostle himself asserts ch. x. 20; but that is no contradiction to the present sentence, which asserts that the deities imagined by them, Jupiter, Apollo, &c., have<i> absolutely no existence</i>. Of that subtle Power which, under the guise of these, deluded the nations, he here says nothing. The rendering of the A.V., and many Commentators, ancient and modern,— ‘<i>an idol is nothing in the world</i>? ch. x. 19; Jer. x. 3, is certainly wrong here, on account of the exact verbal parallel,<b> there is no God but one,</b> which follows. The insertion of “<i>other</i>” (wanting in all our most ancient MSS.) has probably been occasioned by the wording of the first commandment, “Thou shalt have none other gods but me.”
