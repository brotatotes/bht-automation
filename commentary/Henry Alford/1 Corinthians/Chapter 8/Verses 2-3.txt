 2, 3. ] The general deductions, (1) from a  profession of knowledge , and (2) from the  presence of love , in a man: expressed sententiously and without connecting particles, more, as Meyer observes, after the manner of St. John in his Epistles.
	On the text, see var. readd.
	The case supposed is the only one which can occur where love is absent and conceit present: a man can then  only think he knows , no  real knowledge being accessible without humility and love. Such a man  knows not yet, as he ought to know : has had no real practice in the art of knowing.
	 But if a man loves God (which is the highest and noblest kind of love, the  source of brotherly love, 1Jn 5:2 ),  this man (and not the wise in his own conceit)  is known by Him . The explanation of this latter somewhat difficult expression is to be found in ref. Gal., νῦν δὲ γνόντες θεόν ,  μᾶλλον δὲ γνωσθέντες ὑπὸ θεοῦ  . So that  here we may fairly assume that he chooses the expression ἔγνωσται ὑπ ʼ αὐτοῦ  in preference to that which  would have been , had any object of knowledge but the Supreme been treated of,  the natural one , viz. οὗτος ἔγνω αὐτόν . We cannot be said to  know God, in any full sense (as here) of the word  to know . But those who become acquainted with God by love, are  known by Him : are the  especial objects of the divine Knowledge , their being is pervaded by the Spirit of God, and the wisdom of God is shed abroad in them. So in ref. 2 Tim., ἔγνω κύριος τοὺς ὄντας αὐτοῦ . See also Psalms 1:6 . “Cognitionem passivam sequitur cognitio activa c. xiii. 12. Egregia metalepsis: cognitus est, adeoque cognovit.” Bengel. γινώσκω does not seem, any more than יָדַע in Psalms 1:6 ; Psalms 37:18 , for which the LXX have γινώσκω , to signify  to approve , any further than personal knowledge of an intimate kind necessarily involves approval.
