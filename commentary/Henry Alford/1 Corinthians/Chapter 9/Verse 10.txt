But spiritually taken, all coheres. “The command (not to muzzle, &c.) was written on account of us (Christian teachers), because we ploughers (in the ‘<i>husbandry of God</i>,’ ch. iii. 9) ought to plough in hope,—and we threshers (answering to the ‘<i>ox that treadeth out the corn</i>’) ought to work in hope of (as the ox) having a share.’—No minute distinction must be sought between the<i> plougher</i> and the<i> thresher</i>. The former is perhaps mentioned on account of the process answering to the breaking up the fallow ground of Heathenism:—the latter on account of its occurrence in the precept.
