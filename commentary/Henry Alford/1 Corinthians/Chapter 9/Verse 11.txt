 11 .] The  ἡμεῖς (both times  strongly emphatic : we need sorely some means of marking in our English Bibles, for ordinary readers,  which words have the emphasis ) is categoric, but  in fact applies to Paul alone. The secondary emphasis is on ὑμῖν … ὑμῶν . It is one of those elaborately antithetical sentences which the great Apostle wields so powerfully in argument. The ἡμεῖς ἡμεῖς , being identical, stand out in so much the stronger relief against the triple antithesis, ὑμ  ῖν  ,   πνευματικά  ,   ἐσπείραμεν , and  ὑμων  ,   σαρκικά  ,   θερίσωμεν .
	If we read the subjunctive, for the usage after εἰ , see Winer, edn. 6, § 41. b. 2, end; ch. 1 Corinthians 14:5 ; 1 Thessalonians 5:10 ; Kühner, § 818 A. 1. The usage is common in Homer, Od. α . 204, al. fr., doubtful in Her od. 2:13; 8:49, 118 , and hardly ever found in Attic writers. See Soph. Œd. Tyr. 198, εἴ τι νὺξ ἀφῇ , and Œd. Col. 1442, εἴ σου στερηθῶ .
	 πνευμ  . and  σαρκ  . (see Rom 15:27 ) need no explanation. The first are so called as belonging to the  spirit of man (De W. and Meyer, as  coming from the Spirit of God ; but it is better to keep the antithesis exact and perspicuous), the second as serving for the nourishment of the flesh.
