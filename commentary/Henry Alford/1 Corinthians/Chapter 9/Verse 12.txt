<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] <strong> ἄλλοι</strong> does not necessarily point at the <em> false</em> teachers; others may have exercised this power.

<p><strong> ὑμῶν</strong> is the objective genitive: <strong> power over you</strong> , see reff.

<p>The second ἀλλά is not in apposition with the first, but in opposition to the idea implied in ἐχρ . τῇ ἐξ . ταύτῃ . Meyer compares Hom. Il. α . 24 f., ἀλλ οὐκ Ἀτρείδῃ Ἀγαμέμνονι ἥνδανε θυμῷ , Ἀλλὰ κακῶς ἀφίει .

<p><strong> στέγομεν</strong> ] The word was commonly used, as may be seen in Wetst., of vessels <em> containing, holding without breaking</em> , that which was put into them; thence of <em> concealing</em> or <em> covering</em> , as a secret; and also of <em> enduring</em> or <em> bearing up against</em> . In this last sense Diod. Sic. iii. 34, uses it literally of ice, στέγοντος τοῦ κρυστάλλου διαβάσεις στρατοπέδων κ . ἁμαξῶν ἐφόδους , and (xi. 25, Wetst. but?) of a besieged fort, οὐ μήνγε τὴν ὁρμὴν … ἔοτεγεν … τὸ … τεῖχος , … ἀλλὰ ὑπείκειν ἠναγκάζετο . So also Æsch. Sept. c. Theb. 216, πύργου στέγειν εὔχεσθε πολεμίων δόρυ . These last usages are very near akin to this of our text, <strong> We endure all things</strong> : viz. labour, privations, hardships. The ἐγκοπαί (hindrances so Diod. Sic. i. 32, speaks of the Nile as being πολλάκις διὰ τὰς ἐγκοπὰς ἀνακλώμενος ) would arise from his being charged with covetousness and self-seeking, which his <em> independence of them</em> would entirely prevent.</p>
