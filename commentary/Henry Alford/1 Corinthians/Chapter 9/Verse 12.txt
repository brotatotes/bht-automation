 12. ]  ἄλλοι does not necessarily point at the  false teachers; others may have exercised this power.
	 ὑμῶν is the objective genitive:  power over you , see reff.
	The second ἀλλά is not in apposition with the first, but in opposition to the idea implied in ἐχρ . τῇ ἐξ . ταύτῃ . Meyer compares Hom. Il. α . 24 f., ἀλλ οὐκ Ἀτρείδῃ Ἀγαμέμνονι ἥνδανε θυμῷ , Ἀλλὰ κακῶς ἀφίει .
	 στέγομεν ] The word was commonly used, as may be seen in Wetst., of vessels  containing, holding without breaking , that which was put into them; thence of  concealing or  covering , as a secret; and also of  enduring or  bearing up against . In this last sense Diod. Sic. iii. 34, uses it literally of ice, στέγοντος τοῦ κρυστάλλου διαβάσεις στρατοπέδων κ . ἁμαξῶν ἐφόδους , and (xi. 25, Wetst. but?) of a besieged fort, οὐ μήνγε τὴν ὁρμὴν … ἔοτεγεν … τὸ … τεῖχος , … ἀλλὰ ὑπείκειν ἠναγκάζετο . So also Æsch. Sept. c. Theb. 216, πύργου στέγειν εὔχεσθε πολεμίων δόρυ . These last usages are very near akin to this of our text,  We endure all things : viz. labour, privations, hardships. The ἐγκοπαί (hindrances so Diod. Sic. i. 32, speaks of the Nile as being πολλάκις διὰ τὰς ἐγκοπὰς ἀνακλώμενος ) would arise from his being charged with covetousness and self-seeking, which his  independence of them would entirely prevent.
