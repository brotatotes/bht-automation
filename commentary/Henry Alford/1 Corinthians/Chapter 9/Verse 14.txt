 14. ]  So also (i.e. in analogy with that His other command)  did the Lord (Christ; the Author by His Spirit of the O. T. as well as the New)  command (viz. Matthew 10:10 ; Luk 10:7-8 )  to those who are preaching the gospel, to live of (be maintained by. Themistius (Kypke) has ζῇν ἐξ ἐργασίας )  the gospel . Observe, that here the Apostle is establishing an analogy between the rights of the  sacrificing priests of the law, and of the  preachers of the gospel. Had those preachers been likewise sacrificing priests , is it possible that all allusion to them in such a character should have been here omitted? But as all such allusion  is omitted , we may fairly infer that no such character of the Christian minister was then known. As Bengel remarks on 1 Corinthians 9:13 ; ‘Si missa esset sacrificium, plane Paulus versu sequente apodosin huc accommodasset.’
