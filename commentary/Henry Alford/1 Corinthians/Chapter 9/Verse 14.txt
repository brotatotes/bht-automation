<b> 14.]</b> Thus also (i. e. in analogy with that His other command)<b> did the Lord</b> (Christ; the Author, by His Spirit, of the Old Testament as well as the New)<b> appoint</b> (viz. Matt. x. 10; Luke x. 8)<b> to those who are preaching the gospel,</b><b> to live of</b> (be maintained by)<b> the gospel</b>. Observe, that here the Apostle is establishing an analogy between the rights of the<i> sacrificing priests</i> of the law, and of the<i> preachers of the gospel</i>.<i> Had those preachers been likewise sacrificing priests,</i> is it possible that, all allusion to them in such a character should have been here omitted? But as all such allusion is<i> omitted</i>, we may fairly infer that no such character of the Christian minister was then known. As Bengel remarks on yer. 13: “If the mass were a sacrifice, Paul would have expressed this conclusion in the next verse accordingly.”
