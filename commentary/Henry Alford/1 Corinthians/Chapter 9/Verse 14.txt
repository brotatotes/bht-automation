<p><strong> 14.</strong> ] <strong> So also</strong> (i.e. in analogy with that His other command) <strong> did the Lord</strong> (Christ; the Author by His Spirit of the O. T. as well as the New) <strong> command</strong> (viz. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:10">Matthew 10:10</span> ; Luk 10:7-8 ) <strong> to those who are preaching the gospel, to live of</strong> (be maintained by. Themistius (Kypke) has ζῇν ἐξ ἐργασίας ) <strong> the gospel</strong> . Observe, that here the Apostle is establishing an analogy between the rights of the <em> sacrificing priests</em> of the law, and of the <em> preachers of the gospel. Had those preachers been likewise sacrificing priests</em> , is it possible that all allusion to them in such a character should have been here omitted? But as all such allusion <em> is omitted</em> , we may fairly infer that no such character of the Christian minister was then known. As Bengel remarks on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:13">1 Corinthians 9:13</span> ; ‘Si missa esset sacrificium, plane Paulus versu sequente apodosin huc accommodasset.’</p>
