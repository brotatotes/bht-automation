 15. ]  οὐδενὶ τούτων is best explained of the different forms of ἐξουσία , not, with Chrys. al., τῶν πολλῶν παραδειγμάτων πολλῶν γάρ μοι παρεχόντων ἐξουσίαν , τοῦ στρατιώτου , τοῦ γεωργοῦ , τοῦ ποιμένος , τῶν ἀποστόλων , τοῦ νόμου , τῶν παρ ʼ ἡμῶν εἰς ὑμᾶς γενομένων , τῶν παρ ʼ ὑμῶν εἰς τοὺς ἄλλους , τῶν ἱερέων , τοῦ προστάγματος τοῦ χριστοῦ , οὐδενὶ τούτων ἐπείσθην εἰς τὸ καταλῦσαι τὸν ἐμαυτοῦ νόμον , καὶ λαβεῖν . Hom. xxii. p. 193. True, that each of these examples pointed to a form of ἐξουσία , and none of  these forms had he  made use of . See ref. on ch. 1 Corinthians 7:21 .
	 ἔγραψα is the epistolary aorist  I wrote (write)  not these things however, that it may be thus (viz. after the examples which I have alleged)  done to me (in my case, see reff.):  for it were good (reff.)  for me rather to die (or,  better for me to die , see ref. Mark)  than that any one should make void (the remarkable reading of the great MSS. appears to have arisen from the unnatural look of the future with ἵνα . It can only be explained by supposing an aposiopesis; the Apostle breaking off at ἤ , and exclaiming with fervour, τὸ καύχημά μου οὐδεὶς κενώσει )  my (matter of) boasting . To understand ἀποθανεῖν as Chrys., Theophyl., Œc [41] , Estius, Billroth, al., ἀποθ .  λιμῷ , seems quite unnecessary. Further on, Chrys. himself expresses the true sense: οὕτω καὶ ζωῆς αὐτῷ γλυκύτερον ἦν τὸ γινόμενον : and Calvin, “tantum Evangelii promovendi facultatem nimirum propriæ vitæ præferebat.”
