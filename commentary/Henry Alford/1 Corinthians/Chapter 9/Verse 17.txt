 17. ]  For (illustration and confirmation of οὐαὶ γὰρ κ . τ . λ . above)  if I am doing this (preaching)  of mine own accord (as a  voluntary undertaking , which in Paul’s case was  not so , as Chrys., τὸ ἑκὼν κ .  ἄκων ἐπὶ τοῦ ἐγκεχειρίσθαι καὶ μὴ ἐγκεχειρίσθαι λαμβάνων : not, as E. V., al.,  willingly , for this  was so ),  I have a reward (i.e. if  of mine own will I took up the ministry, it might be conceivable that a μισθός might be due to me. That this was not the case,  and never could be , is evident, and the μισθός therefore only hypothetical):  but if involuntarily (which  was the case, see Acts 9:15 ; Acts 22:14 ; Act 26:16 ),  with a STEWARDSHIP ( οἰκ . emphatic)  have I been entrusted (and therefore from the nature of things,  in this respect I have no μισθός for merely doing what is my bounden duty, see Luke 17:7-10 ; but an οὐαί , if I fail in it. Chrys. observes well: οὐδὲ γὰρ εἶπεν , εἰ δὲ ἄκων , οὐκ ἔχω μισθόν , ἀλλ ʼ  οἰκ  .   πεπίστ  . δεικνὺς ὅτι καὶ οὕτως ἔχει μισθόν , ἀλλὰ τοιοῦτον , οἷον ὁ τὸ ἐπιταχθὲν ἐξανύσας , οὐχ οἷον ἐκεῖνος ὁ ἐκ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ φιλοτιμησάμενος κ . ὑπερβὰς τὸ ἐπίταγμα . p. 194).
	The above interpretation, which is in the main that of Chrys., Theophyl., Œcum. (altern.) al., Meyer, and De Wette, is the only one which seems to me to satisfy, easily and grammatically, all the requirements of the sentence, and at the same time to suit the logical structure of the context. The other Commentators go  in omnia alia , and adopt various forced and arbitrary constructions of the verse.
