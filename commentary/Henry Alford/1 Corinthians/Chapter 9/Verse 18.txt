<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] Ordinarily, and even by De Wette, thus arranged and rendered: <em> ‘What then is my reward?</em> ( <em> It is</em> ), <em> that in preaching I make the gospel to be without cost, that I use not my power in the gospel.’</em> But this, though perhaps philologically allowable (against Meyer, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span> , αὕτη ἐστὶν ἡ αἰώνιος ζωή , ἵνα γινώσκωσι … also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:8">John 15:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:17">1 John 4:17</span> (?)), is <em> not true</em> . His making the gospel to be without cost, <em> was not his</em> μισθός , <em> but his</em> καύχημα <em> only:</em> and these two are <em> not identical</em> . The καύχημα was <em> present:</em> the μισθός , <em> future</em> .
	</p>
<p>Meyer’s rendering is equally at fault. He would make τίς οὖν μού ἐστιν ὁ μισθός ; a question implying a <em> negative</em> answer ‘ <em> What then is my reward? None: in order that I preach gratuitously</em> ,’ &amp;c. But thus he severs off (see below) the whole following context, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:19-23">1 Corinthians 9:19-23</span> ; and as it seems to me, stultifies the καύχημα , by robbing it altogether of the coming μισθός . I am persuaded that the following is the true rendering: <strong> What then is my reward</strong> (in prospect) <strong> that I</strong> ( ἵνα , like ὅπως in classical Greek, with a fut. indic., points to the actual realization of the purpose, with more precision than when followed by the subjunctive. So Xen. Cyr. ii. 4.31, Κῦρος , ὦ Ἀρμένιε , κελεύει οἵτω ποιεῖν σε , <strong> ὅπως</strong> ὡς τάχιστα ἔχων <strong> οἴσεις</strong> καὶ τὸν δασμὸν καὶ τὸ στράτευμα , Kühner, Gramm. ii. 490, where see more examples) <strong> while preaching, render the gospel without cost</strong> (i.e. what reward have I in prospect <em> that induces me to preach gratuitously</em> ) <strong> in order not to use</strong> (as carrying out my design not to use) <strong> [to the full] (</strong> <strong> καταχρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> see ref. and note: not, to <em> abuse</em> , as <strong> E. V.) my power in the gospel</strong> (= τῇ ἐξους . μου τῇ ἐν τῷ εὐαγγ ., as often; cf. τοῖς κυρίοις κατὰ σάρκα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5">Ephesians 6:5</span> ; οἱ νεκροὶ ἐν χριστῷ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span> , al. fr.)?</p>
