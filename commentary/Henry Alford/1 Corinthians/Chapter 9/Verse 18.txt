 18. ] Ordinarily, and even by De Wette, thus arranged and rendered:  ‘What then is my reward? (  It is ),  that in preaching I make the gospel to be without cost, that I use not my power in the gospel.’ But this, though perhaps philologically allowable (against Meyer, see John 17:3 , αὕτη ἐστὶν ἡ αἰώνιος ζωή , ἵνα γινώσκωσι … also John 15:8 ; 1 John 4:17 (?)), is  not true . His making the gospel to be without cost,  was not his μισθός ,  but his καύχημα  only: and these two are  not identical . The καύχημα was  present: the μισθός ,  future .
	Meyer’s rendering is equally at fault. He would make τίς οὖν μού ἐστιν ὁ μισθός ; a question implying a  negative answer ‘  What then is my reward? None: in order that I preach gratuitously ,’ &c. But thus he severs off (see below) the whole following context, 1 Corinthians 9:19-23 ; and as it seems to me, stultifies the καύχημα , by robbing it altogether of the coming μισθός . I am persuaded that the following is the true rendering:  What then is my reward (in prospect)  that I ( ἵνα , like ὅπως in classical Greek, with a fut. indic., points to the actual realization of the purpose, with more precision than when followed by the subjunctive. So Xen. Cyr. ii. 4.31, Κῦρος , ὦ Ἀρμένιε , κελεύει οἵτω ποιεῖν σε ,  ὅπως ὡς τάχιστα ἔχων  οἴσεις καὶ τὸν δασμὸν καὶ τὸ στράτευμα , Kühner, Gramm. ii. 490, where see more examples)  while preaching, render the gospel without cost (i.e. what reward have I in prospect  that induces me to preach gratuitously )  in order not to use (as carrying out my design not to use)  [to the full] (  καταχρ  . see ref. and note: not, to  abuse , as  E. V.) my power in the gospel (= τῇ ἐξους . μου τῇ ἐν τῷ εὐαγγ ., as often; cf. τοῖς κυρίοις κατὰ σάρκα , Ephesians 6:5 ; οἱ νεκροὶ ἐν χριστῷ , 1 Thessalonians 4:16 , al. fr.)?
