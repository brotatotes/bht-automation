 2 .] At least my apostleship cannot be denied by  you of all men, who are its seal and proof.
	 εἰ  .…   οὐκ εἰμί ]  οὐκ , because it belongs closely to the hypothesis: ‘if I am  no-Apostle ,’ see ch. 1 Corinthians 7:9 .
	 ἄλλοις ,  to others , i.e.  in the estimation of others .
	 ἀλλά γε ,  yet at least , is stronger than ἀλλά alone. The particle shews that the sentiment which it introduces has more weight than the other to which the ἀλλά is a reply. See Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 385. Meyer (after Klotz) remarks that “in the classics ἀλλά γε is never found without one or more words intervening:” those words being emphatic: e.g. Aristoph. Nub. 399, πῶς οὐχὶ Σίμων ʼ ἐνέπρησεν .… ἀλλὰ τὸν αὑτοῦ γε νεὼν βάλλει ;
	 σφραγίς ]  as being the proof of his apostolic calling and energy, by their conversion ; better than, by the signs and wonders which he wrought among them, as Chrys. (al.) from 2 Corinthians 12:11-13 , and perhaps misled by the similarity of σημεῖον and σφραγίς . Their  conversion was the great proof: so Theodoret, ἀπόδειξιν γὰρ τῶν ἀποστολικῶν κατορθωμάτων τὴν ὑμετέραν ἔχω μεταβολήν .
	 ἐν κυρ  . ] belongs to the whole sentence, see above, on 1 Corinthians 9:1 .
