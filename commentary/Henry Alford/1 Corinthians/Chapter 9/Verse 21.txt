<p><strong> 21. </strong> <strong> τοῖς ἀνόμοις ὡς ἄν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The ἄνομοι are <em> the Heathen</em> ; hardly, with Chrys., <em> such as Cornelius</em> , fearing God but not under the law. Paul became as a Heathen to the Heathen, e.g., when he discoursed at Athens (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:0">Acts 17:0</span> ) in their own manner, and with arguments drawn from their own poets.

<p><strong> μὴ ὢν</strong> κ . τ . λ .] <strong> not being</strong> (being conscious of not being, remembering well in the midst of my ἀνομία that I was not. This is implied by μή , which is subjective, giving the <em> conviction of the subject</em> , not merely the <em> objective fact</em> , as οὐκ ὤν would do) <strong> an outlaw from God</strong> ( θεοῦ and χριστοῦ are genitives of dependence, as after κατήκοος , ἔνοχος , &amp;c.) <strong> but a subject-of-the-law of Christ</strong> (the words seem inserted rather to put before the reader the true position of a Christian with regard to God’s law revealed by Christ, than merely with an apologetic view to keep his own character from suffering by the imputation of ἀνομία ) <strong> that I might gain those who had no law</strong> . κερδανῶ (here only in N. T.) and κερδήσω are both found in the classics; see Matthiæ, § 239, and Lobeck on Phrynichus, p. 740.</p>
