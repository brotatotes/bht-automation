<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] The allusion is primarily no doubt to the Isthmian games [‘celebrated under the shadow of the huge Corinthian citadel’ (Stanley)]; but this must not be pressed too closely: the foot-race was far too common an element in athletic contests, for any accurate knowledge of its predominance in some and its insignificance in others of the Grecian games to be here supposed. Still less must it be imagined that those games were to be celebrated in the year of the Epistle being written. The most that can with certainty be said, is that he alludes to a contest which, from the neighbourhood of the Isthmian games, was well known to his readers. See Stanley’s note: who, in following out illustrations of this kind, writes with a vivid graphic power peculiarly his own.

If, as Dr. Peile imagines, a contrast had been intended, between the stadium where <em> one only</em> can receive the prize, and the Christian race where <em> all</em> may, it must have stood οὕτως δὲ ὑμεῖς τρέχετε , ὡς καὶ ( πάντας ?) καταλαβεῖν .
