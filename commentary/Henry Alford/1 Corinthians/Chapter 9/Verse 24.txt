 24 ff.] ‘This is my aim in all I do: but inasmuch as many run in a race, many reach the goal, but<i> one</i> only receives the prize,—I as an Apostle<i> run my course</i>, and you must so<i> run yours,</i> as each to labour not to be rejected at last, but to gain the glorious and incorruptible prize’ This, as compared with the former context, seems to be the sense and connexion of the passage. He was anxious, as an Apostle, to labour more abundantly, more effectually than they all: and hence his condescension to all men, and self-denial: accompanied with which was a humble self-distrust as to the great matter itself of his personal salvation, and an eager anxiety to secure it. These he proposes for their example likewise.<br><br> 24.] The allusion is primarily no doubt to the Isthmian games, celebrated “under the shadow of the huge Corinthian citadel” (Stanley); but this must not be pressed too closely: the foot-race was far too common. an element in athletic contests, for any accurate knowledge of its predominance in some and its insignificance in others of the Grecian games to be here supposed. Still less must it be imagined that those games were to be celebrated in the year of the Epistle being written. The most that can with certainty be said, is that he alludes to a contest which, from the neighbourhood of the Isthmian games, was well known to his readers. See Stanley’s note: who, in following out illustrations of this kind, writes with a vivid graphic power peculiarly his own.
