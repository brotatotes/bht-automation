 25. ] The point in the  οὕτως ,  the conduct of the athletes in regard of temperance , which he wishes to bring into especial prominence for their imitation: as concerning the matter in hand,  his own abstinence from receiving the world’s pelf , in order to save himself and them that heard him.
	The  δέ specifies, referring back to οὕτως . The emphasis is on  πᾶς , thus  shewing  οὕτως  to refer to the πάντες  who τρέχουσιν .
	 ἀγωνιζόμενος is more general than τρέχων , q. d. ‘Every one who engages, not only in the  race , but in  any athletic contest ,’ and thus strengthening the inference. The art. ( ὁ ἀγων .) brings out the man as an enlisted and professed ἀγωνιζόμενος , and regards him in that capacity. Had it been πᾶς δὲ ἀγωνιζ ., the sense would have been, ‘Now every one,  while contending ,’ &c., making the discipline to be merely accidental to his contending which would not suit the spiritual antitype, where we are enlisted for life.
	Examples of the practice of abstinence in athletes may be seen in Wetst. in loc. I will give but two: (1) Hor. de Arte Poet. 412: “Qui studet optatam cursu contingere metam, Multa tulit fecitque puer, sudavit et alsit: Abstinuit venere et vino.” (2) Epict. c. 35: θέλεις ὀλύμπια νικῆσαι ; κἀγὼ νὴ τοὺς θεούς , κομψὸν γάρ ἐστιν . ἀλλὰ σκόπει καὶ τὰ καθηγούμενα καὶ τὰ ἀκόλουθα , καὶ οὕτως ἅπτου τῶν ἔργων . δεῖ σ ʼ εὐτακτεῖν , ἀναγποτροφεῖν , ἀπέχεσθαι πεμμάτων , γυμνάζεσθαι πρὸς ἀνάγκην ἐν ὥρᾳ τεταγμένῃ , ἐν καύματι , ἐν ψύχει , μὴ ψυχρὸν πίνειν , μὴ οἶνον · ὡς ἔτυχεν ἁπλῶς , ὡς ἰατρῷ παραδεδωκέναι σαυτὸν τῷ ἐπιστάτῃ , εἶτα εἰς τὸν ἀγῶνα παρέρχεσθαι .

	 μὲν οὖν , ‘immo vero’ (reff.).
	The School. on Pind. Isthm. ὑπόθεσις , cited by Meyer, says: στέφος δέ ἐστι τοῦ ἀγῶνος  πίτυς , τὸ δὲ ἀνέκαθεν σέλινα καὶ αὐτοῦ ἦν ὁ στέφανος .
	 ἡμεῖς δέ , scil. ἐγκρατευόμεθα ἵνα λάβωμεν στέφανον . He takes for granted the Christian’s temperance in all things, as his normal state.
