<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] The point in the <strong> οὕτως</strong> , <em> the conduct of the athletes in regard of temperance</em> , which he wishes to bring into especial prominence for their imitation: as concerning the matter in hand, <em> his own abstinence from receiving the world’s pelf</em> , in order to save himself and them that heard him.
	</p>
<p>The <strong> δέ</strong> specifies, referring back to οὕτως . The emphasis is on <strong> πᾶς</strong> , thus <em> shewing</em> <strong> οὕτως</strong> <em> to refer to the</em> πάντες <em> who</em> τρέχουσιν .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀγωνιζόμενος</strong> is more general than τρέχων , q. d. ‘Every one who engages, not only in the <em> race</em> , but in <em> any athletic contest</em> ,’ and thus strengthening the inference. The art. ( ὁ ἀγων .) brings out the man as an enlisted and professed ἀγωνιζόμενος , and regards him in that capacity. Had it been πᾶς δὲ ἀγωνιζ ., the sense would have been, ‘Now every one, <em> while contending</em> ,’ &amp;c., making the discipline to be merely accidental to his contending which would not suit the spiritual antitype, where we are enlisted for life.

<p>Examples of the practice of abstinence in athletes may be seen in Wetst. in loc. I will give but two: (1) Hor. de Arte Poet. 412: “Qui studet optatam cursu contingere metam, Multa tulit fecitque puer, sudavit et alsit: Abstinuit venere et vino.” (2) Epict. c. 35: θέλεις ὀλύμπια νικῆσαι ; κἀγὼ νὴ τοὺς θεούς , κομψὸν γάρ ἐστιν . ἀλλὰ σκόπει καὶ τὰ καθηγούμενα καὶ τὰ ἀκόλουθα , καὶ οὕτως ἅπτου τῶν ἔργων . δεῖ σ ʼ εὐτακτεῖν , ἀναγποτροφεῖν , ἀπέχεσθαι πεμμάτων , γυμνάζεσθαι πρὸς ἀνάγκην ἐν ὥρᾳ τεταγμένῃ , ἐν καύματι , ἐν ψύχει , μὴ ψυχρὸν πίνειν , μὴ οἶνον · ὡς ἔτυχεν ἁπλῶς , ὡς ἰατρῷ παραδεδωκέναι σαυτὸν τῷ ἐπιστάτῃ , εἶτα εἰς τὸν ἀγῶνα παρέρχεσθαι .

<p>The School. on Pind. Isthm. ὑπόθεσις , cited by Meyer, says: στέφος δέ ἐστι τοῦ ἀγῶνος <strong> πίτυς</strong> , τὸ δὲ ἀνέκαθεν σέλινα καὶ αὐτοῦ ἦν ὁ στέφανος .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἡμεῖς δέ</strong> , scil. ἐγκρατευόμεθα ἵνα λάβωμεν στέφανον . He takes for granted the Christian’s temperance in all things, as his normal state.</p>
