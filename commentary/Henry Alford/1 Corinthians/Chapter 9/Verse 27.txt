<b> 27.] but I chastise [bruise] my body</b> (the word literally signifies to strike heavily in the face, so as to render black and blue. The<i> body</i> is the adversary, considered as the seat of the temptations of Satan, and especially of that self-indulgence which led the Corinthians to forget their Christian combat, and sit at meat in the idol’s temple. The abuse of this expression to favour the absurd practice of the flagellants, or to support ascetic views at all, need hardly be pointed out to the rational, much less to the Christian student. It is not even of fasting or prayer that he is here speaking, but as the context, vv. 19–23, shews, of breaking down the pride and obstinacy and self-seeking of the natural man by laying himself entirely out for his great work—the salvation of the greatest number: and that, denying himself “solace” from without: “My hands have been worn away (Acts xx. 34) with the black tent-cloths, my frame has been bowed down with this servile labour.” Stanley), and<b> enslave it: lest perchance having pro</b><i><b> claimed</b></i> (the word<b> proclaimed</b> is used<i> absolutely</i>, and answers to our use of<i> preached</i>. The subject of the proclamation might be the<i> laws of the combat,</i> or the<i> names of the victors</i>, each by one in the capacity of<i> herald</i>: probably here the former only, as answering to the preaching of the Apostles. The nature of the case shews that the Christian herald differs from the agonistic herald, in being himself a<i> combatant as well</i>, which the other was not: and that this is so, is no objection to thus understanding the word. “This introduces indeed a new complication into the metaphor: but it is rendered less violent by the fact that.... sometimes the victor in the games was also selected as the herald to announce his success.” Stanley)<b> to others, I myself may prove rejected</b> (from the<i> prize</i>: not, as some Commentators<i> from the contest altogether</i>, for he was already<i> in it</i>). An examination of the victorious combatants took place after the contest, and if it could be proved that they had contended unlawfully, or unfairly, they were deprived of the prize and driven with disgrace from the games. So the Apostle, if he had proclaimed the laws of the combat to others, and not observed them himself, however successful he might apparently be, would be personally rejected as unqualified in the great day. And this he says with a view to shew them the necessity of more self-denial, and less going to the extreme limit of their Christian liberty; as Chrysostom says, “If<i> to me</i> the having preached, and taught, and brought thousands to the faith, suffices not to salvation, if my personal course have not been lawfully run, much more will this be so with you.”
