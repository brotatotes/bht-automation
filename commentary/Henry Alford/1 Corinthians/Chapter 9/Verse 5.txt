<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] <strong> Have we not the power to bring about with us</strong> (also to be maintained at the cost of the churches, for <em> this</em> , and not the power to marry, is here the matter in question) <strong> as a wife, a (believing) sister</strong> (or, ‘ <em> to bring with us a believing wife</em> :’ these are the only renderings of which the words are legitimately capable. Augustine, De Opere Monachorum, 4 (5), vol. vi. p. 552, explains it thus: “Ostendit sibi licere quod ceteris Apostolis, id est ut non operetur manibus suis, sed ex Evangelio vivat:.… ad hoc enim et fideles mulieres habentes terrenam substantiam ibant cum eis, et ministrabant eis de substantia sua,” &amp;c., and similarly Jerome adv. Jovin. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:26">1 Corinthians 1:26</span> , vol. ii. p. 277. So likewise Tertull., Theodoret, Œcum., Isid [37] Pelus., Theophylact, Ambrose, and Sedul [38] So too Corn.-a-Lap. and Estius. See Estius, and Suicer, γυνή , II. And from this misunderstanding of the passage grew up a great abuse, and such women are mentioned with reprobation by Epiphan. Hær. 78, vol. i. (ii. Migne), p. 1043, under the name of ἀγαπηταί . They were also called ἀδελφαί : and were forbidden under the name of συνείσακτοι by the 3rd Canon of the 1st Council of Nicæa. See these words in Suicer), <strong> as also the other Apostles</strong> (in the wider sense, not only the twelve, for <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:6">1 Corinthians 9:6</span> , Barnabas is mentioned. It does not follow hence that all the other Apostles <em> were married</em> : but that <em> all had the power</em> , and <em> some had used it</em> ) <strong> and the brethren of the Lord</strong> (mentioned not <em> because distinct</em> from the ἀπόστολοι , though they were absolutely distinct from the <em> Twelve</em> , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:14">Acts 1:14</span> , but as a further specification of the <em> most renowned persons</em> , who travelled as missionaries, and took their wives with them. On the ἀδ . τοῦ κυρ . see note, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:55">Matthew 13:55</span> . They were in all probability the actual brethren of our Lord by the same mother, the sons of Joseph and Mary. The most noted of these was James, <em> the Lord’s brother</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:19">Galatians 1:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:12">Galatians 2:12</span> , compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:17">Acts 12:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:13">Acts 15:13</span> ; Act 21:18 ), the resident bishop of the Church at Jerusalem: the others known to us by name were Joses (or Joseph), Simon, and Judas, see note on Matt, ib.), <strong> and Cephas</strong> (Peter was married, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14">Matthew 8:14</span> . A beautiful tradition exists of his encouraging his wife who was led to death, by saying μέμνησο , ὦ αὕτη , τοῦ κυρίου , Clem [39] Alex. Strom. vii. § 11 (63), p. 868 P. Euseb. H. E. iii. 30. Clem [40] Alex. Strom, iii. § 6 (52), p. 535 P., relates that he had children)? On a mistake which has been made respecting St. Paul’s (supposed) wife, see note on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:8">1 Corinthians 7:8</span> .
