 5. ]  Have we not the power to bring about with us (also to be maintained at the cost of the churches, for  this , and not the power to marry, is here the matter in question)  as a wife, a (believing) sister (or, ‘  to bring with us a believing wife :’ these are the only renderings of which the words are legitimately capable. Augustine, De Opere Monachorum, 4 (5), vol. vi. p. 552, explains it thus: “Ostendit sibi licere quod ceteris Apostolis, id est ut non operetur manibus suis, sed ex Evangelio vivat:.… ad hoc enim et fideles mulieres habentes terrenam substantiam ibant cum eis, et ministrabant eis de substantia sua,” &c., and similarly Jerome adv. Jovin. 1 Corinthians 1:26 , vol. ii. p. 277. So likewise Tertull., Theodoret, Œcum., Isid [37] Pelus., Theophylact, Ambrose, and Sedul [38] So too Corn.-a-Lap. and Estius. See Estius, and Suicer, γυνή , II. And from this misunderstanding of the passage grew up a great abuse, and such women are mentioned with reprobation by Epiphan. Hær. 78, vol. i. (ii. Migne), p. 1043, under the name of ἀγαπηταί . They were also called ἀδελφαί : and were forbidden under the name of συνείσακτοι by the 3rd Canon of the 1st Council of Nicæa. See these words in Suicer),  as also the other Apostles (in the wider sense, not only the twelve, for 1 Corinthians 9:6 , Barnabas is mentioned. It does not follow hence that all the other Apostles  were married : but that  all had the power , and  some had used it )  and the brethren of the Lord (mentioned not  because distinct from the ἀπόστολοι , though they were absolutely distinct from the  Twelve , see Acts 1:14 , but as a further specification of the  most renowned persons , who travelled as missionaries, and took their wives with them. On the ἀδ . τοῦ κυρ . see note, Matthew 13:55 . They were in all probability the actual brethren of our Lord by the same mother, the sons of Joseph and Mary. The most noted of these was James,  the Lord’s brother (Galatians 1:19 ; Galatians 2:9 ; Galatians 2:12 , compare Acts 12:17 ; Acts 15:13 ; Act 21:18 ), the resident bishop of the Church at Jerusalem: the others known to us by name were Joses (or Joseph), Simon, and Judas, see note on Matt, ib.),  and Cephas (Peter was married, see Matthew 8:14 . A beautiful tradition exists of his encouraging his wife who was led to death, by saying μέμνησο , ὦ αὕτη , τοῦ κυρίου , Clem [39] Alex. Strom. vii. § 11 (63), p. 868 P. Euseb. H. E. iii. 30. Clem [40] Alex. Strom, iii. § 6 (52), p. 535 P., relates that he had children)? On a mistake which has been made respecting St. Paul’s (supposed) wife, see note on ch. 1 Corinthians 7:8 .
