<b> 5.] Have we not the power to take about with us</b> (also to be maintained at the cost of the churches, for this, and not the power to marry, is here the matter in question)<b> as a wife, a (believing) sister</b> (<i>or, ‘to bring with us a believing wife</i>;’ these are the only renderings of which the words are legitimately capable. From a misunderstanding of this passage grew up a great abuse, that of missionaries taking about with them women of wealth, who ministered to them of their substance. Such women are mentioned with reprobation by Epiphanins, and were forbidden by the Council of Nicaea),<b> as well as the other Apostles</b> (in the wider sense, not only the Twelve; for, ver. 6, Barnabas is mentioned. It does not follow hence that all the other Apostles<i> were married; but that all had the power, and some had used it</i>),<b> and the brethren of the Lord</b> (mentioned not<i> because distinct</i> from the Apostles, though they were absolutely distinct from the<i> Twelve</i>, see Acts i, 14,—but as a further specification of the<i> most renowned persons</i>, who travelled as missionaries, and took their wives with them. On the<i> brethren of the Lord,</i> see note, Matt. xiii. 55. They were in all probability the actual brethren of our Lord by the same mother, the sons of Joseph and Mary. The most noted of these was James, the Lord’s brother [Gal. i. 19; ii. 9, 12, compare Acts xii. 17; xv. 13; xxi. 18], the resident bishop of the Church at Jerusalem; the others known to us by name were Joses [or Joseph], Simon, and Judas, see note on Matt. ib.), and Cephas (Peter was married, see Matt. viii. 14. A beautiful tradition exists of his encouraging his wife who was led to death, by saying, “O thou, remember the Lord.” Clement ‘of Alexandria relates that he had children On a mistake which has been made respecting St. Paul’s (supposed) wife, see note on ch. vii. 8)?
