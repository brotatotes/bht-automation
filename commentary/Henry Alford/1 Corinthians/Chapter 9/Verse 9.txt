<b> 9.]</b> (It does say them)<b> For in the law of Moses it is written, Thou shalt not muzzle an ox while treading out the corn.</b> It was and still is the custom in the East, to place the newly-reaped grain on a floor in the open air, and then, by means of oxen, or buffaloes, to crush out the grain from the husk, either by the feet of the beasts, or by machines dragged by them.<br><br><b> Is it for the OXEN that God is taking care?</b>—The question imports, In giving this command are the<i> oxen</i>, or those<i> for whom the law was given</i>, its objects?” And to such a question there can be but one answer. Every duty of<i> humanity</i> has for its ultimate ground, not the mere welfare of the animal concerned,<i> but its welfare in that system of which MAN is the head:</i> and therefore,<i> man’s</i> welfare. The good done to man’s immortal spirit by acts of humanity and justice, infinitely outweighs the mere physical comfort of a brute which perishes.
