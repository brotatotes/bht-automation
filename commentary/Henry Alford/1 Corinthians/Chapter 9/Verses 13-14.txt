 13, 14 .]  Analogy of the maintenance of the Jewish priesthood from the sacred offerings, with this right of the Christian teacher, as ordained by Christ .
	Meyer rightly remarks, that  οἱ τὰ ἱερὰ ἐργαζόμενοι can only mean the  priests, not including the Levites : and therefore that both clauses apply to the same persons.
	 ἐργάζεσθαι , ἔρδειν , ῥέζειν , are technical words for the  offering of sacrifice . See reff. to LXX.
	 ἱεροῦ here, as θυσιαστηρίου is parallel with it below, is probably not ‘  the sacrifice ,’ ‘  the holy thing ,’ but  the temple ‘  the holy building .’ Similarly Jos. B. J. v. 13. 6, makes the Zealots say, δεῖ … τοὺς τῷ ναῷ στρατευομένους  ἐκ τοῦ ναοῦ τρέφεσθαι  .
	 παρεδρ  . ] So Jos. contra Apion. 1 Corinthians 1:7 , speaks of the priests as τῇ θεραπείᾳ τοῦ θεοῦ προσεδρεύοντας .
	On the practice referred to, see Numbers 18:8 ff.; Deuteronomy 18:1 ff.
	 No other priesthood but the Jewish can have been in the mind of the Apostle. The Jew knew of no θυσιαστήριον but  one : and he certainly would not have proposed heathen sacrificial customs, even  in connexion with those appointed by God, as a precedent for Christian usage: besides that the idea is inconsistent with οὕτως καί : see below.
