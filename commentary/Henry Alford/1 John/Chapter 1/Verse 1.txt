—This Epistle does not begin with an<i> address</i>, properly so called. But there is in this sentence the latent form of an address: the “<i>unto you</i>” of ver. 3, and the wish “<i>that our joy maybe full</i>,” answering (see note) to the more usual<i> greeting</i>, seem to shew that what follows is an Epistle, not a treatise.<br><br> The construction of these verses is difficult, and has been variously given. The simplest view, and that generally adopted, is, that in ver. 1 a sentence is begun, which is broken off by the parenthetical ver. 2 inserted to explain ver. 1, and carried on again in ver. 3, some words being, for the sake of perspicuity, recited again from ver. 1. The smaller clauses, &c., are co-ordinate with each other. So that the sentence and construction flow smoothly and regularly.<br><br><b> That which was</b> (not, ‘<i>took place</i>’)<b> from the beginning</b> (not synonymous with “<i>in the beginning</i>,” though in the depth of its meaning it is virtually the same. It sets before us the prior limit, but without meaning strictly to define it as such exclusively. The interpretation, “<i>Since the beginning of the Gospel</i>,” is connected with the misunderstanding of the whole passage by the Socinian interpreters, and cannot stand for a moment when we consider the context with ver. 2, and the use of this term by St. John when applied Christ or to supernatural beings: see ch. ii. 13, 14, iii. 8; John viii. 44. Wherever he uses it of the preaching of the Gospel it is definitely marked as bearing that meaning: compare ch. ii. 7, 24, iii. 11. On the meaning of this clause see below),<b> that which we have heard</b> (the perfect tense extends the reference of the verb from the beginning, and that which the Apostle might have heard concerning Christ, e.g. from John the Baptist, down to the time when he was writing: regards his hearing as a finished and abiding possession),<b> that which we have seen with our eyes</b> (the same is true again. The seeing as well as the hearing is a finished and abiding possession. The clauses rise in climax: seeing is more than hearing:<b> with our eyes</b> emphasizes the fact of eye-witness),<b> that which we looked upon</b> (now, the tense is altered: because the Evangelist comes from speaking of the closed testimony which abode with him asa whole, to that of the senses actually exercised at the time when Christ was on earth. Notice the climax again:<i> to look upon</i> is more than<i> to see</i>: so Beza here: “which I saw with these eyes, and that not once, nor by the way, but which I earnestly and thoroughly contemplated.” See more below),<b> and our hands handled</b> ( “a reference has been supposed to John xx. 20, 27: Luke xxiv. 39. But there is no need for it. Surely no<i> proof</i> is wanted, that John, who lay on the bosom of our Lord, and was beloved by Him, had touched his Lord with bis hands.” Fritzsche. These words are not for a moment to be explained away: they are literal matter of fact, and form one of the strongest proofs that what is said, is said of no other than the personal incarnate Son of God)<b> concerning the Word of life</b> (the<i> construction</i> seems to be this:<b> concerning</b> depends strictly upon the verb<b> heard</b>, loosely upon the other clauses. The explanation turns wholly upon the sense which we assign to the words the<b> Word of life:</b> and here there has been great diversity among commentators. This diversity may be gathered under two head: those who make<b> the Word</b> the personal Word, who<i> is life</i>, and those who make it the account, or preaching, or doctrine,<i> concerning life</i>. Of this<i> latter</i> number are, for the most part, Socinus and his school, and some few other expositors. ‘The<i> former</i> includes Augustine, Bede, Calvin [gives both], Beza, Luther, Bengel, &c. And as these words are the keystone of the sentence, it will be well to set out the interpretation once for all. I regard then<b> the Word of life</b> as the designation of our Lord Himself. He is the<i> Word</i>, and is<i> the Word of life,</i> this genitive,<i> of life</i>, being one of apposition, as He describes Himself, as being the<i> Life</i>, Join xi, 25, xiv. 6,—<i>the Bread of life</i>, vi. 35, 48: the<i> Light of life,</i> viii. 12: compare also, i. 4. This being so, the things mentioned<b> that which,—that which,—that which</b>,—are all matters concerning, belonging to, regarding, Himself, the Lord of Life: all together predicated of Him by the<b> concerning</b>, which more properly belongs to the one verb<b> heard</b> [notice that in ver. 5, where the nature of the<i> message</i> is stated, this alone, of all these verbs, repeated].<br><br><b> That which was from the beginning</b> is His eternal pre-existence and inherent Life and Glory with the Father: this is what, in a sense slightly, though but slightly, differing from the
