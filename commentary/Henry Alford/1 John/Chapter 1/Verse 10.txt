<b> 10.</b>] Not a mere repetition, but a confirmation and intensification of ver. 8. This verse is related to ver. 9, as ver. 8 is to ver. 7).<br><br><b> If we say that we have not sinned</b> (if we deny, that is, the fact of our commission of sins in our Christian state. The perfect tense, so far from removing the time to that before conversion, brings it down to the present: had it been<i> “that we sinned not,”</i> it might have had that signification.<b> we</b><b> have not sinned</b> answers in time to “<i>we have no sin</i>:” the one representing the state as existing, the other the sum of sinful acts which have gone to make it up),<b> we make him</b> (God, see above)<b> a liar</b> (this is the climax, gradually reached through the words<i> “we lie,</i>” ver. 6, and “<i>we deceive ourselves,</i>” ver. 8.
