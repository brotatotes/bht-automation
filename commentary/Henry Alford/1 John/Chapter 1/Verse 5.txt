<b> 5—II. 28.]</b> FIRST PART OF THE EPISTLE: the message, that<i> if we would have fellowship with Him who is Light, we must</i><i> walk in light, keeping His commandments</i>. See the discussion on the division of the Epistle, in the Introduction.<br><br> 5.] In each of these divisions, the first verse contains the ground-tone of the whole. And so here—GOD IS LIGHT.—<b>And</b> (serves to introduce the new subject)<b> the message which we have heard from Him</b> (viz. from Christ),<b> and announce to you</b> (Diisterdieck remarks, that St. John seems every where to observe the distinction between the two verbs, to<i> announce</i> and to<i> declare</i>),<b> is this: that God is light</b> (not, us Luther, “a light:”<b> light</b> is purely predicative, indicating the essence of God: just as when it is said in ch. iv. 8, “<i>God is love</i>.” There it is true the predicative is purely ethical, and thus literal, when used of God who is a Spirit, whereas here,<i> light</i> being a material, not an ethical object, some amount of figurative meaning must be conceded. But of all material objects, light is that which most easily passes into an ethical predicative without even the process, in our thought, of interpretation. It unites in itself purity and clearness and beauty and glory, as no other material object does: it is the condition of all material life and growth and joy. And the application to God of such a predicative requires no transference. He is Light, and the Fountain of Light material and light ethical. In the one world, darkness is the absence of light: in the other, darkness, untruthfulness, deceit, falsehood, is the absence of God. They who are in communion with God, and walk with God, are of the light, and walk in the light),<b> and there is not in Him any darkness at all</b> (it is according to the manner of St. John, to strengthen an affirmation by the emphatic negation of its opposite; compare ver. 8: ch. ii. 4, 10, 27, &c. Of the ethical darkness here denied, the Scholiast says, “for neither is there ignorance, nor deceit, nor sin, nor death.” ‘The Greek expositors ask the question respecting this message, “And where did he hear this?”—and answer it, From Christ Himself, who suid, “I am the<b> Light</b> of the world.’”
