 6.]<i> None can have fellowship with Him who walk in darkness</i>. If we say (the hypothesis is not assumed,—*If we say, as we do:”—but is purely hypothetical, “say who will and when he will.” ‘The first person plural gives to the sayings ‘a more general form, precluding any from escaping from the inference: at the same time that by including himself in the hypothesis, the Apostle descends to the level of his readers, thus giving to his exhortations the “come,” and not “go,” which ever wins men’s hearts the most)<b> that we have fellowship with Him</b> (see on ver. 3. “Communion with God is the very innermost essence of all true Christian life.” Huther),<b> and walk in the darkness</b> (<b>walk</b>, as so often in the New Test. of the whole being and moving and turning in the world: as Bengel, “by inward or outward action, whither-soever we turn ourselves; the<i> light</i>, the<i> darkness</i>, mark off the two more distinctly than could be done without the articles, as two existing separate ethical regions, the God and no-God regions of spiritual being),<b> we lie</b> (our assertion is a false one)<b> and do not the truth</b> (this clanse is not a mere repetition, in a negative form, of the preceding “<i>we lie</i>:” but is an independent proposition, answering to “<i>and walk in the darkness</i>,” and asserting that all such walking in darkness is a not-doing of the truth. Christ is “the Truth;” and all doing the Truth is of Him, and of those who are in union with Him. So that the truth is objective, not as “<i>truth</i>” alone it be, subjective, and imports “God’s truth,” Eph. iv. 21. We may observe how closely the teaching here as to<i> light</i> and<i> truth</i> resembles that in iv. v. See also John iii. 21)
