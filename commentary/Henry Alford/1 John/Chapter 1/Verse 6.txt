 6 .]  None can have communion with Him who walk in darkness .  If we say (the hypothesis is not assumed, “If we say, as we do:” but is purely hypothetical, “say who will and when he will.” This  ἐάν with the subj. is repeated in every verse as far as ch. 1 John 2:1 . The 1st pers. plur. gives to the sayings a more general form, precluding any from escaping from the inference: at the same time that by including himself in the hypothesis, the Apostle descends to the level of his readers, thus giving to his exhortations the “come,” and not “go,” which ever wins men’s hearts the most)  that we have communion with Him (see on 1 John 1:3 . “Communion with God is the very innermost essence of all true Christian life.” Huther),  and walk in the darkness (  περιπατῶμεν , as so often in N. T., of the whole being and moving and turning in the world: as Bengel, “actione interna et externa, quoquo nos vertimus:” see reff.  τῷ σκότει ,  τῷ φωτί , mark off the two more distinctly than could be done without the art., as two existing separate ethical regions, the God and no-God regions of spiritual being),  we lie (  ψευδόμεθα is used with reference to εἴπωμεν : our assertion is a false one),  and do not the truth (this clause is not a mere repetition, in a negative form, of the preceding ψευδόμεθα , as e. g. Episcopius, “hoc dicentes non facimus quod rectum est:” but is an independent proposition, answering to ἐν τῷ σκότει περιπατῶμεν , and asserting that all such walking in darkness is a not-doing of the truth. Christ is “the Truth:” and all doing the Truth is of Him, and of those who are in union with Him. So that ἡ ἀλήθεια is objective, not as ἀλήθεια alone might be, subjective, and imports “God’s truth,” καθώς ἐστιν ἀλήθεια ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ , Ephesians 4:21 . We may observe how closely the teaching here as to φῶς and ἀλήθεια resembles that in Ephesians 4:5 . See also Joh 3:21 )
