 7.] (is not merely the contrasted hypothesis to ver. 6, but together with that contains a further unfolding of the subject):<b> but if we walk in the light</b> (this walking in the light is explained by what follows, as<i> He is in the light,</i> and by the end of the sentence, which gives the result of so walking,—viz. fellowship&c, See Eph. v. 8 ff. for the ethical details)<b> as He</b> (God)<b> is in the light</b> (because the Christian is made<i> partaker of the divine nature,</i> 2 Pet. i, 4.<b> is in the light</b> is parallel with “<i>is light</i>” above, ver. 5. is, as of Him who is eternal and fixed;<b> we walk</b>, as of us who are of time, moving onward: so Bede, “The distinction of words is to be noted; he says that God is in the light, but that<i> we ought to walk</i> in the light. For the righteous walk in the light, when, giving themselves to the working of good deeds, they advance towards perfection:” see note on ch. ii, 6:<b> the light</b> is the element in which God dwelleth: compare 1 Tim. vi. 16. Notice that this walking in the light, as He is in the light, no mere imitation of God, but is an identity in the essential element of our daily walk with the essential element of God’s eternal being: not imitation, bat coincidence and identity of the very atmosphere of life),<b> we have fellowship with one another</b> (these words are to be taken in their plain literal sense, and refer, not to our communion with God, which is assumed in our walking in the light as He is in the light, but to our mutual communion with one another by all having the same ground-element of life, viz. the light of the Lord, Isa. ii. 5. There is evidently an allusion to ver. 3, and as there fellowship with God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ is expressed, so here it lies in the background, but need not be supplied. De Wette’s remark is most true; Christian communion is then only real, when it is communion with God),<b> and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanseth us from all sin</b> (in order to understand rightly this important sentence, we must fix definitely two or three points regarding its connexion and construction. First then, and connects it, as an additional result of our walking in the light, as He is in the light, with the words<i> we have fellowship one with another</i>: just as in ch. iii. 10, end, and<i> he that loveth not his brother.</i> Consequently, the propostion contained in it cannot be the<i> ground</i> of the former one, that “if we walk, &c., ve fellowship, &c.” but follows as&co-ordinate result with the fact, of our having fellowship. Secondly,<b> cleanseth</b> is the present tense, and must be kept to its<i> present</i> meaning. This consideration precludes all meanings which make it refer to the past effect of the Atonement on us, either absolutely, by its having happened, or as applied to us in Baptism.<i> Thirdly</i>, the<i> sense</i> of<b> cleanseth</b> must be accurately ascertained, and strictly kept to. In 9, “<i>to cleanse us from all unrighteousness</i>” is plainly distinguished from “<i>to forgive us our sins</i>:” distinguished, as a further process: as, in a word, sanctification distinct from justification. ‘This meaning then, however much it may be supposed that’ justification is implied or presupposed, must be held fast here.<i> Fourthly</i>, the sense of<b> the blood of Jesus</b> must be also clearly defined. ‘The expression is an objective one, not a subjective: is spoken of that which is the objective cause from without, of our being cleansed from all sin. And this is the material Blood of Jesus the personal Redeemer, shed on the cross as a propitiatory sacrifice for the sin of the world. So we have the same Blood said in Col. i. 20 to be the great medium of pacification between God and the world: so in Eph. i. 7, to be the means of our<i> redemption</i>: so in Heb. ix. 14, which approaches Very nearly to our passage, to<i> cleanse</i> [here] our conscience from dead works to serve the living God. In all these places, and similar ones, whatever application to ourselves by faith or otherwise may lie in the background, it is not that which is<i> spoken of</i>, but the Blood of Christ itself, as the actual objective cause, once for all, of our reconciliation and sanctification, These considerations remove much of the difficulty and possible misunderstanding of the sentence. Thus understood, it will mean, that this our walking in light, itself necessarily grounded in communion with the Father and the Son, will bring about, that whatever sins we may still be betrayed into by the infirmity of our nature and the malice of the devil, from them the Blood of Jesus purifies us day by day. Observe, not, the<i> application</i> of that Blood: for we are speaking of a state of faith and holiness, in which that blood is continually applied: the<i> walking in the light is</i>, in fact,<i> the application</i>; is that which, as a subjective conditional element, makes that Blood of Christ’s cross to he to us a means of purifying from all sin.—The whole doctrine of this verse is fully and admirable set forth in Dusterdieck. The sum of what he says may be thus stated. St. John, in accord with the other Apostles, sets forth the Death and Blood of Christ in two different aspects: 1) as the one sin-offering for the world, in which sense we are justified by the application of the blood of Christ by faith, His satisfaction being imputed to us. 2) as a victory over Sin itself, His blood being the purifying medium, whereby we gradually, being already justified, become pure and clean from all sin. And this application of Christ’s blood is made by the Spirit which dwelleth in us. ‘The former of these asserts the imputed righteousness of Christ put on us in justification: the latter, the inherent righteousness of Christ, wrought in us gradually in sanctification. And it is of this latter that he here is treating. Compare next verse).
