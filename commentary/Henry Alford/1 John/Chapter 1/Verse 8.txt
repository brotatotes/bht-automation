 8—II. 2.]<i> Unfolding of the idea of purification from sin by” the blood of Christ in connexion with our walking in light.</i> This last is adduced in one of its plainest and simplest consequences, viz. the recognition of all that is yet darkness in us, in the confession of our sins. “If thou hast confessed thyself a sinner, the truth is in thee: for truth itself is light. Thy life is not yet all light, because there are yet sins in it: but nevertheless thou hast begun to be illuminated, because there is in thee confession of sins.” The light that is in us convicts the darkness, and we, no longer loving or desiring to sin, have, by means of the propitiatory and sanctifying blood of Christ, both full forgiveness of and sure purification from all our sins. But the true test of this state of communion with and knowledge of God is, the keeping of His commandments [ii. 36], the walking as Christ walked: and this test is concentrated and summed up in its one crucial application, viz. to the law of love [ii. 7–11]<br><br><b> 8.] If we say that we have not sin (i. e.</b> in the course and abiding of our walking in light: if we maintain that we are pure and free from all stain of sin. St. John is writing to persons whose sins have been forgiven them [ii. 12], and therefore necessarily the present tense [<b>we have</b>] refers not to any previous state of sinful life before conversion, but to their now existing state and the sins to which they are liable in that state. And in thus referring, it takes up the conclusion of the last verse, in which the onward cleansing power of the sanctifying blood of Christ was asserted: as if it were said this state of needing cleansing from all present sin is veritably that of all of us: and our recognition and confession of it is the very first essential of walking in light),<b> we are deceiving ourselves</b> (causing ourselves to err from the straight and true way),<b> and the truth</b> (God’s truth, objective)<b> is not in us</b> (has not subjective place in us. That truth respecting God’s holiness and our own sinfulness, which is the very first spark of light within, has no place in us at all).
