<b> 9.] If we confess our sins</b> (it is evident, from the whole sense of the passage, which has regard to our walling in light and in the truth, that no mere outward lip-confession is here meant, nor on the other hand any mere being aware within ourselves of sin, but the union of the two, an external spoken confession springing from genuine inward contrition. As evident is it, that the confession here spoken of is not confined to confession to God, but embraces all our utterances on the subject, to one another as well as to Him; compare James v. 16: and see more below)<b> He</b> (God the Father; not, Christ, though this may at first sight seem probable from ver. 7 and ch. ii. 1. God is the chief subject through the whole passage: compare “<i>God is</i> light,” ver. 5: “with Him,” ver. 6; “He,” mud “His Son,” in ver. 7."It is ever God's truth [1 Cor. 9, 10, 13; 2 Cor. i. 18; 1 ‘Thess. v. 24] and righteousness (John xvii 25 Rom. iii. 25; Rev. xvi. 5] that are concerned in, and vindicated by, our redemption)<b> is faithful and just</b> (His being faithful and just does not’ depend on our confessing our sins: He had both these attributes before, and will ever continue to have them: but by confessing our sins, we cast ourselves on, we approach and put to the proof for ourselves, and shall find operative in our case, in the<i> forgiving</i> and<i> cleansing</i>, those His attributes of faithfulness and&c. On the former of these adjectives,<b> faithful</b>, almost all Commentators agree. It is, faithful to His plighted word and promise: see the citations above.—The latter, just, has not been so unanimously interpreted ‘The idea of<i> God’s</i> justice seeming strange here, where the remission of and purification from sin is in question, some Commentators have endeavoured to give the word the sense of<i> good</i>,<i> merciful</i>: or, which amounts to the same,<i> fair</i>,<i> favourably</i><i> disposed</i>. But Lucke has shewn, that in none of the Old Test. passages which are cited to substantiate these meanings, have they really place; but in all, righteousness, justice, is the fundamental idea, and the context only makes it mean justice in this or in that direction. See note on Matt. 19. ‘The meaning then being<b> just</b>, we have still to decide between several different views as to what particular phase of the divine justice is meant. Some understand that God’s justice has been satisfied in Christ, and thus the application of that satisfaction to us if we confess our sins, is an act of divine justice: is due to us in Christ. But this is plainly too much to be extracted from our verse. In Rom. iii. 26, where this is asserted, the reason is given, and all is fully explained: whereas here the ellipsis would be most harsh and unprecedented and thus to fill it up would amount to an introduction into the context of an idea which is altogether foreign to it. The correct view seems to be, that<i> just</i> as well as<i> faithful</i> here is an attribute strictly to be kept to that which is predicated of it under the circumstances, without entering upon reasons external to the context. God is<i> faithful</i>, to His promise: is<i> just</i>, in His dealing: and both attributes’ operate in the forgiveness of sins to the penitent, now and hereafter; and in cleansing them from all unrighteousness, The laws of His spiritual kingdom require this: by those laws He acts in holy and infinite justice. His promises announced it, and to those promises He is faithful; but then those promises were themselves made only in accordance with His nature, who is holy, just, and true. In the background lie all the details of redemption; but they are not here in this verse: only the simple fact of God’s justice is adduced)<b> to forgive us our sins</b> (not “so as to forgive, &c.,” but “that He may forgive, &c.” His doing so is in accordance with, and therefore as with Him all facts are purposed, is in pursuance of, furthers the object of,<b> His faithfulness</b> and justice, “So that<b> He is faithful and</b> just; in order that He may,&.” With regard to the particular mentioned, the forgiveness of our sins here means the continued remission of the guilt of each committed sin, which is the special promise and just act of God under the Gospel covenant: see Heb, x. 14, 18),<b> and cleanse us from all unrighteousness</b> (the explanation. of the sense, see above. Here unrighteousness is used, in reference to the word “<i>righteous</i>,” above, as corresponding to<i> sins</i>” in ver. 7, The divine<i> righteousness</i> is revealed in God’s law: every transgression then of that law is of its nature and essence an unrighteousness, as contrary to that<i> righteousness</i>. The two verbs,<b> forgive</b> and<b> cleanse</b>, imply in the original, that the purpose of the faithfulness and justice of God is to do each as one great complex act—to justify and to sanctify wholly and entirely.
