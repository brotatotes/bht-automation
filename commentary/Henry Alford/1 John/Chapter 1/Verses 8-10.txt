 8 2:2 .]  Unfolding of the idea of purification from sin by the blood of Christ, in connexion with our walking in light . This last is adduced in one of its plainest and simplest consequences, viz. the recognition of all that is yet darkness in us, in the confession of our sins. “Si te confessus fueris peccatorem, est in te veritas: nam ipsa veritas lux est. Nondum perfecte splenduit vita tua, quia insunt peccata: sed tamen jam illuminari cœpisti, quia inest confessio peccatorum.” Aug [11] The light that is in us convicts the darkness, and we, no longer loving nor desiring to sin, have, by means of the propitiatory and sanctifying blood of Christ, both full forgiveness of and sure purification from all our sins. But the true test of this state of communion with and knowledge of God is, the keeping of His commandments ( 1Jn 2:3-6 ), the walking as Christ walked: and this test is concentrated and summed up in its one crucial application, viz. to the law of love ( 1Jn 2:7-11 ).
