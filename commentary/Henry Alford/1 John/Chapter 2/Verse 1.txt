 CHAP. II. 1.] The connexion is thus given by Augustine: “Lest perchance he might ‘seem to have given impunity to sins, by saying, ‘He is faithful and just to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,” and men should say to themselves, ‘Let us sin: let us fearlessly do what we will, Christ cleanseth us:’—he takes from thee false security, and puts in useful fear."Thou art disposed to be falsely secure: be thou watchful and careful; for He is faithful and just, that He may remit us our sins, and that thou mayest always he displeased with thyself, and mayest be continually changed even unto perfection What then follows? ‘My little children, &c.’ But then perhaps sin after all, from human imperfection, supervenes, What then? Shall this lead to desperation Listen, ‘If any man have sinned,’ he says, &c.” See more below. But there is more in the connexion than this. It is not corrective only of a possible mistake, but it is progressive—a further step taken in the direction of unfolding the great theme of this part of the Epistle, enounced in ch. i. 5. The first step for those walking in the light of God was, that they should confess their sins: the next and consequent one, that they should forsake them, and, agreeably to their new nature, keep Uis commandments. This verse introduces that further unfolding of our subject, which is continued, and especially pressed as regards the one great commandment of love, in our vv. 3–11.<br><br> 1.]<b> My little children</b> (the diminutive expresses tender affection perhaps also is used in reference to his age and long standing as a father in Christ. There is a beautiful legend in Eusebius, where St. John calls back to him a young man who had gone astray with the words, “<i>Why fliest thou from me, my child, me, thine own father</i>?”),<b> these things write I unto you, that ye may sin not [at all]</b> (implying the absence not only of the habit, but of any single acts of sin.<b> these things I write,</b> not,<i> that which follows;</i> nor, both the preceding and the following: but the preceding only, viz. the concluding verses 8–10 of the former chapter, not in their details merely, but in their whole connexion. The object of writing that passage was, to bring about in them the forsaking of sin. ‘The very announcement there made, that if we confess our sins He in His faithfulness and righteousness will<i> cleanse us from all sin</i>, sufficiently substantiates What the Apostle here says, without bringing out too strongly the contemplation of a supposed misunderstanding on the part of the readers. ‘To do this is to miss the deeper connexion in which these words stand to the great whole in its harmony, and to give instead only an apparent and superficial one. The reference of this exhortation to the<i> unconverted</i> among them, and rendering<i> “that ye abide not in sin,”</i> maintained by Socinus and his followers, need only be mentioned to be refuted. The past tense “<i>have sinned</i>,” may serve to shew its utter untenableness).<b> And if any man have sinned</b> (have committed an act of sin: still speaking of those spots of sin which owing to the infirmity of the flesh remain even in those who are walking in the light. By this there is not any doubt. expressed that all do occasionally sin, but the hypothesis is made, as ever by this formula, purely and generally. The resumption of the first person immediately, makes it evident that the hypothesis is in fact realized in us all),<b> we have an Advocate with</b> (towards, as_pleading in His presence)<b> the Father, Jesus Christ</b> (the principal word requiring elucidation here is<b> Advocate</b> (Paraclete). There are two classes of interpretations of it, which, as already remarked [on John xiv. 16], by no means exclude one another. Of these, that one which may be summed up under the meaning “COMFORTER,” has already been treated, on John, in the place quoted. With the other we have now to deal. ADVOCATE is the commoner sense of the word, and that which it certainly bears here. There is no discrepancy between this passage, where the Son is our<b> Paraclete</b>, and John xiv. 16, where the Holy Spirit is called by the same name: rather is there the closest accordance, seeing that there our Lord says He will pray the Father and He will send us “<b>another</b>
