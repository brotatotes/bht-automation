 CHAP. II. 1.] The connexion is thus given by Augustine: “Lest perchance he might ‘seem to have given impunity to sins, by saying, ‘He is faithful and just to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,” and men should say to themselves, ‘Let us sin: let us fearlessly do what we will, Christ cleanseth us:’—he takes from thee false security, and puts in useful fear."Thou art disposed to be falsely secure: be thou watchful and careful; for He is faithful and just, that He may remit us our sins, and that thou mayest always he displeased with thyself, and mayest be continually changed even unto perfection What then follows? ‘My little children, &c.’ But then perhaps sin after all, from human imperfection, supervenes, What then? Shall this lead to desperation Listen, ‘If any man have sinned,’ he says, &c.” See more below. But there is more in the connexion than this. It is not corrective only of a possible mistake, but it is progressive—a further step taken in the direction of unfolding the great theme of this part of the Epistle, enounced in ch. i. 5. The first step for those walking in the light of God was, that they should confess their sins: the next and consequent one, that they should forsake them, and, agreeably to their new nature, keep Uis commandments. This verse introduces that further unfolding of our subject, which is continued, and especially pressed as regards the one great commandment of love, in our vv. 3–11.<br><br> 1.]<b> My little children</b> (the diminutive expresses tender affection perhaps also is used in reference to his age and long standing as a father in Christ. There is a beautiful legend in Eusebius, where St. John calls back to him a young man who had gone astray with the words, “<i>Why fliest thou from me, my child, me, thine own father</i>?”),<b> these things write I unto you, that ye may sin not [at all]</b> (implying the absence not only of the habit, but of any single acts of sin.<b> these things I write,</b> not,<i> that which follows;</i> nor, both the preceding and the following: but the preceding only, viz. the concluding verses 8–10 of the former chapter, not in their details merely, but in their whole connexion. The object of writing that passage was, to bring about in them the forsaking of sin. ‘The very announcement there made, that if we confess our sins He in His faithfulness and righteousness will<i> cleanse us from all sin</i>, sufficiently substantiates What the Apostle here says, without bringing out too strongly the contemplation of a supposed misunderstanding on the part of the readers. ‘To do this is to miss the deeper connexion in which these words stand to the great whole in its harmony, and to give instead only an apparent and superficial one. The reference of this exhortation to the<i> unconverted</i> among them, and rendering<i> “that ye abide not in sin,”</i> maintained by Socinus and his followers, need only be mentioned to be refuted. The past tense “<i>have sinned</i>,” may serve to shew its utter untenableness).<b> And if any man have sinned</b> (have committed an act of sin: still speaking of those spots of sin which owing to the infirmity of the flesh remain even in those who are walking in the light. By this there is not any doubt. expressed that all do occasionally sin, but the hypothesis is made, as ever by this formula, purely and generally. The resumption of the first person immediately, makes it evident that the hypothesis is in fact realized in us all),<b> we have an Advocate with</b> (towards, as_pleading in His presence)<b> the Father, Jesus Christ</b> (the principal word requiring elucidation here is<b> Advocate</b> (Paraclete). There are two classes of interpretations of it, which, as already remarked [on John xiv. 16], by no means exclude one another. Of these, that one which may be summed up under the meaning “COMFORTER,” has already been treated, on John, in the place quoted. With the other we have now to deal. ADVOCATE is the commoner sense of the word, and that which it certainly bears here. There is no discrepancy between this passage, where the Son is our<b> Paraclete</b>, and John xiv. 16, where the Holy Spirit is called by the same name: rather is there the closest accordance, seeing that there our Lord says He will pray the Father and He will send us “<b>another</b><i> Paraclete:</i>” He himself, the Son of God, being thus asserted to hold this office in the first place, and the Holy Spirit to be His Substitute in His absence) [<b>being</b>]<b> righteous</b> ( “in that He is righteous,” as a contrast to “<i>if any man sin.</i>” In a strict rendering, this force should be kept, and pointed out in explanation: in an English version, it is hardly possible to render it otherwise than our translators have done, “the righteous,” though it is not absolutely correct. “The righteousness of Christ stands on our side: for God’s righteousness is, in Jesus Christ, ours.” Luther):<br><br> 17]<b> And the world is passing away, and the lust of it</b> (<b>of it</b> is subjective again; not objective, “<i>the lust after it</i>,” but as in ver. 16:<b> the lust thereof</b> summing up in one the three which are there mentioned.<b> is passing away</b>, as in ver. 8: not declaring merely an attribute, that it is the quality of the world and its lust to pass away,—but a matter of fact, that it is even now in act so to pass. See on 1 Cor. vii. 31. It is no objection to this, that the<b> abideth</b>, which is opposed to this “<i>is passing away</i>,” contains, not a matter of fact, but a qualitative predication. This is made necessary by the words “<i>for ever</i>” which that clause contains):<b> but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever</b> (in this latter member of the contrast, we have a clearly personal agent introduced: and therefore, as above remarked, we may expect that the former member also will have a like personal reference. But this expectation must not be pushed<i> too far</i>: seeing that in the<i> world</i>, the ungodly men, who are in all their desires and thoughts<i> of the world</i>, are included. They and their lusts belong to, are part of, depend on, a world which is passing away. On the other hand, eternal fixity and duration belongs only to that order of things, and to those men, who are in entire accordance with the will of God. And among these is<i> he that doeth that will</i>, which is [see vv. 3–6] the true proof and following out of love towards Him. As God Himself is eternal, so is all that is in communion with Him: and this are they who believe in Him and love Him, and do His will),<b> 18–28.]</b> WARNING AGAINST ANTICHRISTS AND FALSE TEACHERS (vv. 18–23): AND EXHORTATION TO ABIDE IN 23–28). The place which this portion holds will be best seen by: shortly recapitulating. “God is light, and in Him is no darkness;” that [ch. i. 5] is the ground-tone of this whole division of the Epistle. In ch. i. 5—ii. 11, the Apostle shews wherein the believer’s walking in light consists. At ver. 12, his style takes at once a hortatory turn. In his addresses to the various classes of his readers, the tone of warning is slightly struck by “<i>ye have overcome the wicked one:</i>” if indeed the whole form of assertion of an ideal state in each case do not of itself carry a delicate shade of warning. Hence the transition is easy to actual warning. And this in vv. 15–17 begins by general dehortation from the love of the world as excluding the love of God, and now proceeds by caution against those in the world who would rob them of Him by whom alone walking in the light of God is made both possible and actual to us. The note of transition from the last verses is “<i>it is the last time</i>,” here taking up the term “<i>is passing away</i>.” The world is passing away: and those temptations and conflicts of which ye have heard as belonging to its last period, are now upon you: those adversaries who would endanger your abiding in Him and being found in Him at His coming.
