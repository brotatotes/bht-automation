<b> 15.] Love not the world</b> (what is<b> the world</b>, in the diction of St. John? And what does he import by<b> loving the world?</b> When we read John iii. 16, “<i>God so</i><b> loved the world</b>,”&c. are we to understand the same thing by the words as here? and if not, are<i> both</i> [viz.<i> the world</i> and love] taken in a different sense, or if one only,<i> which</i>? It would seem that the<i> world</i> in both cases is the same, the<i> love</i> is different. In John iii. 16 it is the love of divine compassion and creative and redeeming mercy: here, it is the love of selfish desire, cherishing avarice or pride. But then recurs our question, What is<i> the world?</i> And it is no easy one to answer. If 1) we reply so as to make it<i> personal</i>, we are met at once by the difficulty of<i> “the things in the world:</i>” from which we cannot escape by saying that these are as below, “<i>the lust, &c.</i>” for none can be said to<i> love</i> the lust, but the<i> lust is</i> the<i> love</i>. Hence some have been led to take these three,<i> the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the vain-glory of life</i>, as put for the things desired, and the material of the<i> vain glory</i>. But this manifestly will not hold, owing to the opposition in ver. 17 between “<i>the world and the lust thereof</i>” on the one hand, and “<i>he that doeth the will of God</i>” on the other, which evidently requires that its first member should be personal as well as its second. And this last will be a weighty reason also against 2) taking<i> the world</i> as merely<i> material</i>, the present order of things, in so far as it is alien from God. We are thus brought to a point, for our understanding of the term, intermediate between personal and material. But then our question is, which of the two is to take the first place? Is<i> the world</i> the world of matter, including the men who dwell in it, or is it the world of man, including matter as subordinate to man? If the former, we seem in danger of falling into a dualism, in which God and the world of matter should be set over against one another as independent existences: for thus the evil one, the<i> ruler of the world</i>, and his spiritual agents would themselves be included in the<i> world</i>, and adjuncts to the world of matter: a mode of thought which nowhere appears in the apostolic writings. We are thus narrowed to our other alternative, that of understanding<i> the world</i> as of human persons, including the inferior ranks of created being, and the mass of inanimate matter which they inhabit. Let us see whether this view will meet the necessities of our text and of similar passages. Thus understood, the<i> world</i> was constituted at first in Adam, well-pleasing to God and obedient to Him: it was man’s world, and in man it is summed up: and in man it fell from God’s light into the darkness of selfish pursuits and<i> worldly lusts</i>, in and by which man, who should be rising through his cosmic corporeal nature to God, has become materialized in spirit and dragged down so as to be worldly and sensual, and like him who has led him astray, and who now, having thus subjected man’s nature by temptation, has become the<i> ruler of the world</i>. And thus the<i> world</i> is “<i>man and man’s world,</i>” in his and its fall from God. It was this world which God loved, in its enmity to Him, with the holy love of Redemption: it is this world which we are not to love, in its alienation from Him, with the selfish love of participation. And this<i> world</i> is spoken of sometimes as personal, sometimes as material, according to the context in which it occurs. To give but a few decisive examples: of the purely personal sense, John xv. 18, “<i>If the world hateth you</i>, &c.,” followed by “<i>If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you also</i>,” where the singular is broken up into the individual persons: of the purely material, John xi. 9, “<i>If any one walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he beholdeth the light of this world.</i>” And in passages like the present, these two senses alternate with and interpenetrate one another: e.g. in the term “<i>the things in the world</i>,” the<i> world</i> is apparently material and local: in the opposition which follows, between the love of the world and the love of the Father, the personal meaning begins to be evident: in what follows, “<i>all that is in the world</i>,” which at first sight seems material, is explained by “<i>the lust of the flesh</i>, &c.” which are the subjective desires of the “<i>things in the world</i>,” not the things themselves: then, finally, in ver. 17, where “<i>the world and the lust thereof</i>,” is opposed to “<i>he that doeth the will of God</i>,” it is plain that we have passed, hy the transition in the last verse, from the material to the personal sense altogether. This account may serve to explain that which has given so much trouble to Commentators here, the question whether<i> lust</i> is not put for the thing itself which is desired: the fact being that, the<i> world</i> including the material world<i> in</i> the men, the<i> lusts</i>, which are in the men, are in the<i> world</i>, as well as the things of which they are the desires, and which are in their turn included in them),<b> nor yet</b> (not merely meaning “<i>nor;</i>” but carrying with it an exclusive and disjunctive force, implying that what follows is not identical with what went before. That was spoken of the world itself, the totality: “have no love for this present world as such.” Butan escape from this prohibition might be sought by men who would deny in the abstract the charge of worldly-mindedness, but devoted themselves to some one object of those followed by worldly men: so that it is necessary to add, after “Love not the world,”— “no, nor any thing in it”)<b> the things in the world</b> (explained above: here, the objects after which the ungodly world’s<i> lust</i> reaches out, and on which its<i> vain-glory</i> is founded).<b> If any man</b> (see on the same expression above, ver. 1)<b> love the world, the love of the Father</b> (i. e. love<i> to</i> the Father, as opposed to his love to the world)<b> is not in him.</b>
