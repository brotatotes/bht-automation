<b> 16.]</b><i> Gives a reason for the assertion in ver.</i> 15: viz. the entire separation from one another of the world and God. In order to understand clearly the following, it is necessary to define strictly the things mentioned, and to lay down explicitly the apposition between “<i>all that is in the world</i>,” and the three particulars which follow as included in that category. This can only be rightly done by bearing in mind what was said before,—that, as the world is summed up in man, both those objective material things which are properly<i> the things in the world,</i> and those inward subjectivities which are in man and grounded on his worldly state, are regarded as being<b> in the world</b>, and these pass into, and are almost interchanged with, one another. Now here, the three things spoken of as examples of<i> the things in the world</i> are all purely subjective— “<i>lust</i>,”— “<i>lust</i>,”— “<i>vain-glory</i>.” But they are subjectivities having their ground in the objectivities of the ungodly world: the first<i> lust</i> springs out of (see below) the<i> flesh</i>, the human nature unrenewed by God: the second resides in that sense which takes note of outward things and so is inflamed by them: and the “<i>life</i>,” is that belonging to<i> vain-glory</i>, the manner of life of worldly men among one another, whereby pride as to display and pomp is cherished. Now each one of these three is included in, and includes in itself, love to the world: and he that loves the world falls into, walks after, becomes part of, these lusts, and this<i> vain-glory</i>, which is not of the Father but of the world. Loving the things of the world, he becomes<i> conformed</i> to the world, and following the lusts and pride which are in the world, he himself becomes one of the things in the world.<b> Because every thing that is in the world</b> (namely, or for instance),<b> the lust of the flesh</b> (<b>of the flesh</b> is not an objective gen., so that the words should mean, “lust after the flesh,” i. e, impure desire: this they include, but far more. The genitive is subjective, the flesh being that wherein the lust dwells, as in Gal. v. 16, Eph. ii. 3, 2 Pet. ii. 18, Rom. i. 24: see also Rom. vi. 12; 1 Pet. iv. 2),<b> and the lust of the eyes</b> (subjective genitive, as before: the lust which the eye begets by seeing),<b> and the vain-glory of life</b> (the<i> vain-glorious</i> is one who lays claim to credit or glory which is not his own: see notes on Rom. i. 30 [where the rendering is, “<i>boasters</i>”] and James iv. 16.<b> life</b>, i. e, men’s way or course of life. This life comprehends in it the means of living, and fashion of living,—table, furniture, equipage, income, rank; and the vain-glory arising out of these is that vain-glorious pride, which is so common
