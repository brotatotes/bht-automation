 17]<b> And the world is passing away, and the lust of it</b> (<b>of it</b> is subjective again; not objective, “<i>the lust after it</i>,” but as in ver. 16:<b> the lust thereof</b> summing up in one the three which are there mentioned.<b> is passing away</b>, as in ver. 8: not declaring merely an attribute, that it is the quality of the world and its lust to pass away,—but a matter of fact, that it is even now in act so to pass. See on 1 Cor. vii. 31. It is no objection to this, that the<b> abideth</b>, which is opposed to this “<i>is passing away</i>,” contains, not a matter of fact, but a qualitative predication. This is made necessary by the words “<i>for ever</i>” which that clause contains):<b> but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever</b> (in this latter member of the contrast, we have a clearly personal agent introduced: and therefore, as above remarked, we may expect that the former member also will have a like personal reference. But this expectation must not be pushed<i> too far</i>: seeing that in the<i> world</i>, the ungodly men, who are in all their desires and thoughts<i> of the world</i>, are included. They and their lusts belong to, are part of, depend on, a world which is passing away. On the other hand, eternal fixity and duration belongs only to that order of things, and to those men, who are in entire accordance with the will of God. And among these is<i> he that doeth that will</i>, which is [see vv. 3–6] the true proof and following out of love towards Him. As God Himself is eternal, so is all that is in communion with Him: and this are they who believe in Him and love Him, and do His will),<b> 18–28.]</b> WARNING AGAINST ANTICHRISTS AND FALSE TEACHERS (vv. 18–23): AND EXHORTATION TO ABIDE IN 23–28). The place which this portion holds will be best seen by: shortly recapitulating. “God is light, and in Him is no darkness;” that [ch. i. 5] is the ground-tone of this whole division of the Epistle. In ch. i. 5—ii. 11, the Apostle shews wherein the believer’s walking in light consists. At ver. 12, his style takes at once a hortatory turn. In his addresses to the various classes of his readers, the tone of warning is slightly struck by “<i>ye have overcome the wicked one:</i>” if indeed the whole form of assertion of an ideal state in each case do not of itself carry a delicate shade of warning. Hence the transition is easy to actual warning. And this in vv. 15–17 begins by general dehortation from the love of the world as excluding the love of God, and now proceeds by caution against those in the world who would rob them of Him by whom alone walking in the light of God is made both possible and actual to us. The note of transition from the last verses is “<i>it is the last time</i>,” here taking up the term “<i>is passing away</i>.” The world is passing away: and those temptations and conflicts of which ye have heard as belonging to its last period, are now upon you: those adversaries who would endanger your abiding in Him and being found in Him at His coming.
