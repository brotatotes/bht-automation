<b> 18.]</b><b> Children</b> (as before, addressed not to any one class, but to all the readers)<b>, it is the last time</b> (what is exactly the Apostle’s meaning by these words? Clearly,<i> in some sense or other</i>, that it is the last period of the world. For we must at once repudiate such views as that of Bengel, who, strange to say, seems to understand it as “<i>the last part of John’s own life-time</i>,” and that of Steinhofer, who explains it to be John’s own time as the<i> close of the apostolic age:</i> and even more decidedly that of Œcumenius, that the<i> last</i> is to be interpreted the<i> worst</i>, as when we say,<i> the last degree of misery</i>, for all other reasons, and on account of the saying 2 Tim. iii, 1, “<i>In</i><b> the last days</b><i> there shalt come</i><b> grievous</b><i> times</i>.”<br><br> These then being cleared away, we come to the view of Grotius and others; that, when spoken of to Jews,<i> the last time</i> is that close upon the destruction of the Jewish polity; proceeding to interpret the<i> antichrists</i> to be the many false Christs who arose in that period, and<i> Antichrist</i><i> himself</i> to be the chief of them, Barchochebas. But two sufficient replies may be given to this view. First, that thus these false Messiahs of the Jews must have gone forth<b> from us</b>, i.e. from the Christian Church, which they did not. Secondly, what would the approximation of the destruction of Jerusalem, viewed merely as a Jewish event [which it must be, on the hypothesis here, as the word<b> last</b> would only be true as addressed to Jews], have to do with the subject of our Epistle?<br><br> And thus we have arrived at the views of those who recognize here the last age of the world, but are anxious to get rid of the idea that the Apostle, in thus speak-ing, regarded the coming of the Lord as near at hand, and endeavour to give some meaning to the expression which shall preclude this [to them] objectionable notion. Among these may be mentioned Calvin, and many of the elder Commentators, who understand the<i> latter dispensation:</i> the time from Christ’s advent in the flesh to His coming to judgment. But, apart, from considerations of the unfitness of such an idea in the context, in which the term “<i>passing away</i>,” vv. 8, 17,—and our ver. 28, shew that it is the coming of the Lord which is before the mind of the Apostle,—this objection is fatal to it: that manifestly not this whole period itself, but some time within its limits is meant, from the nature of the sign given below,<i> whence we know</i>, &c. If the whole Christian dispensation were intended by<i> the last time</i>, it would not be stated as a sign of its presence, that already there were many antichrists, but rather that already He was come who is to be the final revelation of the Father. The circumstance of there being already many antichrists, corresponds with a prophecy delivered by our Lord, not of the general character of the whole of the last dispensation, but of the particular character of the time preceding<i> the end</i>, to which prophecy and to which time the Apostle here beyond question alludes.<br><br> I believe that if we are to deal ingenuously both with words and with facts, we must understand the Apostle to be speaking, as any one in any subsequent age of the Church might have spoken, and as we may speak now, of his time as being the last time, seeing that the signs of the last time were rife in it. How long it may please God to prolong this<i> last time</i>, how long to permit the signs to continue which demonstrate each age of the church to have this character, is a question to which it was not given to him, and is not given to us, to reply. To him indeed many prophetic visions were given, and have been recorded for us; but what is their plain and unmistakable import, will only then be known, when it becomes necessary for the churches to see clearly the signs of His coming):<b> and even as ye heard</b> (in our preaching when ye received the Gospel)<b> that antichrist cometh</b> (the present tense of ordained fixity: “<i>is to come</i>.” But who, and what, is<i> Antichrist?</i> As far as the meaning of the word is concerned, it may mean, either 1) one who stands<i> against</i> Christ, or 2) one who stands<i> instead of</i> Christ. The latter meaning is strenuously maintained here by Grotius, who holds that our Antichrist here has nothing to do with the<i> adversary</i> (<i>anti-keimenos</i>) of St. Paul, 2 Thess. ii. 3: that being one who<i> professes himself an enemy to God</i>, whereas this is one who<i> makes himself Christ:</i> understanding this and what follows [see above] of the<i> false Christs</i> prophesied of by our Lord, Matt. xxiv. 5, 24. This he defends by analogy of words similarly compounded with anti-, which furnishes many examples of this sense of<i> substitution</i> for another. But, seeing that the other meaning,<i> the adversary of Christ</i>, is also upheld by abundant precedents of the same kind,—it is clear that we cannot solve the doubt by philology alone, but must take into account other considerations. And first among these comes the fact, that St. John, who was acquainted with the form<i> pseudo-christ</i>, using as he does<i> pseudo-prophet</i>, ch. iv. 1, never uses it, but always,—ch. iv. 3, 2 John 7,—this word<i> Antichrist</i>. Is it not hence probable that he intended to signify, not a<i> false</i> Christ, but an<i> anti-</i>christ? Next, we may fairly allege the ancient interpretations, as shewing how Greeks themselves understood the word. In these we do not find a vestige of the meaning “<i>a substitute for Christ</i>” being attached to the term, but every where they interpret<i> Antichrist</i> by<i> an enemy to Christ</i>.<br><br> Taking then<i> Antichrist</i> for Christ’s adversary, I would refer to the disquisition and summary of opinions in the Introduction on 2 Thess. ii. 1 ff., where the reasons which have induced me to expect a personal Antichrist are given in full: as are also the indications furnished by prophecy, and by the history of the church and the world, as to his probable character and work),<b> even now there have</b><b> arisen many antichrists</b> (what are we to understand the Apostle as saying? Is this fact alleged as a presumption that the Antichrist is<i> near</i>, these<i> many antichrists</i> prefiguring and heralding him,—or as a proof that he is<i> come</i>, being in fact the aggregate of these? The question is an important one, as affecting that of a personal or collective antichrist. And the first thing to be noticed in answering it is, that these<i> many antichrists</i> are explained by the Apostle himself, ver. 22, f., to be deniers of the Father and the Son: i.e. of the Son: and even more explicitly, ch. iv. 3, deniers that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. Here, however, this latter point is not yet brought out: here it is as<i> liars</i> that we hear of them: as<i> deniers</i> of the truth, which Truth is Jesus Christ, the Son of God: as not having the Spirit which is truth and no lie, ver. 27. They are said to have gone forth from the Christian church, but not to have been<i> of us</i>, as their spirit<i> is not of God</i>, ch. iv. 3. They are<i> antichrists;</i> their spirit is<i> the spirit of antichrist</i>, ch. iv. 3, of which the readers had heard that it should come, and it was in the world already. From much of this it might at first sight appear as if these<i> antichrists</i> in their aggregate formed<b> the Antichrist</b>. But a nearer inspection will convince us that this cannot be so. [<i>The</i>]<i> Christ</i> and [<i>the</i>]<i> Antichrist</i> stand over against one another, and analogy requires that if the one be personal, the other should be also. And in ch. iv. 3 we ‘are not told that merely the spirit is of<i> Antichrist</i>, but [in the original] that it is of<b> the Antichrist</b>, the personal reference being still kept. Again, we have “<i>cometh</i>,” the present future of prophetic fixity, in both places, here and in ch. iv. 3, set against “<i>there have arisen</i>” and “<i>it is:</i>” and the verb itself, in its prophetic sense, one regularly used of Christ, as here of antichrist. So that our only refuge in order to consistent interpretation here, is to regard these<i> many Antichrists</i>, clothed with the attributes and having the spirit of<i> the Antichrist</i>, as being his forerunners in the sense of 2 Thess. ii, 7, “<i>for the mystery of iniquity already worketh:</i>” meaning, as I have explained at length in the summary referred to above, that the antichristian principle was then, as it is now, and will be in every age, working, realizing, and concentrating itself from time to time, in evil men and evil books and evil days, but awaiting its final development and consummation in [<i>the</i>]<i> Antichrists</i>, who shall personally appear before the coming of the Lord. In St. John’s time, these<i> many Antichrists</i> were to be seen in the early heretical teachers whose false and corrupting doctrine and practice was beginning to trouble the church):<b> from whence we know that it is the last time</b> (these words are a formal statement of the connexion between the first, and second members of the foregoing sentence, which without them it would be left, for the reader to supply in his mind).
