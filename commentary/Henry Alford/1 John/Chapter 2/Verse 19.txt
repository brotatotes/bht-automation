<b> 19.]</b> These Antichrists are designated as having been formerly attached to the Christian church, but never really members of it. They had not that communion with the Father and the Son in which the communion of Christians with one another really consists, inasmuch as they deny the Father and the Son.<b> They went out from among us, but they were not of us</b> (did not really belong to us, as neither had they their origin among us);<b> for if they had been of us they would have remained with us</b> (the A.V. inserts “<i>no doubt</i>,” as representing an erroneous rendering of the Vulgate Latin, which bas here misled our translators. See in my Greek Test. The sense is, if they had ats belonged to our number, had been true servants of Christ, they would have endured, and would not have become<i> antichrists</i>: their very becoming so proves the unreality of their Christian profession. This point is now brought out in what follows):<b> but</b> (the ellipsis [see marginal note: not expressed in the original] is variously supplied: by “<i>they went out</i>,” as in text, from above: by “<i>this was done</i>,” or “<i>God doeth this</i>.” All these in fact come to the same, provided that we keep the simple sense of the<i> purpose</i> implied, which must necessitate a<i> doer</i>; and that doer, God, So that it will be better, as the divine purpose must be understood in the depth of the meaning, whatever be supplied, to take the simplest supplement, viz. “<i>they went out</i>,” which is already the expressed verb of the sentence),<b> in order that they may be made manifest, that all are not of us</b> (the meaning is, that by their example it may be made manifest that all [who are among us] are not of us. The rendering of the A. V, “that they were not all of us,” leaves open the inevitable conclusion that<i> some of them are of us</i>. The Apostle makes their<i> manifestation</i> the proof not that<i> they</i> were not of us, but that<i> all</i> are not of us, viz. all who are commonly found among us.
