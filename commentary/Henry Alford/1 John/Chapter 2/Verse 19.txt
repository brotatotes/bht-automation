<b> 19.]</b> These Antichrists are designated as having been formerly attached to the Christian church, but never really members of it. They had not that communion with the Father and the Son in which the communion of Christians with one another really consists, inasmuch as they deny the Father and the Son.<b> They went out from among us, but they were not of us</b> (did not really belong to us, as neither had they their origin among us);<b> for if they had been of us they would have remained with us</b> (the A.V. inserts “<i>no doubt</i>,” as representing an erroneous rendering of the Vulgate Latin, which bas here misled our translators. See in my Greek Test. The sense is, if they had ats belonged to our number, had been true servants of Christ, they would have endured, and would not have become<i> antichrists</i>: their very becoming so proves the unreality of their Christian profession. This point is now brought out in what follows):<b> but</b> (the ellipsis [see marginal note: not expressed in the original] is variously supplied: by “<i>they went out</i>,” as in text, from above: by “<i>this was done</i>,” or “<i>God doeth this</i>.” All these in fact come to the same, provided that we keep the simple sense of the<i> purpose</i> implied, which must necessitate a<i> doer</i>; and that doer, God, So that it will be better, as the divine purpose must be understood in the depth of the meaning, whatever be supplied, to take the simplest supplement, viz. “<i>they went out</i>,” which is already the expressed verb of the sentence),<b> in order that they may be made manifest, that all are not of us</b> (the meaning is, that by their example it may be made manifest that all [who are among us] are not of us. The rendering of the A. V, “that they were not all of us,” leaves open the inevitable conclusion that<i> some of them are of us</i>. The Apostle makes their<i> manifestation</i> the proof not that<i> they</i> were not of us, but that<i> all</i> are not of us, viz. all who are commonly found among us.<br><br> It is not my intention to go into the question as to the dogmatic consequences which have been deduced from this verse. The Apostle is probably speaking here not dogmatically, but ethically. If there is a necessity in the inference,<b> they would have remained</b>, it is a “voluntary necessity. We must take these words, ver. 19, in intimate connexion with the enunciation of this whole portion of the Epistle, ch. i. 5–7. The object of this portion is, ch. i. 3, that ye may have fellowship with us, in that we have fellowship with the Father and the Son. This aim penetrates all the exhortation, ii. 19–28. This fellowship depends on the walking in light, i.e. on knowledge of the truth as regards ourselves and God, and love to God and the brethren. He who departs from the truth, he who loves not God and the brethren, belongs not to this fellowship, and shews that he belongs not to it. If he had belonged to it, he would have held fast his walk in the light, as shewn by these indications. This is the human side, on which our passage regards the act and fact. There is also a divine side. They who attain eternal life are given by the Father to the Son, and no man can come to the Son except the Father draw him [John vi. 37, 44, 65, xvii. 6], and such are kept by God [ib. xvii. 11]; but also we read that they believe on on the Son, receive the word of the Son, and keep themselves [John vi. 40 xvii. 6 f., i. 12, James i. 27]. And so again on the other side, they who remain at last excluded from eternal life, are thus excluded not only by God’s decree but by their own evil choice and will. The words cited above, John vi. 65, were spoken by our Lord with direct reference to the traitor Judas: but on the other hand St. John gives notices of the ethical development of Judas, which leave no doubt that his depravity went hand in hand with God’s judgment on him. Judas was covetous: his heart was inclined to mammon: hence he understood not the love of Mary when she anointed Jesus with her precious ointment: he grudged his Lord this token of love: he could not abide with Christ, because he shut his heart through greed, through love of the world, against the love of Christ: for the knowledge of the Lord, faith in Him, fellowship with Him, are all summed up in Love. Thus we see that in the rejection, as in the acceptance of eternal life, the two factors, God’s will and man’s will, are to be regarded in their ethical connexion only. In order to that knowledge of God, which is eternal life, man must be<i> taught</i> of God [John vi. 45]: but man must also<i> learn</i> of God. And the more St. John sets forth the essential nature of this knowledge of God and Jesus Christ as<i> ethical</i>, the more does he recognize, in putting forward God’s will in the matter, man’s will also. Christ is the Saviour of the whole world, ch. ii. 2, iv. 14. But in the personal appropriation of this universal salvation, not all really take it to themselves,—and many, who have taken it, fall away again, because they do not keep the grace given, do not abide in Christ, do not walk in the light. This last is by no means denied by St. John when he says, “If they had been of us, they would have remained with us.” The words set forth an ideal similar to that in ch. ii, 5, iii. 9, v. 18. As in no one of those places can the Apostle possibly mean, that a true believer, one really born of God, has perfect love to God and cannot sin [for what then would ch. ii. 1 mean?],—so neither here can he mean that whoever once inwardly and truly belongs to the communion of believers cannot by any possibility fall from it).
