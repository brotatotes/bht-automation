<b> 21.] I did not write to you</b> (it may refer either to what has immediately preceded, or to the whole Epistle: here probably to the immediately preceding)<b> because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and because no lie is of the truth</b> (i. e. coupling the fact of your knowledge of the truth with the fact that no lie is of the truth, I wrote to supply the link between these two, to point out to you the lie and the liar, that you might at once act on that your knowledge of the truth, and not listen to them that deceive you).
