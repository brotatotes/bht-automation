<b> 22.]</b><b> Who is the liar</b> (the question passes from the abstract,<i> the lie</i>, to the concrete,<i> the liar</i>, the utterer of the lie. Who is he that is guilty of the lie? The Apostle proceeds to identify this utterer of the<i> lie</i> of which he has just spoken. We have a similar question in ch. v. 4, 5: where after describing the victory that overcometh the world, he rejoins,<i> Who is he that conquereth the world,</i>&c., as here. Some have neglected the article altogether; so the A.V.; others have given it merely the force of pointing out a liar remarkable above others. But there ean be little doubt that it refers, as above, to the preceding<i> lie</i>),<b> but</b> (literally, “if not”)<b> he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ (</b>literally, “<i>denieth</i> [to the effect]<i> that Jesus is not the Christ</i>”)<b>? This</b> (the<i> liar</i> just described)<b> is the antichrist</b> (on the personal interpretation, see above, ver. 18.<b> the antichrist</b> is obviously here used not as predicating the one person in whom the character shall be finally and centrally realized, but as setting forth identity of character with him, and participation in the same development of the antichristian principle. Something of the kind must be understood, whichever way antichrist be taken, collective or personal),<b> who denieth</b><b> the Father and the Son</b> (it is implied then, that the denying Jesus to be the Christ, is equivalent to denying the Pather and the Son. And this the Apostle carefully asserts in the next verse).
