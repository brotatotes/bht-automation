<b> 24.] Ye</b> (so literally, the<b> ye</b> standing alone, serving to mark more distinctly the change of person: see below also, on ver. 27),—<b>let that which ye heard from the beginning, abide in you</b> (the truth respecting the Father and the Son once heard is regarded as a seed, dropt in and abiding in the man.<b> from the beginning,</b> necessarily bound here to the subjects of<i> the hearing</i>, just as it is necessarily bound in ch. i. 1, to the subject of “<i>was</i>,” means, “from the time when ye began to be instructed in the first rudiments of the Gospel”).<b> If that which ye heard from the beginning abide</b> ( “shall have abode”)<b> in you, ye also</b> (on your part. If it abide in you, ye too shall abide...)<b> shall abide in the Son and in the Father</b> (here again the rationalizing Commentators have endeavoured to explain away the close personal relation and immanence in God expressed by the Apostle’s words. But here as every where else, they entirely miss the sense. He in whom abides the message of life in Christ which he has heard, not only has received the tidings of that life, but is transformed into the likeness of Him whose seed he has taken into him: is become a new creation: and the element in which and by which he lives and acts is even He in whom and by whom this new life comes, even Christ the Son of God. And thus living in the Son, he lives in the Father also: for Christ the Son of God is the manifestation and effulgence of the Father, himself abiding ever in the Father, as His people abide in Him. See the same truth declared, John vi. 56; xv. 1 ff.: xvii. 23 [Eph. iii. 17; 1 Cor. iii. 16; vi. 17]).
