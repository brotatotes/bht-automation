<b> 27.]</b><b> And you</b> (the same sudden prominence given to the persons addressed as in ver. 24: again setting his believing readers in marked contrast to the deceivers just mentioned),—<b>the anointing which ye received from Him</b> (Christ, ver. 25: see above, ver. 20: as also on<i> the anointing</i>)<b> abideth in you</b> ( “this indicative,” says Bengel, “has a subtle force of exhortation, as in 2 Tim. iii. 14”),<b> and</b> (i. e. and therefore)<b> ye have no need that any one teach you</b> (the Apostle’s assertions here are so many delicate exhortations, veiled under the declaration of their true ideal state of unction with the Holy Spirit who guides into all truth. If that unction were abiding in them in all its fulness, they would have no need for his or any other teaching. And in what is said, he does not indeed say that it is not abiding in them; but the contrary, thus reminding them what their real state is)<b> but</b> (contrast to the<i> having no need</i>, &c.)<b> as his anointing teacheth you concerning all things</b> (this<i> teaching concerning all things</i> is parallel to<i> leading into all the truth</i>, Jon xvi. 13. On the different ways of taking the following words, which can hardly be set before the English reader, see my Greek Test.),—<b>and is true, and is not a lie</b> (<i>what</i> is true, and not a lie? the anointing itself, or that which it teaches about all things? Necessarily, I believe, from the construction, the former. And this is quite correspondent to the fact that the Spirit who is this anointing, is the Spirit of Truth [John xiv. 17], and therefore leads into all truth [ib. xvi. 13]. As Düsterdiock remarks, “The<i> anointing</i> which abides in and teaches believers is essentially true, is not a lie, and hence nothing can come from it which is a lie”),—<b>and even as He</b> (or,<i> it?</i> so A.V. and others: but the change to the past tense seems necessarily to refer to Christ as the subject,—the<i> Holy One</i> from whom the<i> anointing</i> came, and who is ever in the Writer’s mind, a subject ever ready to he supplied)<b> taught you, abide in Him</b> (or, “in<i> it?</i>” or, in that which it teaches? Neither of these: for the “<i>abide in Him</i>” is immediately after repeated, and the reference of “<i>Him</i>” fixed, by what follows, to be to Christ).
