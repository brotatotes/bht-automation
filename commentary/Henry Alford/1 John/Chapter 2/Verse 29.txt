<b> 29.]</b><b> If ye know</b> (appeal to their recognition of the divine character as that which he describes it)<b> that He is righteous</b> (of whom is this said? If of Christ, as seems most natural, after “<i>in Him</i>” and “<i>from Him</i>” preceding, we find a difficulty in the words “<i>is born of Him</i>” below, seeing that, we are never said to be born anew of<i> Christ</i>, but always of God [through Christ], ch. iii. 1, 9; iv. 7; v. 1, 4, 18, &c. If on the other hand they are said of God, “it seems strange that after a change of reference from the preceding “<i>Him</i>,” another subject should be expressed in ch, iii. 1 by the words “<i>the Father</i>.” In consequence of these difficulties, some have referred<b> he is righteous</b> to Christ, and<i> of</i><b> Him</b> to God; which cannot well be. It would be possible, doubtless, to understand the whole of Christ, without change of subject from ver. 28; and to leave the words<b> is born of Him</b> as we find them. If it occurs nowhere else in reference to Christ, there is in it nothing abhorrent from our Christian ideas. And in St. John’s sense of the intimate union between the Father and Son, he who is born of the Father might be said to be born of the Son also. But after all, the other view, which is that of most ancient expositors, must, I apprehend, be adopted. The analogy of the passage, as shewn in ch, iii. 1, 2, 9, 10, fixes the words<b> is born of Him</b> to birth from God: and the absence in the original of a new expressed subject in the words<i> is</i><i> righteous</i> must be accounted for by remembering that this verse, as ch, i. 5, is the opening, and general statement, of a new section of the Epistle. And the essential unity of the Father and the Son comes in on this side also: so that the judgment alluded to ver. 28, which shall be executed by the Son, being judgment committed to Him by the Father, brings to mind the justice and righteousness in which that judgment is founded):<b> ye know that also every one who doeth righteousness</b> (literally,<b> the righteousness</b>, i.e. the righteousness which is implied in the word “<i>righteous</i>” above: if it were not too strong, we might almost say, “that righteousness:” the article showing that there is no other.<b> doeth</b>, for all righteousness is energetic: it springs out of holiness, truth, love),<b> is born</b> (hath been begotten)<b> of Him</b> (God: see above:<i> for the righteous begetteth righteous progeny.</i> The inference here must be carefully kept to the Apostle’s words and obvious sense. And those require that we should understand it thus: God is<i> righteous</i>. This is our axiom, from which we set out, And if so, then the<i> source of</i> righteousness. When therefore a man doeth righteousness,<i> we know</i>, we apprehend, we collect, from our previous knowledge of these truths, that the source of his righteousness is God: that in consequence he has acquired by new birth from God, that righteousness which he had not by nature. We argue from his<i> doing righteousness</i> to his<i> having been begotten of God</i>. And the right apprehension of this is the more important because the whole mass of Socinian and Pelagian Commentators have reversed the members of the argument, and made it conclude that<i> doing</i><i> righteousness</i> is the condition, on our part, of<i> becoming</i> a child of God. And the Roman-Catholic expositors, while they avoid this error, yet go equally wrong, in understanding “<i>hath been begotten</i>” not as the statement of a past and abiding fact, but as the ground of a confidence as to the future).
