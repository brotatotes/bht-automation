<b> 6.]</b> The state of being in Him is carried forward a step further by the expression “abide in Him:” and the way is prepared, by what follows, for the coming exhortation vv. 7–11, to walk in love.<b> The man saying that he abideth in Him</b> (God, as above)<b> ought</b> (see reff. The obligation is grounded on the profession, being one of consistency with it: not on the<i> abiding</i>, which would imply that which follows, as matter of necessity)<b>, even as He</b> (Christ)<b> walked</b> (during His life upon earth: see below),<b> himself also thus to walk</b> (not any one particular of Christ’s walk upon earth is here pointed at, but the whole of His life of holiness and purity and love. This latter, as including all the rest, is most in the Apostle’s mind. So in Eph. v. 1, 2, where St. Paul exhorts us to be followers of God, he adds, “<i>and walk in love, even as Christ also loved us</i>.” Luther simply but appositely remarks, that it is not Christ’s walking on the sea, but His ordinary walk, that we are called on here to imitate).<br><br> That the<i> commandment</i> as such refers to the Iaw of love, thus indeed connected with Christ’s example here, but still to the law of love and no other, is plain from the whole usage of the Apostle; compare especially 2 John 4–6, where the very same train of thought occurs as here, the<i> walking in truth</i> being equivalent to<i> walking in light</i> here, being followed up by<i> “even as we received commandment from the Father,</i>” and that commandment being characterized, as here,— “<i>not as though I wrote unto thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning</i>,” and finally being stated to be “<i>that we love one another</i>.” Indeed the whole process of that passage from this point is most instructive as to our present, one: “<i>And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments: this is the commandment even as ye heard from the beginning that ye may walk in it:</i>” where the same complex of the whole Christian walk is included in the one idea of love, and<i> love</i> identified with walking according to His commandments. Again in ch. iii. 11, the same formula is used in speaking of the law of love— “<i>This is the commandment which ye heard from the beginning, that we love one another:</i>” compare also ch. iv. 21, v. 3, iii. 22–24: again ch. iii. 14, iv. 16, John xiii. 35; ch. v. 1, 2, John xv. 10. To recapitulate: on the interpretation here adopted, the<b> commandment</b> is the command to walk as Christ walked, passing, as the context advances, into the law of love. This<b> commandment</b> is no<b> new</b> one,<b> but</b> an<b> old</b> one, seeing that they had it<b> from the beginning</b>, from the beginning of their faith, and it was in fact the sum of the word which they<b> heard</b>).
