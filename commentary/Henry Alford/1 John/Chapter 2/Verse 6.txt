 6 .] The state of being in Him is carried forward a step further by the expression “abide in Him:” (“Synonyma cum gradatione:  Illum nosse: in Illo esse: in Illo manere : cognitio: communio: constantia.” Bengel:) and the way is prepared, by what follows, for the coming exhortation 1 John 2:7-11 , to walk in love.  The man saying that He abideth in Him (God, as above)  ought (see reff. Huther well remarks, that the obligation is grounded on the λέγειν , the profession, being one of consistency with it; not on the μένειν , which would imply that which follows, as matter of necessity),  even as He (Christ: by  ἐκεῖνος (see above) a third person is introduced: not necessarily, see 2Ti 2:26 and note, but apparently by the requirements of this passage, αὐτός having come down all the way from ch. 1Jn 1:5 as referred to God. I say  apparently : because I do not regard it as by any means a settled matter that this αὐτός does not throughout apply to Christ, and then this ἐκεῖνος will merely refer to a different phase of predication respecting the same person as the ἐν αὐτῷ designates, as in the examples produced in the note as above)  walked (during His life upon earth: see below),  himself also thus to walk (not any one particular of Christ’s walk upon earth is here pointed at, but the whole of his life of holiness and purity and love. This latter, as including all the rest, is most in the Apostle’s mind. So in Ephesians 5:1-2 , where St. Paul exhorts us to be followers of God, he adds, καὶ περιπατεῖτε ἐν ἀγάπῃ , καθὼς καὶ ὁ χριστὸς ἠγάπησεν ὑμᾶς . Luther simply but appositely remarks, that it is not Christ’s walking on the sea, but His ordinary walk, that we are called on here to imitate).
