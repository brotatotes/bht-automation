The meaning above given agrees well both with the context and with St. John’s habit of thought, as well as with matter of fact, and our Lord’s own words, John xiii. 34, xv. 12. “When I stand at the point of time indicated by the term ‘<i>from the beginning,’</i> and look forwards on the Christian life of the readers, the<i> commandment</i> appears a one long known; the readers have known it from the beginning as an essential commandment, they have had it as long as they have been Christians: on the other hand, if I look backward on the life of the readers before that<i> beginning</i>, whether they were before that Jews or Gentiles, this same commandment of necessity appears as a new one, essentially Christian, first beginning for the readers with that beginning; for even for the Jewish Christians the command of brotherly love is a new one, seeing that it is ordained<i> in imitation of Christ</i>, John xiii. 34”)<b>, which (</b>thing, viz. the fact that the commandment is a new one: see below)<b> is true in Him and in you: because the darkness is passing away</b> (not, as A.V., “<i>past:</i>” the verb is<i> present</i>),<b> and the true light is now shining</b> i.e. the commandment<i> is a new one</i>, and this is true both in [the case of] Him [Christ] and in [the case of] you: because [in<i> you</i>] the darkness is passing away, and [in<i> Him</i>] the true light is shining: therefore on both accounts the command is a<i> new</i> one: new as regards you, because you are newly come from darkness into light: new as regards Him, because He uttered it when He came into the world to lighten every man, and began that shining which even now continues.
