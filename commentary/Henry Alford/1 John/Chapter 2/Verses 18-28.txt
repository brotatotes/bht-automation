 18 28 .] WARNING AGAINST ANTICHRISTS AND FALSE TEACHERS ( 1Jn 2:18-23 ): AND EXHORTATION TO ABIDE IN CHRIST ( 1Jn 2:24-28 ). The place which this portion holds will be best seen by strictly recapitulating. “God is light, and in Him is no darkness:” that (ch. 1Jn 1:5 ) is the ground-tone of this whole division of the Epistle. In ch. 1Jn 1:5 to 1 John 2:11 , the Apostle shews, wherein the believer’s walking in light consists. At 1 John 2:12 , his style takes at once a hortatory turn. In his addresses to the various classes of his readers, the tone of warning is slightly struck by νενικήκατε τὸν πονηρόν : if indeed the whole form of assertion of an ideal state in each case do not of itself carry a delicate shade of warning. Hence the transition is easy to actual warning. And this in 1Jn 2:15-17 begins by general dehortation from the love of the world as excluding the love of God, and now proceeds by caution against those in the world who would rob them of Him by whom alone walking in the light of God is made both possible and actual to us. The note of transition from the last verses is the παράγεται , here taken up by ἐσχάτη ὥρα ἐστίν . The world is passing away: and those temptations and conflicts of which ye have heard as belonging to its last period, are now upon you: those adversaries who would endanger your abiding in Him and being found in Him at His coming.
