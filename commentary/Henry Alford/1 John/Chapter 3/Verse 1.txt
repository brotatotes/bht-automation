<b> 1.</b>]<b> Behold</b> (as in John i. 29; xix. 5, does not express the Writer’s own astonishment, but directs the attention of those who are addressed. But there immediately follows upon us, the communicative address, so that in fact the Apostle does in a manner include himself among those addressed in<b> behold</b>),<b> what manner of</b> (including “how great,” “how free,” “how precious”—in fact, all the particulars which are afterwards brought out respecting this love: see ver. 16, ch. iv. 9, 16)<b> love</b> (is<b> love</b> here, joined as it is with the verb “<i>hath bestowed</i>,” literally<i> love itself</i>, or does it import some gift, bestowal, or fruit of love? There seems no necessity for diverting the word from its proper meaning. As in ch. iv. 9, the proof of the love is that which is imported, not by the love itself, but by the verb joined with it; as by “<i>was manifested</i>” there, so by “<i>hath bestowed</i>” here)<b> the Father</b> (spoken here not, as some think, of God in general, the whole three Persons in the blessed Trinity, but personally, of the Father, as distinguished from the Son, in whom we have received our adoption)<b> hath given</b> (see above)<b> unto us, that</b> (how is<b> that</b> here to be taken? is it to be kept to its strong sense, indicating that our being called the children of God is the<i> purpose</i> of that gift of love just spoken of, or does it, as so often in St. John, introduce the<i> purport</i> of that love, stated in the form of an end to be gained by its manifestation? Lücke and others keep the strong telic sense. “What great love,” says Lücke, “hath the Father shewn us [viz, in sending His Son, ch. iv. 10], in order to make us children of God!” But the objection to this is, that thus a proof of the divine Love is hinted at in our verse which is not, expanded, but is left to be gathered from elsewhere: and the purpose introduced by<b> that</b> becomes the secondary and remote subject of the sentence, whereas, from the idea of<b> children of God</b> taking up the preceding idea of<i> birth from God</i>, and being again taken up in ver. 2, it is evidently the primary subject. The other meaning is taken by the ancient Greek expositors; “wbat manner of love... resulting in, proved by, our being, &c.” The effect of the love, that at which it is aimed in its immediate bestowal, is, that we should be called children of God: its ultimate purpose is another thing. See vv. 11, 23, where we have the same construction)<b> we</b><b> should be called children of God</b> (why has the Apostle rather used<b> should be called</b> than “<i>should be?</i>” Probably to bring forward the title, the reality of which, notwithstanding its non-recognition by the world, he is about to assert immediately).<b> And WE ARE [so]: for this cause the world</b><b> doth not know</b> (apprehend, recognize) us;<b> because it did not know Him</b> (viz. Christ.—The insertion of the words,<b> and we are so</b>, appears to serve the purpose of bringing out the reality of the state conferred upon us with this title, in spite of any non-recognition of it by the unbelieving world. This clause is of the highest possible significance. On its assertion depends the<b> therefore</b> which follows: and we ARE God’s children: for<i> this very reason</i>, because we bear not the name only but the essence, the world knows us not: and then, as a reason for this ignorance following on this reality of our derivation from Him,—because it knew Him not. The reality of a believer's sonship of God, and his non-recognition by the world, are thus necessarily connected together. But Whom did the world not know, and when?<b> Him</b> here, by the very requirements of the logic of the passage, must be the Father, who not being recognized, neither are His children; Augustine and others understand<i> Christ</i>. But this can only be, if we understand that the world rejected that revelation of the Father which was made by Christ His Son. And if we introduce this element, we disturb the strictness of the argument. It is the world’s ignorance of God, considered as one great act of non-recognition, disobedience, rebellion, hate, which makes them incapable of recognizing, loving, sympathizing with, those who are veritably children of God: compare ch. v. 1).
