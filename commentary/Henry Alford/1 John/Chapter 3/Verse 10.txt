<b> 10.</b>]<i> The continuation of the former argument:</i> with the insertion, in the latter half, of the new particular which is to form the argument of the next section. But this latter half belongs not only to that next section, but to this as well: its assertion<i> “whosoever doeth not righteousness, &c.,”</i> is requisite for the g out fully of the assertion,<i> “In this, &c.”</i> which at the same time looks<br><br> 3812 backward and forward: backward, for the children of God have already been designated by the absence of sin, ver. 9: forward, for the children of the devil are designated below by the presence of sin in the second half of the verse.<b> In this</b> (fact, circumstance:<i> in</i> better than<i> by this</i>, which the idea that this is the<i> only</i> sign)<b> are manifest</b> (it has been asked,<i> to whom?</i> Some say to God’s unerring eye alone. True, in the full and deep truth of the saying: but surely in degree and proportion to those whom the unction from the Holy One enables to know all things: in proportion as sin is manifested, or hatred and avoidance of sin is manifested, in a character. And the especial sign which follows, the sin of hate, is one which is plainly open to men’s eyes, at least in its ordinary manifestations)<b> the children of God and the children of the devil</b> (see these expressions explained and vindicated from the charge of dualism, above, ver. 8. Compare John viii. 44, Acts xiii. 10. Socinus remarks well, “From the Apostle’s words it may clearly enough be collected, that between the sons of God and the sons of the devil there are none intermediate”):<b> every one that doeth not righteousness</b> (see ch. ii. 29)<b> is not of God</b> (is not a child of God),<b> and he that loveth not his brother</b> (see below, these words pointing on to the next section).<br><br> Before entering on ver. 11, the latter half of ver. 10 must be considered, as belonging properly, in its sense, to this section, though in arrangement inseparable from the last. The<i> “and,”</i> which binds on the additional particular in the last clause, serves, as in ver. 5, to co-ordinate that clause with the foregoing: not in this case as excluded from the forementioned category, but as one in particular, taken out from among the general category, and put into a co-ordinate position with it. And it is thus put, as being the most eminent, and most of the nature of a summary, and criterion, of the rest, of any of those graces which are necessarily involved in<i> righteousness</i>. Augustine beautifully says, “Love alone distinguishes between the children of God and the children of the devil. All may sign themselves with the sign of cross of Christ: all may answer Amen: all may sing Halleluia: all may be baptized, may enter churches, may build the walls of the same: but the children of God are not distinguished from the children of the devil, except by Love.” And this love, thus constituted into the great test and touchstone, is necessarily the family love of brother for brother within the limits of those who are begotten of God. Universal love to man is a Christian grace—but it is not that here spoken of: it neither answers the description of the<i> “message”</i> given in ver. 11, nor corresponds to the context here in general, the drift of which is that a test of our belonging to God’s family is our love towards His children, who are our brethren in that family: cf. ch. v. 1 ff. But, while there can be no doubt that this is the right understanding of the brotherly love here insisted on, we incur at once a formal difficulty in applying this meaning to the negative or exclusive side of the test. He who does not love his brother, has in strict fact<i> no brother to love</i>, for he is not a child of God at all. Hence we must understand, strictly speaking,<i> “his brother”</i> in this case as importing his hypothetical brother: him who would be, were he himself a true child of God, a brother, and, if so, necessarily beloved. That this love does not exist in him, demonstrates him not to be of God’s family.
