<b> 12.</b>]<b> Not as Cain was, of the wicked one, and slew his brother</b> (the construction is elliptic: but nothing need be supplied as in A.V. In the words<b> was of the wicked one</b> we have a resumption of the expression<i> “is of the devil”</i> from above, ver. 8: the word<b> wicked</b> being used probably on account of his being<i> of the wicked one</i> following. Observe, “his works were wicked” is the inference from that great proof which he gave of it by killing his brother: as is also the reason given in what follows: see below. So that here the assertion of his being of the wicked one is, aa above, strictly ethical, and in no way physical or dualistic: “Cain was the son not of God but of the devil,<i> not by generation</i>, but by imitation and suggestion.” Cornclius-a-lapide).<b> And for what reason slew he him? because his [own] works were wicked, and those of his brother righteous</b> (it has caused some difficulty, that no mention of this ethical difference is made in the narrative in Genesis. It has been supposed that the Apostle gathers it from God’s differing acceptance of the offerings of the two: others have culled the ethical characters of the two the<i> previous</i> occasion, whereas the immediately exciting cause was the deduction from acknowledged facts, of the murder. But properly considered, the Apostle’s assertion here is only a<i> proximate</i> occasion. Cain murdered his brother: therefore he hated him: and hate belongs to the children of the evil one,—classes him at once among those whose works are evil, and who hate those who, like Abel, are testified to [Heb, xi. 4] that they are of the children of God who work righteousness. Whatever might. be the exciting occasion of the murder, this lay at the root—the hatred which the children of the devil ever bear to the children of God).
