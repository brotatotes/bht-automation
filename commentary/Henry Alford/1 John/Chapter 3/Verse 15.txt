<b> 15.</b>]<b> Every one that hateth his brother is a manslayer</b> (in these words, (1)<i> “he that loveth not,”</i> which preceded, is taken up by<b> every one that hateth</b>: shewing that the two are identical: the living spirit of man being incapable of a state of indifference: that he who has banished brotherly love has in fact abandoned himself to the rule of the opposite state. In the ethical depth of the Apostle’s view, love and hate, like light and darkness, life and death, necessarily succeed, as well as necessarily exclude, one another. He who has not the one of necessity has the other in each case. (2) he who hates his brother is stated to be a<i> manslayer</i>. The example given, ver. 12, shewed the true and normal result of hate: and again in the Apostle’s ethical depth of view, as in our Lord's own [Matt. v. 21 ff, 27 fi.], he who falls under a state, falls under the normal results of that state carried out to its issue. If a hater be not a murderer, the reason does not lie in his hate, but in his<i> lack</i><i> of</i> hate. “Whom we hate, we wish destroyed,” says Calvin. Some would make a<i> manslayer</i> mean, a destroyer of<i> his own</i> soul. But this, as well as the view that it is the murder of his brother’s<i> soul</i> which is intended, by provoking him to anger and discord,—errs by pressing the reference to the example of Cain above. Some again would interpret it by a reference to John viii. 44, understood as pointing to the ruin of Adam by the Tempter. But as Düsterdieck remarks, far rather should we say that this passage throws back a light on that passage, and makes it likely that the case of Cain, and not that of Adam, is<i> there</i> referred to);<b> and ye know that every manslayer hath not</b> (is without the possession of)<b> eternal life abiding in him</b> (<b>ye know</b>, viz. by your own knowledge of what is patent and axiomatic in itself. We must not fall into the error of referring the saying to the<i> future lot</i> of the murderer: it regards his present state, and is another way of saying that he<i> “abideth in death,”</i> ver. 14. Eternal life, which abides in God’s children, which is the living growth of the seed of God in them, is evidenced by love: if the very crown and issue of hate, homicide, be present, it is utterly impossible that this germ of life ean be coexistent with it; can be firmly implanted and abiding [see John v. 38] in the man).
