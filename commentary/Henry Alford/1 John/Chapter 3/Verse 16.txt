<b> 16.</b>]<i> Example of true love in Christ, and enforcement of it on us</i>.<b> In this</b> (see above, ver. 10, and note, ch. ii, 3)<b> we have the know-ledge of</b> ( “we have arrived at and possess the apprehension of:” knowledge, as an act of the understanding proceeding on intellectual grounds. Here however it is used entirely within the sphere of the Christian of union with Christ. None can understand true love as shewn in this its highest example, but he who is one with Christ, and has felt and does feel that love of His in its power on himself. See note on ch. ii. 8)<b> love</b> (i. e. what love is: the nature of love true and genuine: that perfection of love, which we are commending. So most of the Commentators. Some have held to the insertion of the words<i> “of God”</i> (as A.V.) after<b> love</b>, which has hardly any authority. But there can be but little doubt that the other is the right view. The love of God to us is not that which would,<i> as such</i>, be adduced as a pattern to us of brotherly love; it is true that in the depth of the matter, all true love is love after that pattern: but in a passage so logically bound together it is much more probable that the term common to the two, Christ and ourselves, would be, not divine love, which as such is peculiar to Him, but love itself simply, that of which He has given the great example which we are to follow),<b> that He</b> (Christ, as the words beyond question shew)<b> laid down His life for us</b> (i. e.<i> died</i>: not as Grotius, who in all the places where it occurs maintains that it is only to<i> expose life to danger</i>, which would entirely enervate the Apostle’s saying here. The term<b> for us</b> carries in it and behind it all that we know of the nature of the death which is spoken of: but the vicariousness and atoning power of Christ’s death are not here in consideration: it is looked on here as the greatest possible proof of love, us in John xv, 13):<b> and we</b> (emphatic: we on our part as followers of Christ)<b> ought on behalf of the brethren to lay down our lives</b> (on<b> lives</b>, Socinus says well: “He says not, that we ought to lay down our ‘<i>life</i>,’ as if one were bound to die for many, but, our<i> lives</i>, because each ought to die for each.” The Apostle states the duty generally; and thus stated it is clear enough. As Christ did in pursuance of His love, so ought we to do in pursuance of ours, bound as we are to Him not by the mere force of an outward example, but by the power of an inward life. But naturally and necessarily the precept finds its aerate tion only in those cases where our Heavenly Father's will sets the offering of such a sacrifice in the course and pursuance of our brotherly love, which He has ordained).
