<b> 17</b>.]<b> But</b> ( “by the adversative connexion of ver. 17 with ver. 16 the Apostle marks the passage from the greater, which is justly demanded of us, to the lesser, the violation of which is all the more a transgression of the law just prescribed” Düsterdieck)<b> whosoever hath the world’s sustenance, and beholdeth</b> (the Greek word gives more than “<i>seeth</i>,” which would imply only the casual sight: it is the standing and looking on as a spectator: so that it ever involves not the eye only, but the mind also, in the sight: it is to<i> contemplate</i>, not simply to<i> see</i>. St. John is very fond of this word, and wherever it occurs, this its meaning may be more or less traced. There is then in this unmerciful man not merely the being aware of, but the deliberate contemplation of the distress of his brother)<b> his brother having need, and shutteth up</b> (the shutting is then and there done, as the result of the contemplation: not a mere constitutional hardness of heart, but an act of exclusion from sympathy following deliberately on the beholding of his brother’s distress) bis<b> bowels</b> (i. e. his heart, the seat of compassion: as so often in the New Test., this expression carries the idea of<i> turning away</i> from him. As Düsterdieek remarks, the fact that a man shuts up his heart against his brother, includes in it the fact that that brother is excluded<i> from</i> the heart thus shut up),<b> how</b> (can it be that? as in ch. iv. 20)<b> doth the love of God</b> (i. e. from the very express filling out of the thought in ch. iv. 20,<i> “love to God;”</i> not God’s love to us. See also ch. ii. 5, where we have the same expression and reference to the love of God being in a man. The context indeed here might seem, as the mention of Christ’s love to us as so immediately preceded, to require the other meaning; or at least, that of “the love whereof God hath set us a pattern:” and accordingly both these have been held. But I see not how we can escape the force of the passages above cited)<b> abide in him</b> (Lücke and Düsterdieck are disposed to lay a stress on the word<b> abide</b> here, thereby opening a door for the view that the love of God may indeed be in him in some sense, but not as a firm abiding principle; that at all events at the moment when he thus shuts up his bowels of compassion, it is not<i> abiding</i> in him. But this world seem to violate the ideal strictness of the Apostle’s teaching, and the true sense rather to be, “How can we think of such an one as at all possessing the love of God in any proper sense?” giving thus much emphasis to the word<b> abide</b>.<br><br> Here again, as above in the case of the duty of laying down life for a brother, many questions of casuistry have been raised as to the nature and extent of the duty of almsgiving, on which it is impossible to enter here. The safest answers to them all will be found in the Christian conscience enlightened by the Holy Spirit, guiding the Christian heart warmed by the living presence of Christ)?
