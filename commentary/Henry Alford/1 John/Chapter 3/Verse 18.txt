<p><strong> 18</strong> .] <em> Exhortation to true brotherly love</em> : following naturally on the example of the want of it given in the last verse. <strong> Little children, let us not love with word nor yet with tongue, but</strong> (let us love) <strong> in deed and truth</strong> (there is some little difficulty in assigning these words their several places in the contrast. We may notice first, that the two former, λόγῳ and γλώσσῃ , are simple datives of the instrument, whereas the two latter are introduced by the preposition ἐν , denoting the element in which. The true account of the arrangement seems to be, that the usual contrast of λόγῳ and ἐν ἔργῳ is more sharply defined by the epexegetic τῇ γλώσσῃ and ἐν ἀληθείᾳ : τῇ γλώσσῃ giving, by making the mere bodily member the instrument, more precisely the idea of absence of truth than even λόγῳ , and ( ἐν ) ἀληθείᾳ more definitely the idea of its presence than even ἐν ἔργῳ . Similar contrasts are adduced by the Commentators from the classics: especially from Theognis; e. g. 973 f., μή μοι ἀνὴρ εἴη γλώσσῃ φίλος , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἔργῳ · χερσίν τε σπεύδοι χρήμασί τ ʼ ἀμφότερα : 63, ἀλλὰ δοκεῖ μὲν πᾶσιν ἀπὸ γλώσσης φίλος εἶναι : 96, ὃς κ . εἴπῃ γλώσσῃ λῷστα , φρονῇ δ ʼ ἕτερα . As connected with the exhortation in this verse, I may cite the tradition reported by Jerome in his Commentary on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:10">Galatians 6:10</span> , vol. vii. p. 528 f.: “Beatus Joannes Evangelista cum Ephesi moraretur usque ad extremam senectutem, et vix inter discipulorum manus ad ecclesiam deferretur, nec posset in plura vocem verba contexere, nihil aliud per singulas solebat proferre collectas, nisi hoc: ‘Filioli, diligite alterutrum.’ Tandem discipuli et fratres qui aderant, tædio affecti, quod eadem semper audirent, dixerunt: Magister, quare semper hoc loqueris? Qui respondit dignam Joanne sententiam: Quia præceptum Domini est, et si solum fiat, sufficit”).</p>
