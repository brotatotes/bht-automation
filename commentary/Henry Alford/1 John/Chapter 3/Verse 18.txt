<b> 18.</b>]<i> Exhortation to true brotherly love:</i> following naturally on the example of the want of it given in the last verse.<b> Little children, let us not love with word, nor yet with tongue, but</b> (let us love)<b> in deed and truth</b> (there is some little difficulty in assigning these words their several places in the contrast. Notice first, that the two former,<b> with word</b> and<b> with tongue</b>, simply relate to the<i> instrument</i>, whereas the two latter are introduced by the preposition<i> in</i>, denoting the element in which. The trae account of the arrangement seems to be, that the usual contrast of<i> word</i> and<i> deed</i> is more sharply defined by the explanatory terms,<i> tongue</i> and<i> truth</i>:<b> with the tongue</b> giving, by making the mere bodily member the instrument, more precisely the idea of absence of truth than even<b> with word</b>, and<b> in truth</b> more definitely the idea of its presence than even<b> in deed</b>. As connected with the exhortation in this verse, I may cite the tradition reported by Jerome in his Commentary on Gal. vi. 10: “The blessed. John, the Evangelist, living on at Ephesus into extreme old age, and being with difficulty borne by the hands of his disciples to church, when he could not sustain his utterance for more words, used to say no more at each meeting than this: ‘Little children, love one another.’ At last his disciples and the brethren who were present, being wearied at hearing always the same words, said, ‘Master, why dost thou always go on saying this?’ The answer was worthy of St. John: ‘Because it is the Lord’s command; and if this only be done, it is enough’”).<br><br> It must be plain from what has been said, that the future,<b> shall persuade</b>, is not, on account of the words “<b>before</b><b> Him,</b>” to be taken as referring to the future day of judgment, as some have done. In ch. iv, 17, which is in some respects parallel with this, that day is expressly named: whereas in our passage, an equally clear indication is given, by the parallelism of the two future verbs,<i> “shall know”</i> and<i> “shall persuade,”</i> that no such reference is intended.<b> before Him</b> is not, at His appearing, but,<i> in His sight</i>, as placed before His all-seeing eye.
