<b> 2.</b>]<b> Beloved, now are we children of God</b> (the world recognizes ns not: but our sonship is real: none the less real, that we ourselves know not our future condition in all its manifestation. So that the next member of the sentence is introduced not with a<i> “but,”</i> but with an<i> “and:”</i> the two are not contrasted, but simply put in juxtaposition as components of our present state, We are really sons of God, even<i> now:</i> and we look [this very word<i> “now”</i> suggesting a future] for an inheritance in virtue of that sonship: it has not been yet manifested of what sort that inheritance shall be: thus much we know, &c. Such seems to be the simple connexion, without any adversative particles expressed or understood),<b> and it never yet was manifested</b> (on any occasion: such is the force of the tense in the original. And the verb, as so often in St. John, and as in the next sentence, does not mean, made manifest to<i> knowledge</i> or<i> anticipation</i>,—for that it is, as asserted below: but, shewn forth<i> in actuality</i>, come to its manifestation)<b> what we shall be</b> (understand, in virtue of this our state of sons of God: to what new development or condition this already existing fact will lead. But we must take care not to fall into Grotius’s error, “in what manner we are to be the sons of God:” for as Calovius rightly remarks, “there are no degrees of sonship:” we are as truly, and in the same sense, children of God now, as we shall be then: but now [Gal. iv. 1] we are children waiting for an unknown inheritance—then we shall be children in full possession of that inheritance, And hence, from the reality and identity of that sonship, come what follows,—our certain knowledge, even in this absence of manifestation in detail, that our future condition will consist in likeness to Him).<b> We know</b> (no contrast, though<i> “but”</i> is required to fill out our English idiom: see above: what we know of this<i> what we shall be,</i> is this. There is not even a<i> correction</i> of the preceding: the connexion is simply, “This future condition of ours hath never yet appeared: thus much we know of it.””<b> we know,</b> as always, of certain, well-assured cognition) that, if it were manifested (viz. the<i> “what we shall be;”</i> this verb takes up again the former one. So most of the ancients and moderns. On the other hand, Bede, Calvin, Beza [and the A.V.: Tyndale and Cranmer had<i> “it”</i>), and others, supply<i> “He,”</i> understanding<i> Christ:</i> appealing to St. John’s well-known usage which we have in ch. ii. 28, and below in our ver. 5. But it may be replied, that in the former case the subject was plainly suggested by the preceding words<i> “in Him,”</i> in the latter actually expressed: whereas here the reference of the verb is no less plainly given by the preceding verb, here again repeated. Besides which,<i> “He,”</i> in ver. 5, clearly shews that the divine subject of these verses is not Christ but the Father),<b> we shall be</b> (taken up again from above, and the emphatic<b> like Him</b> corresponding exactly to<b> what</b> above)<b> like Him</b> (<i>God:</i> see below),<b> because</b> (this connecting particle must be kept firm to its causal meaning, and all the difficulties of the sentence met thus, not by explaining it away. Nor does it express merely the<i> mode</i> of the transformation, as Lyra. Still less must we with Calvin and others reverse the causal connexion, and make the seeing Him as He is merely a proof that we shall be like Him. Whatever consequences it may entail, it is certain that the proposition introduced by<i> because</i> contains the real essential cause and ground of that which it follows)<b> we shall see Him</b> (God: see below)<b> as He is</b> (with St. John, the recognition and knowledge of God is ever no mere cognition, but the measure of the spiritual life: he who has it, possesses God, has the Father and the Son: becomes more and more like God, having His seed in him. So that the full and perfect accomplishment of this knowledge in the actual fruition of God Himself must of necessity bring with it entire likeness to God. And this is the part of the future lot of the sons of God which is certain. Because we shall see Him as He is,—which is taken for granted as a Christian axiom,—it of necessity follows that we shall be entirely like Him: ethically like Him: we shall behold, as Ecumenins says, “the just, the just One—the pure, the pure One.” The difficulty, that no man can see God, is not in reality contained here, any more than it is in our Lord’s “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall<i> see</i> God.” The word, however understood, has for its limit, that no created eye even in the glorified body can behold the Creator: that beyond its keenest search there will be glory and perfection baffling and dazzling it: but this incapacity does not prevent the vision, as far as it can reach, being clear and unclouded: being, to the utmost extent of which our glorified nature is capable,<i> as He is</i>—a true and not a false vision of God. And if it be again objected that we seem to be thus confounding the ethical sight of God which is the measure of our likeness to God, with corporeal sight of Him in the resurrection body, I answer that in the realm where our thoughts are now employed, I cannot appreciate that distinction between ethical and corporeal. We are speaking of things which eye hath not seen, nor mind conceived: what a<i> spiritual body</i> may imply, our ideas now do not enable us to conceive: but I suppose it must at all events be a body, all of whose senses are spiritually conditioned and attuned: that what<i> physical capacities</i> are to our bodies here,<i> spiritual capacities</i> will be there: and feeling this, however little I may know of the details of the great fact, it removes from me all insuperable difficulty as to the words<i> “we shall see Him as</i> He<i> is.”</i> “I know that in my flesh I shall see God,” may not be the right expression in Job, but it is the expression of my hopes as a son of God: it is the one expression of a hope in which all other hopes culminate and centre. And every son of God knows, that for it ever to be fulfilled, he must be growing onward in likeness to Him, pure, even up into His purity: for in His light only shall we see light.<br><br> One point only must be noticed before passing onward; the fact that several of the great interpreters understand<b> Him</b> both times of<i> Christ</i>. This has partly of course been occasioned by their supplying Christ as a subject to the verb<i> “shall appear,”</i> or<i> “shall be manifested,”</i> above. Augustine has one of his most beautiful passages, explaining how at Christ’s appearing, the impious shall see only<i> the form of a servant</i>, but we<i> the form of God</i>. The whole view, however, does not satisfy the requirements of the passage. It is the<i> children of God</i> who are addressed: and the topic of exhortation is, that they be righteous as God their Father is righteous).<b></b>
