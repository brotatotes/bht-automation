<b> 20.</b>]<i> takes up this matter of the persuading our hearts before God,</i> and<i> shews its true importance</i> and rationale. This is carried on in the following verses, but is here and in ver, 21 placed as its ground. If our heart,<i> before Him,</i> judges us unfavourably—we favourably still: if our heart condemn us not, again<i> before Him</i>, judging and seeing in the light of His countenance, then we know that we are at one with Him, and those consequences follow, which are set forth in ver. 22. The many difficulties which occur in<i> rendering</i> this verse cannot be presented to the mere English reader. They will be found discussed in my Greek Test. The context appears to stand thus. The Apostle in ver. 19 has said that by the presence of genuine love we shall know that we are of the truth, and shall persuade our hearts in God’s presence. He then proceeds to enlarge on this<i> persuading</i> our hearts<i> in general</i>. If our heart condemn us, what does it import? If our heart acquit us, what? The<i> condemnation</i>, and<i> acquittal</i>, are plainly and necessarily<i> opposed</i>, both in hypothesis and in result. If the consolatory view of ver. 20 is taken,—as softening our self-condemnation by the comforting thought of God’s greatness and infinite mercy,—then the general result of vv. 20, 21 will be, whether our heart condemn us or not, we have comfort and assurance: and then what would be the import of our<i> persuading</i> our hearts at all? But on the other interpretation, the condemnatory sense of ver. 20—as intensifying our self-condemnation by the thought that the cause of it is God, knowing more of our sin than we do—then, taken with some modifications, all will be clear, I say, taken with some modifications: because the sense has been much obscured by the mistake of introducing the particular case treated in ver. 18 into the general statements of vv. 20, 21. It is not, If our heart condemn us<i> for want of brotherly love:</i> but this test is dropped, and the general subject of the testimony of our hearts is entered upon. Thus we get the context and rendering, as follows):<b> because</b> (as if it were said, and this<i> persuading</i><i> our hearts before Him</i> is for us a vital matter, seeing that condemnation and acquittal by our own hearts bring each such a weighty conclusion with it)<b> if our heart condemn us, it is because</b> (our self condemnation is founded on the fact, that)<b> God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things</b> (i. e. the condemning testimony of our conscience is not alone, but is a token of One sitting above our conscience and greater than our conscience: because our conscience is but the faint echo of His voice who knoweth all things: if it condemn us, how much more He? and therefore this persuading, for which this verse renders a reason, becomes a thing of inestimable import, and one which we cannot neglect, seeing that the absence of it is an index to our standing condemned of God. And then, having given the reason why the<i> condemnation</i> should be set at rest by the<i> persuasion</i>, he goes on to give the blessed results of the<i> persuasion</i> itself in vv. 21, 22).
