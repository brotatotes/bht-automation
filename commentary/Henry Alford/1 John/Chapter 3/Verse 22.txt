<b> 22.</b>]<b> and</b> (such another<i> “and”</i> as that in verse 10 above, where, after the general statement,<i> “and”</i> introduced the particular instance in which the general truth was carried forward. So here: By dwelling and walking in love, we can alone gain that approval of our conscience as God’s children, which brings real confidence in Him and real intercommunion in prayer, which is a result and proof of that confidence)<b> whatsoever wo ask, we receive</b> (present: not put for future, as Grotius thinks. The Apostle is setting forth actual matter of fact)<b> from Him</b> (these words must be taken in all their simplicity, without capricious and arbitrary limitations. Like all the sayings of St. John, they proceed on the ideal truth of the Christian state. “The child of God,” as Huther says, “asks for nothing which is against the will of its Father”),<b> because</b> (ground of the above<i> receiving</i>)<b> we keep His commandments, and do the things which are pleasing in His sight</b> (on the last expression [and parallelism] see Exod. xv. 26; also Deut. vi. 18, xii. 25, Ezra x. 11, Isa. xxxviii. 3. It is added, not as explanatory of<i> keeping</i><i> His commandments,</i> but to connect with His granting our prayers, since our lives are in accord with His good pleasure. This however brings us to the theological difficulty of our verse, wherein it would seem at first sight as if the granting of our prayers by God depended, as its meritorious efficient, on our keeping of His commandments and doing that which pleases Him. And so some of the Roman-Catholic expositors here. But both here and elsewhere the solution of the difficulty is very easy, if separated from the party words of theology, and viewed in the light of Scripture itself. Out of Christ, there are no good works at all: entrance into Christ is not won nor merited by them. In Christ, every work done of faith is good and is pleasing to God. The doing of such works is the working of the life of Christ in us: they are its sign, they its fruits: they are not of us, but of it and of Him. They are the measure of our Chistian life: according to their abundance, so is our access to God, so is our reward from God: for they are the steps of our likeness to God, Whatever is attributed to them as an efficient cause, is attributed not to us, but to Him whose fruits they are,<i> Because</i> Christ is thus manifested in us, God hears our prayers, which He only hears for Christ’s sake:<i> because</i> His Spirit works thus abundantly in us, He listens to our prayer, which in that measure has become the voice of His Spirit. So that no degree of efficacy attributed to the good works of the child of God need surprise us: it is God recognizing, God vindicating, God multiplying, God glorifying, His own work in us. So that when, e-g., Cornelius-a-lapide says, “It is congruous, and the congruous reward of obedience and reconciliation (friendship), that if man does the will of God, God in His turn should do the will of man,” all we can reply is that such a duality, such a reciprocity, docs not exist for Christians: we are<i> in God</i>, He in us: and this St. John continually insists on. We have no claim<i> from without</i>: He works in us to do of His good pleasure: and the works which He works, which we work, manifest before Him, and before all, that we are His children. The assertion,<i> “whatsoever we ask, we receive,”</i> I reserve to be treated of on ch. v. 14, 15, where it is set forth more in detail).
