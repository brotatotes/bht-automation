 23 .]  Summing up of all these commandments in one: faith in Christ, and brotherly love according to Christ’s command .  And (see καί similarly used, ch. 1 John 1:5 , 1 John 2:17 , 1Jn 3:3 )  His commandment (“singulari numero mandatum præmisit, et duo subsequentia adjungit mandata, fidem scilicet et dilectionem, quia nimirum hæc ab invicem separari nequeunt. Neque enim sine fide Christi recte nos alterutrum diligere, neque vere in nomine Jesu Christi sine dilectione possumus credere,” Bed [67] : and Œc., ἔχοντες ἐντολήν , ἵνα τῇ πίστει τῇ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ Ἰης . χρ . ἀγαπῶμεν ἀλλήλους )  is this, that (see on ἵνα , 1Jn 3:11 )  we should believe (the aor. imports one act of receptive faith: the present, a continuing habit)  the name (this unusual expression, πιστεύειν τῷ ὀνόματι (reff.), is well explained by Calvin and Beza, “nomen ad prædicationem respicit;” so that, as Seb.-Schmidt, it is “credere merito, satisfactioni, omnibusque promissionibus Christi et de Christo:” to believe the Gospel message concerning Him, and Him as living in it, in all His fulness. We have similar expressions, πιστεύειν τῇ γραφῇ , John 2:22 ; τοῖς ῥήμασι , John 5:47 ; τῇ ἀκοῇ , Joh 12:38 )  of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another (pres., of a continued habit),  even as He gave us commandment (some Commentators have referred these words to both πιστεύσωμεν and ἀγαπῶμεν , and understood ὁ θεός as the subject of ἔδωκεν . So Estius, Hunnius, Bengel, Sander. But this would seem to introduce too much of a tautology: “God’s commandment is, that we should, &c.… as He gave us commandment.” It seems more natural, with the generality of Commentators, to understand Christ as the subject to ἔδωκεν , and by the commandment, John 13:34 ; John 15:12 ; Joh 15:17 ).
