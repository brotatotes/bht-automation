<b> 24a.</b>]<i> General return</i>, with reference to what has been said in the last verses,<i> to the great key-note of the Epistle,</i><b> abide in Him</b>, with which the former part of it concluded, ch. ii. 28. This keeping of His (God’s) commandments is the abiding in God: this of which brotherly love is the first and most illustrious example and summary. So that the exhortation given at the beginning of this portion of the Epistle is still in the Apostle’s mind, as again ch. iv. 15, 16, and v. 20; see also ch. ii. 6, iii, 6, 9.<b> And he that keepeth His</b> (God’s)<b> commandments, abideth in Him</b> (God)<b>,</b><b> and He</b> (God)<b> in him</b> (some hold that<b> He</b> and<b> Him</b> are to be referred to Christ. And no doubt they would be perfectly true, and according to our Lord’s own words, when thus applied: see John xiv. 15, xv. 5 ff. Still, from the context [see below], it is better to refer them to the chief subject, viz. to God. In the sense, the difference is not important. It is one of the most difficult questions in the explanation of this most difficult of Epistles, to assign such expressions as the present definitely to their precise personal object).<br><br><b> 24 b.</b>] And of one part of this mutual indwelling there is<i> a sign and token</i>, given us by God Himself, viz.<i> the Holy Spirit</i>. By the mention of the Spirit, the Apostle makes these words the note of transition to the subject of the neat section, ch. iv. 1–6, which is parenthetical, of the discerning of true and false spirits, and after which the main subject of brotherly love is resumed again.<b> And in this we</b> (all the children of God; not, as the Roman-Catholic expositors, the Apostles, or the apostolic church, only)<b> know that He abideth in us, from</b> (or<b> by</b>—<i>out of</i> the fact)<b> the Spirit which He gave us</b> (not,<i> hath given</i>, as A.V. The<i> giving</i> here took place at a certain time, by a definite act, viz. on the day of Pentecost, when the Father bestowed the Holy Spirit on the Church. And this word<b> gave</b> is one sign that the whole is to be referred to the Father: seeing that our Lord says,<i> “I will pray the Father; and</i><b> He shall give</b><i> you another Comforter, the Spirit of Truth,”</i> John xiv, 16, This indwelling Spirit of God is to the child of God the spring and source of his spiritual life, the sure token of his sonship, Rom. 14, 15, Gal. iv. 6, and of his union with God in Christ).
