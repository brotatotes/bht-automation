<p><strong> 24 b</strong> .] And of one part of this mutual indwelling there is <em> a sign and token</em> , given us by God Himself, viz. <em> the Holy Spirit</em> . By the mention of the Spirit, the Apostle makes these words the note of transition to the subject of the next section, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1-6">1 John 4:1-6</span> , which is parenthetical, of the discerning of true and false spirits, and after which the main subject of brotherly love is resumed again. <strong> And in this we</strong> (all the children of God; not as the R.-Cath. expositors, Lyra, Corn.-a-lap., Estius, the Apostles, or the apostolic church, only) <strong> know that He abideth in us, from the Spirit</strong> (the change of construction is unusual. It arises from the Apostle having combined together two ways of speaking in this connexion, ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν , ὅτι …, see 1Jn 3:16 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:19">1 John 3:19</span> , and ἐκ τούτου γινώσκομεν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:6">1 John 4:6</span> . The knowledge is ἐν τούτῳ , in this element or department of fact, and it is ἐκ τούτου , derived from, as its source, that which follows) <strong> which He gave us</strong> ( <strong> ἔδωκεν</strong> , aor.; at a certain time, by a definite act, viz. on the day of Pentecost, when the Father bestowed the Holy Spirit on the Church. And this ἔδωκεν is one sign that the whole is to be referred to the Father: seeing that our Lord says, κἀγὼ ἐρωτήσω τὸν πατέρα , καὶ ἄλλον παράκλητον <strong> δώσει</strong> ὑμῖν … τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς ἀληθείας , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16-17">John 14:16-17</span> . This indwelling Spirit of God is to the child of God the spring and source of his spiritual life, the sure token of his sonship, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:14-15">Romans 8:14-15</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:6">Galatians 4:6</span> , and of his union with God in Christ).</p>
