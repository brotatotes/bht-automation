<b> 3.</b>]<b> And every one that hath this hope</b> (viz. that of being like Him hereafter)<b> on Him</b> (i. e. rested and grounded on God. In God, and grounded on His promises, is all our hope),<b> purifieth himself</b> (these words are not to be taken in any Pelagian sense, as if a man could of himself purify himself: “apart from me,” says our Lord, “ye can do nothing.” John xv. 5. The man who purifies himself has this hope resting upon God. This mere fact implies a will to purify himself, not out of, nor independent of, this hope, but ever stirred up by, and accompanying it. So that the will is not his own, sprung out of his own nature, but the result of his Christian state, in which God also ministers to him the power to carry out that will in self-purification, See 2 Cor. vii. 1, which is remarkably parallel: and 1 Pet. i. 21, 22. The idea is much the same as that in ch. i. 9: it is entire purification, not merely from unchastity, but from all defilement of flesh and spirit),<b> even as He is pure</b> (Who is intended by<b> He?</b> Clearly below in ver. 5, Christ, from the facts of the case. But is it as clear here? Almost all the modern Commentators assume it, and the inference is upheld by a first view of ch. ii, 6, where much the same expression is used, and used of Christ. But there are some weighty considerations against the view. First, it is the<i> Father</i>, of whom it is written, “Be ye holy, for [or as] I am holy,” 1 Pet. i. 15, 16, Levit. xi. 44, xix. 2: compare also Matt. v. 48. Secondly, it would be very harsh thus to introduce a new subject, in the face of this Scripture usage. Thirdly, it would be against the whole spirit of the context: in which sonship of God and likeness to God are joined together, and the hopes belonging to the state are made motives for the duty. Fourthly, if it be asserted that Christ is our Pattern, in whom we see the Father’s purity shewn forth; I answer that this would be perfectly intelligible, if allusion was made, as in ch. ii. 6, to some historical manifestation in our Lord’s life: but being as it is in the present tense, it refers to the essential divine attribute of purity: and if so, then to that attribute in ary inherence in the Father. For these reasons and others which may be seen in my Greek Testament, I would interpret<b> He</b> here of the Father, in whom essentially abides this perfection of purity, and after continual increase of likeness to whom his sons, having the ultimate hope of being completely like Him, will be striving. In ver. 5, the case is otherwise: see there, and also on ver. 7).
