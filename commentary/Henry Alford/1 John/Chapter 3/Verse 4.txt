<b> 4.</b>] In this verse we have verse 3 taken ap from the opposite side. There, God’s essential purity formed a law, according to which the child of God having hope of ultimate complete likeness to Him, purifies himself. Here we have it declared that the sinner goes counter to [this and all other] law: indeed the two terms, sin and lawlessness, are synonymous and convertible.<b> Every one that committeth sin,</b><b> also committeth transgression-of-law: and sin</b> (abstract and in general)<b> is transgression-of-law</b> (abstract and in general. The assertion amounts to the identification of the terms, and the<b> is</b> amounts to “is equivalent to.”<br><br> This being so,<i> what is it exactly that our verse asserts</i> respecting these two things, sin, and transgression-of-law? First and obviously, no appropriation must be made, in this verse and throughout this passage, of the word<b> sin</b> to<i> one kind</i> of sin, whether it be mortal sin as distinguished from venial [so the Roman-Catholic expositors], or notorious and unrepented sins, or sins against brotherly love [as Luther, and Augustine]. The assertions are all perfectly general, and regard, in the true root and ideal, every sin whatever. Every sin whatever then is a transgression of God’s law: as indeed its very name in Greek implies:<i> to sin</i> being to<i> miss a mark</i>, and the mark being that will of God which is the<i> law</i> and<i> aim</i> to him who “doeth the will of God,” ch. ii. 17).
