<b> 5.</b>]<i> Additional argument</i> for the incompatibility of sin with the life of God’s children: that He, Christ, in and by whom we have this adoption (John i. 12), and by being in whose likeness alone we can be perfectly like God, was manifested to take away all sins, being Himself sinless.<b> And ye know</b> (the Apostle assumes it as known by those who had an anointing from the Holy One and knew all things ch. ii. 20)<b> that He</b> (now clearly Christ, from the context, which [see above on ver. 3] can alone decide the reference in each case)<b> was manifested</b> (viz. by His appearing in the flesh, and all that He openly and visibly did and taught in it, or may be known, by the Spirit, to have done and taught)<b> in order that He may</b> [might]<b> take away</b> (in the original, “take away by one act and entirely.” The meaning,<i> “take away,”</i> and not<i> “bear,”</i> is necessitated here by the context. Sin is altogether alien from Christ. He became incarnate that He might blot it out: He has no stain of it on Himself, If we render the word<i> “bear,”</i> this coherence is lost. Of course this fact is in the background, that He took them away by bearing them Himself: but it is not brought out, only the antagonism between Him and sin. See, on the word, the note on John i. 29)<b> sins</b> (<i>all</i> sins, not merely certain sins. The object of His manifestation is stated not only categorically, but definitively. Compare the striking parallel, Heb. ix. 26):<b> and in Him sin is not</b> (as His work, in being manifested, was, altogether to take away sin, so likewise is He himself free from all spot of sin.
