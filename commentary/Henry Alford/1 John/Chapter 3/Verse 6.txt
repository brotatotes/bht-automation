<b> 6.</b>] The connexion see above.<b> Every one that abideth in Him</b> (this expression is not to be weakened down by any rationalistic interpretation a<i> s believing in Christ</i>, or<i> being joined in love to Christ.</i> This a man might be to an earthly friend: but could not be said to<i> abide in him</i>. See the sense expanded in the note on ch. ii. 24. Nothing short of personal immanence in the personal Christ will satisfy the words: a living because He lives, and as receiving of His fulness)<b> sinneth not</b> (nor again is this to be tamed down, as has been done by far more and better interpreters than in the last case, by making it mean “does not persist in sin,” so Luther, “does not allow sin to reign over him,”—so the Socinians and semi-Socinians. Against all such the plain words of the Apostle must be held fast, and explained by the analogy of his way of speaking throughout the Epistle of the ideal reality of the life of God and the life of sin as absolutely excluding one another. This all the best and deepest Commentators have felt: so Augustine and Bede, saying, “In so far as he abideth in Him, he sinneth not.” The two are incompatible: and in so far as a man is found in the one, he is thereby separated from the other. In the child of God i the hatred of sin; in the child of the devil the love of it; and every act done in virtue of either state or as belonging to either, is done purely on one side or purely on the other. If the child of God falls into sin, it is an act against nature, deadly to life, hardly endured, and bringing bitter repentance: it is as the taking of a poison, which if it be not corrected by its antidote, will sap the very springs of life. So that there is no real contradiction to ch. i, 8–10, ii. 2, where this very falling into sin of the child of God is asserted and the remedy prescribed. The real difficulty of our verse is in that which follows);<b> every one that sinneth hath not seen</b> (so literally: see below)<b> Him, neither hath known Him</b> (here it seems to be said that the act of sinning not only<i> so far</i> excludes from the life in God and Christ, but proves that that life h<i> as never existed</i> in the person so sinning. That this cannot be the meaning of the Apostle, is evident from such passages as i. 8–10, ii. 2, and indeed from the whole tenor of the Epistle, in which the words,<i> “now are we children of God,”</i> occur in combination with<br><br><i> “let no one deceive you,”</i> and the like: whereas if the above view were correct, the very fact of<i> being deceived</i> not only would cause them to cease from being<i> children of God</i>, but would prove that they never had been such. If then this cannot be so, what meaning are we to put upon the words? First observe the tense in which the verbs stand in the original. They are perfects, almost equivalent to our English present, by which I have accordingly rendered them. And the meaning will be, that the cutting off by an act of sin of the sight and knowledge of Christ, shews, and shews in proportion as it prevails, unreality in that sight and knowledge. See the force of the tense discussed in my Greek Testament.<br><br> As regards the relation of the words themselves,<b> seeth</b> and<b> knoweth</b>; some hold that there is no perceptible difference: but that the latter word fixes and specifies the necessarily figurative meaning of the former. Lücke would understand<i> “seeing”</i> of knowledge obtained by historical information, which matures and completes itself into<i> “knowing.”</i> But this seems hardly according to St. John’s practice, who uses<i> “seeing”</i> either of bodily sight [John i. 18, 1 John i. 1, &c., &c.],—or of an intuitive immediate vision of divine things, such as Christ has of the Father and heavenly things [John iii. 11, 32, vi. 46, viii. 38],—or of spiritual intuition gained by knowledge of Christ and the divine life [John xiv. 7, 9; 3 John 11]: and there can be little doubt that this last is the meaning here: and thus<b> neither</b> will retain its proper exclusive and climacteric force:<i> seeing</i> is a further step than<i> knowing</i>: a realization of Christ's personality and of the existence of heavenly things which is the result of spiritual knowledge: and thus the sinner “hath not seen Him, nor yet, nor even, known Him”).
