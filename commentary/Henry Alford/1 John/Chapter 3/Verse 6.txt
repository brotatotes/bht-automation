<b> 6.</b>] The connexion see above.<b> Every one that abideth in Him</b> (this expression is not to be weakened down by any rationalistic interpretation a<i> s believing in Christ</i>, or<i> being joined in love to Christ.</i> This a man might be to an earthly friend: but could not be said to<i> abide in him</i>. See the sense expanded in the note on ch. ii. 24. Nothing short of personal immanence in the personal Christ will satisfy the words: a living because He lives, and as receiving of His fulness)<b> sinneth not</b> (nor again is this to be tamed down, as has been done by far more and better interpreters than in the last case, by making it mean “does not persist in sin,” so Luther, “does not allow sin to reign over him,”—so the Socinians and semi-Socinians. Against all such the plain words of the Apostle must be held fast, and explained by the analogy of his way of speaking throughout the Epistle of the ideal reality of the life of God and the life of sin as absolutely excluding one another. This all the best and deepest Commentators have felt: so Augustine and Bede, saying, “In so far as he abideth in Him, he sinneth not.” The two are incompatible: and in so far as a man is found in the one, he is thereby separated from the other. In the child of God i the hatred of sin; in the child of the devil the love of it; and every act done in virtue of either state or as belonging to either, is done purely on one side or purely on the other. If the child of God falls into sin, it is an act against nature, deadly to life, hardly endured, and bringing bitter repentance: it is as the taking of a poison, which if it be not corrected by its antidote, will sap the very springs of life. So that there is no real contradiction to ch. i, 8–10, ii. 2, where this very falling into sin of the child of God is asserted and the remedy prescribed. The real difficulty of our verse is in that which follows);<b> every one that sinneth hath not seen</b> (so literally: see below)<b> Him, neither hath known Him</b> (here it seems to be said that the act of sinning not only<i> so far</i> excludes from the life in God and Christ, but proves that that life h<i> as never existed</i> in the person so sinning. That this cannot be the meaning of the Apostle, is evident from such passages as i. 8–10, ii. 2, and indeed from the whole tenor of the Epistle, in which the words,<i> “now are we children of God,”</i> occur in combination with
