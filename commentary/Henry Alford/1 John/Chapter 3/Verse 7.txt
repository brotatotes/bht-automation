<p><strong> 7</strong> .] <strong> Little children, let no one deceive you</strong> (it does not seem that any particular false teacher is here in St. John’s view; but he alludes to all who would sever ethical likeness to God from the Christian life): <strong> he that doeth righteousness</strong> ( <strong> τὴν δ</strong> ., perhaps as being abstract, but more probably because the righteousness spoken of is but one, and that God’s: the righteousness which is His) <strong> is righteous, even as He</strong> (here apparently, God, notwithstanding the apparent parallel of Ἰησοῦν χριστὸν δίκαιον in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span> ; for we are by this saying, as by that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span> , where see note, referred back to the great Source of our spiritual birth, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:29">1 John 2:29</span> , and our likeness to Him insisted on: ὁ ποιῶν τὴν δικαιοσύνην ἔγνωκεν τὸν δίκαιον , καὶ δίκαιός ἐστιν ὡς καὶ ἐκεῖνος δίκαιός ἐστιν , τουτέστιν ὁ θεός ) <strong> is righteous</strong> .

<p>This verse has absolutely nothing to do with the sense which the R.-Cath. expositors have endeavoured to extract from it, “adversus hæreticos hodiernos, simili ratione populum seducentes, cum negant per bona opera quemquam justum esse coram Deo,” Est., and so Lyra, Corn.-a-lap., and Tirinus. But this is altogether to invert the proposition of the Apostle, who is reasoning, not from the fact of doing good works to the conclusion that a man is righteous, but from the hypothesis of a man’s being a child of God, born of Him and like Him, to the necessity of his purifying himself and doing righteousness. And in doing this, he ascribes the ποιεῖν τὴν δικαιοσύνην to its source, and the ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν to its source: the one man is of God, the other is of the devil. As Luther well says (in Düsterd. h. l.), “good works of piety do not make a good pious man, but a good pious man does good pious works.… Fruits grow from the tree, not the tree from fruits”).</p>
