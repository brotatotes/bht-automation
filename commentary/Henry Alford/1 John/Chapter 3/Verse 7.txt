<b> 7.</b>]<b> Little children, let no one deceive you</b> (it does not seem that any particular false teacher is here in St. John’s views but he alludes to all who would sever ethical likeness to God from the Christian life):<b> he that doeth righteousness</b> (the righteousness spoken of is but one, and God’s: the righteousness which is is righteous, even as He (here apparently, God, notwithstanding the apparent parallel of “<i>Jesus Christ</i><b> the righteous</b>” in ch, ii, 2: for we are by this saying, as by that in ver. 3,—where see note,—referred back to the great Source of our spiritual birth, ch. ii. 29, and our likeness to Him insisted on)<b> is righteous.</b><br><br> This verse has absolutely nothing to do with the sense which the Roman-Catholic expositors have endeavoured to extract from it, that good works make us righteous before God. This is altogether to invert the proposition of the Apostle, who is reasoning, not from the fact of doing good works to the conclusion that a man is righteous, but from the hypothesis of a man’s being a child of God, born of Him and like Him, to the necessity of his purifying himself and doing righteousness. And in doing this, he ascribes the<i> doing righteousness</i> to its source, and the<i> doing sin</i> to its source: the one man is of God, the other is of the devil. As Luther well says, “Good works of piety do not make a good pious man, but a good pious man does good pious works.... Fruits grow from the tree, not the tree from fruits.”
