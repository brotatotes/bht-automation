<b> 8.</b>]<i> Contrast to ver. 7</i>. He that doeth sin is of the devil (notice first “<i>he that</i><b> doeth</b> [not, as the A.V. most unfortunately, ‘committeth”) sin,” as indicative not s0 much of individual acts as of a state, corresponding to<i> “he that doeth righteousness.”</i> And then the words, is of the<b> devil</b>, must not be rationalized away, as is done by those who deny the personal existence of the devil. It is the distinct opposite correlative of “is of God” [ver. 10, &c.], and implies a personal root and agency, just as much as that other does. But again, it does not imply any physical dualism on the part of the Apostle, “The devil made no one, begat no one, created no one,” says Augustine here; “but he who imitates the devil, as if born of him, becomes a son of the devil, by imitation, not by birth. All sinners are born of the devil, in so far as they are sinners. Adam was made by God: but when he consented to the devil, he was born of the devil, and begat all such as he himself was.” But be it observed, that we have here no such expression as<i> “hath been begotten of the devil,”</i> but only,<i> is</i> of the devil. In the case of the children of God, there is a definite time, known to Him, when they passed from death unto life [ch. ii. 29; iii, 14; v. 11; John i. 12; iii. 3 ff.; v. 24, &c.]: from which their new life unto God dates: but there is no such point in the life of those who are the children of the devil; no regeneration from beneath corresponding to that from above: the natural life of men is not changed hy seed of the devil as it is by seed of God. Rather may we say, that in those who are of the devil this latter change has never taken place. Since sin has come to reign in the world by man’s sin, our natural birth, which is properly and essentially a birth from God, a creation by the eternal Word, has become a birth from the devil: so that it is, as Bengel expresses it, “a, corruption, not a generation:” and there is no trace of a physical dualism in St. John’s doctrine: nay, the idea is at once precluded by the fact, that according to the Apostle [John i. 12] those who are children of God have become so from having been children of the devil):<b> because the devil sinneth from the beginning</b> ( ‘sinned in the beginning, and has never ceased to sin since.’ But the question meets us, what is<b> from the beginning?</b> Bede and others understand it of the beginning of all creation. Many Commentators, to avoid all chance of dualism, make it mean not from the time of his creation, but from that of his fall, understanding it of the beginning<i> of our world</i>. But again, others suppose the term to mark the beginning of the devil’s own apostacy: so Bengel, &c. And lastly, others again take it to mean, “from the time when any began to sin.” And this seems, when we compare John viii. 44, to be the true interpretation. He has ever been the depositary, as it were, of the thought and the life of sin: the tempter to sin: the fountain out of which sin has come, as God is the fountain out of which has come righteousness. See on this subject, my Sermons on Divine Love, Serm. v. pp. 68 ff, “the First Sinner”).<b> To this end was the Son of God manifested</b> (viz. in His incarnation, pregnant with all its consequences),<b> that He might destroy</b> (do away, break up, pull down: the word is used of a building, or a law, or an organized whole)<b> the works of the devil</b> (what are these? Clearly, in the first place, works whereof the devil is the<i> author</i>: not merely<i> devilish works</i>. And then, are we to include in the list not only sins, which manifestly belong to it, but also the consequences of sin—pain, sorrow, death? The<i> fact</i> would be true if we did: for Christ hath abolished death [2 Tim. i. 10]. But the context seems to require that we should at all events keep death and the results of sin in the background, as no mention is made of them here, and sinful works are clearly in the Apostle’s mind. These works the whole<i> manifestation</i> of Christ. went directly to nullify: more especially His Death, in which His power over Satan reached its highest point,—the bruising of His heel, in which He bruised the Enemy’s head:—for it was in that, that He won for us that acceptance which is sealed by His glorification, and in virtue of which the Holy Spirit is given us, of whose work in us it is said that we<i> “by the Spirit mortify (put to death) the deeds of the body.”</i> Rom. viii. 13).<br><br> Before leaving this important passage, I must quote Düsterdieck’s concluding remarks. “The difference between the older and more modern expositors lies in this, that the former are more anxious to moderate the details of the Apostle’s sentiment, and to tone down his assertion. to the actual life of Christians, while the moderns recognize the full precision of the text as it stands, but then remind us that the ideal truth of the principle announced by St. John continually, so to speak, floats above the actual life of believers as their role and aim, and that, in so far, the Apostle’s saying finds in such actual life only a relative fulfilment. None however of all the expositors, who in any way has recognized the ideal character of St. John’s view, has overlooked the fact, that even in the actual life of all that are born of God there is something which in fall verity answers to the ideal words, ‘they cannot sin,’ The children of God, in whom the divine seed of their eternal life abides, have, in reality, a holy privilege,—they sin not, and they cannot sin, just in proportion as the new divine life, unconditionally opposed to all sin, and manifesting itself in godlike righteousness, is present and abides in them. Expositors of all theological tendencies, in all times, point to this, that the new life of believers, veritably begotten by regeneration from God, is simply incompatible with sin;—the life which essentially alienates the spirit from all sin, fills it with an irreconcilable hate against every sin, and urges it to an unceasing conflict against all unrighteousness. Luther excellently says, that a child of God in this conflict receives indeed wounds daily, but never throws away his arms or makes peace with his deadly foe. Sin is ever active, but no longer dominant: the normal direction of life’s energies in the believer is against sin, is an absence of sin, a no-will-to-sin and a no-power-to-sin. He that is born of God has become, from being a servant of sin, a servant of righteousness: according to the divine seed remaining in him, or, as St. Paul says, according to the inner man [Rom. vii. 15 ff.], he will, and he can work only that which is like God,—righteousness, though the flesh, not yet fully mortified, rebels and sins: so that even in and by the power of the new life sin must be ever confessed, forgiveness received [ch. i. 8 ff.], the temptation of the evil one avoided and overcome [v. 18], and self-purification and sanctification carried on”).
