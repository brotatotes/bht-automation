<b> 1.</b>]<b> Beloved</b> (so ver. 7, and ch. iii. 2, 21, marking a transition to a subject on which the Apostle affectionately bespeaks their earnest attention),<b> believe not every spirit</b> (this expression, as also,<i> “the spirits,”</i> indicating plurality of spirits, we to be explained by the fact that both the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error speak by the spirits of men who are their organs. So we have, in reference to prophecy, 1 Cor. xiv. 32,<i> “The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.”</i> By the nature of the testimony of the human spirits, we shall know whether they are of God or not; whether they are organs of the<i> spirit of truth</i>, or of the<i> spirit of error</i>. It will be observed that this interpretation. of<i> “every spirit,”</i> and the Apostle’s way of speaking, rest on the assumption of there being One Spirit of Truth, from God, and one spirit of error, from the world; as opposed to all rationalizing interpretations, and also to all figurative understanding of the word. It is not the men themselves, but their spirits as the vehicles of God’s Spirit or the spirit of antichrist, that are in question), but try the spirits (this<i> trying</i> is enjoined not on<i> the church by her prelates</i>, as the Roman-Catholic expositors, but on all believers, as even some of them reluctantly admit: and the test is one of plain matter of fact, of which any one can be judge. The Church by her rulers is the authoritative assertor of the result of this<i> trial</i> in the shape of official adoption or rejection, but only as moved by her component faithful members, according to whose sense those her formularies are drawn, of which her authorities are the exponents)<b> whether they are of God</b> (bear the character of an origin from Him):<b> because</b> (ground for the necessity of this trial)<b> many false-prophets</b> (called “many anti-christs,” ch. ii, 18: prophets, not as foretelling future things, but as the mouthpieces of the spirit which inspires them. Compare 2 Pet. ii. 1, where the New Test. false teachers are called<i> “false teachers,”</i> and compared to the Old Test. “false prophets”)<b> are gone forth</b> (viz, from him who sent them: even as Jesus Himself is said, John viii. 42, xiii, 8, xvi. 27, 28, to have<i> come forth</i> from God. Or we may take it as in ch, ii. 19,<i> went out from</i><i> us,</i>—from the Church: but the other is more likely)<b> into the world</b> (compare John xvi. 38, which tends to fix the meaning of the words<i> “are gone forth”</i> above).
