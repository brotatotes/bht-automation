Strictly parallel with the latter part of ch. iii, 16, where the same ethical inference is drawn with regard to the example of Christ Himself.<b> Beloved</b> (the Apostle’s usual introduction of a fervent and solemn address, vv. 1, 7, al.),<b> if</b> (this<b> if</b> with an indicative, stating a fact, is very difficult to give exactly in English. It is not on the one hand any expression on uncertainty: but neither on the other is it exactly equivalent to<i> “since,”</i> or<i> “seeing that.”</i> We may call it a certainty put in the shape of a doubt, that the hearer’s mind may grasp the certainty for itself, not take it from the speaker. “If [it be true that]...” is perhaps the nearest English filling up of the sense)<b> God so loved us</b> (<i>so</i> namely as detailed in ver. 10, which, and which alone, is pointed at),<b> we also ought to love one another</b> (the<b> also</b> does not belong to the<b> ought</b>, but purely to the<b> we</b>,— “we, on our side.” But on whnt does the obligation, asserted in<b> we ought</b>, rest? Clearly, on that relation to God and one another implied by being children of God, which runs through all this section of the Epistle. If we are of God, that love which is in Him, and which He is, will be in us, will make us like Him, causing us to love those who are begotten of Him, ch, v. 1, 2. And of this love, our apprehension of His Love to us will be the motive and the measure).
