<p><strong> 11</strong> .] <em> Application to ourselves of this example</em> , as a motive to brotherly love. Strictly parallel with the latter part of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:16">1 John 3:16</span> , where the same ethical inference is drawn with regard to the example of Christ Himself. <strong> Beloved</strong> (the Apostle’s usual introduction of a fervent and solemn address, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:7">1 John 4:7</span> , al.), <strong> if</strong> (this <strong> εἰ</strong> with an indicative is very difficult to give exactly in English. It is not on the one hand any expression of uncertainty: but neither on the other is it = “ <em> since</em> ,” or “ <em> seeing that</em> .” We may call it a certainty put in the shape of a doubt, that the hearer’s mind may grasp the certainty for itself, not take it from the speaker. “ <strong> If</strong> (it be true that) …” is perhaps the nearest English filling up of the sense) <strong> God so loved us</strong> ( <em> so</em> namely as detailed in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:10">1 John 4:10</span> , which and which alone, by the catch-word ἠγάπησεν in the aorist, is pointed at), <strong> we also ought to love one another</strong> (the <strong> καί</strong> does not belong to the <strong> ὀφείλομεν</strong> , but purely to the ἡμεῖς , “we, on our side.” But on what does the obligation, asserted in ὀφείλομεν , rest? Clearly, on that relation to God and one another implied by being children of God, ἐκ θεοῦ γεγεννῆσθαι , which runs through all this section of the Epistle. If we are of God, that love which is in Him, and which He is, will be in us, will make us like Him, causing us to love those who are begotten of Him, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1-2">1 John 5:1-2</span> . And of this love, our apprehension of His Love to us will be the motive and the measure).</p>
