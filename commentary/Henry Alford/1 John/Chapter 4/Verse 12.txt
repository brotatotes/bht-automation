<b> 12.</b>]<b> God hath no one ever beheld</b> (what is the connexion of these words, so suddenly and startlingly introduced? It is evident that ver. 12 is connected with ver. 11, by the words<i> “if we love one another,”</i> taking up again<i> “we ought to love one another.”</i> But it is also evident that it is connected with ver. 13 by the words<i> “abideth in us,”</i>&c. And it is further plain, that these words,<b> God hath no one ever beheld</b>, must have some close reference to<i> loving one</i><i> another</i>, seeing that they stand between those words in ver. 11, and the resumption of them in ver. 12.<br><br> Now on examining ver. 11, we find an unexpected substitution,<i> “if God so loved us, we also ought to love</i> (not<i> God</i>, but)<b> one another</b>.” Why so? Here, ver. 20 will guide us to an answer, if rightly used. Not, because we<i> cannot</i> love God whom we have not seen: but because the exponents of God, whom we have not seen, are our brethren, whom we do see. And the Apostle, in substituting<i> “one another,”</i> does not for a moment drop or set aside the higher,<i> “God,”</i> but in fact leads up to it, by putting its lower and visible objects before us. And then ver. 12 comes in as an explanation, an apology as it were, for this substitution, in the following manner:<i> Love</i><b> one another</b>, I say: for the love to God, which is our duty, is love towards one whom we have never seen, and cannot exist in us [as ver. 20] unless by and with its lower degrees as manifested towards our brethren whom we have seen. By our love to them are we to know, how far we have love to Him: if that be present, He dwelleth in us, and<i> “the love of Him is perfected in us.”</i> And thus [see below] the way is prepared for vv. 15, 16, which take up and bring to a conclusion the reasoning):<b> if we love one another, God abideth in us</b> (for the reason already stated in ver. 8, and restated in immediate connexion with this very matter in ver. 16, that God is Love, and every one that loveth is born of God, knows God, abides in God and God in him),<b> and</b> (simply the copula)<b> the love of Him</b> (as in ch. ii. 5, where we had the same expression, our<i> love to Him</i>, not, as some explain it,<i> His love to us</i>. This is evident, not merely from ii. 5, but from the context here: see it explained above, and remember that it is our love to God which is here the subject, as evinced by our love to our brethren. This is further shewn by the recurrence of the same expression in ver. 17,<i> “Herein is love perfected with us,”</i> and ver. 18,<i> “he that feareth is not made perfect in love.”</i> And so the majority of Commentators) is<b> perfected</b> (see note ch. ii. 5. Here, as there, it signifies, has reached its full maturity: the<i> loving one another</i> being the token and measure of it)<b> in us</b> (keep the primary and obvious sense, “<i>in us</i>,” “within us,” as in ch. ii. 5).
