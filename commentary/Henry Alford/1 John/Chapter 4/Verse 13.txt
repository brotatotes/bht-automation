In the former verse, the  fact of His abiding in us was assured to us, if we love one another. Of this fact, when thus loving, we need a token. Him we cannot see: has He given us any testimony of His presence in us? He has given us such a testimony, in making us partakers of His Holy Spirit. This fact it is to which the Apostle here calls our attention, as proving not the external fact of the sending of the Son ( 1Jn 4:14 ), but one within ourselves the indwelling of God in us, and our abiding in Him. It is obvious that all inferences from the expression  ἐκ τοῦ πν . against the personality of the Holy Ghost are quite beside the purpose: compare Act 2:17 with Joel 2:28 (Heb. and E. V.). We each have the indwelling of one and the same personal Spirit, but each according to our measure, 1 Corinthians 12:4 ; 1 Corinthians 12:11 . One only had the Spirit without measure, in all His fulness: even Christ; John 3:34 .
