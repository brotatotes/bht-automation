<b> 18.</b>] Confidence in (or as understood, as to) that terrible day presupposes the absence of fear: and this casting out of fear is the very work of love, which in its perfect state cannot coexist with fear.—<b>Fear</b> (abstract and general)<b> existeth not in love</b> (abstract and general also, as in ver. 17: not<i> “God’s lore to us;”</i> nor<i> “brotherly love”</i>),<b> nay perfect</b> (see on ver. 17)<b> love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment</b> (see below):<b> but he that feareth hath not been perfected in</b> [<b>his</b>]<b> love.</b> The points here to be noticed are,<br><br> 1) the emphatic<b> existeth not</b>, which is better rendered as above, than “there is no fear in love,” in order to keep<b> fear</b>, which is the subject in the Greek, also the subject in. the English:<br><br> 2)<b> nay</b>, or<i> “but:”</i> which is not here the mere adversative after a negative clause, in which case it would refer to something in which fear<i> is</i>, e.g. “<i>fear existeth not in love, but existeth in hatred:</i>” but it is the stronger adversative, implying “nay far otherwise:” so far from it, that...<br><br> 3) the argument, which is,<i> a</i>) that nothing having torment can consist with perfect love:<i> b</i>) that, fear is in us by nature, and needs<i> casting out</i> in order to its absence.<br><br> 4) the meaning of hath torment. Does<i> torment</i> mean<i> merely</i> pain, or pain as the result of<i> punishment</i>? This last is certainly the sense, both from the usage of the word, and from the context, in which the day of judgment is before us. Fear, by anticipating punishment, has it even now; bears about a foretaste of it and so partakes of it.<br><br> 5) the last clause, “<i>he that feareth is not made perfect in love,</i>” is intimately connected with what follows [see on ver. 14] as well as with what went before. The<b> and</b> [in the original,<b> but</b>: see rendering above] is adversative to the whole preceding sentence, and mainly to the idea of perfect love therein expressed.<br><br> As regards the absence of fear from the love of the Christian believer, it has been well observed by Œumenius, that there are two kinds of godly fear, one which afflicts men with a sense of their evil deeds and dread of God’s anger, and which is not abiding: and the other, of which it is said, “The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever,” Ps. xix. and which is free from this kind of terror. And Bengel says in his brief pointed manner, “The condition of men is various: without fear and love alike: with fear and without love: with fear and love: without fear and with love.”
