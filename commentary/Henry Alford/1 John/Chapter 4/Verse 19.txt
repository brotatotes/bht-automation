<b> 19.</b>] I am sorry to be obliged here to differ from the best modern Commentators, and some of the older ones, in holding firmly that<b> we love</b>, indicative, is right, and not “<i>let us love,</i>” imperative [either of which would satisfy the original word]. This I do not merely on account of the expressed and emphatic<b> we</b>, though that would be a strong point in the absence of a stronger, but on account of the context, which appears to me to be broken by the imperative. He that feareth is not perfect in love. Our love [abstract, not specified whether to God or our brother] is brought about by, conditioned by, depends upon, His love to us first; it is only a sense off that which can bring about our love: and if so, then from the very nature of things it is void of terror, and full of confidence, as springing out of a sense of His love to us. Nor only so: our being new begotten in love is not only the effect of<i> a sense of</i> His past love, but is the effect of that love itself:<b> We</b> (emphatic—one side of the antithesis)<b> love</b> (most Commentators supply “<i>Him</i>” or “<i>one another</i>,” but unnecessarily. It is of all love that he is speaking; of love in its root and ideal),<b> because He</b> (God: see the parallel, ver. 10)<b> first loved us</b> (viz. in the sending of His Son).
