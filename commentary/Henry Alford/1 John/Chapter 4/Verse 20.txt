<b> 20.</b>] The connexion is most close: and the error great of those who have made a new section begin here. This<i> love</i> is sal, necessarily manifested in<i> both</i> of great departments of its exercise. Love, living and working in the heart as a principle, will fix first upon objects at hand and seen: those objects being natural objects for it to fix on, How then can a man love God, the highest object of love, who is removed from his sight, and at the ame time refuse to love his brother, bearing the mark of a child of God, before his eyes from day to day? Put in a brief form, the argument, as connected with the last verse, is this: His love has begotten<i> us</i> anew in love: in this<i> us</i> are included our brethren, objects of our daily sight: if therefore we do not love them, we do not love Him.<b> If any say</b> ( “have said;” i.e. at any time: the saying once, rather than the habit, is the hypothesis),<b> I love God, and hate</b> (present tense, of habit)<b> his brother,</b><b> he is a liar: for</b> (here again the argument needs supplying from our common sense, which tells us that sight is an incentive towards love)<b> he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen</b> (perfect tense, implying,—and continues to feel the influence of that sight. We do not say “<b>I</b> have seen him” of the dead, but of the living only),<b> cannot love God whom he hath not seen</b> (At. John does not say that there is no love without sight; nor that we love all we see better than any thing we do not see: his argument rests on a deeper and truer position: viz, on that assumed in the term<b> his brother</b>, which carries with it the consideration that he of whom it is said is begotten of God. Both terms,<b> his brother</b>, and<b> God</b>, are used within the limits of the Christian life, of which that is true, which is unfolded ch. v. 1, that this<i> brother</i>, as begotten of God, is a necessary object of love to one that loves Him that begat him.<i> Here</i>, a lower step of the same argument is taken; but without this eat truth, lying beneath the word<i> brother</i>, it wonld carry no conviction with it).
