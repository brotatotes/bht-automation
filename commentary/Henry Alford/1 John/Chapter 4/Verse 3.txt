 3 b .] This has been already virtually explained on ch. 1 John 2:18 .  And this is the (  spirit ) (so nearly all the Commentators supply the ellipsis, and rightly. Episcopius, Valla, Zeger, the R.-Cath. Mayer, and Huther, render it, this is “proprium antichristi.” But this would not surely be τὸ τοῦ ἀντιχρίστου , but τοῦ ἀντιχρίστου only. None of the passages cited by Huther touch the point, Matthew 21:21 , τὸ τῆς συκῆς , “this of the fig-tree;” 1 Corinthians 10:24 , τὸ τοῦ ἑτέρου , “that which belongs to his brother;” 2 Peter 2:22 , τὸ τῆς παροιμίας , “that of the proverb;” James 4:14 , τὸ τῆς σὔριον , “the event of to-morrow.” In every one of these the genitive belongs to the subject: but Huther would attach it to the predicate, “hoc est proprium antichristi,” in which case I cannot see how the article could be there. Besides, the ὃ ἀκηκόατε ὅτι ἔρχεται would be awkwardly said as applied merely to an abstract fact, the τὸ μὴ ὁμολογεῖν τὸν Ἰησοῦν , to which it must be referred if τοῦτο is subject, and the genitive imports  proprium antichristi )  of antichrist (of) which ye have heard (the reference is not to ch. 1 John 2:18 ( ἠκούσατε ), but to the course of their Christian instruction in which this had been taught them)  that it cometh (the present used as so often of that which is a thing fixed and determined, without any reference to time: “  that it should come ” of the E. V. is in sense very good, but does not quite suit the perf. ἀκηκόατε , which seems grammatically in English to require “that it shall come;” “  that it must come ” would perhaps be better),  and now it is (not,  now is : this  ἐστίν is not dependent on the preceding ὅτι , but introduces a fresh assertion)  in the world already (viz., in the person of these ψευδοπροφῆται , who are its organs).
