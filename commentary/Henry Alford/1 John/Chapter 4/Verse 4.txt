<b> 4.</b>]<b> Ye</b> (so we had<b> ye</b>, ch. ii. 24, 27: his readers clearly and sharply set against the antichristian teachers)<b> are of God, little children</b> (thus he ever speaks to his readers, as being children of God, see ch. iii. 1 ff., 13 ff., 19, 24, &c.),<b> and have overcome</b> (there need not be any evading or softening of this perfect: see ch. ii, 14. It is faith outrunning sight: the victory is certain in Him who said, “<i>I have overcome the world,</i>” John xvi. end. The ground of this assurance follows)<b> them</b> (the false prophets, thus identified with antichrist),<b> because greater is He</b> [<b>that is</b>]<b> in you than he</b> [<b>that is</b>]<b> in the world.</b><br><br><b> He</b> [that is]<b> in you</b> is most naturally understood of GOD, seeing that<i> “ye are of God”</i> preceded; for he who is<i> “of God”</i> has God dwelling in him. Though, as Düsterdieck remarks, it matters not much whether we take it thus, or of the indwelling of God by His Spirit, or of the life of Christ in believers.<br><br><b> he</b> [that is]<b> in the world</b> is the devil, the prince of this world. Having said this, he proceeds in the next verse to identify these false prophets with the<i> world</i> of which he has spoken.
