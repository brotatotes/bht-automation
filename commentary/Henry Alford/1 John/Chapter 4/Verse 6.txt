<b> 6.</b>]<i> contrast</i>.<b> We</b> (emphatic, as opposed to them; but who are meant? The Apostles and their companions in the ministry, or all believers? Or again, all teachers of God’s truth, the Apostles included? It is hardly likely that the wider meaning has place here, seeing that 1) he has before said<i> “ye are of God,”</i> and 2) he is here opposing one set of<i> teachers</i> to another. On the other hand, it is not likely that he should confine what is said to the Apostles only: such as are mentioned with praise in 3 John 5–8 would surely be included)<b> are of God</b> (see above):<b> he that knoweth</b> (apprehendeth: hath any faculty for the knowledge of. The Apostle sets<b> him that knoweth God</b> in the place of<i> him that is of God</i>, as belonging more immediately to the matter in hand, the hearing, and receiving more knowledge. This<i> knowing God</i>, the apprehension and recognition of God, is the peculiar property of God’s children, not any natural faculty in which one unrenewed man differs from another)<b> God heareth us: he who is not of God doth not hear us</b> (here we must remember carefully, what the context is, and what its purpose. The Apostle is giving a test to distinguish, not the children of God from those who are not children of God, but the spirit of truth from the spirit of error, as is clear from the words following. And this he does by saying that in the case of the teachers of the truth, they are heard and received by those who apprehend God, but refused by those who are not of God. It is evident then that these two terms here,<i> “he that knoweth God,”</i> and<i> “he that is not of God,”</i> represent two patent, matters of fuet,—two classes open and patent to all: one of them identical with the<i> world</i> above: the other consisting of those of whom it is said above,<i> “Ye know the Father”</i>...<i> “ye know Him that is from the beginning,”</i> ch, ii. 13, 14. How these two classes are what they are, it is, not the purpose of this passage to set forth, nor need we here enquire: we have elsewhere tests to distinguish them, ch. iii. 9, 10, and have there gone into that other question. We have a striking parallel, in fact the key to these words, in the saying of our Lord to Pilate, John xviii. 37).<b> From this</b> (viz., not the whole foregoing train of circumstances; nor, those tests proposed in vv. 2, 3: but the facts set forth in vv, 5, 6: the reception of the false teachers by the world: the reception of the true teachers by those that apprehend God, and their rejection by those who are not of God. ‘The same point is touched hy our Lord in John x. 8,<i> “but the sheep did not hear them”</i>)<b> we know</b> (in this unemphatic first person the Apostle includes his readers: we, all God’s children.<b> know,</b><i> distinguish, recognize,</i> as so often)<b> the Spirit of truth</b> (the Spirit that cometh of God and teacheth truth)<b> and the spirit of error</b> (the spirit that cometh of the devil, teaching lies and seducing men into error see ch. i, 8, ii, 26).
