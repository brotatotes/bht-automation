<b> 8.</b>] (<i>Contrast</i>, but with some remarkable variations)<b> he that loveth not</b> (general, as before: no object: he that hath not love in him)<b> hath never known God</b> (hath not once known: has never had in him even the beginnings of knowledge of God. So that the past tense makes a far stronger contrast than the present,<i> “knoweth not,”</i> would. That is excluded, and much more);<b> because</b> (reason why he who loveth not. can never have known God)<b> God is love</b> (love is the very essence, not merely an attribute, of God. It is co-essential with Him: He is all love, love is all of Him: he who has not love, has not God.<br><br> It is not the place here to enter on the theological import of this weighty and wonderful sentence. It will be found set forth in the first of my Sermons on Divine Love, Quebec Chapel Sermons, vol. iii,<br><br> But it may be necessary to put in a caution against all inadequate and shallow explanations of the saying: such as that of Grotius (after Socirus), “God is<i> full of love</i>:” Benson, “God is the most benevolent of all beings: full of love to all His creatures:” Whitby, “The Apostle intends not to express what God is in his essence... but what He is in demonstration of Himself, shewing great philanthropy to men:” Hammond, “God is made up of love and kindness to mankind:” Calvin, “This it is which is His nature, to love men:... he is not speaking of God’s essence, but merely teaching, what He is felt to be by us,”&c. &c. In all these,—in the two last by supplying an object,<i> “men,”</i> which is not in the sacred text, the whole force of the axiom as it stands in the Apostle’s argument is lost. Unless be is speaking of the essential being of God, of what relevance is it, to say that he that loveth not never knew God, because “God is love?” Put for these last words, “God is loving,” and we get at once a fallacy: He that loveth not never knew what love is: God is loving: but what would follow? that in as far as God is loving, he never knew Him: but he may have known Him in as far as He is just, or powerful. But take the proposition,<b> God is love</b>, of God’s essential being,—as a strict definition of God, and the argumentation will be strict: He that loveth not never knew love: God is love [the terms are co-essential and co-extensive]: therefore he who loveth uot never knew God).<br><br> The two emphatic words in the sentence are<b> only-begotten</b> and<b> live</b>. This was the proof, that SUCH a son of God was sent, that we might LIVE).
