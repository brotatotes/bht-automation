 1 6 .]  Warning against, and criteria whereby to distinguish, false teaching . This passage takes up again, with reference to this portion of the Epistle, the similar warning given in the former portion, ch. 1 John 2:18 ff. It is intimately connected with what has immediately preceded. By brotherly love we are to know that we are of the truth, ch. 1 John 3:19 , and the token that He abideth in us is to be the Spirit which He gave us. This Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, it becomes then all-important for us to be able to distinguish, and not to be led astray by any false spirits pretending to his character and office. Such false spirits there are, which are not of God, but of the world, and which make up that spirit of antichrist, of which prophecy had already spoken.
