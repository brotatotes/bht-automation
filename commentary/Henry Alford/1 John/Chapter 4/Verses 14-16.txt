 14, 15, 16 .] The connexion seems to be this: the inward evidence of God’s abiding in us and we in Him, is, the gift of His Spirit. But this is not the only evidence nor the only test which we have. This internal evidence is accompanied by, nay, is itself made possible (see 1Jn 4:19 ) by, our recognition of the Father’s love in sending His Son as our Saviour: which last is a fact, testified by human evidence. This recognition of God’s love is a condition of abiding in Him and He in us: in a word, is the μένειν ἐν τῇ ἀλάπῃ , which is equivalent to abiding in Him.  And we (this  ἡμεῖς brings up in sharp relief the apostolic body whom Christ appointed His witnesses, John 15:27 , Acts 1:8 . The assertion is of the same kind as that in ch. 1Jn 1:1 )  have beheld (  τεθεάμεθα is joined closely to μαρτυροῦμεν , and in common with it belongs to the ὅτι following. No object must be supplied after it, as “Deum ejusque virtutes imprimis caritatem.” Piscator. The construction of θεᾶσθαι with ὅτι is found Joh 6:5 )  and do testify that the Father hath sent (not merely to the historical fact as a thing past, but to its abiding influence as implied by σωτῆρα τ . κόσμου below: q. d., that the Father sent the Son, and that the Son is the Saviour of the world)  the Son (better here than “  His Son:” ὁ πατήρ , τὸν υἱόν , are  termini theologici )  as Saviour of the world (  σωτῆρα , anarthrous, is not appositive but predicatory = in meaning “to save the world,” but one degree removed back from it in telic force: σώζειν τὸν κόσμον would express more strongly the ultimate view of His mission; σωτῆρα τοῦ κόσμου gives the mediate aim, leaving it possible that another may be yet behind.  τοῦ κόσμου here, as in ch. 1 John 2:2 , John 3:16 , in its widest sense: no evasion of this sense, such as the “electorum in omnibus populis” of Piscator and Aretius, is to be endured).
