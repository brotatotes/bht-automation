 7 21 .] The Apostle again takes up his exhortations to brotherly love, but this time in nearer and deeper connexion with our birth from God, and knowledge of Him who is Himself Love, 1 John 4:7-8 . This last fact he proves by what God has done for us in and by His Son, 1 John 4:9-16 ; and establishes the necessary connexion between love to God and love to man, 1 John 4:17-21 .
	The passage is in connexion with what went before, but by links at first sight not very apparent. The great theme of the whole was enounced ch. 1 John 2:29 . The consideration of that has passed into the consideration of that δικαιοσύνη in its highest and purest form of love, which has been recommended, and grounded on His love to us, in ch. 1 John 3:11-18 , where the testimony of our hearts came in, and was explained the great test of His presence in us being the gift of His Spirit, ch. 3 ult. Then from the necessity of distinguishing and being sure of that His Spirit, have been inserted the foregoing tests and cautions respecting truth and error. And now he returns to the main subject. The γινώσκει τὸν θεόν , ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐστιν and γεγέννηται , the taking up again of God’s love to us in Christ at 1Jn 4:9 from ch. 1 John 3:16 , the reiteration of the testimony of the Spirit in 1 John 4:13 , all serve to shew that we are reading no collection of spiritual apophthegms, but a close and connected argument, though not in an ordinary style.
