The combination of anarthrous predicatory clauses only takes place when the whole will bear running together into one idea, as τοῖς κυρίοις - κατὰ - σάρκα ) would require the article ἡ ἐν ἡμῖν . Many Commentators have thus wrongly connected it, and in consequence have been compelled to distort <strong> ἐν</strong> into <strong> εἰς</strong> : so Luther, Seb.-Schmidt, Spener, Beza, Socinus, Schlichting, Episcop., Grot., Benson, Neander, al. Bengel has fallen into the former fault, though not into the latter: “amor Dei qui nunc <em> in nobis</em> est, per omnem experientiam spiritualem.” This is upheld also by Sander, who defends it by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:16">Galatians 1:16</span> , where a totally different matter is treated of.
