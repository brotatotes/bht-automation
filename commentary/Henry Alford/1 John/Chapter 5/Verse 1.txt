<b> CHAP. V. 1.</b>] And who is our brother? and why does this name carry with it such an obligation to love? These questions, in closest connexion with the last verse, the Apostle answers in this,<b> Every one that believeth that Jesus is the Christ hath been begotten of God</b> (to whom do these words apply? from what follows, in the verb<b> hath been</b> [or,<b> is</b>]<b> begotten</b> is taken up by<b> him that is begotten</b>, to the brother whom we are to love as a necessary accompaniment of our loving God. But most Commentators assume that it is of<i> ourselves</i> that this is said:<i> our</i> birth of God depends on and is in closest union with our faith, ch. iii. 23. Then the connexion between this and the following clause must be made by filling up an ellipsis, “and if begotten of God we love God.” But this is far-fetched; and, as has been above shewn implicitly, alien from the context, the object of which is to point out who those are whom we are bound to love, if we love God. Then having made this predication of all the children of God,<i> “every one that believeth, &c.,”</i> he, as so frequently, takes it up again below, ver. 4, with ‘a more general reference, and dwells on our faith as the principle which overcomes the world: see there):<b> and every one who loveth him that begat</b> (these words take up again the former,<i> “if any say, I love God,”</i> ch. iv. 20),<b> loveth also him that is begotten of him</b> (viz. the brother of whom the former clause spoke: not, as Augustine and others, Christ, the Son of God. As Calvin says, “Under this singular number he designates all the faithful. It is an argument drawn from the common order of nature”).
