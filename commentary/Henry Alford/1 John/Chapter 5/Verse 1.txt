 1 .] And who is our brother? and why does this name carry with it such an obligation to love? These questions, in closest connexion with the last verse, the Apostle answers in this.  Every one that believeth (not as Grot. “qui credere se ostendit:” it is the faith itself which is spoken of)  that Jesus is the Christ hath been begotten of God (to whom do these words apply? from what follows, in which the γεγέννηται is taken up by τὸν γεγεννημένον , to the brother whom we are to love as a necessary accompaniment of our loving God. But most Commentators, including Lücke, De Wette, Huther, Düsterd., assume that it is of  ourselves that this is said:  our birth of God depends on and is in closest union with our faith, ch. 1 John 3:23-24 . Then the connexion between this and the following clause must be made by filling up an ellipsis, “and if born of God we love God.” But this is far-fetched and, as has been above shewn implicitly, alien from the context, the object of which is to point out who those are whom we are bound to love if we love God. Then having made this predication of all the children of God, πᾶς ὁ πιστ . κ . τ . λ ., he, as so frequently, takes it up again below, 1 John 5:4 , with a more general reference, and dwells on our faith as the principle which overcomes the world: see there):  and every one who loveth him that begot (these words take up again the ἐάν τις εἴπῃ ὅτι ἀγαπῶ τὸν θεόν , of ch. 1Jn 4:20 ),  loveth also him that is begotten of him (viz. the brother of whom the former clause spoke: not, as Aug [74] , Hil [75] , Corn.-a-lap., al., Christ, the Son of God. As Calvin, “sub numero singulari omnes fideles designat. Est enim argumentum ex communi naturæ ordine sumptum”).
