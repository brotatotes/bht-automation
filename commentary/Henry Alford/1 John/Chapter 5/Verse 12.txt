<b> 12.</b>]<i> Conclusion of the whole argument</i> from ver. 6: dependent on the lust clause of ver. 11, and carrying it on a step further, even to the absolute identity as matter of possession for the believer, of the Son of God, and eternal life.<b> He that hath the Son, hath the life: he that hath not the Son of God, the life hath he not.</b> First notice the diction and arrangement, on which Bengel has well remarked, “The verse has two members: in the former ‘<i>of</i><i> God</i>’ is not added, for the faithful know the Son: in the other, it is added, that unbelievers may know how great a thing they lose.”<br><br> Next, the<b> having the Son</b> must not be explained away, with Grotius, by “<i>keeping the words which the Father committed to the Son,</i>” nor<b> having</b> life, with the same, by “<i>having a certain right to eternal life.</i>” The<i> having the Son</i> is the possession of Christ by faith, testified by the Spirit, the water, and the blood: and the<i> having the life</i> is the actually possessing it, not indeed in its most glorious development, but in all its reality and vitality.<br><br> Thirdly, it must be remarked that the question as to whether eternal salvation is altogether confined to those who in the fullest sense have the Son [to the exclusion, e.g., of those who have never heard of Him], does not belong here, but must be entertained on other grounds, See note on 1 Pet. iii. 19.
