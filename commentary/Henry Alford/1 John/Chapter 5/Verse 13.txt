<b> 13.</b>] This verse seems, as John xx. 30 f,, like an anticipatory close of the Epistle: and its terms appear to correspond to those used in ch. i. 4. This view is far more probable, than that it should refer only to what has occurred since ver. 6, as ch. ii. 26 to ver. 18 ff. there: or only to vv. 11, 12. Still less likely is it that the concluding portion of the Epistle<i> begins</i> with this verse, as some lve thought.<b> These things wrote I to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life,</b> [<b>to you</b>]<b> that believe in the name of the Son of God</b> (the two readings come, in the sense, to much the sane. If that in the A.V. be followed, then the words<i> “that ye may believe”</i> must be interpreted “that ye may continue to believe”).<br><br><b> Him</b> and<b> His will</b> must by all analogy be referred to the Father, not to the Son, by whom we have access to the Father. See especially ch. ii, 21, 22.<br><br> The truth that God hears all our prayers, has been explained on ch. iii, 22. The condition here attached, that the request be<b> according to His will</b>, is in fact limitation within the reality of the Christian life, i.e. in St. John’s way of speaking according to the true ideal. For God’s will is that to which our glorious Head himself submitted himself, and which rules the whole course of the Christian life for our good and His glory: and he who in prayer or otherwise tends against God’s will is thereby, and in so far, transgressing the bounds of his life in God: see James iv. 3. By the continual feeling of submission to His will, joined with continual increase in knowledge of that will, our prayers will be both chastened, and directed aright. If we knew His will thorough!and submitted to it heartily, it would be impossible for us to ask any thing, for the spirit or for the body, which He should not hear and perform. And it is this ideal state, as always, which the Apostle has in view. In this view he goes still further in the next verse).
