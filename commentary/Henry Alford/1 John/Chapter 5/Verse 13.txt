<b> 13.</b>] This verse seems, as John xx. 30 f,, like an anticipatory close of the Epistle: and its terms appear to correspond to those used in ch. i. 4. This view is far more probable, than that it should refer only to what has occurred since ver. 6, as ch. ii. 26 to ver. 18 ff. there: or only to vv. 11, 12. Still less likely is it that the concluding portion of the Epistle<i> begins</i> with this verse, as some lve thought.<b> These things wrote I to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life,</b> [<b>to you</b>]<b> that believe in the name of the Son of God</b> (the two readings come, in the sense, to much the sane. If that in the A.V. be followed, then the words<i> “that ye may believe”</i> must be interpreted “that ye may continue to believe”).
