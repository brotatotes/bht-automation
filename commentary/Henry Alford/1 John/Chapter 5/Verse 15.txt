<b> 15.</b>]<b> And if we know that He heareth us whatsoever we ask</b> (i. e. our every petition: the condition is omitted this time, as being supposed to be fulfilled),<b> we know that we have the petitions</b> (i. e. the things which form the subject of the petitions)<b> which we have asked from Him</b> (notice the present,<b> we have</b>, combined with the perfect,<b> we have asked.</b> The perfect reaches through all our past prayers to this moment. All these we<b> have</b>: not one of them is lost: He has heard, He has answered them all: we know that we have them in the truest sense, in possession).<br><br> Certainly this seems, reserving the question as to the nature of the sin, the right view of the words,<b> I say not</b>. By an express command in the other case, and then as express an exclusion of this case from that command, nothing short of an implied prohibition can be conveyed.<br><br> The second point here relates to the difference between<b> ask</b> and<b> make request</b>. The<i> Greek</i> word represented by the former is more of the petition<i> of the inferior</i>, as of the conquered, or of the guilty: that re-represented by the latter is more general, of the request<i> of the equal</i>, or of one who has a right. Our Lord never uses the former of His own requests to God, but always the latter. And this difference is of importance here. The<b> asking</b> for a sin not unto death is a humble and trusting petition in the direction of God’s will, and prompted by brotherly love: the other, the<b> making request</b> for a sin unto death, would be, it is implied, an act savouring of presumption—a prescribing to God, in a matter which lies out of the bounds of our brotherly yearning [for notice, the hypothesis that a man sees<i> a brother</i> sin a sin unto death is not adduced in words, because such a sinner would not truly be a brother, but thereby demonstrated never to have deserved that name: see ch. ii. 19], how He shall inflict and withhold His righteous judgments.<br><br> And these latter considerations bring us close to the question as to the nature of the sin unto death. It would be impossible to enumerate or even classify the opinions which have been given on the subject. Düsterdieck has devoted many pages to such a classification and discussion. I ean do no more than point out the canons of interpretation, and some of the principal divergencies. But before doing so, ver. 17 must come under consideration).
