<b> 17.</b>]<b> All unrighteousness is sin</b> (in the words<b> all unrighteousness</b> we have a reminiscence of ch. i. 9, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from<b> all unrighteousness</b>,” and also, but not so directly, of ch. iii, 4, which is virtually the converse proposition to this. Here the Apostle seems to say, in explanation of what he has just written, “SIN is a large word, comprehending all unrighteousness whatever: whether of God's children, or of aliens from Him.” The thoughts which have been brought into these words,—that<i> unrighteousness</i> is a mild word, meant to express that every slight trip of the good Christian fills under the category of sin, and so. there may be a sin not unto death,—or, on the other hand, that it is a strong word, as Grotius says, “he calls unrighteousness not every ignorance or sudden fall into sin, but sin committed either with deliberation, or with space given for deliberation,”—or thirdly, as Beza, that “all sins are so far equal, that even the least thought of the least sin deserves eternal death a thousand times over,” and “that all sins are of themselves deadly,”—are equally far from the meaning of the words, whose import is, as above, to account for there being a sin not unto death as well as a sin unto death);<b> and there is a sin not unto death</b> (not having death for its issue: within the limit of that<i> unrighteousness</i>, from all of which God cleanseth all those who confess their sins, ch. i. 9).
