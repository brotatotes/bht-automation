<b> 18.</b>]<b> We know that every one who is born of God, sinneth not</b> (see on ch. iii. 9, from which place our words are almost repeated. As explained there and in our summary of these verses, there is no real inconsistency with what has been just said. And that there is none, the second member of the verse shews):<b> but he that hath been born of God</b> (literally, he that<b> was born</b> of God. The perfect tense expresses more the enduring abidance of his heavenly birth, and fits better the<i> habitual</i> meaning of the words<b> sinneth not</b>: the mere past tense calling attention to the historical fact of his having been born of God, fits better the fact that the wicked one toucheth him not, that divine birth having severed his connexion with the prince of this world and of evil),<b> it keepeth him</b> ( “<i>it,</i>” viz. the divine birth, pointed at in the words<b> born of God</b>. It is this, and not the fact of his own watchfulness, which preserves him from the touch of the wicked one: as in ch. iii. 9, where the same is imported by “<i>his seed abideth in him.</i>” The rationalistic Commentators insist on the reading, “<i>he keepeth himself,</i>” as shewing, as Socinus, “that he himself does and contributes something:” and the orthodox Commentators have but a lame apology to offer. Düsterdieck compares “<i>purifieth himself,</i>” ch. iii. 3. But the reference there is wholly different—viz. to a gradual and earnest striving after an ideal model; whereas here the<b> keeping</b> must be, by the very nature of the case, so far complete, that the wicked one cannot approach: and whose self-guarding can ensure this even for a day? Compare John xvii. 15,<i> “that thou shouldest keep them from the evil,”</i> which is decisive),<b> and the wicked one</b> (Satan)<b> doth not touch him</b> (of course the words must not be understood as saying that he is not tried with<i> temptation</i> by the evil one: but imply that, as the Prince of this world had nothing in our blessed Lord, even so on His faithful ones who live by His life, the Tempter has no point d’ appui, by virtue of that their birth, by which they are as He is, “The malignant one approaches them,” says Bengel, “<i>as a fly the candle</i>,—but hurts them not, nor even touches them”).
