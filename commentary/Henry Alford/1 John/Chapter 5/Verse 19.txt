<b> 19.</b>]<i> Application</i> of that which is said ver. 18, to the Apostle and his readers: and that, in entire separation from the wicked one, the ruling spirit of this present world.<b> We know</b> (see summary above)<b> that we</b> (not emphatic. It is not the object now to bring out a contrast, but to reassert solemnly these great axioms of the Christian life)<b> are of God</b> (i. e. born of God: identifying us with those spoken of ver. 18),<b> and the whole world lieth in the wicked one</b> (this second member of the sentence does not depend on the preceding<i> that</i>, but like those of vv. 18, 20, is an independent proposition.<b> the wicked one</b>, not “<i>wickedness,</i>” as A.V.: the neuter sense can hardly stand after ch. ii, 13, 14, iii. 8, 10, 14 compared: iv. 4: John xvii. 14 f, and above all after the preceding verse here.

But there is no inconsistency whatever. Had not Christ become a propitiation for the sins of the whole world, were He not the Saviour of the whole world, none could ever come out of the world and believe on Him; but as it is, they who do believe on Him, come out and are separated from the world: so that our proposition here remains strictly true: the<i> world</i> is the negation of faith in Him, and as such lies in the wicked one, His adversary).
