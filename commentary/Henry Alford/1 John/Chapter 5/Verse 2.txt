<p><strong> 2</strong> .] And indeed so inseparable are the two, that as before, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:20">1 John 4:20</span> , our love to our brethren was made a sign and necessary condition of our love to God, so conversely, our love to God, ascertained by our keeping His commandments, is itself the measure of our love to the children of God. Either of the two being found to be present, the presence of the other follows. <strong> In this we know that we love the children of God</strong> ( <strong> τὰ τέκνα τοῦ θεοῦ</strong> takes up again τὸν γεγεννημένον ἐξ αὐτοῦ of the preceding verse) <strong> when</strong> (the indefiniteness in ὅταν is to be taken not within the limits of each case, “ <em> whensoever we</em> ,” but as belonging to the cases collectively, “in every case where”) <strong> we love God, and do His commandments</strong> (this adjunct is made, as the following verse shews, in order to introduce an equivalent to ἀγαπῶμεν τ . θεόν by which its presence may be judged. It will be seen from what has been said, that all the devices which have been used to extract from this verse a sense different from that which it really conveys, are wholly unneeded, nay, out of place. Such are those of some of the ancient versions: “per hoc cognoscimus quod diligimus <em> Deum</em> , si dileximus Eum et fecimus mandatum ejus,” æth: “per hoc cognoscimus <em> nos esse Dei filios</em> quum Deum dilexerimus,” &amp;c. arab: of Œc., who seems to be confused in his account, for after citing the words he says, καὶ δεῖγμα τῆς εἰς θεὸν ἀγάπης τὴν εἰς ἀδελφὸν ἀγάπην τίθεται : of Grotius, who says, “facilis fit connexio si trajectio fiat, qualem ego libenter facerem, si librum aliquem veterem haberem auctorem, ἐν τ . γινώσκ . ὅτι τ . θεὸν ἀγ ., ὅταν ἀγ . τὰ τέκνα αὐτοῦ κ . τ . ἐντολὰς αὐτ . τηρ :” that of anon. in Schulz, Konject. ub. d. N. T., who wanted to transpose ὅτι and ὅταν : that of Rosenmüller, who coolly says, “permutantur h. l. significationes particularum ὅτι et ὅταν , quod contextus necessario postulat”).</p>
