<b> 20.</b>] Yet another<b> we know:</b> and that in general, as summing up all, the certainty to us of the Son of God haying come, and g given us the knowledge of God, and of our being in Him: and the formal inclusion, in this one fact, of knowledge of the true God here, and life everlasting hereafter.<b> Moreover</b> (closes off and sums up all, This not ng seen, it has been altered to<i> “and,”</i> as there appeared to be no contrast with the preceding)<b> we know that the Son of God is come</b> (the incarnation, and work, and abiding presence, of the Son of God, is to us a living fact. HE IS HERE—all is full of Him— “<i>the Master is come, and calleth for thee</i>”),<b> and hath given</b> (it is the Son of God who is to us the bestower of this knowledge, see ver. 13: it is He who is here at the end of the Epistle made prominent, as it is He who is to us eternal life, and he who hath Him hath the Father)<b> to us</b> [<b>an</b>]<b> understanding</b> (by<b> understanding</b> is meant the divinely empowered inner sense by which we judge of things divine. It is not the wisdom or judgment<i> itself</i>, but the faculty capable of attaining to it. Compare John i. 12, 18, xvii. 2 f., 6 f., 25 f., 2 Cor. iv. 6, Eph. i. 18),<b> that we know</b> (<b>that we know</b> must bear a sort of pregnant sense, of a purpose accomplished or at least secured)<b> the true One</b> (i. e. God: compare John xvii. 3, “<i>that they may know Thee</i><b> the only true God</b>.” The adjective<b> true</b> is not subjective, but objective, in the sense of<i> genuine</i>, in distinction from every fictitious god. And thus the way is prepared for the warning against all false gods, ver. 21);<b> and we are</b> (again, as in vv. 18, 19, this second member is an independent proposition, not dependent on the “<i>that</i>”)<b> in</b> (see above, on “<i>lieth in,</i>” ver. 19)<b> the true One</b> (viz. God, as above),<b> in His Son Jesus Christ</b> (i. e. by virtue of our being in His Son Jesus Christ: this second<b> in</b> is not in apposition with, but explanatory of the former).<b> This</b> (viz. God the Father:<b> the true One</b>, who has been twice spoken of see below)<b> is the true God, and eternal life.</b> There has been great controversy, carried on principally from doctrinal interests, respecting the reference of the word<b> this</b>: whether it is to be understood as above, or of His Son Jesus Christ, just mentioned. The Fathers who were engaged against Arian error, and most of the orthodox expositors since, regarding the passage as a precious testimony for the Godhead of the Son, have maintained this latter view, rather doctrinally than exegetically. One of the principal Socinianizing expositors, even Episcopins, takes this view, not being able to bear the caprice and tortuousness of the Socinian exegesis. The opposite doctrinal interest has led many of those who deny this application. To these have succeeded another set of expositors with whom not doctrinal but exegetical considerations have been paramount.<br><br> The grounds on which the application to Christ is rested are mainly the following: 1) that the pronoun<b> this</b> most naturally refers to the last-mentioned substantive: 2) that<b> eternal life</b>, as a predicate, more naturally belongs to the Son than to the Father: 3) that the sentence, if understood of God the Father, would be aimless, and tautological. But to these it has been well and decisively answered by Lücke and Düsterdicck, 1) that “<i>this</i>” more than once in St. John belongs not to the nearest, substantive, but to the principal one in the foregoing sentence, e.g. in ch. ii, 22 and in 2 John 7: and that the subject of the whole here has been the Father, who is the true One of the last verse, and the Son is referred back to Him as “<b>His</b> Son,” thereby keeping<i> Him</i>, as the primary subject, before the mind. 2) that as little can “<i>eternal life</i>” be am actual predicate of Christ as of the Father. He is indeed “<i>the life,</i>” ch. i, 2, but not “<b>eternal</b> life.” Such an expression used predicatively, leads us to look for some expression of our Lord's, or for some meaning w not appear on the surface to guide us. And such an expression leading to such a meaning we have in John xvii. 3, “<i>This is eternal life, that they may know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou didst send</i>.” He is eternal life in Himself, as being the fount and origin of it: He is it to us, seeing that to know Him is to possess it. I own I cannot see, after this saying of our Lord with the words,<b> Thee the only true God</b>, how any one can imagine that tho same Apostle can have had in these words any other reference than, that which is given in those. 3) this charge is altogether inaccurate. As referred to the Father, there is in it no tautology and no aimlessness. It serves to identify the “<i>true One</i>” mentioned before, in a solemn manner, and leads on to the concluding warning against false gods. As in another place the Apostle intensifies the non-possession of the Son by including in it the alienation from the Father also, so here at the close of all, the<i> true God</i>, the fount of<i> eternal life</i>, is put before us as the ultimate aim and end, to be approached<i> in His Son</i>, but Himself the one Father both of Him and of us who live through Him.
