<b> 20.</b>] Yet another<b> we know:</b> and that in general, as summing up all, the certainty to us of the Son of God haying come, and g given us the knowledge of God, and of our being in Him: and the formal inclusion, in this one fact, of knowledge of the true God here, and life everlasting hereafter.<b> Moreover</b> (closes off and sums up all, This not ng seen, it has been altered to<i> “and,”</i> as there appeared to be no contrast with the preceding)<b> we know that the Son of God is come</b> (the incarnation, and work, and abiding presence, of the Son of God, is to us a living fact. HE IS HERE—all is full of Him— “<i>the Master is come, and calleth for thee</i>”),<b> and hath given</b> (it is the Son of God who is to us the bestower of this knowledge, see ver. 13: it is He who is here at the end of the Epistle made prominent, as it is He who is to us eternal life, and he who hath Him hath the Father)<b> to us</b> [<b>an</b>]<b> understanding</b> (by<b> understanding</b> is meant the divinely empowered inner sense by which we judge of things divine. It is not the wisdom or judgment<i> itself</i>, but the faculty capable of attaining to it. Compare John i. 12, 18, xvii. 2 f., 6 f., 25 f., 2 Cor. iv. 6, Eph. i. 18),<b> that we know</b> (<b>that we know</b> must bear a sort of pregnant sense, of a purpose accomplished or at least secured)<b> the true One</b> (i. e. God: compare John xvii. 3, “<i>that they may know Thee</i><b> the only true God</b>.” The adjective<b> true</b> is not subjective, but objective, in the sense of<i> genuine</i>, in distinction from every fictitious god. And thus the way is prepared for the warning against all false gods, ver. 21);<b> and we are</b> (again, as in vv. 18, 19, this second member is an independent proposition, not dependent on the “<i>that</i>”)<b> in</b> (see above, on “<i>lieth in,</i>” ver. 19)<b> the true One</b> (viz. God, as above),<b> in His Son Jesus Christ</b> (i. e. by virtue of our being in His Son Jesus Christ: this second<b> in</b> is not in apposition with, but explanatory of the former).<b> This</b> (viz. God the Father:<b> the true One</b>, who has been twice spoken of see below)<b> is the true God, and eternal life.</b> There has been great controversy, carried on principally from doctrinal interests, respecting the reference of the word<b> this</b>: whether it is to be understood as above, or of His Son Jesus Christ, just mentioned. The Fathers who were engaged against Arian error, and most of the orthodox expositors since, regarding the passage as a precious testimony for the Godhead of the Son, have maintained this latter view, rather doctrinally than exegetically. One of the principal Socinianizing expositors, even Episcopins, takes this view, not being able to bear the caprice and tortuousness of the Socinian exegesis. The opposite doctrinal interest has led many of those who deny this application. To these have succeeded another set of expositors with whom not doctrinal but exegetical considerations have been paramount.
