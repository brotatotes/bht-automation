 21 .]  Parting warning against idols .  Little children (see reff. He parts from them with his warmest and most affectionate word of address),  keep yourselves from idols (the  εἴδωλον is properly a figure of an imaginary deity, while an ὁμοίωμα is that of some real person or thing made into an object of worship. So in an old Etymologicum ineditum in Biel sub voce (Düsterdieck), τὸ μὲν εἴδωλον οὐδεμίαν ὑπόστασιν ἔχει , τὸ δὲ ὁμοίωμα τινών ἐστιν ἴνδαλμα καὶ ἀπείκασμα . So Romans 1:23 , 1Co 10:19 ; 1 Corinthians 12:2 , and especially ref. 1 Thess., where, as here, θεὸς ζῶν καὶ ἀληθινός is opposed to εἴδωλα . And there seems no justification for the departing from the plain literal sense in this place. All around the Christian Church was heathenism: the born of God and the κείμενοι ἐν τῷ πονηρῷ were the only two classes: those who went out of one, went into the other: God’s children are thus then finally warned of the consequence of letting go the only true God, in whom they can only abide by abiding in His Son Jesus Christ, in these solemn terms, to leave on their minds a wholesome terror of any the least deviation from the truth of God, seeing into what relapse it would plunge them. This is a more satisfactory view than that taken by Düsterdieck, that having so long and so much warned them against error in Christian doctrine, he could not part without also warning them against that of which they were indeed in less danger, relapse into heathenism: and far better than that of Hammond, al., that the εἴδωλα were the fictions of Gnostic error).
