 5 .] If it be asked, How does our faith overcome the world? this verse furnishes the answer; because it brings us into union with Jesus Christ the Son of God, making us as He is, and partakers of His victory, John 16:33 . Through this belief we are born again as sons of God; we have Him in us, One greater than he who is in the world, ch. 1 John 4:4 . And this conclusion is put in the form of a triumphant question: What other person can do it? Who that believes this, can fail to do it?  Who is be that conquereth the world, except he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? By comparing 1 John 5:1 a, we find 1) that ὁ χριστός there answers to ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ here; 2) that by the combination of the two verses, we get the proposition of 1 John 5:4 a.
	Episcopius gives well the meaning: “Lustrate universum mundum et ostendite mihi vel unum, de quo vere affirmari possit, quod mundum vincat, qui Christianus et fide hac præditus non est.”
