<b> 6.</b>]<b> This</b> (viz. the Person spoken of in the last verse; Jesus. This, which is maintained by most Commentators, is denied by Knapp and Huther, who refer this to<i> “the Son of God:”</i> “The Son of God is he, &c.:” making the proposition assert, the identity of the Son of God with the historical Jesus, not the converse. ‘This Huther supports on two grounds: 1) that the fact that Jesus came by water and blood needed no proof even to Heretics: 2) that on the ordinary interpretation the following words,<i> “Jesus Christ,”</i> become altogether superfluous. But to these it is easily replied, 1) that although the fact might be confessed, that was not confessed to which the fact bore testimony, viz. that Jesus who came in the flesh was the Son of God: 2) that the appositional clause,<i> “Jesus Christ,”</i> is by no means superfluous, being only a solemn reassertion of our Lord’s Person and Office as testified by these signs. The main objection to Huther’s view is, that, as well stated by Düsterdieck, it makes the coming by water and blood, which, by the context, is evidently in the Apostle’s argument, a substantiating consideration, to be merely an exceptional one: “this Son of God is Jesus the Christ,<i> though</i> He came by water and blood.” Therefore the other interpretation must stand fast)<b> is he that came by water and blood</b> (<b>came</b> refers not to the Lord’s birth in the flesh, but to His open manifestation of himself before the world. See above, on ch. iv. 2.<br><br> The preposition<b> by</b>, which passes into “<i>in</i>” in the next sentence, is thereby explained to bear its very usual sense of<i> through</i> or<i> by means of</i>, as said of that which accompanies, as the medium through which, or the element in which. ‘The very same phrases, “<i>by blood</i>,” and “<i>in blood</i>,” are used of our Lord in Heb. ix. 12, 25, which chapter is the best of all comments on this difficult expression.<br><br><b> by water and blood</b> has been very variously understood. Two canons of interpretation have been laid down by Düsterdieck, and may safely be adopted: 1) “Water” and “blood” must point both to some purely historical facts in the life of our Lord on earth, and to some still present witnesses for Christ: and 2) they must not he interpreted symbolically, but understood of something so real and powerful, as that by them God’s testimony is given to believers, and eternal life assured to them. These canons at once exclude all figurative interpretations, such as that of Socinus und his school, in which<i> water</i> stands for the purity and innocence of the life and doctrine of Christ, Heb. x. 22, Eph. v. 26,—and<i> blood</i> for the death of Christ as His testimony of Himself.<br><br> Düsterdieck observes that it is remarkable that the best Roman-Catholic expositor, Estius [whose commentary is unfortunately broken off at this verse], does not, as some have done, interpret<b> blood</b> of the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, but puts together<i> water</i> and<i> blood</i>, as Calvin and Luther. So that, as Düsterdieck proceeds to say, the great leaders of the three schools of theology have had the tact to see that which their less skilled followers have missed seeing,—that<i> blood</i> cannot by any means be understood of the Lord’s Supper, as has been done by many.<br><br> The next point which comes before us is to enquire whether at. all, or how far, our passage is connected with John xix. 34? It occurs here, because many Commentators have seen in the incident there related a miraculous symbolizing of the two sacraments, and in this passage an allusion to that incident. To deny all such allusion seems against probability. The Apostle could hardly both here and in that place lay such evident stress on the water and blood together, without having in his mind some link connecting this place and that. The idea that we have here nothing more than a reference to the fact of John xix. 34, is against our 2nd canon above: but that John xix. 34 and this refer to the same fundamental truth, is I conceive hardly to be doubted.<br><br> It rests now then that we enquire into the meaning of each expression. On the first,<b> blood</b>, there cannot surely be much uncertainty. The blood of His Cross must, by all Scripture analogy, be that intended. The pouring out of this blood was the completion of the baptism which He had to be baptized with, Mark x. 28, 29, Luke xii. 50. And if this is so, to what can the term<b> water</b> be referred so simply, as to that baptism with water, which inaugurated the Lord’s ministry? It might indeed be said, that the baptism which He instituted for His followers, better satisfies the test of our 2nd canon, that viz. of being an abiding testimony in the Christian Church. But to this there lies the objection, that as<i> blood</i> signifies something which happened to Christ Himself, so must<i> water</i> likewise, at least primarily, whatever permanent testimony such event may have left in the Christian Church. And thus some modern Commentators have taken it; as uniting the historical fact of the Lord’s baptism with the ordinance of baptism, grounded on it, and abiding in the Christian Church. Düsterdieck refuses to accept this view, denying that our Lord’s baptism was any proof or testimony of His Messiahship, and understanding water of the ordinance of baptism only. But surely we are not right in interpreting the words “<i>He that came by water,</i>”<i> He that ordained baptism:</i> nor in giving the two,<i> blood</i> and<i> water</i>, an entirely different reference. For his endeavour to escape from this by making the former represent not Christ’s death but His blood, applied to us, cannot be accepted, as giving a “non-natural” sense to the words<i> “he that came by blood”</i> likewise.<br><br> All this being considered, it seems impossible to avoid giving both to<i> blood</i> and<i> water</i> the combined senses above indicated, and believing that such were before the Apostle’s mind. They represent,—the<b> water</b>, the baptism of water which the Lord Himself underwent and instituted for His followers,—the<b> blood</b>, the baptism of blood which He Himself underwent, and instituted for His followers. And it is equally impossible to sever from these words the historical accompaniments and associations which arise on their mention. The Lord's baptism, of itself, was indeed rather a result than a proof of His Messiahship: but in it, taking St. John’s account only, a testimony to His divine Sonship was given, by which the Baptist knew Him to be the Son of God:<i> “I have seen, and have borne witness, that this is the Son of God,”</i> are his words, John i. 34; and when that blood was poured from His “riven side,” he that saw it again uses the same formula,<i> “he that hath seen it hath borne witness.”</i> It cannot be that the word<b> witness</b> being thus referred to two definite points of our Lord’s life, should not apply to these two, connected as they are with water and blood here mentioned, and associated by St. John himself with the remarkable word<b> hath borne witness</b> (ver. 9) in the perfect tense, of an abiding witness in both cases.<br><br> But these past facts in the Lord’s life are this abiding testimony to us, by virtue of the permanent application to us of their cleansing and atoning power. And thus both our canons are satisfied, which certainly is not the case in Düsterdieck’s interpretation, though they were laid down by himself),<b> Jesus Christ</b> (see above on<b> this</b>, In all the places where St. John uses this Name, it las a solemn meaning, and is by the emphasis thus thrown on the official designation of our Lord, nearly equivalent to “<i>Jesus the Christ.</i>” Compare John i. 17, xvii. 3: 1 John i. 3, 7, ii. 1, iii. 23, iv. 2, v. 20: 2 John 3, 7):<b> not in the water only, but in the water and in the blood</b> (<b>in</b>, see above on<b> by</b>. The sense of the two is there shewn to be closely allied, in giving rather the “element in which,”<b> by</b>, the medium through which. The definite article before each word shews that they are well-known and solemn ideas. It is inserted not as matter of course, but as giving solemnity.<br><br> But why has the Apostle added this sentence? It has been thought that it is to give Christ the preference over Moses, who came only by water (1 Cor. x. 2), and Aaron, who came only by blood (of sacrifice), whereas Christ united both. But this is too far-fetched. Another opinion again regards the words as directed against those who despised the Cross of Christ (1 Cor. i. 23): but a more definite explanation than this is required. And those can hardly be wrong, who find it in such words as those of the Baptist in John i. 25,<i> “I baptize with (in) water, but there standeth one among you whom ye know not:”</i> compare the emphatic repetitions below, ver. 31,<i> “I came baptizing with (in) water;”</i> and ver. 38,<i> “He that sent me to baptize with (in) water.”</i> The baptism of Jesus was not one of water only, but one of blood,—<i> “behold the Lamb of God”</i>—and something more than that which follows in the next clause):<b> and the Spirit is that which witnesseth, because the Spirit is the truth</b> (that is, as explained by the next verse, the Spirit is an additional witness, besides those already mentioned to the Messiahship of Jesus, and in that, to the eternal life which God has given us in Him. Some have thought that<b> because</b> should be “that:” the same Greek word signifying hoth these. But it is not to the fact that the Spirit is the truth, that the Spirit gives witness: but it is the fact that He is the truth, which makes Him so weighty a witness; which makes the giving of witness so especially His office.<br><br> Very various however have been the meanings here given to<b> the Spirit</b>. One view understands, the spirit of our Lord, which He when dying commended into His Father’s hands, Another, explaining<i> water and blood</i> of the two Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, sees in<b> the Spirit</b>, in connexion with John xx. 22 ff., a third Sacrament of<i> absolution</i>, Others regard it as equivalent to<i> the spiritual man</i>, i.e. St. John himself. Others again regard it as equivalent to God—and the occasion of the testimony to be the Resurrection, when our Lord rose with Divine power. The Socinian Commentators interpret it of the divine power by which Christ wrought His miracles. But this, as well as Bede’s interpretation, that the Spirit which descended on the Lord at His baptism is meant, inasmuch as it testified to His being the true Son of God, fails, in giving no<i> present abiding</i> testimony such as the context requires. Others again understand by it the ministry of the word. Most of these understand<b> the Spirit</b> here and in ver. 8 differently. But nothing ean be plainer than that we must not alter the meaning, where the word<b> for</b> binds together the sentences so closely.<br><br> The above interpretations failing to give any satisfactory account of the text, we recur to the simple and obvious meaning,<i> the Holy Spirit</i>. And it seems fully to satisfy all the requirements of the passage. The Holy Spirit is He, who testifies of Christ [John xv. 26], who glorifies Him, and shews of the things which belong to Him [John xvi. 14]. It is by the possession of Him that we know that we have Christ [ch. iii, 24], And the following clause, “because the Spirit is the Truth,” exactly agrees with this. He is the absolute truth [John xiv. 17, xv. 26], leading into all the truth [John xvi. 13 f.]. And in this consists the all-importance and the infallibility of His witness).
