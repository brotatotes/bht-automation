<b> 6.</b>]<b> This</b> (viz. the Person spoken of in the last verse; Jesus. This, which is maintained by most Commentators, is denied by Knapp and Huther, who refer this to<i> “the Son of God:”</i> “The Son of God is he, &c.:” making the proposition assert, the identity of the Son of God with the historical Jesus, not the converse. ‘This Huther supports on two grounds: 1) that the fact that Jesus came by water and blood needed no proof even to Heretics: 2) that on the ordinary interpretation the following words,<i> “Jesus Christ,”</i> become altogether superfluous. But to these it is easily replied, 1) that although the fact might be confessed, that was not confessed to which the fact bore testimony, viz. that Jesus who came in the flesh was the Son of God: 2) that the appositional clause,<i> “Jesus Christ,”</i> is by no means superfluous, being only a solemn reassertion of our Lord’s Person and Office as testified by these signs. The main objection to Huther’s view is, that, as well stated by Düsterdieck, it makes the coming by water and blood, which, by the context, is evidently in the Apostle’s argument, a substantiating consideration, to be merely an exceptional one: “this Son of God is Jesus the Christ,<i> though</i> He came by water and blood.” Therefore the other interpretation must stand fast)<b> is he that came by water and blood</b> (<b>came</b> refers not to the Lord’s birth in the flesh, but to His open manifestation of himself before the world.
