<b> 7.</b>] “John here renders a reason why he spoke not of the Spirit only, who has the chief authority in this matter, but also of the water and the blood, because in them also there is no small credit due to testimony, and the ternary number is in case of witnesses the most complete.” Grotius.<b> For</b> (that this, and not “<i>because</i>,” is the correct English reading, see my Greek Test.)<b> those who bear witness are three</b> (the three are considered as living and speaking witnesses; hence we have the masculine form in the original. By being<i> three</i>, they fulfil the requirements of the Law as to full testimony: Deut. xvii. 6, xix. 15: Matt. xviii. 16, 2 Cor. xiii, 1),<b> the Spirit, and the water, and the blood</b> (now, the Spirit is put first: and not without reason. The Spirit is, of the three, the only living and active witness, properly speaking: besides, the water and the blood are no witnesses without Him, whereas He is independent of them, testifying both in the und out of them),<b> and the three concur in one</b> (contribute to one and the same result: viz. the truth that Jesus is the Christ, and that we have life in Him. And this their one testimony is given by the purification in the water of baptism into His name, John iii. 5: by the continual cleansing from all sin which we enjoy in and by His atoning blood: by the inward witness of His Spirit, which He hath given us).
