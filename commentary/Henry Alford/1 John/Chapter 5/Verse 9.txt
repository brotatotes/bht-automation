 9 .] An argument  a minori ad majus , grounded on the practice of mankind, by which it is shewn that God’s testimony must be by a  ll means believed by us.  If we (mankind in general: all reasonable men)  receive (as we  do : εἰ with an indic.: cf. John 7:23 ; John 10:35 ; John 13:14 . On the expression μαρτ . λαμβάνειν , see reff. It is, to receive with approval, to  accept )  the testimony of men (  τῶν ἀνθρ  . , generic;  τὴν μαρτ . in any given case. No special testimony need be thought of, as touching this present case: the proposition is general),  the testimony of God is greater (supply in the argument, “and therefore much more ought we to receive that.” The testimony of God here spoken of is not any particular testimony, as the prophecies concerning Christ (Bede), or the testimony of the Baptist and other eyewitnesses to Him (Wetstein, Storr), or the Prophets, the Baptist, Martyrs, and Apostles (Bengel, Episcopius, al.): it is general, as is the testimony of men with which it is compared. The particular testimony pointed at by the general proposition is introduced in the following words):  for (see above at the beginning of 1 John 5:7 . Here, there is an ellipsis: “and this maxim applies in the case before us, because”),  the testimony of God is this, that He hath borne testimony concerning His Son (i. e. the testimony of God to which the argument applies is this, the fact that He hath borne testimony to His Son: αὕτη ἐστὶν ἡ μαρτυρία , ὅτι …, as in 1 John 5:11 . The correction to the easier ἥν , as in 1 John 5:10 , gives a wrong reference for αὕτη , making it refer back to that mentioned in 1 John 5:6-8 , and throws back also a wrong shade of meaning over 1 John 5:9 , making “the testimony of God” there particular instead of general. The absolute sense of μεμαρτύρηκεν is found in the Gospel, John 1:32 , John 13:21 , John 19:35 ; see also 1Jn 5:6-7 above).
