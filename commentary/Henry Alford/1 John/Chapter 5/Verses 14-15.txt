<p><strong> 14, 15</strong> .] <em> The believer’s confidence as shewn in prayer</em> . <strong> And the confidence which we have towards Him</strong> (which follows as a matter of immediate inference from the fact of our spiritual life: see ch. 1Jn 3:19-21 ) <strong> is this, that if we ask any thing according to His will, He heareth us</strong> (this confidence may be shewn in various ways, including prayer as one, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:22">1 John 3:22</span> . And that one, of prayer, is alone chosen to be insisted on here. As regards the construction, there is no ellipsis between <strong> ἡ</strong> παρ . and ὅτι ; “our confidence is this, (the confidence) that …,” as some, e. g. Lücke, have thought. ἡ παῤῥησία is itself subjective, the feeling of confidence.

<p><strong> αὐτόν</strong> and <strong> τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ</strong> must by all analogy be referred to the Father, not to the Son, by whom we have access to the Father. See especially ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:21-22">1 John 3:21-22</span> .
	</p>
<p>The truth that God hears ( ἀκούει , as in reff.) all our prayers, has been explained on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:22">1 John 3:22</span> . The condition here attached, that the request be <strong> κατὰ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ</strong> , is in fact no limitation within the reality of the Christian life, i. e. in St. John’s way of speaking according to the true ideal. For God’s will is that to which our glorious Head himself submitted himself, and which rules the whole course of the Christian life for our good and His glory: and he who in prayer or otherwise tends against God’s will is thereby, and in so far, transgressing the bounds of his life in God: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:3">James 4:3</span> . By the continual feeling of submission to His will, joined with continual increase in knowledge of that will, our prayers will be both chastened, and directed aright. If we knew His will thoroughly, and submitted to it heartily, it would be impossible for us to ask any thing, for the spirit or for the body, which He should not hear and perform. And it is this ideal state, as always, which the Apostle has in view. In this view he goes still farther in the next verse).</p>
