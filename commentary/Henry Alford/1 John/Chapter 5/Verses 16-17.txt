<p><strong> 16, 17</strong> .] Join together the confidence concerning prayer just expressed, and the all-essential Christian principle of brotherly love, and we have following, as matter of course, the duty, and the practice, of intercession for an erring brother. And of this, with a certain not strictly defined limitation, these verses treat. <strong> If any man see</strong> (on any occasion, aor. “ <em> shall have seen</em> ”) <strong> his brother</strong> (as throughout the Epistle, to be taken in the stricter sense: not “ <em> proximus quicunque</em> ,” as Calov., but his Christian brother, one born of God as he is himself) <strong> sinning</strong> (Düsterd. remarks, that the present part. is not merely predicative, as would be the infin. ἁμαρτάνειν , but more graphic, as describing the ‘brother’ actually in the act and under the bondage of the sin in question) <strong> a sin not unto death</strong> (see below), <strong> he shall ask</strong> (the future conveys not merely a permission, “licebit,” but a command, taking for granted the thing enjoined as that which is to happen), <strong> and shall give him life</strong> (viz. the <em> asker</em> shall give: not, as Beza, Piscator, Socinus, Grot., Benson, Bengel, Lücke, Sander, al., <em> God</em> shall give, though of course this is so in reality: but the words mean, he, interceding for his brother, shall be the means of bestowing life on him: “rogans vivificabit,” as the æthiopic version. The vulg. evades it by “ <em> dabitur ei vita</em> .” This bestowal of life by intercessory prayer, is not to be minutely enquired into, whether it is to be accompanied with “correptio fraterna,” whether it consists in the giving to the sinner a repentant heart (Grot., al.), but taken as put by the Apostle, in all its simplicity and breadth. <em> Life</em> , viz., the restoration of that divine life from which by any act of sin he was in peril and indeed in process of falling, but his sin was not an actual fall) <strong> for them that sin not unto death</strong> (the clause takes up and emphatically repeats the hypothesis before made, viz., that the sin of the brother is not unto death. It does so in the plural, because the αὐτῷ before being indefinite, all such cases are now categorically collected: q. d. “shall give this life, I repeat, to those who sin not unto death”). <strong> There is a sin unto death: concerning it I do not say that he should make request</strong> (leaving for the present the great question, I will touch the minor points in this verse. First, it necessarily by the conditions of the context involves what is equivalent to a prohibition. This has been denied by many Commentators, “Ora si velis, sed sub dubio impetrandi,” says Corn.-a-lap. And it is equally denied, without the same implied meaning being given, by Socin., Schlichting, Grot., Carpzov., Neander, Lücke, De Wette, Huther: some of these, as Neander, thinking it implied, that prayer may be made, though the obtaining of it will be difficult, others, as De Wette, that it will be in vain, others as Huther, that St. John simply says such a case was not within his view in making the above command. And most of even those who have recognized the prohibition, strive to soften it, saying, as e. g. Lyra, that though “non est orandum pro damnatis,” yet we may pray for such a sinner, “ut minus peccaret et per consequens minus damnaretur in inferno:” or as Bengel, “Deus non vult ut pii frustra orent, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+3:26">Deuteronomy 3:26</span> . Si ergo qui peccatum ad mortem commisit ad vitam reducitur, id ex mero provenit reservato divino.” Calvin indeed holds fast the prohibition in all its strictness, but only in extreme cases: adding, “Sed quia rarissime hoc accidit, et Deus, immensas gratiæ suæ divitias commendans, nos suo exemplo misericordes esse jubet: non temere in quem-quam ferendum est mortis æternæ judicium, potius nos caritas ad bene sperandum flectat. Quod si desperata quorundam impietas non secus nobis apparet, ac si Dominus eam digito monstraret, non est quod certemus cum justo Dei judicio, vel clementiores eo esse appetamus.”
	</p>
<p>Certainly this seems, reserving the question as to the nature of the sin, the right view of the οὐ λέγω . By an express command in the other case, and then as express an exclusion of this case from that command, nothing short of an implied prohibition can be conveyed.
	</p>
<p>The second point here relates to the difference between <strong> αἰτεῖν</strong> and <strong> ἐρωτᾷν</strong> . The first is <em> petere</em> , the second <em> rogare</em> : as in Cicero, Planc. x. 25, “Neque enim ego sic rogabam ut petere viderer, quia familiaris esset meus.” Cf. Trench, N. T. Synonyms, pp. 140 143, edn. 1865. αἰτεῖν is more of the petition of the inferior: “in victum quasi et reum convenit,” as Bengel: ἐρωτᾷν is more general, of the request of the equal, or of one who has a right. Our Lord never uses αἰτεῖν or αἰτεῖσθαι of His own requests to God, but always ἐρωτᾶν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:16">John 14:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:26">John 16:26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:9">John 17:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:20">John 17:20</span> . It is true, Martha says, ὅσα ἂν αἰτήσῃ τὸν θεόν , δώσει σοι ὁ θεός , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:22">John 11:22</span> , but it was in ignorance, though in simplicity of faith, see Bengel in loc.: Trench, p. 142: and my note, Vol. I. And this difference is of importance here. The <strong> αἰτειν</strong> for a sin not unto death is a humble and trusting petition in the direction of God’s will, and prompted by brotherly love: the other, the <strong> ἐρωτᾷν</strong> for a sin unto death, would be, it is implied, an act savouring of presumption a prescribing to God, in a matter which lies out of the bounds of our brotherly yearning (for notice, the hypothesis that a man sees a brother sin a sin unto death is not adduced in words, because such a sinner would not truly be a brother, but thereby demonstrated never to have deserved that name: see ch. 1Jn 2:19 ), how He shall inflict and withhold His righteous judgments.
	</p>
<p>And these latter considerations bring us close to the question as to the nature of the sin unto death. It would be impossible to enumerate or even classify the opinions which have been given on the subject. Düsterdieck has devoted many pages to such a classification and discussion. I can do no more than point out the canons of interpretation, and some of the principal divergences. But before doing so, 1Jn 5:17 must come under consideration).</p>
