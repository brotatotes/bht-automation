 18 20 .]  Three solemn maxims of the Epistle regarding sin, and the children of God and the world, and our eternal life in Christ,  are repeated as a  close of the teaching of the Apostle. 1Jn 5:18 seems to be not without reference to what has just been said concerning sin. In actual life, even our brethren, even we ourselves, born of God, shall sin, not unto death, and require brotherly intercession: but in the depth and truth of the Christian life, sin is altogether absent. It is the world, not knowing God, which lies under the power of the wicked one: God’s new-begotten children he cannot touch: they are in and they know the True One, and in Him have eternal life. These maxims are introduced with a thrice-repeated οἴδαμεν , the expression of full persuasion and free confidence. They form a triumphant repetition of and anticipation of the attainment of the purpose expressed in 1 John 5:13 , ἵνα εἴδητε ὅτι ζωὴν ἔχετε αἰώνιον .
