<b> 19.]</b><b> Brethren, if any among you be seduced</b> (literally passive; and there is no reason why the passive signification should not be kept, especially when we remember our Lord’s warning, “<i>Take heed that no man deceive, seduce you”</i>)<b> from the truth</b> (not merely truth practical, of moral conduct, but that truth which is the subject of the<i> word</i> whereby our regeneration took place, ch. i. 18; the doctrine of Christ, spiritual and practical),<b> and one convert</b><b> him</b> (turn him back to the truth);{20}<b>know</b> (or,<i> let him know</i>, viz. the<i> converted man—</i>for his comfort, and for the encouragement of others to do the like by this proclamation of the fact),<b> that he who converteth</b> (not, ‘<i>has converted:</i>’ our English present, when connected with a future, exactly gives the meaning)<b> a sinner from the error of his way</b> (thus is the person converted more generally expressed than before; not only<i> him that has been seduced</i>, but any<i> sinner</i>)<b> shall save a soul from death</b> (in eternity: the future shews that the<i> salvation</i> spoken of is not contemporary with the<i> conversion</i>, but its ultimate result),<b> and shall cover a multitude of sins</b> (viz. by introducing the convert into that state of Christian faith, wherein all sins past, present, and future, are forgiven and done away. See 1 Pet. iv. 8, and for the expression, Ps. xxxi. 1; Neh. iv. 5. The word<b> sins</b>, following<b> sinners</b>, necessarily binds the reference to the converted, not the converters. It is not “<i>his sins</i>” [the ancient Syriac version so renders it], because the Apostle wishes to put in its most striking<i> abstract</i> light the good deed thus done. The objection that thus we should have a tautology,—the saving of the soul of the converted man, including the covering of his sins, is entirely obviated by this latter consideration. The idea that they are the sins of the converter is thus abhorrent from the context, as it is generally repugnant to apostolic teaching. Compare, on the whole, 1 Pet. iv. 8).<h1 class="new-page" id="1 PeterTOC"><a href="#1 Peter"> 1 Peter</a></h1><table><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tr><td><h2><a href="#1 Peter 1"> Chapter 1</a></h2></td><td><h2><a href="#1 Peter 4"> Chapter 4</a></h2></td></tr><tr><td><h2><a href="#1 Peter 2"> Chapter 2</a></h2></td><td><h2><a href="#1 Peter 5"> Chapter 5</a></h2></td></tr><tr><td><h2><a href="#1 Peter 3"> Chapter 3</a></h2></td></tr></table><h1 class="new-page" id="1 Peter"> The First Epistle General Of Peter</h1>
