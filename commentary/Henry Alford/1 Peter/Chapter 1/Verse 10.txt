<b> 10.]</b><b> Concerning which salvation</b> (its<i> time</i> especially, as explained below, but its<i> manner</i> and<i> issue</i> also)<b> sought earnestly and examined earnestly</b> (so literally)<b> prophets</b> (not<i> the prophets;</i> the terms,<b> prophets</b> and<b> angels,</b> are both times generic, to exalt the greatness of the<i> salvation.</i> What follows limits the assertion, and defines the prophets intended. So Bengel: “The omission of the article here gives sublimity to the discourse, for it draws off the reader from the limited consideration of individuals to regard the genus to which they belonged: so in ver. 12,<b> angels</b>”),<b> they who prophesied concerning the grace that was</b> [destined]<b> for you</b> (in matter of fact, in God’s purposes it was<i> you, for whom</i> the salvation was destined, though you as individuals were not in<i> their</i> view):<b> searching</b> (the participle takes up again the two verbs, with a view to mark more definitely the object of their search, now about to be described)<b> at</b> (towards, with reference to)<b> what or what sort of</b> (what, as identifying,<b> what sort of,</b> as describing. “The former means, the very date itself: the latter, the kind of period, to be known by various events.” Bengel)<b> season was declaring</b> (signifying, revealing)<b> the Spirit of Christ which was in them</b> (the Spirit of Christ, i.e. Christ’s Spirit: the Spirit which Christ has and gives, being He who reveals all things relating to Christ and the purposes of the Father: see Matt. xi. 27; John xvi. 14, 15, which passages, though in their normal sense they apply to New Test. revelations, yet in their declarative and abstract truth regard the Spirit’s office in all ages. See also Acts xvi. 7)<b> testifying beforehand the sufferings regarding</b> (spoken of with reference to; or, as before, ‘destined for’)<b> Christ</b> (it is disputed, whether this be meant of Christ individually, or of Christ mystically, including His Church. Our answer may be thus given. The expression is not indeed strictly parallel with that in Col. i. 24: see note there: but still the two are so far analogous that they may throw light one on the other, In both, as in ch. ii. 21, iii. 18, iv. 1, 13, v. 1, and in many other places where Christ’s sufferings are spoken of,<b> Christ</b> is used without<i> Jesus,</i> not thereby precluding the personal designation of our Lord, but still carrying into prominence the official and mediatorial: and on this latter account, if the context seem to requite it, including also the wider mystical sense in which Christ’s sufferings are those of the whole aggregate of His spiritual body. The question for us then is, Does the context here require this latter extended meaning? And to this we must answer decidedly in the negative. The “things which have been now reported unto you by them that preached the gospel unto you,” are the contents of the gospel history, the sufferings and triumphs of Christ. And it was of these as appointed for Him as means of bringing in the grace which was appointed for you, that the prophets testified beforehand),<b> and the glories after these [sufferings]</b> (on these<i> glories,</i> see ch. iii. 18, 22, ver. 1. “The glory of the Resurrection: the glory of the Ascension: the glory of the last judgment and heavenly kingdom.” Bengel. If it be asked what prophets are meant, we may reply, the prophets generally. Of one of them, who did prophesy of the sufferings of Christ, and the glories after them, viz. Daniel, we have it related, that he “understood by books the number of the years” destined for the desolations of Jerusalem. And our Lord declared that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which his disciples saw, and saw them not):<b> to whom</b> (taking up again<i> the prophets</i>)<b> it was revealed</b> (how are these words to be taken? Does<b> it was revealed</b> (1) correspond to “<i>searching, &c.</i>” so as to signify that the revelation was the result of their search, or the answer to it? The difficulty in such a rendering would be, that in one instance only would this be true, viz. that of Daniel; and even in that, not strictly correspondent: whereas it is here predicated of the prophets generally. Most certainly it cannot be in any sense said of them, that the exact time of the fulfilment of their prophecies was revealed to them. Or does it (2) signify that just so much was revealed to them, as that their prophecies were not to be fulfilled in their own time, but in ours? This again would be objectionable, seeing<i> a</i>) that there would be nothing corresponding to it in prophetic history, with the sole exception of Daniel, as before:<i> b</i>) that it would rather indicate a stop and discouragement of their search, than its legitimate result. Add to this, that the cases in which St. Peter himself, in the Acts, cites the prophecies, shew how he intended this term “<i>it was revealed</i>” to be taken. E.g. he quotes Joel, Acts ii. 17, speaking of the things prophesied by him as to take place “<i>in the last days:</i>” he says of David, ver. 31, “<i>Seeing before, he</i><i> spake concerning the Resurrection:”</i> and in iii. 24, he says,<i> “Moreover all the prophets from Samuel and those after, as many as spoke, proclaimed also these days.”</i> From these examples it would appear, that “<i>it was revealed</i>” here is not said of any result or consequence of their<i> search</i>, but of the general revelation made to them: that it is co-ordinate with, not subordinate to<b> searching</b>)<b>, that</b> (the content and purport of the revelation)<b> not to themselves but to you they were ministering</b> (i. e. by announcing, foretelling)<b> the things</b> (in their previous announcement and foreshadowing)<b> which now have been declared</b> (literally, “<i>were declared:</i>”<b> now</b> embracing the New Test. period: but we in English cannot join ‘<i>were</i>’ with ‘<i>now</i>’)<b> unto you by means of those who preached the gospel to you by</b> (instrumental)<b> the Holy Spirit sent</b> (historic tense, referring distinctly to the day of Pentecost)<b> from heaven</b> (herein consists the great difference between prophet and evangelist: the former was the organ of the Spirit of Christ which was in him, the latter preached by the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven. Still, both are one in design, and in the contents of their testimony. And both are here mentioned, to set before the readers their exceeding happiness, in being the favoured objects of the ministration of salvation by prophets and apostles alike),<b> which things</b> (viz. the things announced to you: not, as many, the future glories promised to us: see below)<b> angels</b> (generic, as “<i>prophets</i>” above: see there)<b> desire to look into</b> (literally, to stoop down and peer into, It embraces further still the excellence of the salvation revealed to us, that angels, for whom it is not designed as for us [Heb. ii. 16], long to pry into its mysteries. To the principalities and powers in heavenly places is made known, by the Church, the manifold wisdom of God, Eph. iii. 10. Hofmann remarks,— “Angels have only the contrast between good and evil, without the power of conversion from sin to righteousness. Being then witnesses of such conversion to God, they long to penetrate the knowledge of the means by which it is brought about.…They themselves are placed outside the scheme of salvation: therefore it is said that they desire to look into the facts of the apostolic preaching”).
