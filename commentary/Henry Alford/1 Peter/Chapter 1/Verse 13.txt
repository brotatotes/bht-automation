<b> 13.]</b> FIRST EXHORTATION—to WATCHFULNESS and ENDURANCE of HOPE.<b> Wherefore</b> (i. e. because these things are so precious and wonderful, not only to men, but also to angels)<b> gird up</b> (the tense in the original conveys the sense of completeness and once-for-all nature of the action)<b> the loins of your mind</b> (the exhortation seems to be taken from our Lord’s command, Luke xii. 35, where, as here, the girding up is a preparation for the coming of the Lord. On the figure, see Eph. vi. 14 ff.),<b> being sober</b> (Calvin explains it well: “He recommends not only temperance in meat and drink, but, more than this, spiritual sobriety—the putting a rein on all our senses, that they become not intoxicated with the allurements of this world”),<b> hope perfectly</b> (i. e. “without doubt or dejection, with full devotion of soul:” or, even better, “so, that nothing be wanting.” The A.V., “<i>hope to the end,</i>” does not reach the full meaning)<b> for</b> (in the direction of)<b> the grace</b> (i. e. the great<i> gift</i> of grace, the crowning example of grace)<b> which is being brought</b> (A. V., “<i>is to be brought;</i>” not amiss, but not giving, what the present participle in the original expresses, the near impending of the event spoken of: ‘which is even now bearing down on you’)<b> unto you in the revelation of Jesus Christ</b> (the meaning of St. Peter’s own words, identical with these, as applied to the revelation of the Lord at His second advent, ver. 7, seems to fix the meaning of the above words as here given, and to preclude the rendering of those who take the whole as referring to the present revelation of grace made by the Gospel, in which Jesus Christ is revealed).
