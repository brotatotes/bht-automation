<b> 18.]</b><b> knowing</b> (being aware: this argument enhances the duty of godly fear by the consideration of the-inestimable price at which they were redeemed. This consideration is urged through vv. 18–21)<b> that not</b> (emphatic)<b> with corruptible things, silver or gold, were ye redeemed</b> (bought out of, by the payment of a<i> ransom,</i> presently to be specified: see 1 Cor. vi. 20; vii. 23; Gal. iii. 13)<b> out of your vain behaviour</b> (way of life, which, when past, left no fruit behind it)<b> delivered to you from your fathers</b> ( “<i>One</i> Father alone is to be imitated,” says Bengel; “we find the same contrast in Matt. xxiii. 9.” This again makes it probable that the persons here more especially addressed are Gentile Christians. The Apostle himself, a Jew, would hardly speak of the vain ungodly lives of Jews as delivered to them from their fathers, without more explanation),<b> but with precious blood, as of a lamb blameless and spotless</b> (see Exod. xii. 5; Levit. xxii. 20),<b> [even the blood] of Christ</b> (the other construction, adopted by the A.V., and many Commentators,— “<i>but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb, &c.,</i>” is legitimate; but I prefer the above, as bringing forward the<b> precious blood</b> in contrast to the<b> corruptible things,</b> and then explaining the word<b> precious</b> by a climax, finding its highest point in<b> even of Christ.</b><br><br> The question, with what particular lamb Christ is here compared, will be found discussed in the main on John i. 29. Our reply here however will be somewhat modified by the consideration, that the figure of buying out of the<i> vain way of life</i> seems to contain an allusion to the bringing up ont of Egypt, and the word<b> foreordained</b>, which follows, to the taking up of the paschal lamb beforehand, Exod. xii. 3, 6. And thus I believe the reference here to be to the paschal lamb. “As Israel’s redemption from Egypt required the blood of the paschal lamb, so the redemption of those brought out of heathendom required the blood of Christ, the predestination of whom from eternity is compared with the taking up of the lamb on the tenth day of the month.” Hofmann).
