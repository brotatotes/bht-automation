<p><strong> 19</strong> .] <strong> but with precious</strong> ( <strong> τιμίῳ</strong> is not, as Huther, In opposition to φθαρτοῖς ; nor does it signify <em> “imperishable</em> ,” but simply and generally ‘ <em> precious,’ ‘of worth</em> ’) <strong> blood, as of a lamb blameless and spotless</strong> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:5">Exodus 12:5</span> ; Lev 22:20 ), ( <strong> even the blood) of Christ</strong> (this I believe to be the more natural construction. The other, adopted by E. V., De Wette, Huther, Wiesinger, and many Commentators, “ <em> but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb</em> ” &amp;c., is of course legitimate; and in that case τιμίῳ being prefixed for emphasis, is explained by the ὡς ἀμνοῦ clause inserted between it and χριστοῦ . We have a somewhat similar arrangement in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:27">Hebrews 12:27</span> , δηλοῖ τῶν σαλευομένων τὴν μετάθεσιν , ὡς πεποιημένων . But I prefer the other, as bringing forward the τιμίῳ αἵματι in contrast to the φθαρτοῖς , ἀργ . ἢ χρυς . and then explaining the τιμίῳ by a climax finding its highest point in χριστοῦ .

<p>The question, with what particular lamb Christ is here compared, will be found discussed in the main on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span> . Our reply here however will be somewhat modified by the consideration, that the figure of buying out of the ματαία ἀναστροφή seems to contain an allusion to the bringing up out of Egypt, and the προεγνωσμένου following, to the taking up of the paschal lamb beforehand, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:3">Exodus 12:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:6">Exodus 12:6</span> . And thus I believe Wiesinger and Hofmann are right in maintaining here the reference to the paschal lamb. “As Israel’s redemption from Egypt required the blood of the paschal lamb, so the redemption of those brought out of heathendom required the blood of Christ, the predestination of whom from eternity is compared with the taking up of the lamb on the tenth day of the month.” Hofmann, Schriftb. ii. 1. 326. See, for a further discussion of this point, Wiesinger’s note here: and Hofmann, Schriftb. ii. 1. 194 ff.):</p>
