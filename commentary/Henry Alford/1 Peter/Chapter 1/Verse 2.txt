<b>according to foreknowledge</b> (this significs not merely knowledge of their faith beforehand, as some interpret it, but counsel or fore-ordaining. “God<i> causes</i> election, and does not<i> discover</i> it only.” See on ver. 20, where the signification ‘fore-decreed’ is necessary to the context)<b> of God the Father</b> (thus indicated, as leading on to the great mystery of the Holy Trinity in the work of our salvation)<b> in</b> (not “<i>through</i>,” as A.V.:<i> ‘through</i>’ would betoken the origin, and enduring pattern after which,— ‘<i>unto,’</i> the conditional and abiding element in which, and in signifies the result for which)<b> sanctification of the Spirit</b> (gen. subjective, or rather<i> efficient</i>, the Spirit being the worker of the sanctification),<b> unto</b> (<i>result as regards us</i>—the fruit which we are to bring forth, and the state into which we are to be brought)<b> obedience</b> (absolutely, Christian obedience, the obedience of faith, as in ver. 14)<b> and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ</b> (i. e. admission into and standing in that covenant, whose atoning medium is Christ’s blood,—and mode of application, the sprinkling of that blood on the heart by faith. The allusion is to Exod. xxiv. 8, where the covenant was inaugurated by sprinkling the blood on the people. This was the only occasion on which the blood was thus sprinkled on<i> persons</i>: for on the great day of atonement, only the sacred vessels were thus sprinkled: So also in Heb. ix. 13. But we need not confine the virtue of the sprinkling to<i> admission into</i> the covenant. Doubtless its<i> purifying</i><i> power</i>, especially as connected with<i> obedience</i>, is also in the mind of the Apostle. The Death of Christ is not only,<i> as looking back on the past</i>, a propitiation for sin, thereby removing the obstacle which stood in the way of God’s gracious purpose towards man,—but also,<i> looking forward to the future</i>, a capacitating of us for the participation in God’s salvation: just as Israel, sin having been atoned for by the sacrifice itself, was admitted into the actual state of reconciliation by the sprinkling on them of the sacrificial blood. “By this description of the readers, an anticipation is given of the whole train of thought in the Epistle: the aim of which is to impress the blessed certainty of salvation, and with that, the obligations incurred by receiving God’s gift,” Harless):<b> grace and peace be multiplied unto you</b> (so, but more fully, in reff. 2 Pet.; Jude 1. “Peace is distinguished from grace, as a fruit, or effect, from its cause,” Gerhard. “May your peace be multiplied” is quoted as a rabbinical salutation).
