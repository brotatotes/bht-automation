In fact <strong> τὸν ἐγείραντα</strong> κ . τ . λ . is an epexegesis of δι ʼ αὐτοῦ ) <strong> believers on God</strong> (a similar specification is found at <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:4">1 Peter 1:4</span> , εἰς ὑμᾶς τοὺς κ . τ . λ .) <strong> who raised Him from the dead, and gave Him glory</strong> (“That we are redeemed from our vain conversation, is owing to the blood of Christ: but that we have faith and hope in God, is brought about by God having raised Christ from the dead, and given Him glory.” Hofm. Schriftb. ii. 1, p. 383. Wies. remarks that the δόξαι of 1Pe 1:11 are here separately specified), <strong> so that your faith and hope are</strong> (not, as Syr., Vulg., Œc., Luth., Calv., Beza, Est., al., and E.

Your faith rests on Christ’s resurrection it was God who raised Him: your hope, on Christ’s glorification: it is God who has given Him that glory. Closely accordant with this is St. Peter’s first public speech in the <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22">Acts 2:22</span> ff., where all that has happened to Christ is referred to God as the doer of it) <strong> on</strong> (resting on and in) <strong> God</strong> .</p>
