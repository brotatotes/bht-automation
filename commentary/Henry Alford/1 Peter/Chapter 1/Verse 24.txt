<b> 24.] Because</b> (Scripture proof that the word of God lives and abides, while all human instruments of birth, being flesh, pass away)<b> all flesh is as</b> (<i>as</i> is not found in the Old Test. text)<b> grass, and all glory of it</b> (whatever blooms up from the flesh, as the flower from the grass)<b> as flower of grass. The grass was dried up</b> (the past tense; the fact being related as in a tale; so in James i. 11),<b> and the flower</b> [thereof]<b> fell away: but the word of the Lord</b> (in the Septuagint version, as in the Hebrew,<i> of our God:</i> changed here probably on account of the application which follows)<b> remaineth for ever. And</b> (literally,<b> but</b>: it applies what has gone before: the contrast being between the general truth and the particular identification)<b> this (word</b> here spoken of)<b> is the word which was preached to you</b> (literally,<b> which was evangelized unto you;</b> i.e. which was preached to you in the declaration of the Gospel. The logical inference to be drawn is,— “and consequently the word preached to you is imperishable and eternal, and demands of you that you earnestly and intently follow up that new life which by it has been implanted in you.” Hence the connexion of ch. iii. 1–3).
