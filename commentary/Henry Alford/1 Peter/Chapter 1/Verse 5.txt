Prævenit apostolus ejusmodi objectiones,” &amp;c. Calvin. “Hæreditas servata est: hæredes custodiuntur: neque illa his, neque hi deerunt illi. Corroboratio insignis.” Bengel. “Militare est vocabulum φρουρά : præsidium.

Supreme, the power of God; 2. Subordinate, faith.… Our faith lays hold upon this power, and this power strengthens faith, and so we are preserved.” Leighton) <strong> unto</strong> (the end and limit of the φρουρεῖσθαι : cf. the very similar expression, in ref. Gal., ἐφρουρούμεθα συγκλειόμενοι εἰς τὴν μέλλουσαν πίστιν ἀποκαλυφθῆναι . Calvin, Steiger, al. take this <strong> εἰς</strong> as co-ordinate with εἰς κληρ . above, and this clause as a second (third) pendant on ἀναγεννήσας : “Rem unam duobus modis exprimit,” Calv.

The stress of the ἑτοίμην ἀποκαλυφθῆναι is, as Wiesinger well remarks, not the nearness of the ἀποκάλυψις , but the fact of the salvation being <em> ready</em> to be revealed: not yet to be brought in and accomplished, but already complete, and only waiting God’s time to be manifested. On the inf. aor. after ἑτοίμην , here giving the rapid completion of the act of ἀποκάλυψις as contrasted with the enduring φρουρεῖσθαι , see Winer, § 44. 7, <em> b, c</em> ) <strong> in the last time</strong> (not, as Bengel, “in comparatione ad tempora V.
