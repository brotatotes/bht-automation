<b> 6.]</b> It has been much disputed whether this verse (as also ver. 8, see there) is to be taken of<i> present</i> joy, or of<i> future</i>. In the latter case the present verb in both places must be a categorical present, used of a future. And this sense seems to be sanctioned by ver. 8, in which he could hardly predicate of his readers, that they at the present time rejoiced<i> with joy unspeakable and already glorified.</i> To avoid this, those who suppose the whole to allude to the time present, and the realization of future bliss by faith, imagine the present verb, “<i>ye rejoice,</i>” to have a slight hortatory force, reminding them of their duty in the matter. This however again will hardly suit the very strong qualifying terms above quoted from ver. 8. On the whole, after consideration, I prefer the former interpretation, and the as-if-future sense of the verb “<i>rejoice</i>” in both places.<br><br><b> In which</b> (i. e. in the last time: the<b> in</b> is temporal, bearing the same sense in the resumption, as it did at the end of ver. 5, from which it is resumed.
