James)  of your faith (= the fact of your faith being proved, and so, by an easy transition, the result of that proof, the purified and proved faith itself),  more precious than gold which perisheth (  πολυτιμότερον is in apposition with δοκίμιον above, forming part of the  subject of  εὑρεθῇ , not a predicate after it. No supply before ‘gold,’ such as “  of ,” E. V., or ‘  that of ,’ is legitimate. It is not ‘  the proof ’ which is precious, though the literal construction at first sight seems to be this, but the faith itself: see above),  yet is (usually, habitually)  proved by fire (the  δέ in this clause brings out this, that gold though perishable yet needs fire to try it the inference lying in the background, how much more does your faith, which is being proved for eternity, not for mere temporary use, need a fiery trial?),  may be found (finally and once for all, aor., as the result of the judicial trial at that day = ‘evadat.’  εὑρ  .   εἰς , see ref.
