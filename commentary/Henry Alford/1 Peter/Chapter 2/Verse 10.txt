<b>who</b> (contrast between their former and present states)<b> were once no people</b> (the Apostle is again citing, or rather clothing that which he has to write in, Old Test. words: see Hos. ii. 23),<b> but [are] now the people of God</b> (these words apply most properly to Gentile Christians, although spoken in the prophecy of Jews. St. Paul thus uses them, Rom. ix. 25; and it is not impossible that that passage may have been in St. Peter’s mind),<b> who were unpitied</b> (of God: the clauses here and above are not merely negatives, but contraries: not “who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy,” as A.V., indicating a mere change of time in order of progress, but who were unpitied, objects of aversion and wrath),<b> but now have obtained compassion</b> (the past tense has a fine and delicate force which cannot be given in a version: who were men who [have received no pity], but now men who [received pity], viz. when God called you by Christ).
