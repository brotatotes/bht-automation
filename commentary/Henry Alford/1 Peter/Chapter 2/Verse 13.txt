The latter would stultify what follows: for it is not to the king as a man, but to the king as a human institution, that we are to be subject. It is no objection to this command, that all powers are ordained of God: for that consideration does not come into notice in these words, but in those which follow, “<i>for the Lord’s sake.</i>”<i> Here,</i> it is the<i> lower side</i> of such institutions, the fact of their being ordained and upheld by men, that is brought into sight)<b> for the Lord’s sake</b> (i. e. Christ’s: “<i>the Lord</i>” with St. Peter, except in Old Test. citations, is always our Lord. And here there is additional reason, for that He, the Head of all principality and power, is yet in us his members subject to them, until the day when all shall be put under His feet):<b> whether to king</b> (general,—but, from the nature of the ease as regarded those to whom the Epistle is addressed, here the Roman Emperor)<b> as supereminent</b> (not ruled by any other human power),<b> or to governors</b> (of the provinces, sent by Caesar)<b> as to men sent</b> (<i>in the habit of being sent</i>,—sent from time to time)<b> through him</b> (<i>the king,</i> not<i> the Lord,</i> as some, and Calvin very positively. But there can be little doubt that he is wrong. For first the analogy of the clauses shews that the grounds of obedience in each case, all being alike<i> for the Lord’s sake</i>, belong to the actually existing rights of power in that case. The king is supreme, in his own right: governors rule by delegation from the king. Then the right understanding of “<i>for the Lord’s sake,</i>” as applying to all, forbids this view. For thus we should obey the king as<i> eminent,</i> no mention of the Lord being made, whereas rulers are to be obeyed as sent by the Lord)<b> for</b> (to bring about)<b> vengeance on evil-doers, and praise of well-doers.</b>
