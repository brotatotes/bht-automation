For first the analogy of the clauses, ὡς ὑπερέχοντι … ὡς δι ʼ αὐτοῦ πεμπομένοις , shews that the grounds of obedience in each case, all being alike διὰ κύριον , belong to the actually existing rights of power in that case. The king is supreme, in his own right: governors rule by delegation from the king, ‘  mittuntur ’ δι ʼ αὐτοῦ . Then, the right understanding of διὰ κύριον , as applying to all, forbids this view. For thus we should obey the king as ὑπερέχων , no mention of the Lord being made, whereas rulers are to be obeyed as sent by the Lord.
