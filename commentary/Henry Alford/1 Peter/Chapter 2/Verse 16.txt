<p><strong> 16</strong> .] The connexion is somewhat doubtful. Chrys. (in Cramer’s Catena), Œc., Bengel, Gerh., De Wette, join ὡς ἐλεύθεροι with ὑποτάγητε above, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:13">1 Peter 2:13</span> ; Bed [8] , Luther, Calv., Hammond, Wiesinger, with ἀγαθοποιοῦντας , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:15">1 Peter 2:15</span> ; Steiger, Huther, with the following, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:17">1 Peter 2:17</span> . This latter seems quite untenable, as carrying no application on from 1Pe 2:16 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:17">1 Peter 2:17</span> . No one would think of pleading his freedom as an excuse for not honouring all, or for not loving the brethren, or for not fearing God: or indeed for not, in some sense, <em> honouring</em> the King. But in a matter of subjection, such ἐλευθερία might be and often is made a cloak for disobedience. Connecting then ὡς ἐλεύθ . with what has preceded, which of the other connexions are we to take? That with ὑποτάγητε seems too distant: it may certainly be said that 1Pe 2:17 brings in again the general duty in its most simple form: but even thus we can hardly account for the parenthetical <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:15">1 Peter 2:15</span> , so unparenthetical in its aspect and construction. Whereas if we join ὡς ἐλεύθ . to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:15">1 Peter 2:15</span> , we obtain, as Wiesinger well argues, an epexegesis which that verse seems to need, for it is almost a truism that we are to accomplish the φιμοῦν by ἀγαθοποιεῖν , unless some explanation be given of the particular circumstances under which this is to take place. I regard then 1Pe 2:16 as an epexegesis of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:15">1 Peter 2:15</span> , not carrying on the construction with an accus. but with a nom. as already in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:12">1 Peter 2:12</span> , and indeed even more naturally here, because not the act consequent on ἀγαθοποιεῖν , as there on ἀπέχεσθαι , is specified, but the antecedent state and Christian mode of ἀγαθοποιεῖν . <strong> As free</strong> (children of God, His family and people, His kingly priesthood: not merely free from the law, or free from sin, or free from earthly subjection, but generally and abstractedly free Christ’s freed men), <strong> and not as</strong> ( <strong> ὡς</strong> belongs to ἔχοντες , not to ἐπικάλυμμα ) <strong> having</strong> (cf. above, 1Pe 2:12 ) <strong> your freedom</strong> ( <strong> for</strong> ) <strong> a veil</strong> (reff.) <strong> of your evil intent</strong> (the <strong> τῆς</strong> , hypothetical: of the evil intent which using your freedom as a veil would necessarily presuppose), <strong> but as God’s</strong> (emphatic) <strong> servants</strong> (and therefore bound to submit yourselves to that which God ordains).
