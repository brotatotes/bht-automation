<b> 16.]</b> The connexion is somewhat doubtful. Chrysostom and others join<b> as free</b> with “<i>submit yourselves,</i>” above, ver. 13:—Bede, Luther, Calvin, and others, with the last clause, “<i>that with well doing, &c.</i>” ver. 15: Steiger, Huther, with the following, ver. 17. This latter seems quite untenable, as carrying no application on from ver. 16 to ver. 17. No one would think of pleading his freedom as an excuse for not honouring all, or for not loving the brethren, or for not fearing God: or indeed for not, in some sense,<i> honouring</i> the King. But in a matter of subjection, such<i> freedom</i> might be and often is made a cloke for disobedience. Connecting then<i> as free</i> with what has preceded, which of the other connexions are we to take? That with “<i>submit yourselves</i>” seems too distant: it may certainly be said that ver. 17 brings in again the general duty in its most simple form: but even thus we can hardly account for the parenthetical ver. 15, so unparenthetical in its aspect and construction. Whereas if we join “<i>as free</i>” to ver. 15, we obtain, as Wiesinger well argues, an explanation which that verse seems to need,—for it is almost a truism that we are to accomplish the<i> putting to silence</i> by<i> well doing,</i> unless some explanation be given of the particular circumstances under which this is to take place,—I regard then ver. 16 as an explanation of ver. 15.<b> As free</b> (children of God, His family and people, His kingly priesthood: not merely free from the law, or free from sin, or free from earthly subjection, but generally and abstractedly free—Christ’s freed-men)<b> and not as having your freedom [for] a veil of your evil intent</b> (of the evil intent which using your freedom as a veil would necessarily presuppose),<b> but as God's</b> (emphatic)<b> servants</b> (and therefore bound to submit yourselves to that which God ordains).
