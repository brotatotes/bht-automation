 19 .]  For this is thankworthy (as in ref. Luke, εἰ ἀγαπᾶτε τοὺς ἀγαπῶντας ὑμᾶς , ποία ὑμῖν χάρις ἐστί ; i. e. what recognition at God’s hand in the day when He will come, and His reward with Him (= τίνα μισθὸν ἔχετε ; Mat 5:46 )? It is said of something, to do or suffer which is out of, beyond, the ordinary course of what might have been expected. The meaning attempted by Wiesinger after Steiger, “this is  grace ,” i. e. a  mark of divine grace , does not suit 1 Peter 2:20 , χάρις παρά , not θεοῦ , but θεῷ : and is condemned by the passage in St. Luke. The idea that it means “gratiam divinam concilians,” Wahl, leading on to “hoc est opus supererogationis,” Lyra, is theologically inadmissible, besides doing violence to the construction. The E. V. has hit the meaning very well. Cf. Calvin: “Idem valet nomen gratiæ quod laudis. Intelligit enim nullam gratiam vel laudem conciliari nobis coram Deo, si pœnam sustinemus quam nostris delictis simus promeriti: sed qui patienter ferunt injurias, eos laude dignos esse, et opus facere Deo acceptum”),  if (  εἰ ὑποφέρει τις = τὸ ὑποφέρειν τινά , forms an apposition to and epexegesis of τοῦτο : see for the infin. 2Co 2:1 ; 2 Corinthians 7:11 , and for instances of ὅτι , ἵνα , &c. Winer, § 23. 5. We have ἐάν after τοῦτο in 1Jn 2:3 )  on account of consciousness of God (realization in a man’s inner being, of God’s presence and relation to himself: cf. συνείδ . ἁμαρτιῶν Hebrews 10:2 . Calov. says perhaps too much: “quia conscius est id Deum velle et Deo gratum esse.” Better Calvin, “Hoc enim valet conscientia Dei, dum quis non hominum, sed Dei respectu officio suo fungitur”)  any one endures (as a superimposed burden, see reff., but here induced perhaps by the idea of ὑποταγή which is dominant throughout: so De Wette)  tribulations (“res tristitiam afferentes,” Wahl: cf. λυπηθέντες , ch. 1Pe 1:6 ),  suffering wrongfully (  ἀδίκως here emphatic, as carrying the transition to the next step of the argument).
