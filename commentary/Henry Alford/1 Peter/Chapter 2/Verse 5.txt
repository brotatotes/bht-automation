<b>be ye also as living</b> (see above)<b> stones built up</b> (on the dispute whether the verb is indicative or imperative, see my Greek Test.)<b> a spiritual house</b> (equivalent to “<i>temple,</i>” 1 Cor. iii. 16; Eph. ii. 21: as before, the stones are called<i> living</i>, and the house<i> spiritual</i>, not merely to signify that they are not dead stones, and the house not a material one, but on account of the life which Christians derive from Christ, the living Stone, and of the service which they render in virtue of being a body dwelt in by the Holy Spirit)<b> for an holy priesthood</b> (abstract, office of priesthood, including in itself the individual priests. Being God’s spiritual temple, they form an holy priesthood to Him, approaching and serving before Him in virtue of that Living and Holy One, whose mystic Body they are, and in whom the Father is well pleased. And they need no other by whom to approach God: being all priests, they require not, nor admit of, any distinct body of men among themselves specially called priests, nearer to God than themselves. Nowhere is this more clearly declared by inference, than here)<b> to offer up</b> (no habitual offering, as in rite or festival, is meant, but the one, once-for-all devotion of the body, as in Rom. xii. 1, to God as His)<b> spiritual sacrifices</b> (compare especially Heb. xiii. 15, 16. Spiritual, because as the temple, as the priests, as the God, so the offering. It is this, rather than any distinction from the Old Test. sacrifices, that is pointed at)<b> acceptable to God through Jesus Christ</b> (these last words may be joined, either 1) with “<i>acceptable,</i>” or 2) with “<i>to offer up.</i>” This latter has for it the analogy of Heb. xiii. 15, “<i>By Him therefore let us offer, &c.,</i>” and is much to be preferred. The introduction of the words “<i>through Jesus Christ</i>” as a mere appendage of “<i>acceptable</i>” would not satisfy the weighty character of the words, nay, would seem to put them in the wrong place, seeing that not merely the acceptability, but the very existence, and possibility of offering of those sacrifices depends on the mediation of the great High Priest).
