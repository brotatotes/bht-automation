<b> 6.]</b><i> The exhortation</i> of the previous verses is<i> substantiated</i> in its form and its assertions<i> by Old Test. prophecy</i>.<b> Because</b> (i. e. the aforesaid is so, on the ground of Scripture)<b> it is contained in Scripture, Behold, I place in Zion a chief corner stone, chosen, had in honour: and he that believeth on Him</b> (or, ‘<i>it:</i>’ this addition is not in the passage cited)<b> shall not be ashamed.</b><br><br> is the<i> root of disobedience:</i> but it is the manner of Scripture, to follow it out into disobedience, its invariable effect, when spoken of in contrast to faith. What follows is in the form of another quotation, or rather combination of quotations: the first from Ps. cxviii. 22),<b> the stone which the builders rejected, this has become for a</b> (has been made into a)<b> head corner stone</b> (this is true with regard to believers also: but to them it is grace and glory, to these it is terror and destruction),<b> and a stone of stumbling and rock of offence</b> (second quotation from Isa. viii. 14. This stumbling is not mere mental offence, which e.g. they take at the preaching of the Cross; but the “stumbling upon the dark mountains” of Jer. xiii. 16: see Prov. iv. 19; Dan. xi. 19:—the eternal disgrace and ruin which forms the contrast to “<i>honour</i>” above. See, on the “<i>rock of offence,</i>” Matt. xvi. 23: where we find that the very expression carries a reminiscence of Peter’s own days of unbelief when he was an offence,—he, the stone,<i> petros,</i>—to his Lord),<b> who stumble, being disobedient to the word</b> (thus, and not as A.V., is the construction),<b> for which</b> (thing, fact, viz., their whole moral course of delinquency and the<i> stumbling</i> at the end of it)<b> they were also</b> (besides that they reach it, there is another consideration)<b> appointed</b> (set where they are, or were; viz. by Him who set above [it is the same word in the original] the stone of stumbling).
