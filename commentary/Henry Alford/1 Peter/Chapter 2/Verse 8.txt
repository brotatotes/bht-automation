<p><strong> 8</strong> .] <strong> who stumble, being disobedient to the word</strong> ( <strong> τῷ λόγῳ</strong> belongs to ἀπειθοῦντες , not as E. V. after vulg., Erasm., Luth., Beza, Estius, al., to προσκόπτουσιν , which is doubly objectionable, in, 1. making ἀπειθοῦντες a mere tautology from ἀπειθοῦσιν before: 2. giving a place not prominent enough to τῷ λόγῳ , whereas on the other rendering it takes its proper place, as being the means of growth to the Christian, and rejected by the disobedient: 3. confining the sense of ‘stumbling’ (see above) to a mere subjective one: 4. opposing the analogy of ch. 1Pe 3:1 and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:17">1 Peter 4:17</span> . Cf. Wolf, in loc.: “ <em> Qui impingunt</em> , nempe, in lapidem illum angularem, verbo non credentes (obedientes?): quo ipso et offensio ipsa et ejus causa indicatur”), <strong> for which</strong> (thing, fact, viz. the προσκόπτειν , τῷ λόγῳ ἀπειθοῦσιν , their whole moral course of delinquency and the πρόσκομμα at the end of it) <strong> they were also</strong> ( <strong> καί</strong> , besides that they reach it, there is another consideration) <strong> appointed</strong> (set where they are, or were; viz. by Him who τίθησιν , above, the stone of stumbling. This exposition is certain, notwithstanding the protests of Œc., Did., al. Nor can I see how Bengel can escape, with his διττολογία , “ <em> Positi sunt</em> respondet τῷ <em> pono</em> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:6">1 Peter 2:6</span> ; sed cum differentia. Nam Deus Christum et electos active dicitur <em> ponere</em> ; infideles dicuntur <em> poni</em> , passive.” What inference would he deduce from this? Would he take themselves as the agents, as Œc., Did., “Ad non credendum a semetipsis sunt positi,” thus passing over <strong> καί</strong> , and making the clause a vapid tautology? Or would he say with Aretius, “Non Deus certe, sed Satan tales posuit,” thus making in the world’s moral arrangement, Satan a coordinate power with God?).</p>
