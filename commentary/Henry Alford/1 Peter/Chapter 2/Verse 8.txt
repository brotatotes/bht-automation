V. after vulg., Erasm., Luth., Beza, Estius, al., to προσκόπτουσιν , which is doubly objectionable, in, 1. making ἀπειθοῦντες a mere tautology from ἀπειθοῦσιν before: 2. giving a place not prominent enough to τῷ λόγῳ , whereas on the other rendering it takes its proper place, as being the means of growth to the Christian, and rejected by the disobedient: 3. confining the sense of ‘stumbling’ (see above) to a mere subjective one: 4. opposing the analogy of ch. 1Pe 3:1 and 1 Peter 4:17 .

This exposition is certain, notwithstanding the protests of Œc., Did., al.

Nam Deus Christum et electos active dicitur  ponere ; infideles dicuntur  poni , passive.” What inference would he deduce from this? Would he take themselves as the agents, as Œc., Did., “Ad non credendum a semetipsis sunt positi,” thus passing over  καί , and making the clause a vapid tautology? Or would he say with Aretius, “Non Deus certe, sed Satan tales posuit,” thus making in the world’s moral arrangement, Satan a coordinate power with God?).
