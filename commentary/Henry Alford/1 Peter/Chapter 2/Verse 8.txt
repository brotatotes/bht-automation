<b>and a stone of stumbling and rock of offence</b> (second quotation from Isa. viii. 14. This stumbling is not mere mental offence, which e.g. they take at the preaching of the Cross; but the “stumbling upon the dark mountains” of Jer. xiii. 16: see Prov. iv. 19; Dan. xi. 19:—the eternal disgrace and ruin which forms the contrast to “<i>honour</i>” above. See, on the “<i>rock of offence,</i>” Matt. xvi. 23: where we find that the very expression carries a reminiscence of Peter’s own days of unbelief when he was an offence,—he, the stone,<i> petros,</i>—to his Lord),<b> who stumble, being disobedient to the word</b> (thus, and not as A.V., is the construction),<b> for which</b> (thing, fact, viz., their whole moral course of delinquency and the<i> stumbling</i> at the end of it)<b> they were also</b> (besides that they reach it, there is another consideration)<b> appointed</b> (set where they are, or were; viz. by Him who set above [it is the same word in the original] the stone of stumbling).
