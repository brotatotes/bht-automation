<b>But ye</b> (emphatic)<b> are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood</b> (the expression is from the Septuagint version of Ex. xix. 6. Compare Rev. i. 6, and v. 10. In the New Test. church, these two elements, the kingship and the priesthood, are united in every individual believer, as in our great Head, Jesus Christ, who alone unites them in the Old Test. church; the two coexisting, but never except in the case of Melchizedek His foretype, united in the same Person),<b> an holy nation</b> (also from Exod. xix. 6, God’s declaration at Sinai respecting Israel),<b> a people for acquisition</b> (so literally: i.e. peculiarly God's own, as interpreted by what follows in the place of Isaiah referred to, as well as here. There it stands, in the Septuagint version, “<i>my people whom I acquired for myself to shew forth my virtues.</i>” In the place of Exodus which was before quoted, ch. xix. 5, we read in the Septuagint version, “<i>ye shall be to me a peculiar (acquired) people from all the nations.</i>” In Acts xx. 28, “<i>the Church of God which He purchased by His own blood,</i>” the word rendered ‘<i>purchased</i>’ is ‘<i>acquired,’</i> as here.
