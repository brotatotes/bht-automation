<b> 14.]</b><b> Nay if even ye chance to suffer on account of righteousness</b> (Augustine says, “Not<i> what,</i> but<i> why,</i> he suffers, makes the martyr.”<b> righteousness,</b> i.e. that right and holy living to which you devote yourselves, and which gives offence to the ungodly world. See our Lord’s saying, Matt. v. 10),<b> blessed are ye</b> (this, that is, makes no exception to none harming you, but rather is a notable example of it).<b> But</b> ( “he now teaches how suffering is to be borne so as to keep this blessedness unmarred,” Bengel. The words are almost verbatim from Isa. viii. 12, 13)<b> be not afraid with their terror</b> (not “<i>afraid of,</i>” as A.V.<b> terror is,</b> as in the place quoted, “<i>neither fear ye their fear,</i>” subjective. The command amounts to this, “be not affected in heart by the fear which they strive to inspire into you”),<b> nor be troubled</b> ( “as the highest curse which the law threatens is a heart fearful and full of terror, Lev. xxvi. 36; Deut. xxviii. 65; so the highest good which Christ gained for us and offers us in the Gospel is a heart certified of the grace of God, and consequently tranquil in all adversities and dangers.” Gerhard):<b> nay, rather sanctify in your hearts</b> (in the Old Test. passage it is added, “<i>and He shall</i> (in the A.V.<i> let Him</i>)<i> be your dread.</i>” “This addition is not made here, but instead,<i> in your hearts,</i> to bring out that the sanctifying must be perfected in the inner parts of a man, and so keep him from all false fear. As if he would say, Care only for this, that your heart may be a temple of Christ, in which becoming honour may be given to Him as Lord; then will nothing further disturb you: you have in Him all that you can need.” Wiesinger)<b> Christ as Lord</b> (the expression “<i>the Lord of hosts himself</i>” in truth is changed in a Christian sense into<b> Christ as Lord</b>):<b> [being]</b> (so literally; continuing the same adjectival sentences as before)<b> ready always for</b> (i. e. to give)<b> an answer</b> (an apologetic justification, in the primitive Christian sense. This was most commonly given before official persons and on trial, but in the present case is expressly extended to every person and occasion)<b> to every man that asketh of you a reason</b> (a reasonable account)<b> concerning the hope that is in you</b> (the word<i> hope</i> is not put for the whole of the Christian’s faith, but is to be taken strictly. In persecution, it is his<i> hope</i> especially which is put to the trial),<b> but</b> (makes a contrast to the<i> readiness</i> just inculcated: ready, but not over ready: see Luther, below)<b> with meekness</b> (see above, on ver. 4)<b> and fear</b> (this fear is not the fear of God exclusively, nor that of men, but the aspect of the mind as regards both: proper respect for man, and humble reverence of God. The case supposed would generally occur when some one invested with authority asked a reason; and the complexion of the answer to be given is taken from that circumstance. On the injunction, Luther says, speaking from his own experience at Worms and elsewhere, “Then must ye not answer with proud words, and bring out the matter with a defiance and with violence as if ye would tear up trees, but with such fear and lowliness as if ye stood before God’s tribunal.…so must thou stand in fear, and not rest on thine own strength, but on the word and promise of Christ,” Matt. x. 19 f.):
