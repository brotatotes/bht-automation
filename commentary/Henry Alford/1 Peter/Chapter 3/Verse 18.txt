<b> 18.]</b><b> Because</b> (not ‘<i>for:</i>’ it docs not only render<i> a reason,</i> but lays down<i> the reason</i> why Christian suffering for well-doing is blessed)<b> Christ also</b> (as well as yourselves if ye be so called as to suffer)<b> suffered for sins</b> (the thought is somewhat similar to that in ch. ii. 21, but the intent of it different: there, it was as an example<i> to us</i> that the sufferings of Christ were adduced: here, it is as a proof of the blessedness and advantage of suffering for well-doing, that proof being closely applied to us by the fact that that suffering was undertaken on our behalf, and that blessedness is our salvation. The words<b> for sins</b> I distinctly hold, with Wiesinger, to come in, as a point of comparison, between Christ and ourselves, under the<b> also,</b> against most Commentators. Considering St. Peter’s love of using the same term in two meanings, of which we have already had several examples, e.g. vv. 9, 14, 15, T have no hesitation in applying the<i> suffering for sins</i> the one time to Christ, the other to ourselves, though His suffering for sin, and ours, are two very different things. He, the sinless One,<i> suffered for sins;</i> as a sacrifice for sin, as a sinner, made sin for us, dying the death of a criminal: we, though not sinless, yet in<i> our well-doing,</i> are to suffer if God’s will so will it,<i> for sins,</i>—for sins which we are supposed to have committed, and as sinners. To miss this, is to miss one of the cardinal points of the comparison)<b> once</b> ( “from this<b> once,</b> through the<i> also,</i>” as has been beautifully said, “a beam of comforting light falls on the sufferings of Christians.” He suffered<i> once:</i> His sufferings are summed up and passed away: He shall suffer no more. And we are suffering “<i>once:</i>” it shall be soon so thought of and looked back upon. For this reason doubtless is the word inserted);<b> a just person</b> (<i>just</i> is purely predicative: not as A.V. ‘<i>the just,</i>’ which again loses the point of comparison)<b> on behalf of unjust [persons]</b> (this again, though the resembling tints are beginning somewhat to fade off, is another point of comparison: He suffered, just, righteous,<i> for unjust ones:</i> He represented, He was offered for, the unjust, the unrighteous: and so we in our turn, though in a far less deep and proper meaning, when we, being<i> just</i> [ver. 12], suffer as<i> unjust,</i> though not in any propitiatory sense<i> for unjust.</i> We have similar uncertainty and play of meaning where the same subject is treated, Rom. vi. 10, 11; it is said that Christ “<i>died to sin,</i>” and “<i>liveth to God;</i>” and we are exhorted thus<i> to count ourselves dead to sin, and living to God:</i> where the two expressions, though they have a common meaning of small extent, are in their widest and most important references of necessity widely divergent),<b> that</b> (with this expression of<i> purpose</i> we leave the comparison, as far as suffering is concerned, returning to it presently for a moment with the fact of His being<i> put to death,</i> and pass up to the<i> blessedness</i> of His innocent suffering, and to that which makes it so glorious and precious to us, as the ground of all our blessedness in suffering)<b> He might bring us near to God</b> ( “that He, Himself going to the Father, might bring us who had been alienated, justified, into heaven together with Himself, ver. 22, by the same steps as He trod, of humiliation and exaltation. From this word to ch. iv. 6, St. Peter unites together the course and procession of Christ and the faithful [in which course he himself also followed Christ, according to His prediction John xiii. 36], inserting also the unfaithfulness and punishment of some.” Bengel),<b> put to death</b> (this participial clause gives the manner of that bringing us near to God)<b> indeed in the flesh</b> (of this there ean be no doubt, and in this assertion there is no difficulty.<b> in the flesh,</b> in this region, under these conditions, the death on the cross was inflicted: His flesh, which was living flesh before, became dead flesh: Christ Jesus, the entire complex Person, consisting of body, soul, and spirit, was put to death<i> in the flesh</i>),<b> but made alive [again] in the spirit</b> (here there may seem to be difficulty: but the difficulty will vanish, it we guide ourselves simply and carefully by the former clause. AS regarded the flesh, the Lord was put to death; as regarded the spirit, He was brought to life. Tis flesh was the subject, recipient, vehicle, of inflicted death; His Spirit was the subject, recipient, vehicle, of restored life. But here let us beware, and proceed cautiously. What is asserted is not that the<i> flesh died</i> and the Spirit was<i> made alive;</i> but that as to the flesh the Lord died, as to the Spirit, He was made alive. He, the God-man Christ Jesus, body and soul, ceased to live in the flesh, began to live in the Spirit; ceased to live a fleshly mortal life, began to live a spiritual resurrection life. His own Spirit never died, as the next verse shews us. “This is the meaning, that Christ by His sufferings was taken from the life which is flesh and blood, as a man on earth, living, walking, and standing in flesh and blood…and He is now placed in another life and made alive according to the Spirit, has passed into a spiritual and supernatural life, which includes in itself the whole life which Christ now has in soul and body, so that he has no longer a fleshly but a spiritual body.” Luther. And Hofmann says, “It is the same who dies and the ame who is again made alive, both times the whole Man Jesus, in body and soul. He ceases to live, in that<i> that</i>, which is to His Personality the medium of action, falls under death; and He begins again to live, in that He receives back this same for a medium of His action again. The life which fell under death was a fleshly life, that is, such a life as has its determination to the present condition of man’s nature, to the externality of its mundane connexion. The life which was won back is a spiritual life, that is, such a life as has its determination from the Spirit, in which consists our inner connexion with God.” It is impossible, throughout this difficult and most important passage, to report all the various shades of difference of opinion which even the greater expositors have given us. I shall indicate only those which are necessary to be mentioned as meanings to be distinguished from that which I advocate, or as errors likely to fall constantly under the eye of my readers. Of this latter class is the rendering of the A.V. here, “<i>by the Spirit,</i>” which is wrong both grammatically and theologically):<b> in which</b> (viz. in the spirit, according to which His Jew life was.<i> In which,</i> not<i> by which:</i> see below)<b> He also went and preached</b> (went, used of a local transference here, just as “<i>is gone</i>” [the same word], below in ver. 22: and<b> preached,</b> of a preaching good news, as in all other places of the New Test.)<b> to the spirits in prison</b> (the disembodied spirits, which were kept shut up [Jude 6; 2 Pet. ii. 4] in the place of the departed awaiting the final judgment: in Scheol, as the Jews called it);<b> which were once disobedient</b> (this clause is a secondary and dependent one, descriptive of the spirits intended: that they were those of men who were formerly disobedient),<b> when</b> (marks distinctively the time intended by the word<b> once) the long-suffering of God was waiting</b> (and this marks the period of their disobedience, viz. those 120 years of Gen. vi. 3)<b> in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which</b> (by having entered into which)<b> a few persons, that is, eight souls</b> (individuals)<b> were saved</b> (from drowning)<b> by water</b> (not, “<i>into which a few, &c. got safe through the water,</i>” which was not the fact. The water is in the Apostle’s view, the<i> medium of saving,</i> inasmuch as it bore up the ark: see the next verse). So much for the interpretation of the detail of this passage; from which it will be seen that we have regarded it, in common with the majority of Commentators, as necessarily pointing to an event in our Lord’s redemptive agency which happened, as regards time, in the order of the context here: and that that event was, His going (whether between His death and resurrection, or after the latter, will be presently discussed) to the place of custody of departed spirits, and there preaching to those spirits, which were formerly disobedient when God's long-suffering waited in the days of Noah. Thus far I conceive our passage stand committed: and I do not believe it possible to make it say less, or other, than this. What was the intent of that preaching, and what its effect, is not here revealed; the fact merely is stated. The statement of the fact, however, has been felt to be accompanied by such great difficulties, that other meanings have been sought for the passage than that which the words present at first sight. Expositors have endeavoured to remove the idea that the gospel was preached to the dead in Hades, either 1) by denying the reference to our Lord’s descent thither at all, or 2) by admitting that, but supposing it to have had another purpose. I give, following the classification in Huther’s note, an account of the principal upholders of these views. Under I., I place all those who deny any reference to Christ’s descent into Hades, distinguishing the minor differences between them as to what<i> preaching</i> is there indicated.
