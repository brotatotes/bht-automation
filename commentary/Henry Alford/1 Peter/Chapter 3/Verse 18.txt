<b> 18.]</b><b> Because</b> (not ‘<i>for:</i>’ it docs not only render<i> a reason,</i> but lays down<i> the reason</i> why Christian suffering for well-doing is blessed)<b> Christ also</b> (as well as yourselves if ye be so called as to suffer)<b> suffered for sins</b> (the thought is somewhat similar to that in ch. ii. 21, but the intent of it different: there, it was as an example<i> to us</i> that the sufferings of Christ were adduced: here, it is as a proof of the blessedness and advantage of suffering for well-doing, that proof being closely applied to us by the fact that that suffering was undertaken on our behalf, and that blessedness is our salvation. The words<b> for sins</b> I distinctly hold, with Wiesinger, to come in, as a point of comparison, between Christ and ourselves, under the<b> also,</b> against most Commentators. Considering St. Peter’s love of using the same term in two meanings, of which we have already had several examples, e.g. vv. 9, 14, 15, T have no hesitation in applying the<i> suffering for sins</i> the one time to Christ, the other to ourselves, though His suffering for sin, and ours, are two very different things. He, the sinless One,<i> suffered for sins;</i> as a sacrifice for sin, as a sinner, made sin for us, dying the death of a criminal: we, though not sinless, yet in<i> our well-doing,</i> are to suffer if God’s will so will it,<i> for sins,</i>—for sins which we are supposed to have committed, and as sinners. To miss this, is to miss one of the cardinal points of the comparison)<b> once</b> ( “from this<b> once,</b> through the<i> also,</i>” as has been beautifully said, “a beam of comforting light falls on the sufferings of Christians.” He suffered<i> once:</i> His sufferings are summed up and passed away: He shall suffer no more. And we are suffering “<i>once:</i>” it shall be soon so thought of and looked back upon. For this reason doubtless is the word inserted);<b> a just person</b> (<i>just</i> is purely predicative: not as A.V. ‘<i>the just,</i>’ which again loses the point of comparison)<b> on behalf of unjust [persons]</b> (this again, though the resembling tints are beginning somewhat to fade off, is another point of comparison: He suffered, just, righteous,<i> for unjust ones:</i> He represented, He was offered for, the unjust, the unrighteous: and so we in our turn, though in a far less deep and proper meaning, when we, being<i> just</i> [ver. 12], suffer as<i> unjust,</i> though not in any propitiatory sense<i> for unjust.</i> We have similar uncertainty and play of meaning where the same subject is treated, Rom. vi. 10, 11; it is said that Christ “<i>died to sin,</i>” and “<i>liveth to God;</i>” and we are exhorted thus<i> to count ourselves dead to sin, and living to God:</i> where the two expressions, though they have a common meaning of small extent, are in their widest and most important references of necessity widely divergent),<b> that</b> (with this expression of<i> purpose</i> we leave the comparison, as far as suffering is concerned, returning to it presently for a moment with the fact of His being<i> put to death,</i> and pass up to the<i> blessedness</i> of His innocent suffering, and to that which makes it so glorious and precious to us, as the ground of all our blessedness in suffering)<b> He might bring us near to God</b> ( “that He, Himself going to the Father, might bring us who had been alienated, justified, into heaven together with Himself, ver. 22, by the same steps as He trod, of humiliation and exaltation. From this word to ch. iv. 6, St. Peter unites together the course and procession of Christ and the faithful [in which course he himself also followed Christ, according to His prediction John xiii. 36], inserting also the unfaithfulness and punishment of some.” Bengel),<b> put to death</b> (this participial clause gives the manner of that bringing us near to God)<b> indeed in the flesh</b> (of this there ean be no doubt, and in this assertion there is no difficulty.<b> in the flesh,</b> in this region, under these conditions, the death on the cross was inflicted: His flesh, which was living flesh before, became dead flesh: Christ Jesus, the entire complex Person, consisting of body, soul, and spirit, was put to death<i> in the flesh</i>),<b> but made alive [again] in the spirit</b> (here there may seem to be difficulty: but the difficulty will vanish, it we guide ourselves simply and carefully by the former clause. AS regarded the flesh, the Lord was put to death; as regarded the spirit, He was brought to life. Tis flesh was the subject, recipient, vehicle, of inflicted death; His Spirit was the subject, recipient, vehicle, of restored life. But here let us beware, and proceed cautiously. What is asserted is not that the<i> flesh died</i> and the Spirit was<i> made alive;</i> but that as to the flesh the Lord died, as to the Spirit, He was made alive. He, the God-man Christ Jesus, body and soul, ceased to live in the flesh, began to live in the Spirit; ceased to live a fleshly mortal life, began to live a spiritual resurrection life. His own Spirit never died, as the next verse shews us. “This is the meaning, that Christ by His sufferings was taken from the life which is flesh and blood, as a man on earth, living, walking, and standing in flesh and blood…and He is now placed in another life and made alive according to the Spirit, has passed into a spiritual and supernatural life, which includes in itself the whole life which Christ now has in soul and body, so that he has no longer a fleshly but a spiritual body.” Luther. And Hofmann says, “It is the same who dies and the ame who is again made alive, both times the whole Man Jesus, in body and soul. He ceases to live, in that<i> that</i>, which is to His Personality the medium of action, falls under death; and He begins again to live, in that He receives back this same for a medium of His action again. The life which fell under death was a fleshly life, that is, such a life as has its determination to the present condition of man’s nature, to the externality of its mundane connexion. The life which was won back is a spiritual life, that is, such a life as has its determination from the Spirit, in which consists our inner connexion with God.” It is impossible, throughout this difficult and most important passage, to report all the various shades of difference of opinion which even the greater expositors have given us. I shall indicate only those which are necessary to be mentioned as meanings to be distinguished from that which I advocate, or as errors likely to fall constantly under the eye of my readers. Of this latter class is the rendering of the A.V. here, “<i>by the Spirit,</i>” which is wrong both grammatically and theologically):<b> in which</b> (viz. in the spirit, according to which His Jew life was.<i> In which,</i> not<i> by which:</i> see below)<b> He also went and preached</b> (went, used of a local transference here, just as “<i>is gone</i>” [the same word], below in ver. 22: and<b> preached,</b> of a preaching good news, as in all other places of the New Test.)<b> to the spirits in prison</b> (the disembodied spirits, which were kept shut up [Jude 6; 2 Pet. ii. 4] in the place of the departed awaiting the final judgment: in Scheol, as the Jews called it);<b> which were once disobedient</b> (this clause is a secondary and dependent one, descriptive of the spirits intended: that they were those of men who were formerly disobedient),<b> when</b> (marks distinctively the time intended by the word<b> once) the long-suffering of God was waiting</b> (and this marks the period of their disobedience, viz. those 120 years of Gen. vi. 3)<b> in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which</b> (by having entered into which)<b> a few persons, that is, eight souls</b> (individuals)<b> were saved</b> (from drowning)<b> by water</b> (not, “<i>into which a few, &c. got safe through the water,</i>” which was not the fact. The water is in the Apostle’s view, the<i> medium of saving,</i> inasmuch as it bore up the ark: see the next verse). So much for the interpretation of the detail of this passage; from which it will be seen that we have regarded it, in common with the majority of Commentators, as necessarily pointing to an event in our Lord’s redemptive agency which happened, as regards time, in the order of the context here: and that that event was, His going (whether between His death and resurrection, or after the latter, will be presently discussed) to the place of custody of departed spirits, and there preaching to those spirits, which were formerly disobedient when God's long-suffering waited in the days of Noah. Thus far I conceive our passage stand committed: and I do not believe it possible to make it say less, or other, than this. What was the intent of that preaching, and what its effect, is not here revealed; the fact merely is stated. The statement of the fact, however, has been felt to be accompanied by such great difficulties, that other meanings have been sought for the passage than that which the words present at first sight. Expositors have endeavoured to remove the idea that the gospel was preached to the dead in Hades, either 1) by denying the reference to our Lord’s descent thither at all, or 2) by admitting that, but supposing it to have had another purpose. I give, following the classification in Huther’s note, an account of the principal upholders of these views. Under I., I place all those who deny any reference to Christ’s descent into Hades, distinguishing the minor differences between them as to what<i> preaching</i> is there indicated.<br><br> I. 1. Augustine, Bede, Thomas Aquinas, Lyra, Hammond, Beza, Sealiger, Leighton, &c., and recently Hofmann, maintain that the<b> preaching</b> mentioned was the preaching of righteousness<i> by Noah to his contemporaries:</i> that Noah thus preached not of himself, but by virtue of the Spirit of Christ inspiring him; and that thus his preaching was in fact a preaching by Christ in the Spirit. But this necessitates a forced interpretation of the words<b> in prison;</b> Augustine understanding by them,<i> in the darkness of ignorance as in a prison:</i> Beza, &c., that they<i> are now</i> in prison for their then unbelief. It must be evident to every unprejudiced reader, how alien such au interpretation is from the plain meaning and connexion of the words and clauses. Not a word is indicated by St. Peter on the very far-off lying allusion to the fact that the Spirit of Christ preached in Noah: not a word, here, on fact that Noah himself preached to his contemporaries. Again, the same<i> subject, Christ,</i> runs through the whole, without a hint, that we are dealing with historical matter of fact, in<i> some</i> of the terms, as “<i>suffered,</i>” “<i>put to death,</i>” “<i>made alive,</i>” and with recondite figure in<i> others,</i> as “<i>went and preached.</i>” Again, whether we take the<i> metaphorical prison</i> of Augustine, which I suppose will hardly find any advocates, or the<i> present</i> being in prison of Beza, &c., it cannot surely be doubted that we are equally putting force on the Apostle’s words, and that the<b> spirits in prison</b> must, be taken as describing the local condition of<i> the spirits at the time when the preaching took place.</i> Moreover,<b> went,</b> as compared with ver. 22 (which Hofmann gets most lamely over, by saying that it presents no greater difficulty than the statement that Christ accompanied the Israelites through the wilderness in 1 Cor. x. 4: to which we may answer, If this were a plain statement, involving such an application of the word, we might then discuss the intelligibility of it)—the expression,<b> were once disobedient,</b> marked off as not belonging to the same time as the<i> preaching,</i> shew, as plainly as words can shew, that we are reading of some act of Christ which He<i> then, at the time described, went and did, with reference to spirits who were, at some other time specified, in a certain state.</i> And, which has not been sufficiently noticed, a crowning objection to this view is the use of the word<i> spirits,</i> connecting [<b>wherein,</b> i.e.<i> in the spirit</i>] our Lord’s state with the state of those to whom He preached: a word only used of men when departed out of this life.<br><br> I. 2. Several Commentators, principally Socinian, but also Grotius and others, understand by<b> the spirits in prison</b> either the Gentiles, or the Jews (under the yoke of the law) and Gentiles (under the power of the devil) together, and by the word<b> preached,</b> the preaching of the Spirit of Christ by the Apostles. These expositors take the mention of the disobedient in Noah’s time to be merely by way of sample of the disobedient in all time, or, at least, in the time when the Apostle was writing. As Huther well says, “How this interpretation heaps on caprice upon caprice, need not be shewn.” I will add, that its supporters do not appear to attempt to justify it philologically, as indeed it is plain they cannot. Every word of every clause protests against it.<br><br> II. We now come to those who understand the passage of our Lord’s descent into Hades, but, offended by the idea of the possibility of salvation being opened to spirits of the disobedient kept awaiting judgment, diverge from one another and from the straightforward explanation.<br><br> II. 1. Many understand<b> the spirits in prison</b> of souls awaiting condemnation, but explain<b> preached</b> of announcing, not salvation, but condemnation. But, besides that this verb, as remarked above, has, as applied to Christ and His Apostles, but the one meaning of preaching the good tidings of Salvation,—besides the utter superfluity of such a “preaching” to spirits already reserved to damnation,—what a context would such a meaning give, in the midst of a passage intended to convey consolation and encouragement by the blessed consequences of Christ’s sufferings!<br><br>II. 2. Some of the Fathers, as Irenæus, Tertullian, Hippolytus,—the Schoolmen, Zwingle, Calvin, &c., explain<b> preached</b> rightly, of announcing salvation, but regard<b> the spirits in prison</b> as the spirits of the<i> just</i>, especially of the Old Test. saints. The most extraordinary instance of this class of interpreters is Calvin, who destroys his own explanation, by confessing that the Greek will not bear it.<br><br> II. 3. Estius, Bellarmine, Luther, Peter Martyr, Bengel, &c., assume that the words refer, not to all the unbelievers of Noah’s time, but only to those who repented at the last moment when the flood was upon them.<br><br> II. 4. Athanasius, Ambrose, Erasmus, Calvin, hold both kinds of preaching, the evangelic to the spirits of the just, the damnatory to those of the disobedient.<br><br> One or two singular interpretations do not fall under any of the above classes: e.g. Marcion maintained that the preaching of Christ was to those whom the Old Test. calls ungodly, but who were in reality better than the Old Test. saints; Clement of Alexandria, that they were the<i> just among the philosophers,</i> who were nevertheless imprisoned under idolatry.<br><br> It remains that we should enquire, whether this preaching to the imprisoned spirits by our Lord, took place between His death and His resurrection, or after the latter. The answer will very much depend on the sense which we give to the words<b> in which.</b> The argument which Wiesinger so much insists on, that the clauses must come in chronological sequence, will not determine for us; because<b> in which He also</b> might very well be a taking up again of<b> in the Spirit,</b> recapitulating some former act also done in the Spirit: “put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit,—that Spirit in which also, ere He was made alive with the full resurrection life, He&c.” And this I incline to think the sense of the passage:<b> in which</b> referring not to the complex resurrection life, but properly and strictly to the spirit, in which the Lord never ceased to be, even when His complex life of body and soul was dissolved. When again Wiesinger says that<b> went and preached</b> cannot be understood of the time intermediate, because in no case can we think of our Lord’s state in death in dualistic wise, so that while His body was held by the bands of death, His Spirit should be carrying on the Messianic work,—I answer, why not? Surely the reply to the penitent thief implies a<i> going,</i> and in that going a joy and triumph sufficient to be the subject of a consoling promise at that terrible moment. And might not the reasoning be turned, with as much propriety? Might not we say that it is impossible to conceive of our Lord during that time as<i> other than</i> employed in the spirit in which He continued, not to exist merely, but to live? That, granted that His dying words imply a special delivering of his Spirit into the hands of his Father, and by consequence, a resting of his Spirit in those Hands in the death-state,—yet must we not conceive of His Spirit as going thither, where “the righteous souls are in the hand of God?” And if so, who shall place a limit to His power or will to communicate with any departed spirits of whatever character? So that, while I would not say that the conditions of the passage are are not satisfied by the supposition the event happened after the Resurrection, I believe there can be no reason for saying that they are not, on the other hypothesis. And I own, that the<b> in which</b> also inclines me to this other. It seems most naturally to be taken as a resumptive explanation of<b> in the Spirit,</b> with a view to something (ver. 21) which is to follow; and the in, capable indeed of being otherwise explained, yet seems to favour this idea,—that the Lord was strictly speaking<i> in the Spirit,</i> when that happened which is related.<br><br> From all then which has been said, it will be gathered, that with the great majority of Commentators, ancient and modern, I understand these words to say, that our Lord, in His disembodied state, did go to the place of detention of departed spirits, and did there announce His work of redemption, preach salvation in fact, to the disembodied spirits of those who refused to obey the voice of God when the judgment of the flood was hanging over them. Why these rather than others are mentioned,—whether merely as a sample of the like gracious work on others, or for some special reason unimaginable by us, we cannot say. It is ours to deal with the plain words of Scripture, and to accept its revelations as far as vouchsafed to us. And they are vouchsafed to us to the utmost limit of legitimate inference from revealed facts. That inference every intelligent reader will draw from the fact here announced; it is not purgatory, it is not universal restitution; but it is one which throws blessed light on one of the darkest enigmas of the divine justice: the cases where the final doom seems infinitely out of proportion to the lapse which has incurred it. And as we cannot say to what other cases this<i> preaching</i> may have applied, so it would be presumption in us to limit its occurrence or its efficacy. The reason of mentioning here these sinners, above other sinners, appears to be, their connexion with the type of baptism which follows. If so, who shall say, that the blessed act was confined to them?
