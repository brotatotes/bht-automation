<b> 21.]</b><b> Which</b> (viz.<i> water:</i> not<i> baptism,</i> which does not come in till the end of the clause: nor, the whole fact announced in ver. 20. The construction is somewhat involved by the close connexion of the thing signifying and the thing signified. The<i> water</i> to which<b> which</b> refers is not the water of Noah’s flood, but water, generally, the common term between the type and antitype),<b> the antitype [of that]</b> i.e. simply the<i> corresponding particular</i> in both cases: the word does not contain in itself any solution of the question which of the two, the<i> type</i> or that which is<i> antitype</i> to it, is the original: the same word,<i> antitype</i>, is used in Heb. ix. 24, where, from the context, the<i> type</i> is the primitive, the<i> antitype</i> the representative: here, from the context, it is<i> vice versa:</i> this need not however be expressed, but left to be understood),<b> is now saving</b> (the rescue not being as yet fully accomplished. We are as yet<i> being saved</i> by water)<b> you also</b> (as well as them. Then this assertion having been made, follows the parenthetical explanation, that the method of saving in the<i> antitype</i> is not material, as in the type),<b> even baptism</b> (not,<i> the water of</i> baptism: the parenthesis following is a kind of protest against such a rendering:—but, water, in the form of baptism, become to us baptism.<i> Water</i> is the common term: water saves in both cases. It saved them, being to them a means of floating their ark and bearing them harmless: it saves us, becoming to us baptism: and that baptism not material, but spiritual):<b> not putting away of the filth of the flesh</b> (i. e. “not fleshly putting away of filth.” It is possible that the Apostle may have special reference to the unavailing nature of the Jewish washings, as Justin Martyr says, “What was the profit of that baptism which cleanses the flesh and body only? Be baptized in soul”),<b> but enquiry of a good conscience after God</b> (i. e. the seeking after God in a good and pure conscience, which is the aim and end of the Christian baptismal life. This is the sense of the Greek expression here, in the only other place where it occurs in Scripture, viz. 2 Kings xi. 7. On this view, the<b> enquiry of a good conscience</b> means,—the enquiry which a good conscience makes. Very various have been the interpretations. Some understand the<i> questions used in baptism;</i> others, the<i> request</i> of a good conscience; others, again,<i> prayer to God</i> for a good conscience. The objection to all these is, that they do not justify the expression as applied to the saving force of baptism; as indeed neither entirely does the meaning which I have given above: but where<i> all</i> explanations were unsatisfactory, I thought it best to adopt one which strictly keeps to the Scripture usage of the words, being at the same time full as good as any of the others in its contextual application. The rendering of the A.V., the<i> answer</i> of a good conscience, is entirely unjustifiable, in fact is a pure invention, the word bearing no such meaning),<b>—by means of the resurrection of Jesus Christ</b> (with what are these words to be joined? Grotius, with others, connects them with the immediately preceding. So also Hofmann, saying, “By means of the resurrection of Christ, as the removal of sin once for all for all mankind, it is, that in baptism the prayer for a good conscience is directed to God.” But as Wiesinger objects, it is surely allotting too insignificantly a part to these words, to make them merely assign the method in which the prayer is heard. Most Commentators have joined them with<b> saves,</b> regarding the intervening sentence as parenthetical. Thus taken, the words refer back to “<i>being made alive in the Spirit</i>” in ver. 18, conducting on the course of thought with regard to Christ, and to ourselves: His resurrection, and entrance into His kingdom, giving us, by Him, a living part in Him, and entrance also into His kingdom by means of His appointed sacrament of Holy Baptism, spiritually received):
