<p><strong> 6</strong> .] <strong> As</strong> (e. g.) <strong> Sarah obeyed</strong> (aor. It refers to her whole course of obedience considered as a completed whole: cf. reff., and Joh 17:4 ) <strong> Abraham calling him lord</strong> (ref.: ὁ δὲ κύριός μου πρεσβύτερος ): <strong> of whom ye have become</strong> (i. e. by your implanting through faith into the family of faithful Abraham. The aor. properly refers back to the precise time when they were so made; but cannot be so expressed in English) <strong> children, if</strong> (the connexion of the following participles is variously taken. The worst way is with Bengel, Ernesti, al. to suppose them in apposition with ὑποτασσόμεναι above, ὡς … τέκνα being in a parenthesis: for there is nothing in either of the participles which finds any historical justification in the history of the holy women. Didymus, al., understand them of the manner in which ye are to become Sarah’s children: Harless, Wies., al., of the sign by which your having so become is to be known: but it is perhaps better to take them as the condition on which: and so most Commentators and virtually the E. V. “as long as,” rendering literally the <em> dum</em> of Beza) <strong> ye do good, and are not afraid of any sudden fear</strong> (to what do these words allude? As in reff., they appear to be a citation from Prov.: where it is said to him that obeys the counsels of wisdom, οὐ φοβηθήσῃ πτόησιν ἐπελθοῦσαν , οὐδὲ ὁρμὰς ἀσεβῶν ἐπερχομένας . This passage, the coincidence with which can hardly be fortuitous, seems to point to the objective rather than the subjective sense of πτόησις , so that <strong> φοβεῖσθαι πτόησιν</strong> is not = φοβεῖσθαι φόβον , but πτόησις is some external cause of terror. And such a meaning would suit very well with the context, in which as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:14">1 Peter 3:14</span> , the Apostle is often encouraging his readers to bear affliction and persecution cheerfully. So that we may interpret <strong> πτόησιν</strong> with Est., “quod dum facitis, non est quod metuatis quidquam mali: velut, ne maritis vestris displiceatis, si minus corruptæ inceditis: aut ne serviliter vos tractent, si faciles ad obsequium vos præbeatis; ut solet sexus muliebris vanis pavoribus esse obnoxius. Sed et si forte nacti estis maritos iniquiores, silentio potius ac patientia, quam multis verbis studete eorum animos lenire.” Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:9">Luke 21:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:37">Luke 24:37</span> . Huther quotes from Stephanus an extraordinary explanation, “jubentur mulieres officium facere etiam cum nullus eas metus constringit, i. e. sponte et ultro.” And Œc., interpreting ἀγαθοποιοῦσαι of doing good deeds of benevolence, understands this of the wives not being afraid of the account which their (unbelieving) husbands would require of them: ἐλεήμονας αὐτὰς εἶναι παραινεῖ , μηδὲν ὑποβλεπομένας τὸν ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνδρῶν αὐτῶν διὰ τοῦτο ἐκλογισμόν . See Winer, § 32. 2. <em> b</em> , who however interprets πτόησιν subjectively).

<p>With regard to the much-disputed question whether by the preceding injunction all ornament of dress is forbidden, or only the making such ornament <em> the adorning</em> , it may safely be left to the Christian wisdom of believing women, to be not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is, in this as in other similar matters. Within the limits of propriety and decorum, the common usage is the rule. There is sin in singularity, both as ministering to pride in ourselves, and as giving offence to others and discommending our holy religion. As Leighton well says, “There may be in some an affected pride in the meanness of apparel; and in others, under either neat or rich attire, a very humble unaffected mind.… ‘Magnus qui fictilibus utitur tanquam argento; nec ille minor qui argento tanquam fictilibus,’ says Seneca: Great is he who enjoys his earthenware as if it were plate, and not less great is the man to whom all his plate is no more than earthenware.”</p>
