<b> 7.]</b><i> Duty of husbands to their wives.</i><b> Ye husbands, in like manner</b> (in like manner, i.e., there is a certain<i> honour</i> due to the wife, as to the husband and the master before. This again must be connected with the general precept in ii. 17),<b> dwelling according to knowledge</b> (in an intelligent and reasonable manner, well aware of the<i> weakness</i> spoken of below)<b> with the feminine as with the weaker vessel</b> (some, as the A.V., join these words with<i> giving honour.</i> But this mars the parallelism and the sense. For the Apostle prescribes two things: 1) consideration for the wife, as of the weaker sex: 2) honour for the wife, as a fellow-heir of the grace of life),<b> giving</b> (apportioning)<b> honour as to those who are also</b> (besides being your wives)<b> fellow-inheritors</b> (with you)<b> of the grace of life</b> (i. e. Godâ€™s gracious gift of life eternal: ch. i. 4, 13 suffice to clear the meaning, the former explaining<i> inheritance</i>, the latter,<i> grace</i>):<b> in order that your prayers be not hindered.</b> The hindrance meant seems to be, that which would be occasioned by the man not giving his wife proper honour as a fellow-heir of the grace of life; in which case the peculiar promise of advantage in social united prayer would be lost: see Matt. xviii. 19. According to this view, the united prayers of man and wife are meant. And so most of the Commentators.
