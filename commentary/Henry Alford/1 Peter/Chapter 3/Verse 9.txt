<b>not giving back</b> (in deeds)<b> evil for evil</b> [to others,]<b> or reproach for reproach</b> (in words):<b> nay rather on the contrary, blessing</b> (others. The word<i> blessing,</i> in A.V., is liable to be, and generally is, mistaken for the substantive “<i>a blessing:</i>” whereas it is the participle, as in our text):<b> because to this end</b> (viz. that which follows)<b> ye were called</b> (by God),<b> that ye might inherit blessing</b> (it is not in order to inherit a blessing that we must bless; but because our portion is, blessing: and the reasoning is much as in Eph. iv. 32, “<i>forgiving one another, as God also in Christ forgave you</i>”).
