On <strong> λόγια</strong> , see note, ref. Heb.) <strong> of God: if any one ministereth</strong> (in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span> , we have the several parts of this διακονία laid out), ( διακονοῦντες ) <strong> as</strong> (see above) <strong> out of</strong> (as his store and power of ministration) <strong> the power</strong> (thus to minister) <strong> which God bestoweth</strong> ( ἐπιχορηγέω is commoner than the simple word: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:11">2 Peter 1:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:10">2 Corinthians 9:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:5">Galatians 3:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+2:19">Colossians 2:19</span> ; and ἐπιχορηγία <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:19">Philippians 1:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:16">Ephesians 4:16</span> .

The fact that all things are referred to God and done as of and to Him, is His being glorified in the Christian church. Œc. gives as an altern., ἐν πᾶσιν ἔθνεσιν , which is still more in fault) <strong> God may be glorified through Jesus Christ</strong> (“sicut a Deo per Christum omnia beneficia ad nos descendunt, ita quoque … per Christum omnia ad Dei gloriam referri debent.” Gerh.), <strong> to whom</strong> (viz. to God, as the main subject of the foregoing, and also because ἡ δόξα refers back to δοξάζηται . Grot., Calov., Steiger, al. refer the words to Christ, which is not so natural here, seeing that διὰ Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ is introduced only secondarily. The case is very similar to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:21">Hebrews 13:21</span> , where see note.
