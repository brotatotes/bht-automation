<b> 19.] Wherefore</b> (general conclusion from vv. 17, 18. If the sufferings of Christians as Christians are a sign of God’s favour towards them, in subjecting them to his judgments, with a view to their not perishing with the ungodly world, then have they every reason to trust Him in those sufferings, and to take comfort: continuing in that same well-doing which is their very element and condition)<b> let also them who suffer</b> (<i>also,</i> as well as all other persons)<b> according to</b> (in pursuit of, along the course of)<b> the will of God</b> (see on ch. iii. 17: here especially in reference to our ver. 17, seeing that it is God’s will that judgment should begin at His house),<b> commit</b> (deliver [subjectively] into the hands of, and confidently leave)<b> their souls</b> (their personal safety and ultimate<i> salvation</i>, ver. 18)<b> in</b> (as clad in, accompanied with, subsisting and employed in)<b> well-doing</b> (as contrasted with the opposite characters in ver. 15. Huther says well: “This addition shews that the confident surrender to God is to be joined, not with careless indolence, but with active practice of good”)<b> unto a faithful Creator</b> (in God being our<i> Creator</i>, without whom not a hair falls to the ground, we have an assurance that we are not overlooked by Him: in His being a<i> faithful</i> Creator, whose covenant truth is pledged to us, it is implied that we are within that covenant, suffering according to His will and as His children. This title of God must not be understood of the second creation in the new birth).
