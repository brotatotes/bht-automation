The aim of this verse is well given by Gerhard: “monuit hæc προθεραπεία ipsorum animos, ne perversis et præposteris illis impiorum judiciis ac blasphemis sermonibus turbentur, multo vero minus ad pristinorum vitiorum societatem sese pertrahi patiantur.” They  must give offence to their former companions: for this there is no help)  they are astonished (think it strange, as E.
