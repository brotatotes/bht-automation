<b>to this end to dead men also</b> (as well as to<i> living,</i> which is the ordinary case:<b> and</b> carrying with it a climax,— ‘even to the dead”)<b> was the gospel preached</b> (when, and by Whom, see below),<b> that they might indeed be judged according to men as regards the flesh, but might live on according to God as regards the spirit.</b> In examining into the meaning of this difficult verse, one thing may be laid down at the outset, as certain on any sure principles of exposition; and thereby a whole class of interpretations removed ont of our way. Seeing that<b> for</b> binds vv. 5 and 6 logically together, and that<b> to dead men</b><b> also</b> distinctly takes up the<b> to dead men</b> before in this logical connexion, all interpretations must be false, which do not give to the words<b> the dead</b> in ver. 6 the same meaning as<b> the dead</b> in ver. 5: i.e. that of<i> dead men,</i> literally and simply so called: men who have died and are in their graves. This at once rids us of all the Commentators who interpret this second<b> dead</b> of the<i> dead in trespasses and sins,</i> as well as those who to gain this meaning here, distort<b> dead</b> in ver. 5 from its constant reference in that connexion to mean the spiritually dead, or the Gentiles. A second principle which we may lay down is this: that<b> dead</b> in ver. 6 must be kept as wide in its<i> reference</i> as dead in ver. 5: i.e. that it must not be interpreted as applying merely to the blasphemers of the Christians who should have died before the judgment, or merely to such blasphemed Christians themselves, as shall have then died, or merely to the spirits in prison of ch. iii. 19, but must be treated as a general assertion in the literal meaning of the word. It is quite impossible to put before the English reader the discussion on the different interpretations which have been given, as it mainly turns on considerations of the construction of the sentence in the original, but I may just say this much, that dead cannot mean “<i>now dead,</i>” nor can<b> the gospel was preached</b> point to the time when the gospel was preached to them, before they died: nor again, can the Apostle’s view be to comfort his readers in persecution and slander, by the thought that bodily death would not exempt their adversaries from the divine judgment. The view here adopted is, the persons pointed at are those spirits in prison to whom our Lord went and preached, ch. iii. 19. Our Lord is ready to judge the dead; and with reason; for even they have not been withont opportunity of receiving his gospel: as the example which was adduced in ch. iii. 19 shews. For this end the gospel was preached even to the dead,—that they might—not indeed escape the universal judgment on human sin, which is physical death,—but,<i> that they might be judged</i> [be in the state of the completed sentence on sin, which is death after the flesh]<i> according to</i> [as]<i> man as regards the flesh, but</i> [notwithstanding]<i> might live</i> [of a state to continue]<i> according to God</i> [a life with God, and divine]<i> as regards the spirit.</i> And this interpretation I adopt, believing it to he the only one which satisfies the conditions of the sentence: which justifies the<b> for</b> as accounting for the judging the<b> dead:</b> the<b> also,</b> as taking up, and bringing into prominence and climax the<i> dead:</i> the term<b> dead,</b> as used in precisely the same sense as in the last verse, and contemporary with the verb which governs it: the statement, that<b> the gospel was preached,</b> as grounded on a previously-announced fact, ch. iii. 19: the aim and end introduced by the<b> that,</b> which on this, and on no other rendering, receives meaning and perspicuity. And so, in the main, with minor deviations, the more accurate of the modern Commentators.
