<b> 8.]</b><b> above all things</b> (not placing love above prayer, but because all social life and duty must presuppose love as its necessary bond and condition)<b> having your love towards one another intense</b> (sec ch. i. 22. He presupposes their love, and enjoins that it be fervent or intense)<b>: because love covereth a multitude of sins</b> (from ref. Prov. x. 12, except that there it is “<i>all sins.</i>” As to the meaning, the words here are used in a different reference from that in St. James, where see note. Here it is the hiding of offences [both from one another and in God’s sight: see below] by mutual forbearance and forgiveness, which is meant. This has been recently denied by De Wette and Huther, the former understanding the sins rather as those of the Christian body, which mutual love keeps back from being committed, and the latter not excluding the other meaning. They would understand the words, that love causes God to overlook a multitude of sins. This they do partly on account of the word<i> sins,</i> which they maintain cannot well be applied to the mutual offences of common life [see however Matt. xviii. 15], and partly on account of “because,” which seems to indicate some stimulus by which Christian love is recommended. And doubtless there is something in this latter consideration, especially when we remember that the nearness of the divine judgment is a pressing motive throughout these exhortations. I do not see why we should not take the saying in its widest reference, understanding it primarily perhaps of forgiveness, but then also of that prevention of sin by kindliness of word and deed, and also that intercession for sin in prayer, which are the constant fruits of fervent love. It is a truth from which we need not shrink, that every sin which love hides from man’s sight, is hidden in God’s sight also. There is but one efficient cause of the hiding of sin: but mutual love<i> applies</i> that cause:<i> draws the universal cover over the particular sin.</i> This meaning, as long as it is not perverted into the thought that love towards others covers a man’s own sin by his merits, need not and should net be excluded):—<b>hospitable towards one another</b> (see Rom. xii. 13)<b> without murmuring</b> (see Phil. ii. 14, and note. The opposite to<i> murmuring</i> in hospitality is simple open-heartedness, Rom. xii. 8: the consequence of it, “hidden evil speaking, hateful reproaching with past favours,” as Gerhard says here).
