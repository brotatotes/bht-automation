 12 19 .]  Exhortations (see summary above)  in reference to the trial of affliction which they were to undergo : and that, in view of the end of things. The section falls into three parts: 1) 1 Peter 4:12-13 , these sufferings, as participation in Christ’s sufferings, are to be rejoiced in, as in prospect of participation of His glory also: 2) 14 16 if really sufferings for Christ, the glory of Christ already rests on you: take care then that they  be verily sufferings for Him: 3) 17, 18, these sufferings are a part of the coming judgment which begins at the house of God. Then 1Pe 4:19 concludes. This passage is no repetition of ch. 1Pe 3:13 to 1 Peter 4:6 , which treated of their sufferings with reference to their inflictors: whereas this proceeds wholly on reference to a Christian’s own inner hopes, and considerations within the church itself.
