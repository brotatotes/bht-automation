<b> 1.]</b><b> Elders therefore among you I exhort</b> (the designation<i> elders</i> or<i> presbyters</i> here is evidently an official one [ver. 2], but at the same time reference to age is included: see ver. 5. The<b> therefore</b> takes up the above exhortation ch. iv. 19),<b> who am a fellow-elder</b> (with you: Bengel remarks, that “mutual exhortation among equals and colleagues is of great force”),<b> and witness of the sufferings of Christ</b> (not in the sense of Acts i. 8, 22, ii. 32, x. 39, &c.,—a witness to testify to by words,—nor as Heb. xii. 1; Acts xxii. 20; Rev. ii. 13, xvii. 6, a witness, in bearing about in his own person,—nor both of these together;—but in the sense of an<i> eye-witness</i>, on the ground of which his apostolic testimony rested: I who say to you, “<i>Christ suffered in the flesh</i>,” say this of sufferings which my own eyes saw. Thus this clause links on the following exhortation to the preceding portion of the Epistle concerning Christian suffering, and also tends to justify the<i> therefore</i>),<b> who am also a partaker of the glory which is about to be revealed</b> (I prefer to take this as an allusion to our Lord’s own words John xiii. 36, “<i>Thou shalt follow me afterwards,</i>” rather than regard it as alluding to the Transfiguration, as some, or to the certainty that those who suffer with Him will be glorified with Him. As bearing that promise, he came to them with great weight of authority as an exhorter—having seen the sufferings of which he speaks, and being himself an heir of that glory to which he points onwards),—<b>tend</b> (or keep. It is the same word as in John xxi. 16 [not 15 and 17): see note there)<b> the flock</b> (the verb includes in one word the various offices of a shepherd; the leading, feeding, heeding)<b> of God</b> (see Acts xx. 28. The similitude is among the commonest in Scripture: see Jer. iii. 15, xxiii. 1–4; Ezek. xxxiv. 2 ff.; John x. 11 ff.)<b> which is among you</b> (he orders them to feed the flock of God, not generally, nor ecumenically, but locally, as far as concerned that part of it found among them) [<b>overseeing</b> (it) (this word, “<i>episcopountes,</i>” has perhaps been removed for ecclesiastical reasons, for fear presbyters should be supposed to he, as they really were,<i> episcopoi</i>, bishops)]<b> not constrainedly</b> ( “so, as men do who would be of some other profession if they could afford it, and are consequently idle and cold-hearted in their work”),<b> but willingly</b> (out of love to the great Shepherd, and to the flock. The addition, “<i>according to God</i>,” is curious, and ‘not easily accounted for. It certainly does not, as Huther says, clear up the thought, but rather obscures it. The expression is seldom found; and never in the sense here required)<b>;</b><b> nor yet</b> (brings in a climax each time)<b> with a view to base gain</b> (see Isa. lvi. 11; Jer. vi. 13, viii. 10; Ezek. xxxiv. 2, 3, &c.; and Titus i. 7),<b> but earnestly</b> (prompted by a desire not of gain, but of good to the flock;—rendy and enthusiastic, as [the illustration is Bede’s] the children of Israel, and even the workmen, gave their services eagerly and gratuitously to build the tabernacle of old);<b> nor yet as lording it over</b> (using the rights of a<i> lord</i> for the diminution of the ruled and the exaltation of self. Christian rulers of the church are<i> set over the church</i> (1 Thess. v. 12; Rom. xii. 8],<i> leaders</i> [Luke xxii. 26], but not<i> lords over it</i> [Luke xxii. 25, 26]. One is their<i> lord</i>, and they are His<i> ministering servants</i>)<b> the portions [entrusted to you]</b> (so is the original word (<i>clerus</i>) understood by very many Commentators, and rightly, as is decided by the mention of<i> the flock</i> below. See this meaning defended in my Greek Test.),<b> but becoming patterns of the flock</b> (the tyrannizing could only apply to the portion over which their authority extended, but the good example would be seen and followed by the whole church: hence “<i>your portions</i>” in the prohibition, but “<i>the flock</i>” in the exhortation).<b> And [then] when the chief Shepherd</b> (see ch, ii, 25; Heb. xiii. 20: and compare Ezek. xxxiv. 15, 16, 23; Matt. xxv. 32)<b> is manifested</b> (used by St. Peter in a double reference, to Christ’s first coming, and His second also: see ch. i. 20: so also by St. Paul, Col. iii. 4; 1 Tim. iii. 16: by St. John, 1 John ii. 28, iii. 2, 5, 8. Here clearly of the second coming. It would not be plain, from this passage alone, whether St. Peter regarded the coming of the Lord as likely to occur in the life of these his readers, or not; but as interpreted by the analogy of his other expressions on the same subject, it would appear that he did),<b> ye shall receive the amarantine</b> (the adjective formed from<i> amarantus</i>, the everlasting, or unfading, flower. It does not here mean<i> unfading,</i> but must be rendered strictly,<i> composed of that flower:</i> the word in ch. i. 4 is a different form)<b> crown</b> (reff:)<b> of His glory</b> (or, of glory: but I prefer the other. That we shall share his glory, is a point constantly insisted on by St. Peter: see ver. 1, ch. iv. 13, i. 7: and above all, ver. 10 below. This idea reaches its highest in St. John, with whom the inner unity of the divine life with the life of Christ is all in all. Compare especially 1 John iii. 2f).
