<p><strong> 13</strong> .] <strong> She that is elected together with you in Babylon salutes you</strong> ( <em> who</em> , or <em> what is this?</em> The great majority of Commentators understand it to mean a <em> sister congregation</em> , elect like yourselves, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span> . So [34] al. in digest, E. V., Luth., Calv., Gerhard, Steiger, &amp;c., and the more recent interpreters, De Wette, Huther, Wiesinger. And this perhaps may be a legitimate interpretation. Still it seems hardly probable, that there should be joined together in the same sending of salutation, an <em> abstraction</em> , spoken of thus enigmatically, and a <em> man</em> , Μάρκος ὁ υἱός μου , by name. No mention has occurred in the Epistle of the word ἐκκλησία , to which reference might be made: if such reference be sought for, διασπορά , in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span> , is the only word suitable, and that could hardly be used of the congregation in any particular place. Finally, it seems to be required by the rules of analogy, that in an Epistle addressed to ἐκλεκτοὶ παρεπίδημοι , individually, not gregatim, ἡ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι συνεκλεκτή must be an individual person also. These considerations induce me to accede to the opinion of those, who recognize here the ἀδελφὴ γυνή whom St. Peter περιῆγεν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:5">1 Corinthians 9:5</span> ; and to find, in the somewhat unusual periphrastic way of speaking of her, a confirmation of this view. Bengel, who defends it, adduces ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:7">1 Peter 3:7</span> , where the wives are called συγκληρονόμοι χάριτος ζωῆς . Still, I own, the words ἐν Βαβυλῶνι a little stagger me in this view. But it seems less forced than the other. On the question, <em> what Babylon</em> is intended, whether Rome, or the Chaldæan capital, or some village in Egypt, see Prolegomena, § iv. 10 ff.), <strong> and Marcus my son</strong> (perhaps, and so most have thought, the well-known Evangelist (see Eus. H. E. ii. 15: Orig [35] in Eus. vi. 25: Œc. al.): perhaps the <em> actual son</em> of St. Peter, bearing this name (Œc.-altern., Bengel, al.). The fact of Peter taking refuge in the house of Mary the mother of John Mark ( Act 12:2 ), casts hardly any weight on the side of the former interpretation: but it derives some probability from the circumstance that St. Mark is reported by Eus. l. c., and iii. 39, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:8">1 Peter 5:8</span> , vi. 14, 25, to have been the ἀκόλουθος and μαθητής and ἑρμηνευτὴς Πέτρου , on the authority of Papias and Clement of Alexandria: and that Irenæus (Hær. iii. 11, p. 174, Eus. 1Pe 5:8 ) reports the same. The <strong> υἱός</strong> is understood either spiritually or literally, according as one or other of the above views is taken).

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [34] The CODEX SINAITICUS. Procured by Tischendorf, in 1859, from the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai. The Codex Frederico-Augustanus (now at Leipsic), obtained in 1844 from the same monastery, is a portion of the same copy of the Greek Bible, the 148 leaves of which, containing the entire New Testament, the Ep. of Barnabas, parts of Hermas, and 199 more leaves of the Septuagint, have now been edited by the discoverer. A magnificent edition prepared at the expense of the Emperor of Russia appeared in January, 1863, and a smaller edition containing the N.T. &amp;c., has been published by Dr. Tischendorf. The MS. has four columns on a page, and has been altered by several different correctors, one or more of whom Tischendorf considers to have lived in the sixth century. The work of the original scribe has been examined, not only by Tischendorf, but by Tregelles and other competent judges, and is by them assigned to the <em> fourth</em> <em> century</em> . The internal character of the text agrees with the external, as the student may judge for himself from the readings given in the digest. The principal correctors as distinguished by Tischendorf are: A, of the same age with the MS. itself, probably the corrector who revised the book, before it left the hands of the scribe, denoted therefore by us א -corr 1 ; B (cited as א 2 ), who in the first page of Matt. began inserting breathings, accents, &amp;c., but did not carry out his design, and touched only a few later passages; C a (cited as א 3a ) has corrected very largely throughout the book. Wherever in our digest a reading is cited as found in א 1 , it is to be understood, if no further statement is given, that C a altered it to that which is found in our text; C b (cited as א 3b ) lived about the same time as C a , i.e. some centuries later than the original scribe. These are all that we need notice here 6 .
