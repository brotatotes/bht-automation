<b> 13.] She that is elected together with you in Babylon salutes you</b> (<i>who</i>, or<i> what is this?</i> The great majority of Commentators understand it to mean a<i> sister congregation,</i> elect like yourselves, ch. i. 1. And this perhaps may be a legitimate interpretation. Still it seems hardly probable, that there should be joined together in the same sending of salutation, an<i> abstraction</i>, spoken of thus enigmatically, and a<i> man, Mark my son,</i> by name. No mention has occurred in the Epistle of the word<i> church</i>, to which reference might be made: if such reference be sought for,<i> the dispersion,</i> in ch. i. 1, is the only word suitable, and that could hardly be used of the congregation in any particular place. Finally, it seems to be required by the rules of analogy, that in an Epistle addressed to<i> elect strangers</i> or<i> sojourners</i>, individually, not aggregately, “<i>she that is elected together with them,</i>” must be an individual person also. These considerations induce me to accede to the opinion of those, who recognize here the believing sister whom St. Peter<i> led about, being his wife</i>, 1 Cor. ix. 5: and to find, in the somewhat unusual periphrastic way of speaking of her, a confirmation of this view. Still, I own, the words “<i>in Babylon</i>” a little stagger me in this view. But it seems less forced than the other. On the question,<i> what Babylon</i> is intended, whether Rome, or the Chaldean capital, or some village in Egypt, see Introduction,§iv.),<b> and Mark my son</b> (perhaps, and so most have thought, the well-known Evangelist: perhaps the<i> actual son</i> of St. Peter, bearing this name. The fact of Peter taking refuge in the house of Mary the mother of John Mark (Acts xii. 2), casts hardly any weight on the side of the former interpretation: but it derives some probability from the circumstance that St. Mark is reported by Eusebius to have been the<i> follower</i> and<i> disciple</i> and<i> interpreter</i> of<i> Peter</i>, on the authority of Papias and Clement of Alexandria: and that Irenæus reports the same. The word “<i>son</i>” is understood either spiritually or literally, according as one or other of the above views is taken).
