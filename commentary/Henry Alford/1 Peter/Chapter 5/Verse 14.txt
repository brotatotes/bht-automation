<b> 14.] Salute one another in</b> (as the medium of salutation)<b> a kiss of love</b> (see on Rom. xvi. 16, where, as every where except here, “<i>an holy kiss</i>” is the expression).<b> Peace be to you all that are in Christ</b> (the concluding blessing of St. Paul is usually<i> grace</i>, not<i> peace:</i> see [Rom. xvi. 24] 1 Cor. xvi, 23; 2 Cor. xiii. 13; Gal. vi. 18; Eph. vi. 24 [where however “<i>peace be to the brethren,</i>”<i>&c.</i> precedes]; Phil. iv. 23; Col. iv. 18; 1 Thess. v. 28; 2 Thess. iii. 18; 1 Tim. vi. 21; 2 Tim. iv. 22; Titus iii. 15: Philem. 25 [Heb. xiii. 25]. Gerhard says well that the formula came into use from the salutation of Christ after the Resurrection. The blessing differs also from those in St. Paul, in the limitation implied by<b> you all that are in Christ,</b> whereas St. Paul has ever “<i>with you all.”</i> Here it is, “Peace to you, I mean, all that are, and in as far as they are, in Christ;” in union and communion with Him. “<i>That are in Christ</i>” is quite in St. Paul’s manner: compare Rom. viii. 8; xvi. 7; 2 Cor. v. 17. See also our ch. iii. 16; v. 10).
