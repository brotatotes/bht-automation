Rom. where, as every where except here, φίλημα ἅγιον is the expression. For a full account of the custom, see Winer, Realw. art. <em> Kuss</em> ). <strong> Peace be to you all that are in Christ</strong> (the concluding blessing of St. Paul is usually χάρις , not εἰρήνη : cf.

Here it is, “peace to you, I mean, all that are, and in as far as they are, in Christ;” in union and communion with Him. <strong> τοῖς ἐν χριστῷ</strong> is quite in St. Paul’s manner, cf. reff. See also our ch. 1Pe 3:16 , 1Pe 5:10 ).</p>
