 14 .]  Salute one another in (as the medium of salutation)  a kiss of love (see on ref. Rom. where, as every where except here, φίλημα ἅγιον is the expression. For a full account of the custom, see Winer, Realw. art.  Kuss ).  Peace be to you all that are in Christ (the concluding blessing of St. Paul is usually χάρις , not εἰρήνη : cf. ( Rom 16:24 ) 1 Corinthians 16:23 ; 2 Corinthians 13:13 ; Galatians 6:18 ; Ephesians 6:24 (where however εἰρήνη τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς κ . τ . λ . precedes); Philippians 4:23 ; Col 4:18 ; 1 Thessalonians 5:28 ; 2 Thessalonians 3:18 ; 1Ti 6:21 ; 2 Timothy 4:22 ; Titus 3:15 ; Philemon 1:25 ( Heb 13:25 ). “Formula petita,” says Gerhard, “ex salutatione Christi præsertim post resurrectionem usitata.” The blessing differs also from those in St. Paul, in the limitation implied by ὑμῖν πᾶσιν τοῖς ἐν χριστῷ , whereas St. Paul has ever μετὰ πάντων ὑμῶν . Here it is, “peace to you, I mean, all that are, and in as far as they are, in Christ;” in union and communion with Him.  τοῖς ἐν χριστῷ is quite in St. Paul’s manner, cf. reff. See also our ch. 1Pe 3:16 , 1Pe 5:10 ).
