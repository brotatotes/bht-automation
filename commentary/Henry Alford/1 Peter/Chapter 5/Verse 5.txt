<b> 5.]</b><b> In like manner</b> (i. e. ‘<i>mutatis mutandis,’</i> in your turn: see ch. iii. 7: with the same recognition of your position and duties),<b> ye younger, be subject to the elders</b> (in what sense are we to take “<i>younger</i>” and “<i>elders</i>” here? One part of our answer will be very clear: that “<i>elders</i>” must be in the same sense as above, viz., in its official historical sense of presbyters in the church. This being so, we have now some clue to the meaning of “<i>ye younger:</i>” viz. that it cannot mean younger in age merely, though this, as regarded<i> men</i>, would generally be so, but that as the name<i> elder</i> had an official sense, of superintendents of the church, so<i> younger</i> likewise, of those who were the ruled, the disciples of the<i> elders</i>. Thus taken, it will mean here, the rest of the church, as opposed to the<i> elders</i>).<b> Yea</b> (the A.V. happily thus gives the sense, i.e., Why should I go on giving these specific injunctions, when one will cover them all?),<b> all gird on humility one to another</b> (an allusion to our Lord’s action of girding Himself with a napkin in the servile ministration of washing the disciples’ feet: of which He himself said, that He had given them an example to do as He did. The impression made on St. Peter by this proof of his Master’s love is thus beautifully shewn. The verb rendered<b> gird on</b> is variously interpreted. Its derivation is from the string or band attached to a garment to tie it with)<b>: because</b> (reason why you should gird on humility)<b> God</b> (the citation agrees verbatim with James iv. 6)<b> opposeth Himself to the proud</b> (this was a common saying even among the heathen moralists)<b>, but giveth grace to the humble</b> (here in a subjective sense, the lowly-minded, those who by their humility are low).
