<b> Chap. I. 1.</b>] ADDRESS AND GREETING. The Apostle names Silvanus and Timothy with himself, as having with him founded the church at Thessalonica, see Acts xvi. 1; xvii. 14. Silvanus is placed before Timothy, then a youth (Acts xvi. 1 f., see further in Introd. to 1 Tim.§i. 3, 4), as being one “<i>chief among the brethren</i>” (Acts xv. 22, 32; xviii. 5), and a<i> prophet</i> (ib. xv. 32, see also 2 Cor. i. 19; 1 Pet. v. 12). He does not name himself<i> an Apostle</i>, probably because his Apostleship needed not any substantiation to the Thessalonians. For the same reason he omits the designation in the Epistle to the Philippians.<br><br><b> unto the church</b>] So in 2 Thess., Gal., 1 and 2 Cor.: in the other Epistles, viz, Rom., Eph., Col., Phil., more generally, e.g.,— “<i>to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints</i>.” This is most probably accounted for by the circumstances of, the various Epistles. We may notice that the genitive plural of the<i> persons constituting the church</i> occurs only in the addresses of these two Epistles. We may render ‘of Thessalonians,’ or ‘of the Thessalonians:’ better the former.<br><br><b> in God the Father</b> marks them as not being heathens,—and<b> the Lord</b><b> Jesus Christ</b> as not being Jews.—The<b> in</b>, as usual, denotes<i> communion</i> and<i> participation</i><i> in</i>, as the element of spiritual life. “Grace and peace from God be unto you, that you who are deprived of human favour and secular peace, may have both these with God.” Anselm. The words which follow in the A.V., are not yet added in this, St. Paul’s first Epistle. Afterwards they become a common formula with him.
