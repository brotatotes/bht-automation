<b> Chap. I. 1.</b>] ADDRESS AND GREETING. The Apostle names Silvanus and Timothy with himself, as having with him founded the church at Thessalonica, see Acts xvi. 1; xvii. 14. Silvanus is placed before Timothy, then a youth (Acts xvi. 1 f., see further in Introd. to 1 Tim.§i. 3, 4), as being one “<i>chief among the brethren</i>” (Acts xv. 22, 32; xviii. 5), and a<i> prophet</i> (ib. xv. 32, see also 2 Cor. i. 19; 1 Pet. v. 12). He does not name himself<i> an Apostle</i>, probably because his Apostleship needed not any substantiation to the Thessalonians. For the same reason he omits the designation in the Epistle to the Philippians.
