<b> 2—III. 13.</b>] FIRST PORTION OF THE EPISTLE,<i> in which he pours out his heart to the Thessalonians respecting all the circumstances</i><i> of their reception of and adhesion</i><i> to the faith</i>.<br><br><b> 2.</b>]<b> We give thanks</b>, coming so immediately after the mention of Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, can hardly be here understood of the Apostle alone, as it is by many Commentators. For undoubted as it is that he often, e.g. ch. iii. 1, 2, where see note, uses the plural of himself alone, yet it is as undoubted that he uses it also of himself and of his fellow-labourers—e. g., 2Cor. i. 18, 19.<br><br><b> always for you all</b>] We have the same alliteration Eph. v. 20. On the latter words in this verse, see Rom. i. 9 f.<br><br><b> unceasingly</b> seems, by the nearly parallel place, Rom. i. 9, to belong to<i> what goes before</i>, not to<i> what follows</i>. Such a formula would naturally repeat, itself, as far as specifications of this kind are concerned.
