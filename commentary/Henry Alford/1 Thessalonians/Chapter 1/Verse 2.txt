 2 .]  εὐχαριστοῦμεν , coming so immediately after the mention of Paul, Silvanus, and Timotheus, can hardly be here understood of the Apostle alone, as Pelt, Conyb. and Hows., Jowett, al. For undoubted as it is that he often, e.g. ch. 1 Thessalonians 3:1-2 , where see note, uses the plural of himself alone, yet it is as undoubted that he uses it also of himself and his fellow-labourers e.g., 2 Corinthians 1:18-19 . And so De W., Lünemann, al., take it here.
	 πάντοτε περὶ πάντων ] We have the same alliteration Ephesians 5:20 . These words belong to εὐχαριστ ., not to μνείαν ποι . On these latter words see Romans 1:9 f.
	 ἀδιαλείπτως seems by the nearly parallel place, Romans 1:9 , to belong to μνείαν ὑμ . ποι ., not to μνημονεύοντες , as Lün., Pelt, al. Such a formula would naturally repeat itself, as far as specifications of this kind are concerned. Still it must be borne in mind, that the order there is slightly different.
