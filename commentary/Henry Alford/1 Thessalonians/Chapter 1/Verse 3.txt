<p><strong> 3</strong> .] μνημον . is not intransitive, as Erasm.-Schmid, al.: but as in reff.: ‘ <em> commemorantes</em> ,’ Beza. <strong> ὑμῶν</strong> is by Œcum., Calv., al., regarded as the genitive after μνημον . standing alone, and ἕνεκα supplied before the other genitives. But such a construction may be doubted, and at all events it is much simpler here to regard ὑμ . as the genitive governed by τοῦ ἔργου , … τοῦ κόπου , and τῆς ὑπομονῆς , and prefixed, as belonging to all three, <strong> πίστις</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> ἀγάπη</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> ἐλπίς</strong> , are the three great Christian graces of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:0">1 Corinthians 13:0</span> .

<p><strong> τοῦ ἔργου τῆς πίστεως</strong> ] Simple as these words are, all sorts of strange meanings have been given to them. Koppe and Rosenmüller hold τ . ἔργου to be pleonastic: Calv., Calov., al., render (ungrammatical) ‘ <em> your faith wrought by God</em> ;’ Kypke, ‘ <em> the reality</em> ( ἔργ . as contrasted with λόγος ) <em> of your faith</em> ;’ Chrys., Thl., Thdrt, Œc., al., ‘ <em> the endurance of your faith in suffering</em> :’ &amp;c. Comparing the words with the following genitives, they seem to mean, ‘that work (energetic activity) which faith brings forth’ (as Chrys. ἡ πίστις διὰ τῶν ἔργων δείκνυται : the gen., as also those following, being thus a <em> possessive</em> one: see Ellicott here): q.d. ‘the activity of your faith:’ see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:11">2 Thessalonians 1:11</span> ; or perhaps, as Jowett (but not so well), “ ‘your work of faith,’ i.e. the Christian life, which springs from faith:” thus making the gen. one of <em> origin</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> τοῦ κόπου</strong> ] probably <em> towards the sick and needy strangers</em> , cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:35">Acts 20:35</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:6">Romans 16:6</span> ; Rom 16:12 not <em> in the word and ministry</em> (De W.), cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:12">1 Thessalonians 5:12</span> ; which is irrelevant here. τῆς ἀγάπ . not as <em> springing from</em> , but as <em> belonging to</em> , love, <em> characterizing</em> it (Lün.): see above.
	</p>
<p><strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὑπομ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τῆς ἐλπίδος</strong> ] <strong> your endurance of hope</strong> i.e. endurance (in trials) which belongs to (see above), characterizes, your hope; and also nourishes it, in turn: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:4">Romans 15:4</span> , ἵνα διὰ τῆς ὑπομονῆς , κ . διὰ τῆς παρακλήσεως τῶν γραφῶν τὴν ἐλπίδα ἔχωμεν .
	</p>
<p><strong> τοῦ κυρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἰ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> χ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] specifies the hope that it is a hope of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ (cf. 1Th 1:10 ). Olsh. refers the words to all three preceding substantives but this seems alien from St. Paul’s style. On all three Jowett says well, ‘your faith, hope, and love; a faith that had its outward effect on your lives: a love that spent itself in the service of others: a hope that was no mere transient feeling, but was content to wait for the things unseen when Christ should be revealed.’

<p><strong> ἔμπρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πατρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] belongs most naturally to μνημονεύοντες <strong> making mention … before God</strong> : not to the genitives preceding (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:17">Romans 4:17</span> ; Rom 14:22 ), as Thdrt., al.</p>
