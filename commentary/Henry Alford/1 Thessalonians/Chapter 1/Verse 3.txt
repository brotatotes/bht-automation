<b> 3.</b>]<b> faith, love, hope</b>, are the three great Christian graces of 1 Cor. xiii. See also ch. v. 8; Col. i. 4, 5.<br><br><b> the labour of your love</b>] probably<i> towards the sick and needy strangers</i>, compare Acts xx. 35; Rom. xvi. 6, 12.<b> of... love</b>, not as<i> springing from</i>, but as<i> belonging to</i>, love,—<i>characterizing</i> it.<b> the endurance</b> (or,<b> patience</b>)<b> of your hope</b>—i. e. endurance (in trials) which belongs to (see above), characterizes, your hope; and also nourishes it, in turn: compare Rom, xv. 4.<br><br><b> of our</b><b> Lord Jesus Christ</b>] specifies the hope—that it is a hope of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ (compare ver. 10). Olshausen refers the words to all three ceding substantives—but this seems alien from St. Paul’s style. On all the three Jowett says well, “Your faith, hope, and love; a faith that had its outward effect on your lives: a love that spent itself in the service of others: a hope that was no mere transient feeling, but was content to wait for the things unseen when Christ should be revealed.”<br><br><b> before God</b> connects most naturally with ver. 2—<b>making mention.... before God</b>: not to the genitives preceding (see Rom. iv. 17; xiv. 22).
