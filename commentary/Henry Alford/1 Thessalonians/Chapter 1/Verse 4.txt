 4 .]  εἰδότες refers back to μνημονεύοντες ;  in that we know or  for we know . Thdrt., Erasm., Grot., al., take it for οἴδατε γάρ , or εἰδότες ἐστέ , wrongly referring it to the Thessalonians: Pelt joins it with μνείαν ποιούμενοι : but the construction as above seems the best.  ὑπὸ θεοῦ belongs to ἠγαπημένοι , as in 2 Thessalonians 2:13 , see also Romans 1:7 ; not to εἰδότες , as Est. thinks possible ( ὑπό for παρά ?), nor to ἐκλογήν either as E. V., ‘  your election of God ,’ which is ungrammatical (requiring τὴν ὑπ . θ . ἐκ .), or as Œc., Thl., all., ὑπὸ θ . τὴν ἐκλ . ὑμ . ( εἶναι ), which would introduce an irrelevant emphasis on ὑπὸ θεοῦ .
	 ἐκλογή must not be softened down: it is the  election unto life of individual believers by God, so commonly adduced by St. Paul (reff.: and 1 Corinthians 1:27 ; 2Th 2:13 ).
	 ὑμῶν , objective genitive after ἐκλογήν knowing that God ἐξελέξατο ὑμᾶς .
