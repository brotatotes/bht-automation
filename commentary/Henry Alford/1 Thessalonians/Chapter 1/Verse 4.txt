<b> 4.] knowing</b> refers back to<i> remembering</i>,<b> in that we know</b>—or,<b> for we know</b>. It must not be paraphrased “<i>in that</i><i> ye</i><i> know</i>,” as some have done. The words<b> by</b><b> God</b> belong to “<i>beloved</i>,” as in 2 Thess. ii. 13, see also Rom. i. 7: not, as A.V., to “<i>your election</i>,” which is an ungrammatical rendering.<br><br> The word<b> election</b> must not be softened down: it is the election unto life of individual believers by God, so commonly adduced by St. Paul (reff.: and 1 Cor. i. 27.<br><br><b> your election</b>, i.e.<b> the election of you</b>: knowing that God elected you.
