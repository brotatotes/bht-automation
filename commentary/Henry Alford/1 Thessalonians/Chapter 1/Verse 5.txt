<b> 5. Because</b>] Verses 5, 6 ff. are meant not to explain<i> wherein</i> their election<i> consisted</i>, but to give reasons in matter of fact for concluding the existence of that election. These reasons are (1) the power and confidence with which he and Silvanus and Timothy preached among them (ver. 5), and (2) the earnest and joyful manner in which the Thessalonians received it (vv. 6 ff.). Both these were signs of God’s grace to them—tokens of their election vouchsafed by Him.<br><br><b> our gospel</b>] i.e. the gospel which we preached.<br><br><b> came unto you</b>] literally,<b> became to you</b>—proved to be, in its approach to you. The preposition<b> in</b>, thrice repeated, indicates the form and manner in which the<i> preaching</i><i> was carried on</i>, not that in which the Thessalonians received it, which is not treated till ver. 6.<br><br><b> in power</b>] not ‘<i>in miracles</i>,’ but<b> in power</b> of utterance and of energy.<br><br><b> and in the Holy Ghost</b>] i.e. not only in force and energy, but<b> in</b><b> the Holy Ghost</b>—in a manner which could only be ascribed to the operation of the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b> in much confidence</b> (of faith). This confidence (see above) was that in which<i> Paul and Silvanus and</i><i> Timothy preached to them</i>: not<b> that in</b><b> which they</b><i><b> received</b></i><b> the preaching.</b><br><br><b> even as, &c.</b>] Appeal to their knowledge that the fact was so. These words restrict the foregoing to the<i> preachers</i>, as explained above. This interpretation is fixed by the term<b> even as</b>, referring back to the whole previous description,<br><br><b> what manner of men we proved</b>] The point of the fact appealed to is, the proof given, what manner of men they were, by the manner of their preaching. “The<i> quality</i> was evinced, in the power and confidence with which they delivered their message.” Ellicott:<i> the proof given by the manner of their preaching.</i><br><br><b> for your sakes</b>] conveying the purpose of the Apostle and his colleagues, and in the background also<i> the purpose of</i> GOD— ‘you know what God enabled us to be,—how mighty in preaching the word,—for your sakes—thereby proving that He loved you, and had chosen you for His own.’
