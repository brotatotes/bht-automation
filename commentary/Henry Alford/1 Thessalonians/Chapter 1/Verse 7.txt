There is no reference, as Theodoret thinks, to the<i> Greeks</i> being “very great nations, and admired for wisdom,” and so<i> their praise</i> being the greater: these are mentioned simply because the Apostle had been, since their conversion, in Macedonia, and had left Silvanus and Timothy there,—and was now in Achaia.
