	 περὶ ἡμῶν ]  concerning US, Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus; not as Lün., ‘  us both ,’ including the Thessalonians. This he does, to square the following clauses, which otherwise are not correspondent: but there are two objections to his view: (1) the emphatic position of  περὶ ἡμῶν , which seems to necessitate its keeping its strict meaning: (2) that it would in this case have been much more naturally ὑμῶν than ἡμῶν , as the second person has prevailed throughout, and our εἴσοδος to you was quite as much a matter happening to you as to us. That καὶ περὶ ὑμῶν , πῶς should be abbreviated as we find it, will surely not surprise any one familiar with the irregularities, in point of symmetry, of St. Paul’s style.
	The ἀπαγγελλόμενα here correspond to the two members of the above proof, 1 Thessalonians 1:5-6 .  ὁποίαν has no reference to  danger , as Chrys., al.  εἴσοδος merely  access , in the way of  coming to them : see ch. 1 Thessalonians 2:1 ; not of itself  facilis aditus , as Pelt.  πῶς , merely  how that , introducing matter of fact, not ‘  how ,’ ‘in what manner,’ how joyfully and energetically, as Lünem.: if so, the long specification ( πρὸς … ἐρχομένης ), which follows the (thus) unemphatic verb, drags wearily: whereas, regarded as indicating matter of fact only, the  πῶς is unemphatic, and the matter of fact itself, carrying the emphasis, justifies the full statement which is made of it.
