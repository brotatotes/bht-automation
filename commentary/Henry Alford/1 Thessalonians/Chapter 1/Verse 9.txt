<p><strong> περὶ ἡμῶν</strong> ] <strong> concerning</strong> US, Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus; not as Lün., ‘ <em> us both</em> ,’ including the Thessalonians. This he does, to square the following clauses, which otherwise are not correspondent: but there are two objections to his view: (1) the emphatic position of <strong> περὶ ἡμῶν</strong> , which seems to necessitate its keeping its strict meaning: (2) that it would in this case have been much more naturally ὑμῶν than ἡμῶν , as the second person has prevailed throughout, and our εἴσοδος to you was quite as much a matter happening to you as to us. That καὶ περὶ ὑμῶν , πῶς should be abbreviated as we find it, will surely not surprise any one familiar with the irregularities, in point of symmetry, of St. Paul’s style.

<p>The ἀπαγγελλόμενα here correspond to the two members of the above proof, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:5-6">1 Thessalonians 1:5-6</span> . <strong> ὁποίαν</strong> has no reference to <em> danger</em> , as Chrys., al. <strong> εἴσοδος</strong> merely <strong> access</strong> , in the way of <em> coming to them</em> : see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:1">1 Thessalonians 2:1</span> ; not of itself <em> facilis aditus</em> , as Pelt. <strong> πῶς</strong> , merely <strong> how that</strong> , introducing matter of fact, not ‘ <em> how</em> ,’ ‘in what manner,’ how joyfully and energetically, as Lünem.: if so, the long specification ( πρὸς … ἐρχομένης ), which follows the (thus) unemphatic verb, drags wearily: whereas, regarded as indicating matter of fact only, the <strong> πῶς</strong> is unemphatic, and the matter of fact itself, carrying the emphasis, justifies the full statement which is made of it.
