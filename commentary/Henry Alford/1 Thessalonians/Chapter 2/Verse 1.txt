<b> 1.</b>]<b> For</b> refers back to ch. i. 9: ‘not only do strangers report it, but you know it to be true.’ He makes use now of that knowledge to carry out the description of his preaching among them, with a view, by recapitulating these details, to confirm them, who were as yet but novices, in the faith.<br><br><b> in vain</b>] or,<b> empty</b>. It is evident from vv. 2 ff., that this does not here apply to the<i><b> fruits</b></i>, but to the<i> character</i> of his<b> preaching</b>: the<i> result</i> does not appear till ver. 13, And within this limitation, we may observe that the verb is<b> hath been</b>, not<i> was</i>; to be understood therefore not of any mere intent of the Apostle at the time of his coming among them, but of some abiding character of his preaching. It probably expresses, that his<i> entering in</i> was and continued ‘<i>no empty scheme</i>’ ( ‘<i>no light matter</i>,’ as we say), but an earnest, bold, self-denying endeavour for their good. This he proceeds to prove.
