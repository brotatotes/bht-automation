<p><strong> 1</strong> .] <strong> γάρ</strong> refers back to ὁποίαν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:9">1 Thessalonians 1:9</span> ; ‘not only do strangers report it, but you know it to be true.’ He makes use now of that knowledge to carry out the description of his preaching among them, with a view, by recapitulating these details, to confirm them, who were as yet but novices, in the faith.

<p><strong> κενή</strong> ] It is evident from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span> ff., that this does not here apply to the <em> fruits</em> , but to the <em> character</em> of his preaching: the <em> result</em> does not appear till <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:13">1 Thessalonians 2:13</span> . And within this limitation, we may observe that the verb is <strong> γέγονεν</strong> , not ἐγένετο ; to be understood therefore not of any mere intent of the Apostle at the time of his coming among them, but of some abiding character of his preaching. It cannot then be understood as Koppe, ‘ <em> veni ad vos eo consilio … ut vobis prodessem, non ut otiose inter vos viverem</em> :’ and nearly so Rosenm. It probably expresses, that his εἴσοδος was and continued ‘ <em> no empty scheme</em> ’ (‘ <em> no light matter</em> ,’ as we say; οὐχ ἡ τυχοῦσα , Chrys.), but an earnest, bold, self-denying endeavour for their good. This he proceeds to prove.</p>
