	 ὁσίως κ  .   δικ  . ] Cf. Plato, Gorg. p 507 A, B, καὶ μὴν περὶ μὲν ἀνθρώπους τὰ προσήκοντα πράττων δίκαι ʼ ἂν πράττοι , περὶ δὲ θεοὺς ὅσια , and Polyb. xxiii. 10. 8, παραβῆναι κ . τὰ πρὸς τοὺς ἀνθρώπους δίκαια κ . τὰ πρὸς τ . θεοὺς ὅσια . This distinction, perhaps “precarious” (Ellic.) where the words occur separately, or seem to require no very precise application, is requisite here where both divine and human testimony is appealed to.
	 ὑμῖν τ  .   πιστ  . ] not the dat. commodi (Ellic.), nor ‘  towards you believers,’ nor is it governed by ἀμέμπτως , but as Œc., Thl., Lünem., dat. of the  judgment , as in 2 Peter 3:14 , σπουδάσατε ἄσπιλοι κ . ἀμώμητοι αὐτῷ εὑρεθῆναι . For otherwise we lose the force of the slight emphasis on  ὑμ  .   τοῖς πιστ  . , q. d. ‘whatever we may have seemed to the unbelieving:’ “tametsi aliis non ita videremur,” Bengel. See Bernhardy, p. 337 f. The charge of  want of point , brought by Jowett against the words to τοῖς πιστεύουσιν , hence appears to be unfounded. The former verse having referred to external occupation, in which he must have consorted with unbelievers, he here narrows the circle, to speak of his behaviour among the brethren themselves.
