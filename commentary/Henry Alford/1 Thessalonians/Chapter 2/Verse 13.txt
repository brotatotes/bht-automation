<p><strong> 13</strong> .] <strong> διὰ τοῦτο</strong> is best and most simply referred, with Lünem., to the fact announced in the preceding words viz. that God καλεῖ ὑμᾶς εἰς , &amp;c. Seeing that He is thus calling you, your thorough reception of His word is to us a cause of thanksgiving to Him. That διὰ τοῦτο is made thus ‘to refer to a mere appended clause’ (Ellic.) is no objection: see above on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span> . It is surely not possible with Jowett, to refer διὰ τοῦτο ‘to the verses both before and after.’

<p><strong> ἀκοῆς παρ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἡμῶν</strong> is perhaps to be taken together <strong> of hearing</strong> (genitive of apposition) <strong> from us</strong> i.e. ‘which you heard from us.’ So Est., Pelt, Olsh., Lünem., all. Or <strong> παραλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> παρ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἡμῶν</strong> may be taken together, as De W., strongly objecting to the construction ἀκοῆς παρ ʼ ἡμῶν , and understanding by λόγος ἀκοῆς the preached word ( <em> Wort der Künde</em> ). Lünem. answers, that the construction ἀκοῆς παρ ʼ ἡμῶν is unobjectionable, as ἀκούειν παρά τινος occurs <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:41">John 1:41</span> , al., and substantives and adjectives often retain in construction the force of the verbs from which they are derived (Kühner, ii. 217, cites from Plato, Alcib. ii. p. 141, οἶμαι δὲ οὐκ ἀνήκοον εἶναι ἔνιά γε χθιζά τε καὶ πρώϊζα γεγενημένα ): that De W.’s rendering is objectionable, because thus no reason is given for separating παρ ʼ ἡμῶν from παραλ ., and because ἀκοῆς is superfluous and vapid if the same is already expressed by παραλαβ . παρ ʼ ἡμῶν . On the other rendering, which is adopted and defended also by Ellicott, there is a significant contrast, St. Paul distinguishing himself and his companions, as mere publishers, from God, the great Source of the Gospel.

But we must not supply ‘ <em> as</em> ,’ with Jowett: no subjective view of theirs being implied in these words, but simply the objective fact of their reception of the word from Paul, Silvanus, and Timotheus).
