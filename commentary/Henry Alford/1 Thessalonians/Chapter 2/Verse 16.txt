<b> 16.</b>]<b> us</b> refers to Paul and Silas. In the words<b> are contrary to all men</b>, most. Commentators, and recently Jowett (see above), have seen the “<i>hatred of the human race</i>,” ascribed to the Jews by Tacitus, and by several other classic authors. But it is hardly possible that St. Paul, himself a Jew, should have blamed an exclusiveness which arose from the strict monotheism and legal purity of the Jew: and besides this, the construction having been hitherto carried on by copulae, but now dropping them, most naturally goes on from this<i> contrariety</i> to what next follows, viz.,<i> their forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles</i>, specifying wherein the contrariety consists, viz. in opposing the salvation of mankind by the Gospel.<br><br><b> to the end that they may fill up their sins alway</b>] This is said, not of the intention of the Jews themselves, but of their course of conduct, viewed as having an intent in the divine purposes: as so often in St. Paul. The meaning of the expression is, that they may bring up the measure of their sins to the pre-scribed point.<b> But</b> (this their opposition to God and men shall not avail them: for)<b> the</b> (predestined, or predicted, or merited)<b> wrath</b> (of God)<b> came upon them</b> (he looks<i> back</i> on the fact in the divine counsels as a thing in past time, i.e. ‘was appointed to come:’ not as in A, V. “is come”)<b> to the uttermost</b> (to the end of it, i.e. the wrath: so that it shall exhaust all its force on them).
