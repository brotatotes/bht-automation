<b> 19.</b>]<i> accounts for this his earnest desire</i><i> to see them, by the esteem in which he held them</i>.<br><br><b> in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming]</b> The Apostle, after having asked and answered the question, “<i>what is our hope?&c.</i>,” breaks off, and specifies that wherein this hope and joy mainly consisted, viz. the glorious prospect of their being found in the Lord at his appearing. But he does not look forward to this as anticipating a reward for the conversion of the Thessalonians, or that their conversion will compensate for his having persecuted the Church before, but from generous desire to be found at that day with the fruits of his labour, and that they might be his boast and he theirs before the Lord; see 2 Cor. i. 14; Phil. ii. 16.
