 3 .  παράκλησις ]  exhortation to you, viz. our whole course of preaching. Supply is, not ‘  was ;’ cf. λαλοῦμεν below. “The two senses of παράκλησις , exhortation and consolation, so easily passing into one another (compare 1Th 2:11 ), are suggestive of the external state of the early church, sorrowing amid the evils of the world, and needing as its first lesson to be comforted; and not less suggestive of the first lesson of the Gospel to the individual soul, of peace in believing.” Jowett.
	 ἐκ ]  having its source in .
	 πλάνης ] here probably  error . “The word is used transitively and intransitively. In the former case, it is ‘  imposture ’ ( Mat 27:64 ) or ‘  seduction ’ ( Eph 4:14 ): in the latter and more usual,  error .” Lünem.
	 ἀκαθαρσίας ] hardly, as Chrys., ὑπὲρ μυσαρῶν πραγμάτων οἷον γοήτων κ . μάγων , though such a reference is certainly possible, considering the vile degradation of that class at the period, but here apparently of the impure desire of gain, cf. 1 Thessalonians 2:5 , where ἐν προφάσει πλεονεξίας seems to correspond with ἐξ ἀκαθαρσίας . Still such a meaning seems to want example. If it be correct, this represents (Lün.) the subjective side, the  motive , as ἐκ πλάνης the objective side, the  ground .
	 ἐν δόλῳ ] this of the  manner , or perhaps, as Ellic., the  ethical sphere, in which : ‘nor did we make use of deceit to win our way with our παράκλησις .’ See 2 Corinthians 2:17 .
