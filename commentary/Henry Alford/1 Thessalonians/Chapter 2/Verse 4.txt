<p><strong> δεδοκιμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] see reff., <strong> we have been approved, thought fit</strong> : cf. πιστὸν ἡγήσατο , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:12">1 Timothy 1:12</span> . Lünem. cites Plut. Thes. 12: ἐλθὼν οὖν ὁ Θησεὺς ἐπὶ τὸ ἄριστον , οὐκ ἐδοκίμαζε φράζειν αὐτὸν ὅστις εἴη . We must not introduce any ascertained fitness of them in themselves into the idea ( οὐκ ἂν ἐξελέξατο , εἰ μὴ ἀξίους ἐγίνωσκε Thl.: so Chr., Œc., Olsh.): it is only the free choice of God which is spoken of.

As Lünem. justly observes against De W., τὰς καρδίας here and τὰς ἑαυτ . ψυχάς below, are conclusive against imagining that St. Paul in this place is speaking of <em> himself alone</em> . Yet Conyb. renders it, ‘ <em> my heart</em> ,’ and τὰς ἑ . ψ ., ‘ <em> my own life</em> .’</p>
