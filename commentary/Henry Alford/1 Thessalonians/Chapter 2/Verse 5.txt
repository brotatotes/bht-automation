Lün. quotes Theophrastus, Charr. 2, τὴν δὲ κολακείαν ὑπολάβοι ἄν τις ὁμιλίαν αἰσχρὰν εἶναι , συμφέρουσαν δὲ τῷ κολακεύοντι , and Ellic. remarks, “It seems more specifically to illustrate the ἐν δόλῳ of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:3">1 Thessalonians 2:3</span> , and forms a natural transition to the next words, the essence of κολακεία being self-interest: ὁ δὲ ὅπως ὠφέλειά τις αὐτῷ γίγνηται εἰς χρήματα καὶ ὅσα διἀ χρημάτων , κόλαξ .
