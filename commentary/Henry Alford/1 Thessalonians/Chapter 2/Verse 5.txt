 5 ff.]  Proofs again of the assertions of 1 Thessalonians 2:3-4 .  For neither did we become conversant (see reff. γενέσθαι ἔν τινι ,  in re quadam versari ; so οἱ μὲν ἐν τούτοις τοῖς λόγοις ἦσαν , Xen. Cyr. iv. 3. 23. On the impracticability of maintaining a passive sense in the form ἐγενήθημεν , see above, on ch. 1Th 1:5 )  in speech of (consisting of)  flattery (not ‘  incurring repute of flattery ,’ as Hamm., Le Clerc, Michael., al. (similarly as to meaning, Pelt), which would be irrelevant, as he is not speaking of what  others thought of their ministry, but of their own behaviour in it. On κολακ .

Thdrt., and similarly Chrys. But perhaps it is simpler, seeing that no ὑμεῖς is expressed with οἴδατε , to refer θεὸς μάρ . to the whole).
