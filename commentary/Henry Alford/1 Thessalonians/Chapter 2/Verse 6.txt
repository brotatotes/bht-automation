<b> 6.</b>] The glory which they sought was not at all to come out of human sources, whether actually from the Thessalonians or from any others.<br><br><b> though we might have been burdensome</b>] Some refer this to<i> covetousness</i>, mentioned above, and understand it of using the power of living by the gospel, which St. Paul, &c., might have done, but did not: so ver. 9: 2 Thess. iii. 8; 2 Cor. xii.<b> 16; xi. 9.</b> But the words are separated from the mention of<i> covetousness</i> by the new idea beginning at ver. 6, to which, and not to the former clause, this is subordinated. I therefore take them with Chrysostom and many others, as referring to the claim of honour and deference, which as Apostles they might have put forward. They are equivalent to,<b> when we might have stood on our dignity</b>.<br><br><b> as</b> (being)<b> Apostles of Christ</b>] It is simpler to take Apostles here in its wider sense, than to limit the sentence to St. Paul alone.
