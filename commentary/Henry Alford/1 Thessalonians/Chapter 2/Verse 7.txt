Eliac. ii. 18, βασιλέα γὰρ οὐ τὰ πάντα ἤπιον , ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ μάλιστα θυμῷ χρώμενον Ἀλέξανδρον τοῦ Φιλίππου (Wetst.): see also Herod. iii. 89: and Ellic.’s note here.

It is best to retain the comma after ὑμῶν , not as Lün., to place a colon: for though there is a break in the construction, it is one occasioned by the peculiar style of the Apostle, which should not be amended by punctuation. The emphasis on  ἑαυτῆς should not be lost sight of  as when a nurse (a  suckling mother )  cherishes (reff.)  her own children . See Galatians 4:19 , for the same figure.
