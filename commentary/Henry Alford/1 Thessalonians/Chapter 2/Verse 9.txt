 9 .]  Proof of the dearness of the Thessalonians to Paul and his companions : not of ἐγενήθ . ἤπιοι , to which it would be irrelevant, nor of their readiness to give their lives, &c. (as Ellic.), for this verse does not refer to dangers undergone, but to  labour, in order not to trouble any . It is no objection to this (Ellic.) that διότι κ . τ . λ . is a subordinate causal member of the preceding sentence, seeing that it is precisely St. Paul’s habit to break the tenor of his style by inserting confirmations of such clauses.
	 μνημ  . is indic. ( γάρ ).
	 τ  .   κόπον κ  .   τ  .   μόχθον ] a repetition (reff.) to intensify as we should say  labour and pains : no distinction can be established.
	 νυκτός first, not merely because the Jews and Athenians (‘Athenienses inter duos occasus,’ Plin. N. H. ii. 77) so reckoned it, but  for emphasis , being the most noteworthy, and the  day following as matter of course. See besides reff. Acts 20:31 .
	 ἐργαζόμενοι (reff.) in its strict meaning of manual labour viz., at tent-cloth making, Acts 18:3 .
	 πρ  .   τὸ μὴ ἐπιβ  . ]  in order not to burden any of you , viz. by accepting from you the means of sustenance. One can hardly say with Chrys., ἐνταῦθα δείκνυσιν ἐν πενίᾳ ὄντας τοὺς ἄνδρας : for we know St. Paul’s strong feeling on this point, 2 Corinthians 11:9-10 .
	 εἰς ὑμᾶς ,  to you not quite = ὑμῖν : the latter represents the preaching more as a thing  imparted , this as a thing  diffused . On the supposed inconsistency of the statement here with the narrative in Acts 17:0 , see Prolegomena, § ii. 3, and note.
