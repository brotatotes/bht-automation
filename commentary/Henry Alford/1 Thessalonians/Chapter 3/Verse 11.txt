<b> 11</b>.<b> himself</b>] This word exalts the absolute power of God and the Lord Jesus—if He expedites the way, it will be accomplished.<b> Himself</b> then is in contrast with<i> ourselves</i>, who have once and again tried to come to you, but have been hindered by Satan.<br><br><b> direct</b>] We cannot express in an English version what appears in the Greek, where this verb<i> direct</i>, though preceded by two personal nominatives, “<i>God</i>,” and “<i>our Lord Jesus</i>,” is in the singular<i> number</i>, This is the case also in 2 Thess. ii. 16, 17. It would be hardly possible that it should be so, unless some reason existed in the subjects of the verb. Mere<i> unity of will</i> between the Father and the Son would not be enough, unless absolute unity were also in the writer’s mind. Athanasius therefore seems to be right in drawing from this construction an argument for the unity of the Father and the Son.
