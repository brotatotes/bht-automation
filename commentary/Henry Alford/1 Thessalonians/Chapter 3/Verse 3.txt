<p><strong> 3</strong> .] <strong> that no one might be disquieted</strong> (ref.: Soph. Antig. 1214, παιδός με σαίνει φθόγγος : Eur. Rhes. 53, σαίνει μ ʼ ἔννυχος φρυκτώρια , &amp;c. In these places <strong> σαίνω</strong> is a <em> vox media</em> , conveying the meaning of agitation, disquieting, which the context must interpret for better or worse) <strong> in</strong> (in the midst of) <strong> these tribulations</strong> (which are happening to us both). The construction of <strong> τὸ μηδένα σαίνεσθαι</strong> is doubted. Lünem. enters into the matter, as usual, at length and thoroughly. He first deals with the rec. <strong> τῷ</strong> μηδ . σ ., and exposes as ungrammatical the view which would regard it as a <em> dativus commodi</em> , as = εἰς τὸ …, rejecting also Rückert’s more grammatical view, that it indicates “ <em> unde nascituram</em> τὴν παράκλησιν <em> speraverat, quum Timotheum misit, apostolus</em> .” Then as to <strong> τὸ</strong> μ . σ ., we may take it either 1) with Matthæi, supplying a second εἰς from the former εἰς τὸ στηρ . But then why is not the second εἰς expressed, as in Rom 4:11 ? Or, 2) with Schott, as a pendent accusative, in the sense ‘ <em> quod attinet, ad</em> .’ But this is a very rare construction, which has been often assumed without reason (see Bernhardy, pp. 132 ff.), and therefore should only be resorted to when no other supposition will help the construction: 3) Winer, edn. 3 (not in edn. 6), § 45. 3 anm., whom De W. and Ellicott follow, makes it dependent on παρακαλέσαι , and treats it as a further explanation of ὑπὲρ τῆς πίστεως viz. ‘ <em> to exhort, that none should become unstable</em> .’ But if τὸ μηδ . σαίν . depended on παρακαλέσαι , then παρακαλεῖν , in the sense of ‘ <em> to exhort</em> ,’ would be followed by a imple accusative of the thing, which though perhaps possible, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:2">1 Timothy 6:2</span> , is very harsh. (Consult however Ellicott’s note, as to the mere mediate dependence of such clauses on the governing verb in comparison with the immediate dependence of substantives.) Besides, if τὸ μ . σ . were a further specification of ὑπὲρ τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν , it would not be accusative but genitive. 4) It only remains that we should take <strong> τὸ μ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σ</strong> <strong> .</strong> as in apposition with the whole foregoing sentence, εἰς τὸ στ . ὑ . κ . παρ . ὑπ . τ . πίστ . ὑμ . so that τὸ μηδ . σαίν . serves only to repeat the same thought, which was before positively expressed, in a negative but better defined form: <strong> τό</strong> being nearly = τουτέστι . So that the sense is: <strong> to confirm you and exhort you on behalf of your faith, that is, that no one may be shaken in these troubles</strong> : <strong> τὸ μηδ</strong> <strong> .</strong> being dependent, not on a second εἰς understood, as in (1), but on the first εἰς , which is expressed. With this view I entirely agree, only adding, that instead of making τό = τουτέστι , I would rather say that τουτέστι might have been <em> inserted before</em> τὸ μηδένα .
