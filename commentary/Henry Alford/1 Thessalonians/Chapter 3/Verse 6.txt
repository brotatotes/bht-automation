<b> 6. But Timothy having just now come</b>] See Acts xviii. 5. This settles the time of our Epistle being written. It was very soon after this arrival of Silas and Timothy.—First their Christian state comforted him,—then, their constant remembrance of himself. Theodoret remarks: “He mentions three things which have excited his affection to them: their faith, their love, their remembrance of their teacher. Their faith shews the stability of their piety; their love, their practical virtue; and their remembrance of their teacher and desire for him testifies to their loyalty in matters of doctrine.”
