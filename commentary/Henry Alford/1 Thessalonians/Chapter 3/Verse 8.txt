 8 .]  for now (not so much an adverb of  time , here, as implying the fulfilment of the condition ( ἐάν ) which follows: so Eur. Iph. in Aul. 644: “ συνετὰ λέγουσα μᾶλλον εἰς οἶκτὸν μ ʼ ἄγεις .” “ ἀσύνετα  νῦν ἐροῦμεν ,  εἰ σέ γ ʼ εὐφοανῶ .” See more examples in Hartung, Partikell. ii. p. 25; Kühner, ii. p. 185) we live (the ἀνάγκη and θλῖψις being conceived as a  death : but not to be referred to  everlasting life, as Chrys.

The reading must not be dismissed, as Ellic., by taking refuge in Scrivener’s assertion that permutations of similar vowels are occasionally found even in the best MSS.
