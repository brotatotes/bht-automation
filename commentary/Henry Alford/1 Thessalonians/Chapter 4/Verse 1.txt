 CHAP. IV.<b> 1—V. 24.</b>] SECOND PORTION OF THE EPISTLE: consisting of exhortations and instructions.<br><br><b> 1.</b>]<b> Furthermore</b> has no reference to time, as Chrysostom, “<i>always and for ever</i>,” but introduces this second portion, thus dividing it from the first, and implying the<i> close</i> of the Epistle. St. Paul uses it towards the end of his Epistles: see 2 Cor. xiii. 11; Eph. vi. 10; Phil. iv. 8 ( “<i>finally</i>,” but the same word in the Greek.)
