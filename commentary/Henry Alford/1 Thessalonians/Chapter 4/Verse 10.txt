<b> 10.</b>] follows up the last verse by a matter of fact, shewing the teaching to have been in some measure effectual.<br><br><b> to abound</b>, viz. in this<i> love</i>.<br><br> There does not seem any reason, with Jowett, to ascribe the want of quietness, here implied,<b> to be quiet</b>, to their<i> uneasiness about the state of the dead</i>: much rather [as he also states: see below] to their mistaken anticipations of the immediate coming of the Lord. It would seem as if, notwithstanding their liberality to those without, there were some defect of diligence and harmony within which prompted this exhortation: see 2 Thess. iii. 11, 12. Theodoret assigns another reason for it: “This exhortation is not inconsistent with the foregoing praises. For the state of things was, that one party zealously ministered charity to the needy, and that the latter on account of this zealous ministration neglected their own duties: he naturally therefore praised the one and gave fitting advice to the others.” It has been objected to this, that thus the Church would be divided into two sections, the one exhorted to persist and abound in their liberality, the other to work diligently to support themselves; whereas there is no trace in the text of such a division. But we may well answer, that instances are frequent enough of exhortations being addressed to whole churches which in their application would require severing and allotting to distinct classes of persons.
