<b> 13.</b>]<b> we</b> (or<b> I</b>)<b> would not have you ignorant</b>.... is with our Apostle (compare Rom. i. 13; xi, 25; 1 Cor. x. 1; xii. 1; 2 Cor. i. 8) a common formula of transition to the imparting of weighty information.<br><br><b> them which are sleeping</b>] This was an expression (see reff.) conveying definite meaning to the Thessalonians as importing<i> the dead in Christ</i> (ver. 16). No inference must therefore be drawn from the Apostle’s use of this word, as to the intermediate state: for the word is a mere common term.<br><br><b> that ye may not sorrow</b>] object of my not wishing you to be ignorant.<br><br> The word<b> sorrow</b> is<i> absolute</i>,<b> that ye mourn not at all</b>:—not to be joined with what follows, and to be made only to mean that. ye sorrow not in the same manner as&c. He forbids<b> mourning</b> altogether. But we must remember,<i> what sort of mourning</i> it was. It was mourning for<i> them</i>: not mourning for<i> our</i> loss in their<i> absence</i>, but for<i> theirs</i>, and<i> in so far</i>, for ours also.<br><br><b> the rest</b>] viz. the heathen, and those<b> Jews</b> who did not believe a resurrection.<br><br><b> have no hope</b>] viz. in the<i> resurrection</i>. Examples of this “<i>no hope</i>” are easily given from the Pagan writers. Lünemann cites,—Theocritus, “Hope goes with life—all hopeless are the dead.” Æschylus, “Once dead, there is no resurrection more.” Catullus, “Suns may set and may return:|We, when once our brief light wanes,|Have eternal night to sleep.” Lucretius, “None ever woke again|Whom the cold pause of life hath overta’ en.” Jowett adds ‘the sad complaints of Cicero and Quintilian over the loss of their children, and the dreary hope of an immortality of fame in Tacitus and Thucydides.’ This shews of<i> what kind</i> their<i> mourning</i> was: viz. a grief whose ground was unbelief in a resurrection: which regarded the dead as altogether cut off from Christ’s heavenly kingdom.
