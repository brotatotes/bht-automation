<p><strong> ἀπέθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀνέστη</strong> go together, forming the same process through which οἱ κοιμώμενοι are passing. “The Apostle here, as always, uses the direct term ἀπέθανε in reference to our Lord, to obviate all possible misconception: in reference to the faithful he appropriately uses the consolatory term κοιμᾶσθαι : see Thdrt. in loc.” Ellicott.

<p><strong> οὕτως</strong> ] The two clauses do not accurately correspond. We should expect καὶ πιστεύομεν ὅτι οὕτως καὶ οἱ ἐν Ἰησοῦ κοιμηθέντες ἀναστήσονται , or the like. Still the <strong> οὕτως</strong> betokens identity of lot for the two parties concerned, viz., death, and resurrection. In this they resemble: but in the expressed particulars here, they differ. Christ’s was simply ἀνέστη : theirs shall be a resurrection through Him, at His coming.

<p><strong> διὰ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἰησοῦ</strong> ] I feel compelled to differ from the majority of modern scholars (not Ellicott), in adhering to the old connexion of these words with τ . κοιμηθέντας . I am quite aware of the grammatical difficulty: but as I hope to shew, it is not insuperable. But if we join <strong> διὰ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἰησ</strong> <strong> .</strong> with <strong> ἄξει</strong> , we obtain a clause which I am persuaded the Apostle could never have written, flat and dragging in the extreme <strong> διὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ ἄξει σὺν αὐτῷ</strong> <strong> </strong> <strong> αὐτῷ</strong> referring to Ἰησοῦ already mentioned in the same clause. Whereas, on the other connexion, we have <strong> Ἰησοῦς</strong> and <strong> οἱ κοιμηθέντες διὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ</strong> set over against one another, the very article, and the unemphatic position of the words, shewing the reference back, and we have <strong> αὐτῷ</strong> naturally and forcibly referring back to <strong> Ἰησοῦς</strong> and <strong> διὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ</strong> , in the preceding clauses. In other words, the logical construction of the sentence seems to me so plainly to require the connexion of <strong> διὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ</strong> with <strong> κοιμηθέντας</strong> , that it must be a grammatical impossibility only, which can break that connexion. But let us see whether there be such an impossibility present. <strong> οἱ κοιμηθέντες</strong> are confessedly the <em> Christian</em> dead, and none else. They are distinguished by the Apostle’s use of and adhesion to the word, from the merely θανόντες . What makes this distinction? Why are they asleep, and not dead? <em> By whom</em> have they been thus privileged? Certainly, διὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ . We are said πιστεύειν δι ʼ αὐτοῦ ( Act 3:16 ), εὐχαριστεῖν δι ʼ αὐτοῦ ( Rom 1:8 ), εἰρήνην ἔχειν δι ʼ αὐτοῦ (ib. Rom 5:1 ), καυχᾶσθαι δι ʼ αὐτοῦ (ib. Rom 1:11 ), παρακαλεῖσθαι δι ʼ αὐτοῦ ( 2Co 1:5 ), &amp;c. &amp;c.: why not also κοιμᾶσθαι δι ʼ αὐτοῦ ? And when Lünem. objects, that the extent of the idea <strong> οἱ κοιμηθέντες</strong> is understood from the former part of the sentence, <strong> εἰ πιστεύομεν</strong> κ . τ . λ ., this very reason seems to me the most natural one for the specification <strong> If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, then even thus also those, of whom we say that they sleep</strong> , just <strong> because of Jesus, will God</strong> , &amp;c.: the emphasis being on the <strong> διὰ</strong> . Jowett keeps this connexion, merely saying however, “nor will the order of the words allow us to connect them with ἄξει ;” a reason surely insufficient for it. He is certainly in error when he continues, “The only remaining mode is to take διὰ for ἐν (?), ‘those that are asleep in Christ.’ ”

<p><strong> ἄξει σὺν αὐτῷ</strong> ] <strong> will bring</strong> (back to us) <strong> with Him</strong> (Jesus): i.e. when Jesus shall appear, they also shall appear with Him, being (as below) raised at His coming. Of their disembodied souls there is here no mention: nor is the meaning, as often understood, that God will bring them (their disembodied souls, to be joined to their raised bodies) with Him: but the bringing them with Jesus = their being raised when Jesus appears.</p>
