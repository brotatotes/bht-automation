We should expect “<i>we believe also that even thus they who fell asleep through Jesus will rise again</i>,” or the like. Still the<b> even so</b> betokens identity of lot for the two parties concerned, viz. death, and resurrection. In this they resemble: but in the expressed particulars here, they differ.

Of their disembodied souls there is here no mention: nor is the meaning, as often understood, that God will bring them (their disembodied souls, to be joined to their raised bodies) with Him: but the bringing them with Jesus, i.e. their being raised when Jesus appears.
