<b> 15.</b>]<i> Confirmation of last verse by direct revelation from the Lord.</i><br><br><b> this</b>—this which follows: taken up by<b> that</b>.<br><br><b> in</b> (virtue of: an assertion made within the sphere and element of that certainty, which the word of the Lord gives)<b> the word of the Lord</b>,—i. e. by direct revelation from Him made te me. “That is,” says Chrysostom, “we say it not of ourselves, but having learned it from Christ.” That St. Paul had many special revelations made to him, we know from 2 Cor. xii. 4.. Compare also Gal. i, 12; Eph. Cor. xi. 23; xv. 3, and notes.<br><br><b> we which are living</b>] Then beyond question, he himself expected to be alive, together with the majority of those to whom he was writing, at the Lord’s coming. For we cannot for a moment accept the evasion of Theodoret (so also Chrysostom and the majority of ancient Commentators, down to Bengel, and even some of the best of the moderns, warped by their subjectivities: even Ellicott here),— “that he said this not in his own person, but in that of the men who should be surviving at that time (!)”—nor the ungrammatical rendering of some, ‘we, if we live and remain’—nor the idea of Œcumenius, al., that<i> we who live</i> are the<i> souls</i>,<i> they who sleep the bodies</i>:—but must take the words in their only plain grammatical meaning, that<b> we which are living, who remain behind</b>, are a class distinguished from<b> them which fell asleep</b>, by being yet in the flesh when Christ comes, in which class, by prefixing<b> we</b>, he includes his readers and himself. That this<i> was</i> his expextation, we know from other passages, especially from 2 Cor. v. 1–10, where see notes. It does not seem to have been so strong towards the end of his course; see e.g. Phil.—26. Nor need it surprise any Christian, that the Apostles should in this matter of detail have found their personal expectations liable to disappointment, respecting a day of which it is so solemnly said, that no man knoweth its appointed time, not the angels in heaven, nor the Son (Mark xiii. 32), but the Father only. At the same time it must be borne in mind, that this inclusion of himself and his hearers among the “<i>living and remaining behind</i>” does not in any way enter into the fact revealed and here announced, which is re-specting that class of persons only as they are, and must be,<i> one portion</i> of the faithful at the Lord’s coming: not respecting the question,<i> who shall</i>, and<i> who shall not</i> be among them in that day.<br><br><b> shall in no wise</b> (emphatic—; there is no reason to fear, that we shall....’)<b> gain an advantage over</b> (literally,<i> get before</i>,<i> outstrip</i>,<i> anticipate</i>: in the old sense of the word,<i> prevent</i>, so that they be left behind, and fail of the prize).
