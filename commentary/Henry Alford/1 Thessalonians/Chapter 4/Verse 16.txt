<b> 16.</b>]<i> A reason of the foregoing assertion,</i><i> by detailing the method of the resurrection</i>.<b> Because the Lord Himself</b> (said for solemnity’s sake, and to shew that it will not be a<i> mere gathering to</i> Him, but HE HIMSELF will descend, and we all shall be summoned before Him)<b> with</b> (literally, ‘in, as the element,—the accompanying circumstance)<b> a signal-shout</b> (the word signifies primarily not only ‘<i>the shout of battle</i>,’ as Conybeare; but is used of any signal given by the voice, whether of a captain to his rowers, of a man shouting to another at a distance, of a huntsman to his dogs. Here it seems to include in it the two which follow and explain it),<b> viz. with the voice of an</b> (or, the)<b> archangel</b> (Christ shall be surrounded with His angels, Matt. xxv. 31 al. To enquire,<i> which</i> archangel, is futile: to understand the word of<i> Christ Himself</i>, or the Holy Spirit, impossible), and<b> with the trump of God</b> (the trumpet especially belonging to and used in the heavenly<i> state</i> of God; not,<i> commanded by God</i> [Pelt, Olsb., al.],—nor does<b> of God</b> import<i> size</i> or<i> loudness</i> [Bengel], although these qualities of course are understood. On the trumpet as summoning assemblies, compare Num. x. 2; xxxi. 6; Joel ii. 1:—as accompanying the divine appearances, Exod. xix. 16; Ps. xlvii. 5; Isa. xxvii. 13; Zech. ix. 14; Matt. xxiv. 31; 1 Cor. xv. 52)<b> shall come down from heaven</b> (see Acts i. 11):<b> and the dead in Christ shall first rise</b> (this<b> first</b> has no reference whatever to the<i> first resurrection</i> [Rev. xx. 5, 6], here, for<i> only the Lord’s people</i> are here in question: but answers to<b> then</b> below:<i> first</i>, the dead in Christ shall rise:<i> then</i>, we, &c.);<b> then we who are living, who remain behind</b> (as above),<b> shall be caught up</b> (the great change spoken of, 1 Cor. xv. 52, having first suddenly taken place)<b> all together</b> (see Rom, iii. 12; ch. v. 10 note:<b> together</b> does not belong to “with them”),<b> with them</b> (the raised of ver. 16),<b> in</b> (<b>the</b>)<b> clouds, to meet the Lord</b> (as He descends. Christ is<i> on His way to this earth</i>: and when De Wette says that there is no plain trace in St. Paul of Christ’s Kingdom on earth,—and Lünemann, that, the words shew that the Apostle did not think of Christ as descending down to the earth, surely they cannot suppose him to have been so ignorant of Old Test. prophecy, as to have allowed this, its plain testimony, to escape him. To<i> meet</i> occurs twice more in the New Test.: and each _ time implies meeting one who was<i> approaching</i>—not merely ‘meeting with’ a person),<b> into the air</b> (belongs to<b> shall be caught up</b>, not to the words “<i>to meet the Lord</i>,” as in A.V.):<b> and thus we</b> (i. e. we and they united, who were the subject of the last sentence)<b> shall be always with the Lord</b>. That he advances no further in the prophetic description, but breaks off at our union in Christ’s presence, is accounted for, by his purpose being accomplished, in having shewn that they who have died in Christ, shall not be thereby deprived of any advantage at His coming. The rest of the great events of that time—His advent on this earth, His judgment of it, assisted by His saints (1 Cor. vi. 2, 3),—His reign upon earth,—His final glorification with His redeemed in heaven,—are not treated here, but not therefore to be conceived of as alien from the Apostle’s teaching.
