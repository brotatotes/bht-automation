<b> 18.</b>]<b> So then:</b> seeing that this is so.<br><br><b> these words,</b> which I have by inspiration delivered to you. It will be manifest to the plain, as well as to the scholar-like reader, that attempts, like that of Mr. Jowett, to interpret such a passage as this by the rules of mere figurative language, are entirely beside the purpose. The Apostle’s declarations here are made in the practical tone of strict matter of fact, and are given as literal details, to console men’s minds under an existing difficulty. Never was a place where the analogy of symbolical apocalyptic language was less applicable. Either these details must be received by us as matter of practical expectation, or we must set aside the Apostle as one divinely empowered to teach the Church. It is a fair opportunity for a crucial experiment, to test Christian faith and unbelief: and such test cannot be evaded by Mr. Jowett’s intermediate expedient of figurative language.
