<b> 4.</b>] On the meaning of the expression,<b> his own vessel</b>, there has been much difference. Very many Commentators understand it of ‘<i>the body</i>.’ But it is fatal to this interpretation, (1) that it must force an untenable meaning on the pre-ceding verb, which can only mean ‘<i>to acquire</i>,’ not, as in A.V., ‘<i>to possess</i>.’ Chrysostom, whose sense of Greek usage led him to feel this, tries to fit the mean-ing ‘<i>to acquire</i>’ into the sense: saying, “We do really<i> acquire</i> the body, when it remains pure, and is in sanctification” (so Dr. Vaughan also). But this is lame enough, and would not, as De Wette remarks, answer for the other member of the sentence, “<i>not in the lust of carnal desire</i>.” (2) That the mere use of the word<b> vessel</b>, without any explanation, could hardly point at the<i> body</i>. In all the passages ordinarily quoted to support it, the metaphor is further explained by the context. 2 Cor. iv. 7 is evidently no case in point, the epithet “<i>earthen</i>” being there added, and the body being simply<i> compared</i> to an<i> earthen vessel</i>. (3) The order of the words in the original is against it, by which the whole stress is laid on the word<i> own</i>. This would be without meaning if “vessel” meant the body: for how could a man<i> acquire</i> another’s body? (4) But a more fatal objection than any of the former is, that the context is entirely against the meaning. The<i> sanctification</i> has been explained to consist in abstaining from<b> fornication</b>. And now this<i> fornication</i> comes to be specified, wherein it consists, and how it may be guarded against: viz. in carrying on the divinely-appointed commerce of the sexes in holiness and honour. In fact, the thought is exactly as in 1 Cor. vii. 2, “<i>Because of fornications,</i><i> let each man</i><b> have his own wife,</b><i> and let each woman</i><b> have her own husband.</b>” Many have therefore understood vessel in its literal meaning as applied to “<i>the matter</i>” in hand,—i. e. the<i> woman</i> (or indeed the<i> man</i>, on the other side, inasmuch as the woman has<i> power</i> over his body, see 1 Cor. vii. 4.—So that thus it would be an exhortation to the woman also). Thus the context would be satisfied, and the emphatic position of<b> his own</b> (as in 1 Cor. vii. 2);—and<b> acquire</b> would re-tain its proper meaning:<b> that each of you should know how to acquire his own vessel</b> (for this purpose)<b> in sanctification and honour</b>. This sense of<i> vessel</i> is found in the Jewish books; and the verb rendered “<i>acquire</i>” was commonly used of taking a wife. This interpretation is that of some of the principal among the ancients, including Augustine, and of many of the principal moderns. The objection to it alleged by Calvin and others, that thus only<i> men</i> would he addressed, is easily answered (besides as above, under 4) by observing that in other places also, where<i> fornication</i> is in question, the male only is exhorted, e.g. 1 Cor. vi. 15–18: the female being included by implication, and bound to interpret on her side that which is said of the other.
