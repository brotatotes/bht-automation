<b> 6.</b>] I cannot help regarding it as most unnatural, to interpret this verse of a new subject introduced, viz. the not<i> wronging</i> one another<i> in the business of life</i>. How some of the best modern Commentators can have entertained this view, I am at a loss to imagine. For (1) the sense is carried on from vv. 4, 5, without any thing to mark a change of topic: and (2) when the Apostle sums up the whole in ver. 7, he mentions merely impurity, without the slightest allusion to the other. To say that more than one kind of sin must be mentioned because he speaks of “<i>all these things</i>” is mere trifling: this expression merely generalizes from the sin mentioned to a wider range. I understand the verse, with Chrysostom, and most of the ancients and moderns, to refer to the<i> sins of uncleanness</i>, and continue vv. 4, 5:—<b>that he should not</b> (viz.<b> any of you</b>, repeated from “<i>every one of you</i>” above)<b> go beyond</b> (or<b> set at nought</b>, which perhaps is more strictly accurate; but the word means both, and the other is perhaps best in English)<b> and overreach his brother in the</b> (i. e. this)<b> matter</b> (viz. of acquiring his own vessel—that there should be among you no strifes on account of the<i> lusts of carnal desire</i>. The matter, viz. which is now in hand: not,—nor can the words by any possibility mean, “<i>any matter</i>,” as A.V.: nor “<i>the business of life</i>,” as some have interpreted it: see above. “It is probable that the obscurity of the passage arises partly from the decency in which the Apostle clothes it.” Jowett):<b> because God is the avenger</b> (<i> ‘righter</i>,’ in such cases of setting at nought and overreaching)<b> of all these things</b> (viz. cases of<i> going beyond and overreaching</i>, and by inference, lustful sins like them),<b> as also</b> (see on ver. 5)<b> we before told you and (constantly) testified</b>.
