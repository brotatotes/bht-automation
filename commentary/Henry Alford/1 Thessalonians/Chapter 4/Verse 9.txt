 9 .]  δέ is transitional, the implied contrast being to the sin last spoken of.
	 φιλαδελφία (reff.) here refers more immediately (cf. ποιεῖτε αὐτό below) to deeds of kindness by way of relief to poor brethren.
	 οὐ χρείαν ἔχετε ] This is a not unusual touch of delicate rhetoric with St. Paul (cf. 2 Corinthians 9:1 ; Philemon 1:19 ; ch. 1Th 5:1 ). It conveys tacit but gentle reproof. The knowledge and the practice already exist: but the latter is not quite in proportion to the former. τῷ εἰπεῖν , οὐ χρεία ἐστί , μεῖζον ἐποίησεν ἢ εἰ εἶπεν . Chrys. The construction οὐ χρείαν ἔχετε γράφειν ὑμῖν (defended by De Wette and Winer), has been pronounced inadmissible by Lünemann, such use of the infinitive active being only found where no special personal reference is attached to the verb, as ὑμῖν here: so that this would require ἐμὲ γρ . or γράφεσθαι . He therefore reads ἔχομεν . But with so many corrections (see var. readd.), and with the known irregularities of St. Paul’s style in such constructions, it surely is not safe to speak so positively. I should regard the construction, not as analogous with χῶρον οὐχ ἁγνὸν πατεῖν , Soph. Œd. Col. 37; ἄξιος θαυμάσαι , Thuc. i. 38, and the like, but as a mixed one between ἔχομεν γράφειν and ἔχετε γράφεσθαι .
	 αὐτοὶ ὑμεῖς , in opposition to ἡμᾶς , the subject to be supplied from γράφειν : but  αὐτοί is not  sponte , which would not agree with  θεοδίδακτοι . The stress of the sentence is on  αὐτοὶ ὑμεῖς , not on the  θεο - in θεοδίδακτοι , as Olsh., “where  God teaches, there, the Apostle says,  he may be silent:” but as Lün. observes, the θεο - comes in over and above as it were; διδακτοί would convey the  fact : θεοδίδακτοι = διδακτοί , κ . ταῦτα παρὰ θεοῦ . And this teaching is practical its tendency and object being εἰς τὸ ἀγ . ἁλλ ., to produce mutual love.
