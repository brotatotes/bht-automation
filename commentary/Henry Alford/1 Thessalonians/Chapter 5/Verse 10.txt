<p><strong> 10</strong> .] <strong> who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep</strong> (in what sense? surely not in an ethical sense, as above: for they who sleep will be overtaken by Him as a thief, and His day will be to them darkness, not light. If not in an ethical sense, it must be in that of <em> living</em> or <em> dying</em> , and the sense as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:8">Romans 14:8</span> . (For we cannot adopt the trifling sense given by Whitby, al., ‘whether He come in the night, and so find us taking our natural rest, or in the day when we are waking.’) Thus understood however, it will be at the sacrifice of perspicuity, seeing that <strong> γρηγορεῖν</strong> and <strong> καθεύδειν</strong> have been used ethically throughout the passage. If we wish to preserve the uniformity of metaphor, we <em> may</em> (though I am not satisfied with this) interpret in this sense: that our Lord died for us, that whether we watch (are of the number of the watchful, i.e. already Christians) or sleep (are of the number of the sleeping, i.e. unconverted) we should live, &amp;c. Thus it would = ‘who died that all men might be saved:’ who came, not to call the righteous only, but sinners to life. There is to this interpretation the great objection that it confounds with the λοιποί , the ἡμᾶς who are definitely spoken of as set by God not to wrath but to περιποίησιν σωτηρίας . So that the sense <strong> live or die</strong> , must, <strong> I</strong> think, be accepted, and the want of perspicuity with it. The construction of a subjunctive with εἴτε … εἴτε is not classical: an optative is found in such cases, e.g. Xen. Anab. ii. 1. 14, καὶ εἴτε ἄλλο τι θέλοι χρῆσθαι εἴτ ʼ ἐπ ʼ Αἴγυπτον στρατεύειν .… See Winer, edn. 6, § 41, p. 263, Moulton’s Engl. transl. 368, note 2.
