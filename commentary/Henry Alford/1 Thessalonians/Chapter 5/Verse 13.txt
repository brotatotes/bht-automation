 13 .]  ἡγεῖσθαι ἐν ἀγάπῃ is an unusual expression for  to esteem in love; for such seems to be its meaning. Lün. compares ἔχειν τινὰ ἐν ὀργῇ (Thuc. ii. 18). We have περὶ πολλοῦ ἡγεῖσθαι , Herod. ii. 115 ( Job 35:2 does not apply).
	 ὑπερεκπερισσῶς is best taken with ἐν ἀγάπῃ : it will not form a suitable qualification for ἡγεῖσθαι , which is merely a verbum medium. And so Chrys., all.
	 διὰ τὸ ἔργ  .   αὐτ  . may mean,  because of the  nature  of their work , viz. that it is the Lord’s work, for your souls: or,  on account of their activity in their office , as a recompense for their work. Both these motives are combined in Hebrews 13:17 .
	The reading εἰρηνεύετε ἐν αὐτοῖς (see var. readd.) can hardly mean, as Chrys., al., μὴ ἀντιλέγειν τοῖς παρ ʼ αὐτῶν λεγομένοις (Thdrt.), but is probably, as De W., a mistaken correction from imagining that this exhortation must refer to the presbyters as well as the preceding: whereas it seems only to be suggested by the foregoing, as enforcing peaceful and loving subordination without party strife: cf. ἀτάκτους below.
	 ἑαυτοῖς not = ἀλλήλοις (see ref. Col. and note there, and cf. Mar 9:50 ).
