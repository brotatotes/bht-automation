 14 .  ἀτάκτους ] This as ch. 1Th 4:11 , 2 Thessalonians 3:6 ; 2 Thessalonians 3:11 , certainly implies that there was reason to complain of this ἀταξία in the Thessalonian church. “  ἄτακτος is especially said of the soldier who does not remain in his rank:  so inordinatus in Livy.” Lün.: hence  disorderly .
	 ὀλιγοψύχους ] such e.g. as needed the comfort of ch. 1 Thessalonians 4:13 ff.
	 ἀντέχεσθε ]  keep hold of (reff.)  i.e. support .
	 οἱ ἀσθενεῖς must, be understood of the spiritually weak, not the literally sick: see reff.
	 πρὸς πάντας ] not, ‘all the foregoing’ ( ἀτάκτους , ὀλιγοψύχους , ἀσθενῶν ); but  all men : cf. next verse.
