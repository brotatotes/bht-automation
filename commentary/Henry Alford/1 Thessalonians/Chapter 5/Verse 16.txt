<b> 16.</b>] Chrysostom refers this to ver. 15: “When we have such a disposition as to hurt no one but to do good to all, whence can the sting of grief enter? For he who so joys in being injured as to requite his injurer by good offices, whence shall he receive annoyance for the future?” But perhaps this is somewhat far-fetched. The connexion seems however to be justified as he proceeds: “And how, means the Apostle, is this possible? if we will, it is possible. And then he shews the way: ‘pray unceasingly’&c.” And so Theophylact: “For one accustomed to converse with God and to give thanks to Him for all that happens, as good for him, will clearly possess unbroken joy.”
