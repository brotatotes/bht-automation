But there can be no doubt that the <em> supernatural</em> agency of the Spirit is here alluded to, the speaking in tongues, &amp;c., as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:7">1 Corinthians 12:7</span> ff. It is conceived of as a flame, which may be checked and quenched: hence the ζέων τῷ πνεύματι of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:25">Acts 18:25</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:11">Romans 12:11</span> . The word is a common one with the later classics applied to <em> wind</em> : e.g. Plut. de Is. and Osir. p. 366 E, τὰ βόρεια πνεύματα κατασβεννύμενα κομιδῆ τῶν νοτίων ἐπικρατούντων . Galen, de Theriaca i. 17, uses the expression of the spirit of life in children: speaking of poison, he says, τὸ ἔμφυτον πνεῦμα ῥᾳδίως σβέννυσιν . See more examples in Wetst.</p>
