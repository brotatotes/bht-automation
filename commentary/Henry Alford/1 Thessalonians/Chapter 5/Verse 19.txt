It is conceived of as a flame, which may be checked and quenched: hence the ζέων τῷ πνεύματι of Acts 18:25 , Romans 12:11 .

Galen, de Theriaca i. 17, uses the expression of the spirit of life in children: speaking of poison, he says, τὸ ἔμφυτον πνεῦμα ῥᾳδίως σβέννυσιν . See more examples in Wetst.
