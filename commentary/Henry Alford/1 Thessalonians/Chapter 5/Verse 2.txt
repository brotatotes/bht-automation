 2 .] [  ἡ ]  ἡμέρα κυρίου is not the  destruction of Jerusalem , as Hammond, Schöttg., al., nor the day of  each man’s death , as Chrys., Œc., Thl., Lyr., al.,  but the day of the Lord’s coming , the  παρουσία , which has been spoken of, in some of its details, above. So Thdrt. ἡ δεσποτικὴ παρονσία . This is plain, by comparing 2 Thessalonians 2:2 ; 1 Corinthians 1:8 ; 1 Corinthians 5:5 ; 2 Corinthians 1:14 ; Philippians 1:6 ; Philippians 1:10 ; Philippians 2:16 . It is both the suddenness, and the terribleness (surely we cannot with Ellic. omit this element, in the presence of the image in the next verse) of the Day’s coming, which is here dwelt on: cf. next verse.
	 οὕτως fills up the comparison  as a thief in the night (comes),  so … it comes (not for future, but expressing, as so often by the present, the absolute truth and certainty of that predicated it is its attribute, to come).
