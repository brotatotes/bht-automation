<b> 22.</b>] These words cannot by any possibility be rendered as in A.V., ‘<i>abstain from all appearance of evil</i>.’ For (1) the Greek word (<i>eidos</i>) never signifies ‘<i>appearance</i>’ in this sense: (2) the two members of the sentence would thus not be logically correspondent, but a new idea would be introduced in the second which has no place in the context: for it is not against being deceived by false<i> appearance</i>, nor against giving occasion by behaviour which<i> appears like</i> evil, that he is cautioning them, but merely to distinguish and hold fast that which is good, and reject that which is evil. The Greek word means the<i> species</i>, as subordinated to the<i> genus</i>:—<b>abstain from every species</b> (or<b> form</b>)<b> of evil</b>.
