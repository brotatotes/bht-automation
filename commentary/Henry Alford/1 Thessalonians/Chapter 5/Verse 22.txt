<b> 22.</b>] These words cannot by any possibility be rendered as in A.V., ‘<i>abstain from all appearance of evil</i>.’ For (1) the Greek word (<i>eidos</i>) never signifies ‘<i>appearance</i>’ in this sense: (2) the two members of the sentence would thus not be logically correspondent, but a new idea would be introduced in the second which has no place in the context: for it is not against being deceived by false<i> appearance</i>, nor against giving occasion by behaviour which<i> appears like</i> evil, that he is cautioning them, but merely to distinguish and hold fast that which is good, and reject that which is evil. The Greek word means the<i> species</i>, as subordinated to the<i> genus</i>:—<b>abstain from every species</b> (or<b> form</b>)<b> of evil</b>.<br><br><b> peace</b>, here most probably in its wider sense, as the accomplishment of all these Christian graces, and result of the avoidance of all evil. It seems rather far-fetched to refer it back to ver. 13.<br><br><b> wholly</b> (in original,<b> entire</b>, an adjective, agreeing with<b> you</b>) seems to refer to the entireness of sanctification, which is presently expressed in detail.<br><br><b> and</b> introduces the detailed expression of the same wish from the lower side—in its effects.<br><br><b> spirit and soul and body</b>] The SPIRIT (<i>pneuma</i>) is the highest and distinctive part of man, the immortal and responsible<i> soul</i>, in our common parlance: the SOUL is the lower or animal soul, containing the passions and desires which we have in common with the brutes, but which in<i> us</i> is ennobled and drawn up by the<i> spirit</i>. That St. Paul had these distinctions in mind, is plain from such places as 1 Cor. ii. 14. The spirit, that part whereby we are receptive of the Holy Spirit of God, is, in the unspiritual man, crushed down and subordinated to the animal soul (<i>psyché</i>): he therefore is called “a<i> psychic man</i>, not having a spirit,” Jude 19: see also note on 1 Cor. as above.<br><br><b> in the coming</b>,—for it will be<i> in</i> that day that the result will be seen,—that<i> the having been kept whole without blame</i> will be accomplished.
