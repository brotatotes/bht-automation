 7 .] Explanation of the assertion regarding οἱ λοιποί above from the common practice of men. There is no distinction, as Macknight pretends, between μεθυσκόμενοι and μεθύουσιν (‘the former denoting the  act of getting drunk, the latter the  state of being so’), but they are synonymous, answering to καθεύδοντες and καθεύδουσιν . Nor are the expressions to be taken in a spiritual sense, as Chrys., al. ( μέθην ἐνταῦθά φησιν , οὐ τὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴνου μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν κακῶν : ‘Spiritual sleep and intoxication belong to the state of darkness,’ Baum.-Crus.-): the repetition of the same verbs as subjects and predicates (Lün.) shews that  νυκτός is merely a designation of  time , and to be taken literally.
