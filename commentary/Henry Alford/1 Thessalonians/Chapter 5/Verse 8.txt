 8 .] Contrast (  δέ ) of our course, who are of the day. And this not only in being awake and sober, but in being  armed not only watchful, but as sentinels, on our guard, and  guarded ourselves. Notice, that these arms are defensive only, as against a sudden attack and belong therefore not so much to the Christian’s conflict with evil, as (from the context) to his guard against being surprised by the day of the Lord as a thief in the night. The best defences against such a surprise are the three great Christian graces, Faith, Hope, Love, which are accordingly here enumerated: see ch. 1 Thessalonians 1:3 , and 1 Corinthians 13:13 . In Ephesians 6:13-17 , we have offensive as well as defensive weapons, and the symbolism is somewhat varied, the θώραξ being δικαιοσύνη , πίστις being the θυρεός ; while the helmet remains the same. See on the figure, Isaiah 59:17 ; Wis 5:17 ff. We must not perhaps press minutely the meaning of each part of the armour, in the presence of such variation in the two passages.
