<b> 8.</b>] Contrast of our course, who are of the day. And this not only in being awake and sober, but in being<i> armed</i>—not only watchful, but as sentinels, on our guard, and<i> guarded</i> ourselves. Notice, that these arms are defensive only, as against a sudden attack—and belong therefore not so much to the Christian’s conflict with evil, as (from the context) to his guard against being surprised by the day of the Lord as a thief in the night. The best defences against such a surprise are the three great Christian graces, Faith, Hope, Love,—which are accordingly here enumerated: see ch. i. 3, and 1 Cor. xiii. 13. In Eph. vi. 13–17, we have offensive as well as defensive weapons, and the symbolism is somewhat varied, the<i> breastplate</i> being<i> righteousness</i>,<i> faith</i> being the<i> shield</i>; while the helmet remains the same. See on the figure, Isa. lix. 17; Wisd. v. 17 ff. We must not perhaps press minutely the meaning of each part of the armour, in the presence of such variation in the two pas-sages.
