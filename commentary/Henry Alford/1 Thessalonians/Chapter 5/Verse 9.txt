<b> 9.</b>] Explanation of the “<i>hope of salvation</i>,”— ‘and we<i> may</i> with confidence put on such an hope as our helmet’—<b>For God set us not</b> ( ‘appointed<b> us</b> not’ [reff.]; keep the historical past meaning,—referring to the time when He made the appointment)<b> to</b> ( ‘<i>with a view to</i>’—so as to issue in, become a prey to)<b> wrath, but to acquisition</b><b> of salvation through</b> (<b>through...</b> refers to “<i>acquisition of salvation</i>,” not to “<i>appointed</i>”)<b> our Lord Jesus Christ</b>,<b> 10.</b>]<b> who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep</b> (in what sense? surely not in an ethical sense, as above: for they who sleep will be overtaken by Him as a thief, and His day will be to them darkness, not light. If not in an ethical sense, it must be in that of<i> living</i> or<i> dying</i>, and the sense as Rom. xiv. 8. For we cannot adopt the trifling sense given by Whitby, al.,— ‘whether He come in the night, and so find us taking our natural rest, or in the day when we are waking.’ Thus understood however, it will be at the sacrifice of perspicuity, seeing that the words<b> wake</b> and<b> sleep</b> have been used ethically throughout the passage. If we wish to preserve the uniformity of metaphor, we<i> may</i> [though I am not satisfied with this] interpret in this sense: that our Lord died for us, that whether we watch [are of the number of the watchful, i.e. already Christians] or sleep [are of the number of the sleeping, i.e. unconverted] we should live, &c. Thus it would be equivalent to, ‘who died that all men might be saved:’ who came, not to call the righteous only, but sinners to life. There is to this interpretation the great objection that it confounds with the “<i>rest</i>” the “<i>we</i>,” who are definitely spoken of as set by God not to wrath but to<i> the obtaining</i><i> of salvation</i>. So that the sense<b> live or die</b>, must, I think, be accepted. and the want of perspicuity with it).
