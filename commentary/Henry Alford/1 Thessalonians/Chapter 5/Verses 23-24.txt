<p><strong> εἰρήνη</strong> here most probably in its wider sense, as the accomplishment of all these Christian graces, and result of the avoidance of all evil. It seems rather far-fetched to refer it back to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:13">1 Thessalonians 5:13</span> .

<p><strong> ὁλοτελεῖς</strong> seems to refer to the entireness of sanctification, which is presently expressed in detail. Jerome, who treats at length of this passage, ad Hedibiam (ep. cxx.) quæst. xii., vol. i. p. 1004, explains it, ‘per omnia vel in omnibus, sive plenos et perfectos:’ and so Pelt, ‘ut fiatis integri:’ and the reviewer of Mr. Jowett in the Journal of S. Lit., April, 1856: ‘sanctify you (to be) entire.’ But I prefer the other interpretation: in which case it = ὅλους .

<p><strong> ὁλόκληρον</strong> ] emphatic predicate, as its position before the article shews: <strong> entire</strong> refers to all three following substantives, though agreeing in gender with πνεῦμα , the nearest. Cf. besides reff., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+23:15">Leviticus 23:15</span> , ἑπτὰ ἑβδομάδας ὁλοκλήρους .

<p><strong> τὸ πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡ ψυχ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τὸ σῶμα</strong> ] τὸ πνεῦμα is the SPIRIT, the highest and distinctive part of man, the immortal and responsible <em> soul</em> , in our common parlance: <strong> ἡ ψυχή</strong> is the lower or animal soul, containing the passions and desires ( αιτία κινήσεως ζωικῆς ζώων , Plato, Deff. p. 411), which we have in common with the brutes, but which in <em> us</em> is ennobled and drawn up by the πνεῦμα . That St. Paul had these distinctions in mind, is plain (against Jowett) from such places as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14">1 Corinthians 2:14</span> . The spirit, that part whereby we are receptive of the Holy Spirit of God, is, in the unspiritual man, crushed down and subordinated to the animal soul ( ψυχή ): he therefore is called ψυχικὸς πνεῦμα μὴ ἔχων , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:19">Jude 1:19</span> ; see also note on 1 Cor. as above.
