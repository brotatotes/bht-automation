<b> 17.</b>]<i> Autographic salutation</i>. The Epistle, as it follows from this, was not written with the Apostle’s own hand, but dictated. So with other Epistles: see Rom. xvi. 22: 1 Cor. xvi. 21: Col. iv. 18. The whole of vv. 17, 18, not merely the benediction, are included in the term<i> the salutation</i>, as written by his own hand. By the words<b> so I write</b>, we must not conceive that any thing was<i> added</i>, such as<i> his signature</i>,—or “<i>farewell</i>,” or any thing of the kind: they are said of that which he is writing at the time. His reason for this caution evidently was, the “<i>epistle as from us</i>,” spoken of ch. ii. 2, And the words<b> in every epistle</b> must not be limited to any future Epistles which he might send to the Thessalonians, but understood of a caution which he intended to practise in future with all his Epistles: or at least with such as required, from circumstances, this identification. Thus we have (1 Thess. being manifestly an exception, as written before the rule was established) Gal. written with his own hand (see note on Gal. vi. 11); 1 Cor. authenticated (xvi. 21); 2 Cor. sent by Titus, and therefore perhaps not needing it (but it may have existed in xiii. 12, 13 without being specified); Rom. not requiring it, as not insisting on his personal authority (but here again the concluding doxology may have been autographic): Col. authenticated (iv. 18): Eph. apparently without it (but possibly vi. 24 may have been autographic): Phil. from its character and its bearer Epaphroditus not requiring it (but here again iv. 23 may be autographic): and the Epistles to individuals would not require such authentication, not to mention that they are probably all autographic—that to Philemon certainly is, see ver. 19 there.<h1 class="new-page" id="1 TimothyTOC"><a href="#1 Timothy"> 1 Timothy</a></h1><table><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tr><td><h2><a href="#1 Timothy 1"> Chapter 1</a></h2></td><td><h2><a href="#1 Timothy 4"> Chapter 4</a></h2></td></tr><tr><td><h2><a href="#1 Timothy 2"> Chapter 2</a></h2></td><td><h2><a href="#1 Timothy 5"> Chapter 5</a></h2></td></tr><tr><td><h2><a href="#1 Timothy 3"> Chapter 3</a></h2></td><td><h2><a href="#1 Timothy 6"> Chapter 6</a></h2></td></tr></table><h1 class="new-page" id="1 Timothy"> The First Letter Of Paul The Apostle To Timothy</h1>
