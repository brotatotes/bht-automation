<b> 1. according to the commandment</b>] See Rom. xvi. 26, Tit. i. 3: a usual expression of St. Paul, and remarkably enough occurring in the doxology at the end of the Epistle to the Romans, which there is every reason to think was written long after the Epistle itself. It is a more direct predication of divine command than “<i>by the will of God</i>” in the earlier Epistles.
