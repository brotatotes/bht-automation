<b> 1. according to the commandment</b>] See Rom. xvi. 26, Tit. i. 3: a usual expression of St. Paul, and remarkably enough occurring in the doxology at the end of the Epistle to the Romans, which there is every reason to think was written long after the Epistle itself. It is a more direct predication of divine command than “<i>by the will of God</i>” in the earlier Epistles.<br><br><b> and Christ Jesus</b>] The Apostle loves these repetitions in his more solemn and formal passages—and the whole style of these Epistles partakes more of this character, as was natural in the decline of life.<br><br><b> our hope</b>] It is not easy to point out the exact reference of this word here, any further than we may say that it gives utterance to the fulness of an old man’s heart in the near prospect of that on which it naturally was ever dwelling. It is the ripening and familiarization of “<i>Christ in us the hope of glory</i>,” Col. i. 27. See also Tit. i. 2. I am persuaded that in many such expressions in these Epistles, we are to seek rather a psychological than a pragmatical explanation. Theodoret notices the similar occurrence of words in Ps. lxv. 5, “<i>O God our Saviour, who art the hope of all the ends of the earth</i>”—which is interesting, as it might have suggested the expression here, familiar as the Apostle was with Old Test. diction.
