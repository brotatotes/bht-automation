<b> 12</b> ff.] (See summary on ver. 3.)<b> I give thanks</b> (this peculiar expression is only used by the Apostle here and in 2 Tim. i. 3)<b> to Him that put strength in me</b> (viz. for His work: he is here treating of the divine enlightening and strengthening which he received for the ministry: compare Acts ix. 22, where the same word in the Greek occurs, “<i>Saul increased in strength</i>”’—a coincidence not to be overlooked), [even]<b> Christ Jesus our Lord, that He accounted me faithful</b> (compare the strikingly similar expression, 1 Cor. vii. 25, “<i>I give my opinion, as having received mercy from the Lord to be faithful</i>:”—He knew me to be such an one, in His foresight, as would prove faithful to the great trust),<b> appointing me</b> (compare 1 Thess. v. 9. The expression is there used of that appointment of God in His sovereignty, by which our course is marked for a certain aim or end: and so it is best taken here,—not for the act of ‘<i>putting me into</i>,’ the ministry, as A.V.)<b> to the ministry</b> (what sort of<i> ministry</i>, is declared, Acts xx. 24);<br><br><b> 13.</b> (and all the more is he thankful, seeing that he was once a direct opponent of the Gospel),<b> being before</b> (the participle is slightly concessive,<i> though<b> I</b> was before</i>)<b> a blasphemer</b> (see Acts xxvi. 9, 11),<b> and persecutor, and insulter</b> (one who added insult to persecution. The facts which justified the use of such a term were known to St. Paul’s conscience: we might well infer them, from his own confessions in Acts xxii. 4, 19, and xxvi. 9–12. He describes himself as “<i>being exceedingly mad against them</i>”):<b> howbeit</b> ( “God’s mercy and St. Paul’s want of it are put in sharp contrast.” Ellicott)<b> I had mercy shewn me, because I did it ignorantly</b> (so Rom. x. 2, of the Jews, “<i>They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge</i>.” Compare also, as a most important parallel, our Lord’s prayer for His murderers, Luke xxiii. 34)<b> in unbelief</b> (<b>unbelief</b> was his<i> state</i>, of which his ignorance of what he did was a<i> consequence</i>. The clause is a very weighty one, as applying to others under similar circumstances: and should lead us to form our judgments in all charity respecting even persecutors—and if of them, then surely even with a wider extension of charity to those generally, who lie in the ignorance of unbelief, whatever be its cause, or its effects).
