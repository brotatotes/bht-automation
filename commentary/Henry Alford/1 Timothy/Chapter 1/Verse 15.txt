Revelation 21:5 , οὗτοι οἱ λόγοι ἀληθινοὶ καὶ πιστοί εἰσιν : similarly Revelation 22:6 [or, one belonging to those who are of the πίστις ]. The formula πιστὸς ὁ λόγος is peculiar to the pastoral Epistles, and characteristic I believe of their later age, when certain sayings had taken their place as Christian axioms, and were thus designated)  is the saying, and worthy of all (all possible, i.e. universal)  reception (see reff.
