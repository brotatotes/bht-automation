<b> 15.</b>]<b> Faithful</b> (worthy of credit: compare Rev. xxi. 5, “<i>These sayings are true and faithful</i>:” similarly xxii. 6. The formula “<i>Faithful is the saying</i>” is peculiar to the pastoral Epistles, and characteristic I believe of their later age, when certain sayings had taken their place as Christian axioms, and were thus designated)<b> is the saying, and worthy of all</b> (all possible i.e. universal)<b> reception</b> (we have a form of the same word used Acts ii. 46, “As many as<i> received</i> his word were baptized”),<b> that Christ Jesus came into the world</b> (an expression otherwise found only in St. John. In Matt. xviii. 11, and the parallel place in St. Luke, we have<i> came</i>, simply, thus used)<b> to save sinners</b> (to be taken in the most general sense, not limited in any way);<b> of whom</b> (sinners; the aim and extent of the Lord’s mercy intensifies the feeling of his own especial unworthiness)<b> I am</b> (not, ‘<i>was</i>’)<b> chief</b> (literally,<b> first</b>: but the expression does not refer to<i> time</i>, which would not be the fact [see below]: the expression is one of the deepest humility: “he oversteps the very limit of self-abasement,” says ‘Theodoret: and indeed it is so, compare Phil. iii. 6; 1 Cor. xv. 9; Acts xxiii. 1; xxiv. 16; but deep humility ever does this: it is but another form of “<i>me the sinner</i>,” Luke xviii. 13: other men’s crimes seem to sink into nothing in comparison, and a man’s own to be the chief and only ones in his sight).
