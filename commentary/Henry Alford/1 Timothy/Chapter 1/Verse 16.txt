<p><strong> 16</strong> .] <strong> howbeit</strong> (as E. V.: “not resumptive, but as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:13">1 Timothy 1:13</span> , seclusive and antithetical, marking the contrast between the Apostle’s own judgment on himself, and the mercy which God was pleased to shew him.” Ellic.) <strong> for this purpose I had mercy shewn me, that in me</strong> (as an example; “in my case:” see reff. and cf. εἰς ὑποτύπωσιν below) <strong> first</strong> (it can hardly be denied that in <strong> πρώτῳ</strong> here the senses of ‘ <em> chief</em> ’ and ‘ <em> first</em> ’ are combined. This latter seems to be necessitated by <strong> μελλόντων</strong> below. Though he was not in time ‘the first of sinners,’ yet he was the first as well as the most notable example of such marked long-suffering, held up for the encouragement of the church) <strong> Christ Jesus might shew forth</strong> (dynamic middle: see note on ref. Eph., and Ellicott there) <strong> the whole of His</strong> (not merely ‘ <em> all</em> ’ (all possible, πᾶσαν ): nor ‘all His’ (Conyb., Ellic.: πᾶσαν τὴν …), but ‘ <em> the whole</em> ,’ ‘the whole mass of μακροθυμία , of which I was an example; ὁ ἅπας seems to be found here only. If the rec. reading be in question, in all other cases where ὁ πᾶς occurs with a substantive in the N. T., it is one which admits of partition, and may therefore be rendered by ‘all the ‘or ‘the whole:’ e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:18">Acts 20:18</span> , πῶς μεθ ʼ ὑμῶν τὸν πάντα χρόνον ἐγενόμην : see also ref. Wetst. has two examples from Polyb. in which ὁ πᾶς has the meaning of ‘ <em> the utmost</em> :’ τῆς πάσης ἀλογιστίας ἐστὶ σημεῖον , and τῆς ἁπάσης (as here) ἀτοπίας εἶναι σημεῖον ) <strong> long-suffering</strong> (not, <em> generosity, magnanimity</em> : nor is the idea of <em> long</em> -suffering here irrelevant, as some have said: Christ’s mercy gave him all that time for repentance, during which he was persecuting and opposing Him, and therefore it was his <em> long</em> -suffering which was so wonderful), <strong> for an example</strong> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:6">2 Peter 2:6</span> , ὑπόδειγμα μελλόντων ἀσεβεῖν τεθεικώς . Wetst. has shewn by very copious extracts, that <strong> ὑποτύπωσις</strong> is used by later writers, beginning with Aristotle, for a <em> sketch</em> , an <em> outline</em> , afterwards to be filled up. This indeed the recorded history of Paul would be, the filling up taking place in each man’s own case: see ref. 2 Tim., note. Or the meaning ‘sample,’ ‘ensample,’ as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:13">2 Timothy 1:13</span> , will suit equally well) <strong> of</strong> (to, see Ellicott’s note, and Donaldson, Gr. Gr. § 450) <strong> those who should</strong> (the time of μελλόντων is not the time of writing the Epistles, but that of the mercy being shewn: so that we must not say “who <em> shall</em> ,” but “who <em> should</em> ”) <strong> believe on Him</strong> (the unusual <strong> ἐπ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> αὐτῷ</strong> is easily accounted for, from its occurrence in so very common a quotation as πᾶς ὁ πιστεύων ἐπ ʼ αὐτῷ οὐ καταισχυνθήσεται , see reff. The propriety of the expression here is, that it gives more emphatically the ground of the πιστεύειν brings out more the <em> reliance</em> implied in it almost q. d., ‘to rely on Him for eternal life.’ Ellicott has, in his note here, given a full and good classification of the constructions of πιστεύω in the N. T.) <strong> to</strong> (belongs to πιστεύειν (see above) as its aim and end (cf. Heb 10:39 ): not to ὑποτύπωσιν , as Bengel suggests) <strong> life eternal:</strong></p>
