 17 .]  but (  δέ takes the thought entirely off from himself and every thing else, and makes the following sentence exclusive as applied to God. ‘Ex sensu gratiæ fluit doxologan.’ Bengel. Compare by all means the very similar doxology, Romans 16:25 ff.: and see, on their similarity, the inferences in the Prolegomena, ch. vii. § i. 33, and note)  to the King (this name, as applied to God, is found, in N. T., only in Matthew 5:35 (not Matthew 25:34 ff.) and our ch. 1 Timothy 6:15 . See below)  of the ages (i.e. of eternity: cf. the reff. Tobit, where the same expression occurs, and Sir. θεὸς τῶν αἰώνων : also Psalms 144:13 , ἡ βασιλεία σου βασιλεία πάντων τῶν αἰώνων , מַלְכוּת כָּל־עֹלָמִים . Comparing these with the well-known εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων , εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας , and the like, it is far more likely that οἱ αἰῶνες here should mean eternity, than the ages of this world, as many have understood it. The doxology is to the Father, not to the Trinity (Thdrt.), nor to the Son (Calov., al.): cf. ἀοράτῳ ),  incorruptible (in ref. Rom. only, used of God),  invisible (reff.: see also ch. 1 Timothy 6:16 ; John 1:18 . Beware of taking ἀφθάρτῳ , ἀοράτῳ with θεῷ , as recommended by Bishop Middleton, on the ground of the articles being wanting before these adjectives. It is obvious that no such consideration is of any weight in a passage like the present. The abstract adjectives of attribute are used almost as substantives, and stand by themselves, referring not to βασιλεῖ immediately, but to Him of whom βασιλεύς is a title, as well as they: q. d. ‘to Him who is the King of the ages, the Incorruptible, the Invisible, …’),  the only God ( σοφῷ has apparently come from the doxology at the end of Romans, where it is most appropriate),  be honour and glory to the ages  of the ages (the periods which are made up of αἰῶνες , as these last are of years, as years are of days: see note, Ephesians 3:21 ; and Ellic. on Gal 1:5 ),  Amen .
