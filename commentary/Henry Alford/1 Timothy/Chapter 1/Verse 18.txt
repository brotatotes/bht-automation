<b> 18</b> ff.] He now returns to the matter which he dropped in ver. 3, not indeed formally, so as to supply the termination of the sentence there neglected, but virtually: the<i> commandment</i> not being the one there hinted at, for that was one not given to Timothy, but<i> to be given by</i> him. Nor is it that in ver. 5, for that is introduced as regarding a matter quite different from the present—viz. the aberrations of the false teachers, who do not here appear till the exhortation to Timothy is over. What this command is, is plain from the following.—<b>This command I commit</b> (as a deposit, to be faithfully guarded and kept)<b> unto thee, my child Timothy</b> (see on ver. 2),<b> according to</b> (in pursuance of)<b> the former prophecies concerning thee</b> (the directions, or, prophecies properly so called, of the Holy Spirit, which were spoken concerning Timothy at his first conversion, or at his admission [compare ch. iv. 14] into the ministry, by the “<i>prophets</i>” in the church. We have instances of such prophetic intimations in Acts xiii. 1, 2,— [ix 28,]—xxi. 10, 11. By such intimations, spoken perhaps by Silas, who was with him, and who was a<i> prophet</i> [Acts xv. 32], may St. Paul have been first induced to take Timothy to him as a companion, Acts xvi. 3),<b> that thou mayest</b> (purpose, and at the same time purport, of the<i> commandment</i>)<b> war</b> (this word extends to the whole business of the employed soldier; not indicating merely<i> fighting,</i> properly so called)<b> in them</b> (not, as A.V., ‘<i>by them,</i>’ but ‘<i>in,</i>’ as clad with them, as if they were his defence and confirmation)<b> the good warfare</b> (not as Conybeare, ‘fight the good fight.’ It is the<i> whole campaign,</i> uot the fight alone, which is here spoken of);<b> holding</b> [<b>fast</b>] (more than ‘<i>having;</i>” but we must hardly carry on the metaphor and think of the shield of faith Eph. vi. 16, such continuation being rendered unlikely by the unmetaphorical character of the following words,<i> a good conscience</i>)<b> faith, and good conscience</b> (compare ver. 5),—<b>which</b> (latter, viz.<i> good conscience</i>—not, both)<b> some having thrust from them</b> (there is something in the word implying the violence of the act required, and the importunity of conscience, reluctant to be so extruded)<b> made shipwreck</b> (the similitude is so common a one, that it is hardly necessary to extend the figure of a shipwreck beyond the word itself, nor to find in the<i> thrusting from them</i> allusions to a rudder, anchor, &c.)<b> concerning the faith</b> (objective: the things believed):<b> among whom is Hymenzus</b> (there is a Hymenæus mentioned 2 Tim. ii. 17, in conjunction with Philetus, as an heretical teacher. There is no reason to distinguish him from this one: nor any difficulty occasioned by the fact of his being here<i> delivered over to Satan</i>, and there mentioned as overthrowing the faith of many. He would probably go on with his evil teaching in spite of the Apostle’s sentence, which could carry weight with those only who were sound in the faith)<b> and Alexander</b> (in all probability identical with “<i>Alexander the coppersmith,</i>” 2 Tim. iv. 14. There is nothing against it in what is there said of him. He appears there to have been an adversary of the Apostle, who had withstood and injured him at his late visit to Ephesus: but there is no reason why he should not have been still under this sentence at that time);<b> whom I delivered over to Satan</b> (there does not seem to be, as almost always taken for granted, any necessary assertion of excommunication, properly so called. The delivering to Satan, as in 1 Cor. v. 5, seems to have been an apostolic act, for the purpose of active punishment, in order to correction. It might or might not be accompanied by extrusion from the church: it appears to have been thus accompanied in 1 Cor. v. 5:—but the two must not be supposed identical. The upholders of such identity allege the fact of Satan’s empire being conceived as including all outside the church [Acts xxvi. 18 al.]: but such expressions are too vague to be adduced as applying to a direct assertion like this. Satan, the adversary, is evidently regarded as the buffeter and tormentor, compare 2 Cor. xii. 7—ever ready, unless his hand were held, to distress and afflict God’s people,—and ready therefore, when thus let loose by one having power over him, to execute punishment with all his malignity.—Observe that the verb is not perfect, “<i>I have delivered,</i>” as A.V. wrongly, but past [<b>I delivered</b>]. He did this when he was last at Ephesus),<b> that they may be disciplined</b> (taught by chastisement: “<i>may be,</i>” because the effect of what was done still abides; the sentence was not yet taken off, nor the chastisement at an end)<b> not to blaspheme</b> (God, or Christ, whose holy name was brought to shame by these men associating it with unholy and unclean doctrines).
