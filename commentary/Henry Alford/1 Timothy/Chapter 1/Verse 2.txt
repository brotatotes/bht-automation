 2 .  γνησίω τ  . ] Cf. Acts 16:1 ; 1 Corinthians 4:14-17 ; and Prolegg. to this Epistle, § i. 1 ff.  γνησίῳ ,  true, genuine cf. Plato, Politic. p. 293, οὐ γνησίας οὐδ ʼ ὄντως οὔσας … ἀλλὰ μεμιμημένας ταύτην .
	 ἐν πίστει ] When Conyb. says, “ ‘  in faith ,’ not ‘  in the faith ,’ which would require τῇ ” (so Ellic., without the protest), he forgets (1) the constant usage by which the article is omitted after prepositions in cases where it is beyond doubt in the mind of the writer and must be expressed in translation: (2) the almost uniform anarthrousness of these Epistles. He himself translates the parallel expression in Titus 1:4 , ‘  mine own son according to our common faith ,’ which is in fact supplying the article. Render therefore  in the faith : joining it with γνησίῳ τέκνῳ : and compare reff.
	 ἔλεος and  εἰρήνη are found joined in Galatians 6:16 , in which Epistle are so many similarities to these (see Prolegg. to these Epistles, § i. 32, note).
	The expression  θεὸς πατήρ , absolute, is found in St. Paul, in Galatians 1:1 ; Galatians 1:3 ; Ephesians 6:23 ; Philippians 2:11 ; Colossians 3:17 ( τῷ θ . π .): 1 Thessalonians 1:1 ; 2Th 1:1 ; 2 Timothy 1:2 ; Titus 1:4 . So that it belongs to all periods of his writing, but chiefly to the later.
