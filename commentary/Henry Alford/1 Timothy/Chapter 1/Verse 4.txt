<b> 4. fables</b>] We can only judge from the other passages in these Epistles where the word occurs, what kind of fables are alluded to. In Tit. i. 14 we have “<i>Jewish fables</i>.” In our ch. iv. 7, they are designated as “<i>profane and anile</i>.” In 2 Tim. iv. 4, they are spoken of absolutely, as here. If we are justified in identifying the ‘fables’ in Titus with these, they had a Jewish origin: but merely to take them, as Theodoret, for the Jewish traditional comments on the law, does not seem to satisfy the<i> epithets</i> quoted above. And consequently others have interpreted them of the gnostic mythology. It does not seem easy to define them any further, but it is plain that any transitional state from Judaism to gnosticism will satisfy the conditions here propounded without inferring that the full-blown gnosticism of the second century must be meant, and thus calling in question the genuineness of the Epistle. On the whole subject, see Introd. to ch. vii.§i. 8 ff.<br><br><b> endless genealogies</b>] De Wette, in his note on Tit i. 14, marks out well the references which have been assigned to this expression: “<b>genealogies</b> cannot mean 1)<i> properly genealogical registers</i>,—either for a pure genealogico-historical end, or for a dogmatico-historical one, to foster the religious national pride of Jews against Gentiles, see Phil. iii. 4 f., or to ascertain the descent of the Messiah, least of all genealogies of Timothy himself,—for all this does not touch, or too little touches religious interests: nor are they 2)<i> gentile theogonies</i>; nor again 3)<i> cabalistic pedigrees</i>, which will hardly suit the word<i> genealogies</i>: nor 4)<i> Essenean</i><i> genealogies of angels</i>, of the existence of which we have no proof: nor 5)<i> allegorizing</i><i> genealogies</i>, applications of psychological and historical considerations to the genealogies contained in the books of Moses: as in Philo,—a practice too peculiar to Philo and his view: but most probably 6)<i> lists of gnostic emanations</i>.”—But again, inasmuch as<b> genealogies</b> are coupled in Tit. iii. 9 with “<i>strifes about the law</i>,” it seems as if we must hardly understand the ripened fruits of gnosticism, but rather the first beginnings of these genealogies in the abuse of Judaism.<br><br><b> endless</b> may be used merely in popular hyperbole to signify the tedious length of such genealogies.<br><br><b> the which</b>] i.e.<b> of the kind which</b>.<br><br><b> minister</b>] ‘<i>afford</i>,’ ‘<i>give rise to</i>,’ ‘<i>furnish</i>.’<br><br><b> rather than</b>] is a mild way of saying “<i>and not</i>: see John iii. 19; Acts xxvii. 11; 2 Tim. iii, 4.<br><br><b> God’s dispensation...</b>] This has been taken two ways: 1) objectively: the<i> dispensation of God</i> (towards man)<i> which is</i> (consists)<i> in</i> (the)<i> faith</i>: in which case the verb “<i>minister</i>” must bear something of a transferred meaning, as applied to “<i>dispensation</i>,” implying, “rather than they set forth,”&c, And to this there can be no objection. This meaning also suits that of<i> dispensation</i>, even in Eph. i. 16, and 1 Cor. ix. 17, where the dispensation is the objective matter wherewith the Apostle was entrusted, not his own subjective fulfilment of it. 2) subjectively:— ‘<i>the exercising of</i><i> the stewardship of God in faith</i>.’ But to this there is the serious objection, that the word<i> œconomy</i>, or<i> dispensation</i>, in this subjective sense, ‘<i>the fulfilment of the duty of a steward</i>,’ wants example: and even could this be substantiated,<i> to minister a dispensation</i>, in the sense required, would seem again questionable. I would therefore rest in the objective sense—<b>the dispensation of God</b>.<b> Then which is in faith</b> has also been variously taken. But the only legitimate meaning seems to be—<b>which is in faith</b>, i.e. finds its sphere, and element, and development among men, in faith. Thus<b> in faith</b> stands in contrast to<i> questions</i>, in which the<i> dispensation</i><i> of God does not</i> consist: and the way for the next sentence is prepared, which speaks of<i> faith unfeigned</i> as one of the means to the great end of the gospel.
