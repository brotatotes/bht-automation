<b> 4. fables</b>] We can only judge from the other passages in these Epistles where the word occurs, what kind of fables are alluded to. In Tit. i. 14 we have “<i>Jewish fables</i>.” In our ch. iv. 7, they are designated as “<i>profane and anile</i>.” In 2 Tim. iv. 4, they are spoken of absolutely, as here. If we are justified in identifying the ‘fables’ in Titus with these, they had a Jewish origin: but merely to take them, as Theodoret, for the Jewish traditional comments on the law, does not seem to satisfy the<i> epithets</i> quoted above. And consequently others have interpreted them of the gnostic mythology. It does not seem easy to define them any further, but it is plain that any transitional state from Judaism to gnosticism will satisfy the conditions here propounded without inferring that the full-blown gnosticism of the second century must be meant, and thus calling in question the genuineness of the Epistle. On the whole subject, see Introd. to ch. vii.§i. 8 ff.
