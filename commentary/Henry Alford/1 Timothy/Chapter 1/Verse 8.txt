<b> 8</b> ff.] On the other hand the law has its right use:—not that to which they put it, but to testify against sins in practice: the catalogue of which seems to be here introduced, on account of the lax moral practice of these very men who were, or were in danger of, falling into them. They did not set it aside, but perverted it, and practised the very sins against which it was directed.<b> But</b> (slight contrast to last verse, taking up the matter on general grounds)<b> we know</b> (see Rom. vii. 14: a thoroughly Pauline expression)<b> that. the law is good</b> (Rom. vii. 16: not only<i> profitable</i>, but in a far higher sense, as in Rom. vii. 12, 14: good abstractedly,—in accordance with the divine holiness and justice and truth: see ver. 18, ch. iv. 4),<b> if a man</b> (undoubtedly, in the<i> first place</i>, and mainly, a<i> teacher</i>: but not to be confined to that meaning: all that is here said might apply just as well to a private Christian’s thoughts and use of the law, as to the use of it by teachers themselves)<b> use it lawfully</b> (i. e. not, as most expositors,<i> according to its</i><i> intention as law</i>, and as directed against the following sins<i> in Christians</i>: but clearly, from what follows,<b> lawfully</b><i> in the Gospel sense:</i> i.e. as<i> not binding on</i>, nor<i> relevant to Christian believers</i>, but only<i> a means of awakening repentance in the ungodly and profane</i>. Chrysostom’s words are: “Who is he that uses it lawfully? He who knows not the need of it”),<b> and be aware of this</b> (the word implies both the possession and the application of the knowledge),<b> that for a righteous man</b> (in what sense? in the mere sense of ‘<i>virtuous</i>,’ righteous in the world’s acceptation of the term? Such meaning is clearly excluded by ver. 11, which sets the whole sentence in the full light of Gospel doctrine, and necessitates a corresponding interpretation for every term used in it.<b> Righteous</b> therefore can only mean, righteous in the<i> Christian sense</i>, viz. by<i> justifying faith and sanctification of the Spirit</i>,—one who is included in the actual righteousness of Christ by having put Him on, and so not<i> forensically amenable to the law</i>,—par-taker of the inherent righteousness of Christ, inwrought by the Spirit, which unites him to Him, and so not<i> morally needing it</i>)<b> the law</b> (as before)<b> is not enacted but for lawless and insubordinate</b> (Tit. i. 6, 10: it. is very nearly the same as<i> disobedient</i>, see Tit. i. 16; iii. 3,—this latter being more subjective, whereas “<i>insubordinate</i>” points to the objective fact. This first pair of adjectives expresses opposition to<i> the law</i>, and so stands foremost as designating those for whom it is enacted), for<b> impious and sinful</b> (see especially i Pet. iv. 18. This second pair expresses opposition to<i> God</i>, whose law it is—<b>impious</b>, or<b> ungodly</b>, being the man who does not reverence Him, the<b> sinner</b>, the man who lives in defiance of Him),<b> for unholy and profane</b> (this last pair betokens separation and alienation from God and His law alike—those who have no share in His holiness, no relation to things sacred. “The<i> impious</i> is unholy through his lack of<i> reverence</i>: the<i> unholy</i>, through his lack of<i> inner purity</i>.” Ellicott),<b> for father-smiters and mother-smiters</b> (not only<i> murderers</i>; the word often had a wider sense. Hitherto the classes have been general, and [see above] arranged according to their opposition to the law, or to God, or to both: now he<i> takes the second table of the decalogue, and goes through its commandments</i>, to the ninth inclusive,<i> in order</i>.<i> Smiters of fathers and mothers</i> are the transgressors of the<i> fifth</i>),<b> for manslayers</b> (<i>the sixth</i>),<b> for fornicators</b>,<b> for sodomites</b> (sins of abomination against both sexes: the<i> seventh</i>),<b> for slave-dealers</b> (the Apostle puts the<i> slave-stealer and dealer</i> as the most flagrant of all breakers of the<i> eighth</i> commandment. No theft of a man’s goods can be compared with that most, atrocious act, which steals<i> the man himself</i>, and robs him of that free will which is the first gift of his Creator. And of this crime all are guilty, who, whether directly or indirectly, are engaged in, or uphold trom whatever pretence, the making or keeping of slaves),<b> for liars, for perjurers</b> (breakers of the<i> ninth</i> commandment. It is remarkable that he does not refer to that very commandment by which the law wrought on himself when he was alive without the law and sin was dead in him, viz. the<i> tenth</i>. Possibly this may be on account of its more spiritual nature, as he here wishes to bring out the grosser kinds of sin against. which the moral law is pointedly enacted. The subsequent clause however seems as if he had it in his mind, and on that account added a concluding general and inclusive description),<b> and if any thing else</b> (he passes to sins themselves from the committers of sins)<b> is opposed to the healthy teaching</b> (i. e. that<i></i> moral teaching which is spiritually sound<i>: the teaching according to</i><i> godliness</i>, ch. vi. 3, where it is parallel with “<i>the wholesome sayings of our Lord Jesus Christ</i>.” “The formula.... stands in clear and suggestive contrast to the sickly [ch. vi. 4] and morbid [2 Tim. ii. 17] teaching of Jewish gnosis.” Ellicott);<b> according to</b> (belongs to the whole preceding sentence,—the entire exposition which he has been giving of the freedom of Christians from the moral law of the decalogue)<b> the gospel of the glory</b> (not, ‘<i>the glorious gospel</i>,’ A.V., see 2 Cor. iv. 4: all propriety and beauty of expression is here, as always, destroyed by this adjectival rendering. The gospel is ‘the glad tidings of the glory of God,’ as of Christ in 2 Cor., inasmuch as it reveals to us God in all His glory, which glory would be here that of justifying the sinner without the law, by His marvellous provision of redemption in Christ)<b> of the blessed God</b> (<b>blessed</b>, used of God, is one of those expressions which are peculiar to this later date and manner of the Apostle. On such, see Introduction),<b> with which I</b> (emphatic)<b> was</b> (indicating simply the past; pointing to the time during which this his commission had been growing into its fulness and importance)<b> entrusted</b> (not<i> these people</i>. The connexion with the following appears to be this: his mind is full of thankfulness at the thought of the commission which was thus entrusted to him: he does not regret the charge, but overflows with gratitude at the remembrance of Christ’s grace to him, especially when he recollects also what he once was; how nearly approaching [for I would not exclude even that thought as having contributed to produce these strong expressions] some of those whom he has just mentioned. So that he now goes off from the immediate subject, even more completely and suddenly than is his wont in his other writings, as again and again in these pastoral Epistles: shewing thereby, I believe, the tokens of advancing age, and of that faster hold of individual habits of thought and mannerisms, which characterizes the decline of life).
