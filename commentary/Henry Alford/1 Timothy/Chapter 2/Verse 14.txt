 14 .]  Second reason as the woman was  last in being , so she was  first in sin indeed  the only victim of the Tempter’s deceit.  And Adam was not deceived (not to be weakened, as Thdrt. τὸ οὐκ ἠπατήθη , ἀντὶ τοῦ , οὐ πρῶτος , εἴρηκεν : nor, as Matthies, must we supply ὑπὸ τοῦ ὄφεως : nor, with De W., Wiesinger, al., must we press the fact that the woman only was  misled by the senses. Bengel and Huther seem to me (but cf. Ellicott) to have apprehended the right reference: ‘serpens mulierem decepit, mulier virum non decepit, sed ei persuasit.’ As Huther observes, the ἠπάτησεν , in the original narrative, is used of the woman only.

Rom 4:15 ).
