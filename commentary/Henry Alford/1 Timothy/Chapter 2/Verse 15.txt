The curse on the woman for her<i> transgression</i> was, “<i>In sorrow shalt thou bear children</i>” [Gen. iii. 16]. Her<b> childbearing</b> is that in which the curse finds its operation. What then is here promised her? Not only exemption from that curse in its worst and heaviest effects: not merely that she shall safely bear children: but the Apostle’ uses the words<b> shall be saved</b> purposely for their higher meaning, and the construction of the sentence is precisely as 1 Cor. iii. 15,<i> “He himself shall be saved, but so as through fire.</i>” Just as that man should be saved through, as passing through, fire which is his trial, his hindrance in his way, in spite of which he escapes,—so she shall be saved, through, as passing through, her childbearing, which is her trial, her curse, her (not means of salvation, but) hindrance in the way of it.—The other renderings which have been given seem to me both irrelevant and ungrammatical.
