<b>God, who</b> (i. e. seeing that He)<b> willeth all men to be</b><b> saved</b> (see ch. iv. 10: Tit. ii. 11.<b> All men</b> is repeated from verse 1. Chrysostom’s comment is very noble: “Imitate God. If He willed all men to be saved, why then we ought to pray for all mankind. If He willeth all to be saved, do thou will it too; and if thou willest it, pray. For prayer is the utterance of the will.” Notice, not “<i>God willeth to save all</i><i> men,</i>” for in that case He would have done it: but<b> God willeth all men to be</b><b> saved:</b> to accept the offered salvation. On this even God’s predestination is contingent. Calvin most unworthily shuffles out of the decisive testimony borne by this passage to universal redemption, saying, “The Apostle simply means, that no people or rank in the world is excluded from salvation: because God willeth the Gospel to be propounded to all without exception.... The discourse is of kinds of men, not of individual persons: for he merely intends to include in this number kings and foreign peoples.” As if kings and all in eminence were not in each case individual men),<b> and to come to (the) certain knowledge</b><br><br> (the word imports a fuller and more assured acquaintance than mere<i> knowledge,</i> see 1 Cor. xiii. 12: Col. i. 11; ii, 2)<b> of (the) truth</b> (the expression is a favourite one in these Epistles, see 2 Tim. ii. 25; iii. 7; Titus i. 1. This realization of the truth is in fact identical with<i> salvation,</i> not only as that<i> salvation</i> is a<i> rescue</i> from life in untruth, but in its deepest and widest sense of<i> salvation</i>, here and hereafter: compare John xvii. 3).
