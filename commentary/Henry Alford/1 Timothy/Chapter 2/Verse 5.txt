<b> 5.</b>]<b> For</b> (further grounding of the acceptableness of prayer for all men,—in the UNITY of God. But this verse is joined by the<b> for</b> directly to the preceding, not to ver. 1. Chrysostom gives it rightly,— “shewing that He willeth all to be saved”)<b> there is</b> ONE<b> God</b> (He is ONE in essence and one in purpose—not of different minds to different nations or individuals, but of one mind towards all. Similarly Rom. iii. 30, and, which is important for the understanding of that difficult passage, Gal. iii. 20. The double reference, to the unity in essence and unity of purpose, for which I have contended there, is plain and unmistakeable here), ONE<b> Mediator</b> (this word<b> Mediator</b> occurs, besides Gal. iii. 19, 20, only in the Epistle to the Heb., 6; ix. 15; xii. 24. There is no necessity that the idea should be connected with that of a mutual covenant, and so be here far-fetched as regards the context: the word is used as standing alone, and representing the fact of Christ Jesus being the only<i> go-between,</i> in whatever sense)<b> also of</b> (between)<b> God and men</b> (if one only goes between, then that One aust be for<i> all</i>),<b> Christ Jesus</b> [<b>himself</b>]<b> man</b> (why<b> man?</b> ‘Theodoret answers, “He calls Christ man because he called Him a Mediator: for He became Mediator by becoming man:” and so most Commentators. But it is not here the Apostle’s object, to set forth the nature of Christ’s mediation as regards its being brought about;—only as regards its unity and universality for mankind. And for this latter reason he calls him here by this name MAN,—that He gathered up all our human nature into Himself, becoming its second Head, So that the assertion that He is<i> man</i>, in fact carries with it the very strongest proof of that which he is maintaining. Notice it is not, as in A.V., “the<i> man</i> Christ Jesus:” in personality, our Lord was not<i> a man</i>, but in nature He was man. The stupidity of such writers as Baur and the Socinians, who regard such an expression as against the deity of Christ, is beyond all power of mine to characterize. In the face of the words “<i>one God, one</i><b> Mediator between God</b><i> and</i><b> men,</b>” to maintain gravely such a position, shews utter blindness from party bias even to the plainest thoughts expressed in the plainest words):<b> who gave himself a ransom</b> (literally,<b> a payment in recompense:</b> and this expresses more distinctly the reciprocity which is already implied in the simple word in each case. That the main fact alluded to here is the<i> death</i> of Christ, we know: but it is not brought into prominence, being included in, and superseded by the far greater and more comprehensive fact, that He gave HIMSELF, in all that He undertook for our redemption; see Phil. ii. 5–8)<b> on behalf of all</b> (not of a portion of mankind, but of<i> all men;</i> the point of ver. 1,<i> for</i><b> all men</b>),—<b>the testimony</b> ( ‘that which was [to be] testified” This oneness of the Mediator, involving in itself the universality of Redemption, was the great subject of Christian testimony: see below)<b> in its own seasons</b> (in the times which God had appointed for it).<b> For</b> (towards)<b> which</b> (the testifying)<b> I was placed as a herald</b> (this is a word used in these pastoral Epistles and 2 Pet. only),<b> and apostle</b> (the proclaiming this universality of the Gospel was the one object towards which my appointment as an apostle and preacher was directed. Those who hold the spuriousness of our Epistle, regard this returning to himself and his own ease on the part of the writer as an evidence of his being one who was acting the part of Paul. They have so far truth on their side, that we must recognize here a characteristic increase of the frequency of these personal vindications on the part of the Apostle, as we so often have occasion to remark during these Epistles:—the disposition of one who had been long opposed and worried by adversaries to recur continually to his own claims, the assertion of which had now become with him almost, so to speak, a matter of stock-phrases. Still, the propriety of the assertion here is evident: it is only in the manner of it that the above habit is discernible. See more on this in the Introduction. The same phrase occurs verbatim in 2 Tim. i. 11),—<b>I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not</b>— (in spite of all that some Commentators say of the evident appropriateness of this solemn asseveration here, I own I am unable to regard it as any more than a strong and interesting proof of the growth of a habit in the Apostle’s mind, which we already trace in 2 Cor. xi. 31, Rom. ix. 1, till he came to use the phrase with less force and relevance than he had once done. Nothing can be more natural than that one whose life was spent in strong conflict and assertion of his Apostleship, should repeat the fervour of his usual asseveration, even when the occasion of that fervour had passed away)—<b>a teacher of the Gentiles</b> (it was especially in this latter fact that the assertion of the universality of the Gospel found its justification, The historical proof of his constitution as a teacher of the Gentiles is to be found in Acts ix. 15, xxii. 21, xxvi. 17; but especially in Gal. ii. 9)<b> in (the) faith and (the) truth</b> (do these words refer subjectively to his own conduct in teaching the Gentiles, or objectively to that in which he was to instruct them? The former view is taken hy Theodoret and most Commentators: the latter by some moderns. In judging between these, we must take into account the usage of “<i>truth</i>” above, ver. 4, ina very similar reference, when it was to be matter of teaching to all men. There it undoubtedly is<i> the truth</i> of God. I would therefore take it similarly here,—the sphere in which both his teaching and their learning was to be employed—<i>the truth of the Gospel.</i> Then, if so, it is surely harsh to make<b> faith</b> subjective, especially as the “<i>in</i>” is not repeated before “<i>truth</i>.” It too will most properly be objective,—and likewise regard that in which as an element or sphere, he was to teach and they to learn:<i> the faith</i>).
