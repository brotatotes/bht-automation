The public assemblies are doubtless, in ver. 12, still before the Apostle’s mind, but in a very slight degree. It is the general duties of women, rather than any single point in reference to their conduct in public worship, to which he is calling attention: though the subject of public worship led to his thus speaking, and has not altogether disappeared from his thoughts)<b> adorn themselves in orderly apparel</b> (see Tit. ii. 3, note: “in seemly guise,” Ellicott)<b> with shamefastness</b> (not, as modern reprints of the A.V., ‘shame<i> faced</i> ness,’ which is a mere unmeaning corruption by the printers of a very expressive and beautiful word. Archbishop Trench says (Synonyms of the New Test.,§20), “It is a pity that ‘shamefast’ and ‘shamefastness,’ which last word our translators used here, should have been corrupted in modern use to ‘shame<i> faced</i>’ and ‘shame<i> facedness</i>.’ The words are properly of the same formation as ‘steadfast,’ ‘steadfastness,’ ‘soothfast,’ ‘soothfastness,’ and those good old English words, now lost to us, ‘rootfast,’ and ‘rootfastness.’ As by ‘rootfast’ our fathers understood that which was firm and fast by its root, so by ‘shamefast’ in like manner, that which was established and made<i> fast</i> by an honourable<i> shame.</i> To change this into ‘shamefaced’ is to allow all the meaning and force of the word to run to the surface, to leave us ethically a far inferior word. It is very inexcusable that all modern reprints of the Authorized Version have given in to this corruption’),<b> and self-restraint</b> (or,<b> sobermindedness</b>) ( “if,” Trench concludes, “the former word is the ‘shamefastness,’ or tendency which shrinks from overpassing the limits of womanly reserve and modesty, as well as from the dishonour which would justly attach thereto, this word is that habitual inner self-government, with its constant rein on all the passions and desires, which would hinder the temptation to this from arising, or at all events’ from arising in such strength as should overbear the checks and hindrances which<i> shamefastness</i> opposed to it.” Ellicott explains it, “<i>the well-balanced state of mind, arising from habitual self-restraint</i>”);<b> not in plaits</b> (of hair: compare 1 Pet. iii. 3)<b> and gold</b> ( “<i>putting on of golden ornaments</i>,” 1 Pet. as above: from the use of<b> and,</b> the gold is supposed to be twined among, or worn with, the plaited hair. See Rev. xvii. 4),<b> or pearls, or costly raiment</b> (<i>putting on of apparel,</i> 1 Pet. as above),—but (<b>which is becoming for women professing godliness) by means of good works</b> (not in again, because the adornment lies in a different sphere, and cannot be so expressed. The adorning which results from good works is brought about by their practice, not displayed by appearing to be invested with them).
