<b> 1.] Faithful is the saying</b> (see on ch. i. 15, from the analogy of which it appears that the words are to be referred to what follows, not, with Chrysostom and others, to what has preceded),<b> If any man seeketh (reacheth out after:</b> but it does not seem that he uses the word with any reference to an ambitious seeking. So that any inference respecting ambition for the episcopate betraying the late age of the Epistle, falls to the ground)<b> (the)</b><b> bishopric</b> (office of an<i> overseer</i> or<i> bishop:</i> but it is merely laying a trap for misunderstanding, to render the word, at this time of the Church’s history, ‘the office of a Bishop,’ without giving an explanation, what that office was. The “<i>episcopi</i>” of the N.T. have officially nothing in common with our<i> Bishops</i>. In Acts xx. 17, the A.V. ought to have been consistent with itself, and to have rendered the word<i> bishops</i> always, not<i> bishops</i> in one place and<i> overseers</i> in another, to suit ecclesiastical prejudices. It would be better to adopt the other alternative, and always to render it<b> overseers</b>, were not that word to common English readers appropriated to another kind of office. Thus we should avoid any chance of identifying it with a present and different office, and take refuge in the meaning of the word itself, which at the same time bears an important testimony to the duties of the post.—The identity of the “<i>bishop</i>” and “<i>presbyter</i>” in apostolic times is evident from Tit. i. 5–7: see also note on Phil. i. 1), he<b> desireth a good work</b> (not ‘a good<i> thing:</i>’ but a good<i> employment</i>: see 1 Thess. v. 13: 2 Tim. iv. 5: one of the “<i>good works</i>” so often spoken of).<b> It behoves then (then</b> is best regarded as taking up the term “<i>a good work</i>,” and substantiating that assertion: “a good work must be entrusted to good men”)<b> a bishop</b> (generic)<b> to be irreproachable</b> (Theodoret draws an important distinction: “not to afford<i> just</i> cause for blame: this is what he says, not that he should not be the object of slander, for this the Apostle himself was in many ways”),<b> husband of one wife</b> (two great varieties of interpretation of these words have prevailed, among those who agree to take them as<i> restrictive</i>, not<i> injunctive</i>, which the spirit of the passage and the insertion of the word<i> one</i> surely alike forbid. They have been supposed to prohibit either 1)<i> simultaneous polygamy,</i> or 2)<i> successive polygamy.</i> 1) has somewhat to he said for it. The custom of polygamy was then prevalent among the Jews [Justin Martyr says that their Rabbis even then permitted them to have four or five wives apiece. This was in the middle of the second century], and might easily find its way into the Christian community. And such, it is argued, was the Apostle’s reference, not to second marriages, which he himself commands ch. v. 14, and allows in several other places, e.g. Rom. vii. 2, 3: 1 Cor. vii. 39. But the objection to taking this meaning is, that the Apostle would hardly have specified that as a requisite for the episcopate or presbyterate, which we know to have been fulfilled by all Christians whatever: no instance being adduced of polygamy being practised in the Christian church, and no exhortations to abstain from it. As to St. Paul’s command and permissions, see below. Still, we must not lose sight of the circumstance that the earlier Commentators were unanimous for this view. 2) For the view that<i> second marriages</i> are prohibited to aspirants after the episcopate,—is, the most probable meaning [see there] of “<i>wife of one husband</i>” in ch. v. 9,—as also the wide prevalence in the early Church of the idea that, although second marriages were not<i> forbidden</i> to Christians, abstinence from them was better than indulgence in them. See this proved by various authorities cited in my Greek Test. With regard to the Apostle’s own command and permissions of this state [see above], they do not come into account here, because they are confessedly (and expressly so in ch. v. 14) for those whom it was not contemplated to admit into ecclesiastical office. 3) There have been some divergent lines of interpretation, but they have not found many advocates. Some deny altogether the formal reference to 1) or 2), and understand the expression only of a chaste life of fidelity to the marriage vow: “that neither polygamy, nor concubinage, nor any offensive second marriage, should be able to be alleged against such a person.” But surely this is very vague, for the precise words “<i>husband of one wife.</i>” Bretschneider maintains that “<i>one</i>” is here the indefinite article, and that the Apostle means, a<i> bishop</i> should be the husband of a wife. This hardly needs serious refutation. Worse still is the Romanist evasion, which understands the “<i>one wife</i>” of the<i> Church.</i>—The view then which must I think be adopted, especially in presence of ch. v. 9 [where see note], is, that to candidates for the episcopate [presbytery] St. Paul forbids second marriage. He requires of them pre-eminent chastity, and abstinence from a licence which is allowed to other Christians. How far such a prohibition is to be considered binding on us, now that the Christian life has entered into another and totally different phase, is of course an open question for the present Christian church at any time to deal with. It must be as matter of course understood that regulations, in all<i> lawful</i> things, depend, even when made by an Apostle, on circumstances: and the superstitious observance of the letter in such cases is often pregnant with mischief to the people and cause of Christ),<b> vigilant</b> (probably in the more extended sense of the word;—a pattern of active sobriety and watchfulness: for all these five first adjectives are descriptive of<i> positive</i> qualities: “<i>no brawler</i>” giving the negative and more restricted opposite),<b> soberminded</b> (or,<b> discreet</b>; see above on ch. ii. 9),<b> orderly</b> ( “what<i> soberminded</i> implies within,<i> orderly</i> implies without,” Bengel: thus expanded by Theodoret: “Both in voice and in manner and in look and in gait, so as to exhibit in his body the sobriety of his mind”),<b> hospitable</b> (loving, and entertaining strangers: see Heb. xiii. 2. This duty in the early days of the Christian church was one of great importance. Brethren in their travels could not resort to the houses of the heathen, and would be subject to insult in the public inns),<b> apt in teaching</b> (not merely<i> given</i><i> to</i> teaching, but able and skilled in it. All<i> might teach,</i> to whom the Spirit imparted the gift: but<i> skill</i> in teaching was the especial office of the minister, on whom would fall the ordinary duty of instruction of believers and refutation of gainsayers).
