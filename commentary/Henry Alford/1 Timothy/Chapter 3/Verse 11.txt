<b> 11.</b>] (<b>The</b>)<b> women in like manner</b> (who are these? Are they (1) women who were to serve as deacons,—deaconesses?—or (2) wives of the deacons?—or (3) wives of the deacons and overseers?—or (4) women in general? I conceive we may dismiss (4) at once, for Chrysostom’s reason: “Why should he in the midst of writing on another subject insert any thing respecting<i> women</i>?”— (3) upheld by Calvin and others, may for the same reason, seeing that he returns to the deacons again in ver. 12, be characterized as extremely improbable:— (2) has found many supporters among modern Commentators: and it is the rendering of the A.V. But it has against it (<i>a</i>) the omission in the original of all expressed reference to the deacons: (<i>b</i>) the expression<b> in like manner</b>, by which the<i> deacons</i> themselves were introduced in ver. 8, and which seems to mark a new ecclesiastical class: (<i>c</i>) the introduction of the injunction respecting the deacons in ver. 12, as a new particular, which would hardly be if their wives had been mentioned before: (<i>d</i>) the circumstance connected with the mention of Phœbe as<i> deaconess</i> of the Church at Cenchreæ in Rom. xvi. 1, that unless these are deacon-esses, there would be among these injunctions no mention of an important class of persons employed as officers of the church. We come thus to consider (1), that these women are<i> deaconesses,—ministræ,</i> as Pliny calls them in his letter to Trajan [see note on Rom. xvi. 1]. In this view the ancients are as far as I know unanimous: and it is held by some of the ablest among the moderns. It is alleged against it— (a) that thus the return to the<i> deacons,</i> verse 12, would be harsh, or, as Conybeare says, “on that view the verse is most. unnaturally interpolated in the midst of the discussion concerning the deacons.” But the ready answer to this is found in Chrysostom’s view of ver. 12, that under the word deacons, and their household duties, he comprehends in fact both sexes under one: (b) that the existence of dea-conesses as an order in the ministry is after all not so clear. To this it might be answered, that even were they nowhere else mentioned, the present passage stands on its own grounds; and if it seemed from the context that such persons were indicated here, we should reason from this to the fact of their existence, not from the absence of other mention to their non-indication here. I decide then for (1): that these women are<i> deaconesses</i>) (<b>must be</b>)<b> grave, not slanderers</b> (corresponds to “<i>not doubletongued</i>” in the males,<i> slander</i> being the vice to which the female sex is more addicted. The word used for<i> slanderer</i> in this sense is peculiar, in the New Test., to these Epistles), sober (see on ver. 2, corresponding to<i> not given to much wine</i>, ver. 8),<b> faithful in all things</b> (cor-
