<b> 13.</b>] The importance of true and faithful service in the diaconate.<b>—For those who served well the office of deacon</b> (<i>past, not, perfect, “have served,”</i> because the standing-point of the sentence is at first the great day, when their<i> diaconate</i> has passed by)<b> are acquiring</b> (thus literally: the Apostle having begun by placing himself at the great day of retribution, and consequently used the<i> past</i>, now shifts, so to speak, the scene, and deals with their<i> present</i> conduct: q.d., ‘Those who shall then be found to have served well,<i>&c..... are now, &c.</i>)<b> for themselves</b> (emphatic—besides the service they are rendering to the church)<b> a good standing-place</b> (viz. at the great day: compare ch. vi. 19:—and Dan. xii, 13, where however the metaphor is differeut.—The interpretations of this word, which literally means<i> a step</i>, or place to stand on, have been very various. (1) Very many, both ancients and moderns, understand it of a<i> degree of ecclesiastical preferment,</i> as that from the office of deacon to that of presbyter, and take “good” for a comparative. Against this is (a) the foreing of the word “<i>good;</i>” (b) the improbability that such a rise upwards through the ecclesiastieal offices was known in the Apostle’s time: (c) the still greater unlikelihood, even if it were known, that he would propose as a motive to a deacon to fulfil his office well, the ambitions desire to rise out of it. (2) Some among the moderns, following Calvin and Luther, understand by it a high place of honour in the esteem of the church. Against this is (a) that there is not a more distinct reference made to the estimation of the church: (b) that thus again an unworthy motive would be set before the deacons: (c) that again [see below] “<i>great boldness,</i>” or “<i>confidence,</i>” will not on this interpretation, bear any legitimate rendering: (d) the use of the past, they who served: see above. (3) Some take it<i> spiritually,</i> as meaning<i> progress in the faith</i>. But (a) the whole is of too objective a character thus to be interpreted of a merely subjective process—besides that (b) thus also we should require<i> “are serving,” present, instead of “served,” past.</i> (4) Theodoret and others understand it nearly as above—of the station or standing-place which the faithful deacon acquires before God, with reference to his own salvation. The opinions of these Commentators are, however, somewhat various as to the exact time to which the standing on this<i> standing-place</i> is to be referred. Theodoret refers it to the next life. Others understand that they procure to themselves a<i> good expectation of salvation: a standing-place,</i> i.e., in<i> this life, with reference</i> to the future one. I believe that the truth will be found by combining the two views. The past verb,<b> served,</b> as above stated, is used with reference to their finished course at that day. The term are obtain-ing transfers the scene to the present time. The<b> standing-place</b> is that which they are now securing for themselves, and will be found standing on at that day: belonging therefore in part to both periods, and not necessarily involving the idea of different degrees of blessedness, though that idea [see 1 Cor. iii. 15] is familiar to St. Paul,—but merely predicating the soundness of the ground on which these<i> deacons</i> will themselves stand), and much confidence (this also is variously understood, according as the<i> standing-place</i> is interpreted. Those who think of<i> ecclesiastical</i><i> preferment</i>, render it ‘freedom<br><br> of speech as regards the faith,’ i.e. in teaching, or in resisting error, or ‘a wide field for spiritual action.” To these there might be no objection, but for the adjunct,<i> in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</i> Thus defined, this<i> boldness,</i> or<i> confidence,</i> must necessarily have a subjective reference,—i. e, to the confidence towards God possessed by those who have made good advance in faith in Christ)<b> in [the] faith</b> (subjective, from what follows)<b> which is in</b> (reposing in)<b> Christ Jesus.</b><br><br> pillar and basement of the truth:” and in the Epistle of the churches of Lyons and Vienne, it is said of Attalus, that “he has become for evermore the pillar and basement of the Christians there.” The principal modern reasons for adopting this view have been (a) polemical—as against Roman Catholic infallibility of the Church, or (b) for uniformity of symbolism, seeing that in Gal. ii. 9, Rev. iii. 12,<i> men</i> are compared to pillars. On both of these I shall treat expressly below.—Grammatically (see my Greek Test.) there is no objection to this view.—But to the sentence itself thus arranged and understood, there are weighty, and I conceive fatal objections, arising from the form of the clauses in the original. In this case also, the words,<i> “and without controversy,”</i> which follow, would most naturally refer, not to the great deposit of faith in Christ which is entrusted to the church to keep,—but to the very strong and unusual expression which had just been used of a young minister in the church,— ‘and confessedly great is the dignity of the least of the ministers of Christ: for,’&c. (3) The reference to THE CHURCH is upheld by Chrysostom, Theodoret, &c., the Roman Commentators,—Luther, Calvin, Beza, Grotins, &c., &c. And this interpretation agrees with 2 Tim. ii. 19: see note there, But there is brought against it the objection, that there is thus introduced confusion of metaphor. The<i> church,</i> which was the<i> house</i> just now, becomes<i> a pillar,</i> a part of the<i> house,</i> This is not difficult to answer. The house contains in itself both<i> pillar</i> and<i> basement</i>—the pillar and the basement both belong to the house. Why may not the pillar be taken collectively? the very word<i> church</i> or<i> congregation</i>, occurring since, has pluralized the idea—the building consists of the<i> faithful,</i> who are so many<i> Pillars</i>—why should it not in the aggregate e described as<i> the</i><i> pillar?</i> The way in which the congregation of the faithful is the pillar and basement of the truth is admirably given by Theodoret: “He calls the assembly of the faithful the house and. church of God. These he names the pillar and basement of the truth. For they remain founded fixedly and immoveably on the rock, and proclaiming by their actions the truths of the doctrines:” viz. in that it is the element in which and medium by which the truth is conserved and upheld),
