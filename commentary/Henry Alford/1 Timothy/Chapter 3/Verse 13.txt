<b> 13.</b>] The importance of true and faithful service in the diaconate.<b>—For those who served well the office of deacon</b> (<i>past, not, perfect, “have served,”</i> because the standing-point of the sentence is at first the great day, when their<i> diaconate</i> has passed by)<b> are acquiring</b> (thus literally: the Apostle having begun by placing himself at the great day of retribution, and consequently used the<i> past</i>, now shifts, so to speak, the scene, and deals with their<i> present</i> conduct: q.d., ‘Those who shall then be found to have served well,<i>&c..... are now, &c.</i>)<b> for themselves</b> (emphatic—besides the service they are rendering to the church)<b> a good standing-place</b> (viz. at the great day: compare ch. vi. 19:—and Dan. xii, 13, where however the metaphor is differeut.—The interpretations of this word, which literally means<i> a step</i>, or place to stand on, have been very various. (1) Very many, both ancients and moderns, understand it of a<i> degree of ecclesiastical preferment,</i> as that from the office of deacon to that of presbyter, and take “good” for a comparative. Against this is (a) the foreing of the word “<i>good;</i>” (b) the improbability that such a rise upwards through the ecclesiastieal offices was known in the Apostle’s time: (c) the still greater unlikelihood, even if it were known, that he would propose as a motive to a deacon to fulfil his office well, the ambitions desire to rise out of it. (2) Some among the moderns, following Calvin and Luther, understand by it a high place of honour in the esteem of the church. Against this is (a) that there is not a more distinct reference made to the estimation of the church: (b) that thus again an unworthy motive would be set before the deacons: (c) that again [see below] “<i>great boldness,</i>” or “<i>confidence,</i>” will not on this interpretation, bear any legitimate rendering: (d) the use of the past, they who served: see above. (3) Some take it<i> spiritually,</i> as meaning<i> progress in the faith</i>. But (a) the whole is of too objective a character thus to be interpreted of a merely subjective process—besides that (b) thus also we should require<i> “are serving,” present, instead of “served,” past.</i> (4) Theodoret and others understand it nearly as above—of the station or standing-place which the faithful deacon acquires before God, with reference to his own salvation. The opinions of these Commentators are, however, somewhat various as to the exact time to which the standing on this<i> standing-place</i> is to be referred. Theodoret refers it to the next life. Others understand that they procure to themselves a<i> good expectation of salvation: a standing-place,</i> i.e., in<i> this life, with reference</i> to the future one. I believe that the truth will be found by combining the two views. The past verb,<b> served,</b> as above stated, is used with reference to their finished course at that day. The term are obtain-ing transfers the scene to the present time. The<b> standing-place</b> is that which they are now securing for themselves, and will be found standing on at that day: belonging therefore in part to both periods, and not necessarily involving the idea of different degrees of blessedness, though that idea [see 1 Cor. iii. 15] is familiar to St. Paul,—but merely predicating the soundness of the ground on which these<i> deacons</i> will themselves stand), and much confidence (this also is variously understood, according as the<i> standing-place</i> is interpreted. Those who think of<i> ecclesiastical</i><i> preferment</i>, render it ‘freedom
