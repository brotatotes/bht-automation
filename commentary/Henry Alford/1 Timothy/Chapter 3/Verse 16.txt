<b> 16.</b>]<b> And</b> (follows on the preceding: it is indeed worth all thy care to conduct thyself worthily in this house of God—for that truth which is there conserved and upheld is great and glorious above all others, being [see below] none other in fact than THE LORD HIMSELF, in all His gracious manifestation and glorious triumph)<b> confessedly</b> ( ‘as is acknowledged on all hands’)<b> great is the mystery</b> (see ver. 9: that which was hidden from man until God revealed it, historically, in Redemption)<b> of godliness</b> (see ch. ii, 2, note: ‘of the religious life.’—In order to comprehend fully what follows, we must endeavour to realize the train of thought in the Apostle’s mind at the time. This<i> ‘mystery’</i> of the life of God in man, is in fact the unfolding of Christ to and in him: the key-text to our passage being Col. i. 27,<i> “To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this</i> MYSTERY<i> among the Gentiles:</i> WHICH IS, CHRIST AMONG YOU THE HOPE OF GLORY.” This was the thought in St. Paul’s mind; that the great revelation of the religious life is, CHRIST. And in accordance with his practice in these Epistles, written, as I believe, far on in his course, and after the figures and results of deep spiritual thoughts had been long familiar to him, he at once without explanation, or apology as beforetime in Col. i. 27, or expression of the word<i> Christ</i>, justifying the change of gender in the relative, joins the deep and latent thought with the superficial and obvious one, and without saying that the mystery<i> is in</i><i> fact</i> Christ, passes from the mystery to the Person of Christ as being one and the same. Then, thus passing, he is naturally led to a summary of those particulars wherein Christ has been revealed as a ground for the godly recognition of His Church. And, idea of MYSTERY being prominent before him, he selects especially those events in and by which Christ was manifested forth—came forth from that secrecy in which he had beforetime been hidden in the counsels of God, and shone out to men and angels as the Lord of life and glory. Let me say in passing, that it should be noticed, in a question which now happily no longer<br><br> depends on internal considerations, how completely the whole glorious sentence is marred and disjoined by the substitution of the word GOD, found in the A.V., and so strenuously, even to this day, upheld by some. It is not the objective fact of<i> God being manifested,</i> of which the Apostle is speaking, but<i> the life of God lived in the church,</i>—the truth, of which the congregation of believers is the pillar and basement,—as identical [John xiv. 6] with Him who is its centre and heart and stock—as unfolded once for all in the unfolding of Him. The intimate and blessed link, furnished by the relative pronoun WHO, assuring the Church that it is not they that live, but Christ that liveth in them, is lost, if we understand<i> the mystery</i> merely as a fact, however important, historically revealed. There is hardly a passage in the New Test. in which I feel more deep personal thankfulness for the restoration of the true and wonderful connexion of the original text)<b>—who</b> (thus, and not ‘which,’ nor ‘He who,’ should we render, preserving the same transition, from the mystery, to Him of whom now all that follows is spoken.<i> Who</i> is, as stated in Ellicott, “a relative to an omitted though easily recognized antecedent, viz. Christ”)<b> was manifested in the flesh</b> (it has been often maintained of late, that these sentences, from their parallelism and symmetry, are taken from some hymn or confession of the ancient church. We cannot absolutely say that it may not have been so: but I should on all grounds regard it as very doubtful. I can see no reason why the same person who wrote the rhetorical passages, Rom. viii. 38, 39; xi. 33–36: 1 Cor. xiii. 4–7, and numerous others, might not, difference of time and modified mental characteristics being allowed for, have written this also. Once written, it would be sure to gain a place among the choice and treasured sayings of the Church, and might easily find its way into liturgical use: but I should be most: inclined to think that we have here its first expression. The reason which some of the above Commentators adduce for their belief,—the abrupt insulation of the clauses disjoined from the thought in the context, has no weight with me: I on the other hand feel that so beautiful and majestic a sequence of thoughts springing directly from the context itself, can hardly be a fragment pieced in, but must present the free expansion of the mind of the writer in the treatment of his subject. On the sense of this clause, compare John i. 14,—and 2 Tim. i. 10. This is put first in the rank, as being the preliminary to all the rest. It is followed by the next clause, because the assertion and assurance of Christ’s perfect unsinning righteousness was the aim of his manifestation in our flesh all those thirty years which preceded His public ministry: see below),<b> was justified</b> (i. e. approved to be righteous,—according to the uniform Pauline usage: not as De W., al., ‘proved to be what he was.’ The Apostle is following the<i> historical order of events during the manifestation of our Lord on earth.</i> That this is so, is manifest by the final clause including the Ascension. I take these events then in their order, and refer this to our Lord’s baptism and temptation, in which His righteousness was approved and proved)<b> in the Spirit</b> (He was dwelt on by the Spirit in His baptism—led up by the Spirit to His great trial, and<i> in the Spirit,</i> His Spirit, that of which he said “the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak,” He was proved to be righteous and spotless and separate from evil and its agent. See Rom. i. 3, 4, where another proof of this His spiritual perfection is given, viz. the great and crowning one of the Resurrection from the dead. Some have thought of that proof here also: others, of the continued course of His miracles,<i> especially</i> the Resurrection: some of the Resurrec-tion and Ascension, by which He entered into His glory: others, in other ways. But I prefer keeping the historical order, though I would by no means limit the<i> justification</i> to that time only:<i> then</i> it was chiefly and prominently manifested),<b> was seen by angels</b> (viz. by means of His Incarnation, and specifically, when they came and ministered to Him after His temptation. This seems to be regarded as the first, or at all events is the first recorded occasion on which they ministered to Him. Theodoret says: “For even they saw not His invisible Godhead, but when He was incarnate, they beheld Him.” This, one of the particulars of the glory and manifestation of the incarnate Saviour, is, though not immediately<br><br> concerning the mystery of piety as upheld in the Church, cited as belonging to the<i> unfolding</i> of that mystery in Christ),<b> was preached among the nations</b> (that preaching commencing with the sending out of the Apostles, and though not then, in the strict technical sense, carried on<i> among the nations,</i> yet being the beginning of that which waxed onward till it embraced all nations. See and Compare Rom. xvi. 26 [Eph. iii. 8]. So that we are still proceeding with our Lord’s ministry, taking<i> the nations</i> in that wider sense in which the Jews themselves are numbered among them, and the fact itself as the great commencement of the proclamation of Christ to men),<b> was believed on in the world</b> (including all that winning of faith first, from His disciples [John ii. 11], then from the Jews [ib. 28, viii. 30], and Samaritans [iv. 41, 42]: see also ib. x. 42. Our clause bears with it a reminiscence of His own great saying, John iii. 16 ff.),<b> was received up in glory</b> (at His Ascension.<b> in glory:</b> i.e. was taken up into, and reigns in, glory.—It is this distinct reference to the fact of our Lord’s personal Ascension, which in my mind rules the whole sentence, and makes it, whatever further reference each clause may have, a chain of links of the divine manifestation of the Person of Christ, following in chronological order from His incarnation to His assumption into glory. The order and connexion of the clauses has been very variously understood, as may be seen in Wolf, and in De Wette. The triple antithesis, so characteristic of St. Paul, can hardly escape any reader:<i> “in the flesh, in the spirit,—angels, the nations,—in the world, in glory:”</i> but further it is hardly worth while to reproduce the distinctions which some have drawn, or motives for arrangement which they have supposed).
