<b> 16.</b>]<b> And</b> (follows on the preceding: it is indeed worth all thy care to conduct thyself worthily in this house of God—for that truth which is there conserved and upheld is great and glorious above all others, being [see below] none other in fact than THE LORD HIMSELF, in all His gracious manifestation and glorious triumph)<b> confessedly</b> ( ‘as is acknowledged on all hands’)<b> great is the mystery</b> (see ver. 9: that which was hidden from man until God revealed it, historically, in Redemption)<b> of godliness</b> (see ch. ii, 2, note: ‘of the religious life.’—In order to comprehend fully what follows, we must endeavour to realize the train of thought in the Apostle’s mind at the time. This<i> ‘mystery’</i> of the life of God in man, is in fact the unfolding of Christ to and in him: the key-text to our passage being Col. i. 27,<i> “To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this</i> MYSTERY<i> among the Gentiles:</i> WHICH IS, CHRIST AMONG YOU THE HOPE OF GLORY.” This was the thought in St. Paul’s mind; that the great revelation of the religious life is, CHRIST.

Let me say in passing, that it should be noticed, in a question which now happily no longer
