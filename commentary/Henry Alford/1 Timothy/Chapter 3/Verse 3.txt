<p><strong> 3</strong> .] <strong> not a brawler</strong> (properly, ‘ <em> one in his cups</em> ,’ ‘a man rendered petulant by much wine:’ τὸ τοίνυν παρ ʼ οἶνον λυπεῖν τοὺς παρόντας , τοῦτ ʼ ἐγὼ κρίνω παροινίαν , Xen. Sympos. vi. 1. And perhaps the literal meaning should not be lost sight of. At the same time the word and its cognates were often used without reference to wine: see παροινέω , - ία , - ιος , in Palm and Rost’s Lex. As πλήκτης answers to πάροινος , it will be best to extend the meaning to signify rather the character, than the mere fact, of παροινία ), <strong> not a striker</strong> (this word also may have a literal and narrower, or a metaphorical and wider sense. In this latter it is taken by Thdrt.: οὐ τὸ ἐπιτιμᾷν εἰς καιρὸν κωλύει · ἀλλὰ τὸ μὴ δεόντως τοῦτο ποιεῖν . But perhaps the coarser literal sense is better, as setting forth more broadly the opposite to the character of a Christian ἐπίσκοπος ), <strong> but</strong> (this contrast springs out of the two last, and is set off by them) <strong> forbearing</strong> (reasonable and gentle: φέρειν εἰδότα τὰ πρὸς αὐτὸν πλημμελήματα , Thdrt. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+4:5">Philippians 4:5</span> , and Trench, N. T. Syn. § xliii.; but correct his derivation, as in that note), <strong> not quarrelsome</strong> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:24">2 Timothy 2:24</span> . Conyb.’s ‘ <em> peaceable</em> ’ is objectionable, as losing the negative character), <strong> not a lover of money</strong> (‘ <em> liberal</em> ,’ Conyb.: but this is still more objectionable: it is not the positive virtue of liberality but the negative one of abstinence from love of money, which, though it may lead to the other in men who <em> have</em> money, is yet a totally distinct thing. Thdrt.’s explanation, while true, is yet characteristic of an ἐπίσκοπος of later days: οὐκ εἶπεν ἀκτήμονα · σύμμετρα γὰρ νομοθετεῖ · ἀλλὰ μὴ ἐρῶντα χρημάτων . δυνατὸν γὰρ κεκτῆσθαι μέν , οἰκονομεῖν δὲ ταῦτα δεόντως , καὶ μὴ δουλεύειν τούτοις , ἀλλὰ τούτων δεσπόζειν ):</p>
