And perhaps the literal meaning should not be lost sight of. At the same time the word and its cognates were often used without reference to wine: see παροινέω , - ία , - ιος , in Palm and Rost’s Lex. As πλήκτης answers to πάροινος , it will be best to extend the meaning to signify rather the character, than the mere fact, of παροινία ),  not a striker (this word also may have a literal and narrower, or a metaphorical and wider sense. In this latter it is taken by Thdrt.: οὐ τὸ ἐπιτιμᾷν εἰς καιρὸν κωλύει · ἀλλὰ τὸ μὴ δεόντως τοῦτο ποιεῖν . But perhaps the coarser literal sense is better, as setting forth more broadly the opposite to the character of a Christian ἐπίσκοπος ),  but (this contrast springs out of the two last, and is set off by them)  forbearing (reasonable and gentle: φέρειν εἰδότα τὰ πρὸς αὐτὸν πλημμελήματα , Thdrt. See note on Philippians 4:5 , and Trench, N. T. Syn. § xliii.; but correct his derivation, as in that note),  not quarrelsome (cf. 2 Timothy 2:24 . Conyb.’s ‘  peaceable ’ is objectionable, as losing the negative character),  not a lover of money (‘  liberal ,’ Conyb.: but this is still more objectionable: it is not the positive virtue of liberality but the negative one of abstinence from love of money, which, though it may lead to the other in men who  have money, is yet a totally distinct thing. Thdrt.’s explanation, while true, is yet characteristic of an ἐπίσκοπος of later days: οὐκ εἶπεν ἀκτήμονα · σύμμετρα γὰρ νομοθετεῖ · ἀλλὰ μὴ ἐρῶντα χρημάτων . δυνατὸν γὰρ κεκτῆσθαι μέν , οἰκονομεῖν δὲ ταῦτα δεόντως , καὶ μὴ δουλεύειν τούτοις , ἀλλὰ τούτων δεσπόζειν ):
