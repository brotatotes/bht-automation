<p><strong> 4</strong> .] (This positive requisite again seems to spring out of the negative ones which have preceded, and especially out of ἀφιλάργυρον . The negatives are again resumed below with μὴ νεόφυτον ) <strong> presiding well over his own house</strong> ( <strong> ἰδίου</strong> , as contrasted with the church of God below, <strong> οἴκου</strong> , in its wide acceptation, ‘ <em> household</em> ,’ including all its members), <strong> having children</strong> (not ‘ <em> keeping</em> (or <em> having</em> ) <em> his children</em> ’ ( ἔχοντα τὰ τέκνα ), as E. V. and Conyb. The emphatic position of τέκνα , besides its anarthrousness, should have prevented this mistake: cf. also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:6">Titus 1:6</span> , μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἀνήρ , τέκνα ἔχων πιστά , κ . τ . λ .) <strong> in subjection</strong> (i.e. who are in subjection) <strong> with all gravity</strong> (‘ <em> reverent modesty</em> ,’ see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:2">1 Timothy 2:2</span> . These words are best applied to the <em> children</em> , not to the head of the house, which acceptance of them rather belongs to the rendering impugned above. It is the σεμνότης of the children, the result of his προστῆναι , which is to prove that he <em> knows how</em> to preside over his own house, not his own σεμνότης in governing them: the matter of fact, that he has children who are in subjection to him in all gravity, not his own keeping or endeavouring to keep them so. Want of <em> success</em> in ruling at home, not want of will to rule, would disqualify him for ruling the church. So that the distinction is an important one): <strong> but</strong> (contrast, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:12">1 Timothy 2:12</span> , to the suppressed but imagined opposite case) <strong> if any man knows not</strong> (the use of <strong> εἰ οὐ</strong> here is perfectly regular: see Ellicott’s note) <strong> how to preside over his own house</strong> (shews, by his children being insubordinate, that he has no skill in domestic government), <strong> how shall he</strong> (this future includes ‘ <em> how can he</em> ,’ but goes beyond it appealing, not to the man’s power, which conditions his success, but to the resulting matter of fact, which will be sure to substantiate his failure) <strong> take charge of</strong> (so Plato, Gorg. p. 520 a: οἱ φάσκοντες προεστάναι τῆς πόλεως καὶ ἐπιμελεῖσθαι ) <strong> the church of God</strong> ( ὁ τὰ σμικρὰ οἰκονομεῖν οὐκ εἰδώς , πῶς δύναται τῶν κρειττόνων καὶ θείων πιστευθῆναι τὴν ἐπιμέλειαν ; Thdrt. See the idea followed out popularly in Chrys.) <strong> ?</strong></p>
