<b> 6.]</b> (The negative characteristics are resumed)<b> Not a novice</b> (a new convert. An objection has been raised to this precept, that it could hardly find place in the apostolic church, where all were<i> new converts.</i> It has been answered, that in Crete this might be so, and therefore such a precept would be out of place in the epistle to Titus, but the Ephesian church had been many years established. But it has been again rejoined to this, that the precepts are perfectly general, not of particular application. The real reply is to be found, partly by narrowing the range of the meaning of a new<i> convert,</i> partly in assigning a later date to these Epistles than is commonly held. The case here contemplated is that of one<i> very recently</i> converted. To ordain such a person to the ministry would, for the reason here assigned, be most unadvisable. But we cannot imagine that such period need be extended at the most to more than three or four years, in cases of men of full age who became Christians; and surely such a condition might be fulfilled by any of the Pauline churches, supposing this Epistle to bear any thing like the date which I have assigned to it in the Introd.§ii.)<b>, lest being besotted with pride</b> (the word used is derived from a substantive signifying<i> smoke</i> or<i> steam</i>; and hence metaphorically, the pother which a man’s pride raises about him so that he cannot see himself or others as they are. Hence the verb, which is used only in this metaphorical sense, means to be thus blinded, or bewildered, with pride or self-conceit)<b> he fall into the judgment of the devil</b> (these last words are ambiguous.<b> Is of the devil</b> [1] the genitive objective, ‘<i>the judgment into which the devil fell</i>,’—or [2] the genitive subjective, ‘<i>the judgment which is wrought by the devil?’</i> [1] is held by Chrysostom and many others ancient and modern [ “into the same condemnation which came on<i> him</i> for his madness,” Chrysostom]. [2] is held by Ambrose and others. Matthies says, “Ifa Christian church-overseer allowed himself to be involved in a charge of pride, the adversary (i. e., in the concrete, living men, his instruments) might by it have reason as well for the accusation of the individual as for inculpation of the congregation: compare ch. v. 14, Eph. iv. 27.” In deciding between the above, one question must first be answered: are we obliged to preserve the same character of the genitive in verses 6 and 7? because, if so, we must manifestly take [2]: for the words there [see below] cannot bear any other meaning than ‘<i>the</i> [reproach and]<i> snare which the devil lays.</i>’ This question must be answered, not by any mere consideration of uniformity, but by careful enquiry into the import of the substantive<b> judgment</b>. I conceive we cannot understand it here otherwise than as a<i> condemnatory sentence.</i> This being so, it must be remembered that it is not the prerogative of the<i> devil</i> to<i> judge</i> or to<i> condemn,</i> and that sense [2] is by this negatived. From the use of the decisive word<b> judgment</b>, I infer that it cannot be an act of the adversary which is here spoken of, but an act in which “<i>the ruler of this world</i><b> has been judged.”</b> Then as to uniformity with ver. 7, I should not be disposed to make much account of it. For one who so loved similarity of external phrase, even where different meanings were to be conveyed, as St. Paul, to use the genitives in “<i>judgment of the devil</i>,” and “<i>snare of the devil</i>,” in these different meanings, is surely nothing which need cause surprise:—<b>of the devil</b> is common to both: the devil’s condemnation, and the devil's snare, are both alike alien from the Christian, in whom, as in his divine Master,
