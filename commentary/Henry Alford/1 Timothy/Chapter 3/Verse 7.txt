<p><strong> 7</strong> .] <strong> Moreover</strong> ( <strong> δέ</strong> , bringing in the contrast of addition; ‘ <em> more than this</em> ,’ … <strong> καί</strong> , the addition itself of a new particular) <strong> he must have a good testimony</strong> (reff.) <strong> from those without</strong> (lit. ‘ <em> those from without</em> :’ the unusual - <strong> θεν</strong> (reff.) being added as harmonizing with the <strong> ἀπό</strong> , the testimony coming ‘from without’), <strong> lest he fall into</strong> (a question arises which must be answered before we can render the following words. Does ὀνειδισμόν (1) stand alone, ‘ <em> into reproach, and the snare of the devil</em> ,’ or is it (2) to be joined with παγίδα as belonging to διαβόλου ? For (1), which is the view of Thl., Est., Wolf, Heyden., Huther, Wiesinger, al. (and Ellic. doubtfully), it is alleged, that ὀνειδισμόν is separated from καὶ παγίδα by ἐμπέσῃ . But this alone cannot decide the matter. The Apostle may have intended to write merely εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν ἐμπέσῃ τοῦ διαβόλου . Then in adding καὶ παγίδα , we may well conceive that he would keep εἰς ὀν . ἐμπ . for uniformity with the preceding verse, and also not to throw κ . παγίδα into an unnatural prominence, as would be done by placing it before ἐμπέσῃ . We must then decide on other grounds. Wiesinger, seeing that the ὀνειδισμὸς τοῦ διαβόλου , if these are to be taken together, must come immediately from οἱ ἔξωθεν , objects, that he doubts whether any where the devil is said <em> facere per se</em> that which he <em> facit per alterum</em> . But surely 1Jn 3:8 is a case in point: ὁ ποιῶν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ἐκ τοῦ διαβόλου ἐστίν , ὅτι ἀπ ʼ ἀρχῆς ὁ διάβολος ἁμαρτάνει . εἰς τοῦτο ἐφανερώθη ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ , ἵνα λύσῃ <strong> τὰ ἔργα τοῦ διαβόλου</strong> , and indeed <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span> , τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ νῦν ἐνεργοῦν ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς τῆς ἀπειθείας . Huther supports this view by ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:14">1 Timothy 5:14</span> ; but I am unable to see how that verse touches the question: for whether the ὀνειδισμός belong to τοῦ διαβ . or not, it clearly must come in either case from οἱ ἔξωθεν . One consideration in favour of this view has not been alleged: that ἡ παγὶς τοῦ διαβόλου seems, from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:26">2 Timothy 2:26</span> , to be a familiar phrase with the Apostle, and therefore less likely to be joined with another governing substantive.

<p>For (2), we have Thdrt. ( τῶν ἔξωθεν τῶν ἀπίστων λέγει . ὁ γὰρ καὶ παρ ʼ ἐκείνοις πλείστην ἔχων πρὸ τῆς χειροτονίας διαβολήν , ἐπονείδιστος ἔσται , καὶ πολλοῖς ὀνείδεσι περιβαλεῖ τὸ κοινόν , καὶ εἰς τὴν προτέραν ὅτι τάχιστα παλινδρομήσει παρανομίαν , τοῦ διαβόλου πάντα πρὸς τοῦτο μηχανωμένου ), al., Bengel (“diabolus potest antistiti malis testimoniis laboranti plurimum excitare molestiæ, per se et per homines calumniatores”), De W., al. The chief grounds for this view are, (a) grammatical that the εἰς is not repeated before παγίδα . I am not sure, whether we are right in applying such strict rules to these Pastoral Epistles: but the consideration cannot but have some weight. (b) contextual that the Apostle would hardly have alleged the mere ἐμπεσεῖν εἰς ὀνειδισμόν as a matter of sufficient importance to be parallel with ἐμπ . εἰς παγίδα τοῦ διαβόλου . This latter, I own, inclines me to adopt (2), but I would not by any means speak strongly in repudiation of the other) <strong> the reproach and the snare of the devil</strong> (reff. This latter is usually taken as meaning, the danger of relapse (cf. Thdrt. cited above): so Calv.: “ne infamiæ expositus, perfrictæ frontis esse incipiat, tantoque majore licentia se prostituat ad omnem nequitiam: quod est diaboli plagis se irretire. Quid enim spei restat ubi nullus est peccati pudor?” Grot. gives it a different turn: ‘ne contumeliis notatus quærat se ulcisci.’ These, and many other references, may well be contained in the expression, and we need not, I think, be at the pains precisely to specify any one direction which the evil would take. Such an one’s steps would be shackled his freedom hampered his temper irritated his character lost and the natural result would be a fall from his place, to the detriment not of himself only, but of the Church of Christ).</p>
