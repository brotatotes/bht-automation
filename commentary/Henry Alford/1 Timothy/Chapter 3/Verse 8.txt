<b> 8.</b>]<b> In like manner</b> (this expression seems introduced by the similarity of character,—not merely to mark an additional particular)<b> the deacons</b> (mentioned as a class, besides here, only<b> Phil. i. 1,</b> where as here, they follow the “<i>bishops</i>.” Phoebe, Rom. xvi. 1, is a “<i>deacon</i> [<i>ess</i>]” of the church at Cenchreæ. The term or its cognates occur in a vaguer sense, but still indicating a special office, in Rom. xii. 7; 1 Pet. iv. 11. The connexion of the ecclesiastical deacons with the seven appointed in Acts vi. is very doubtful: see Chrysostom’s and (Ecumenius’s testimony distinguishing them, in note there. But that the ecclesiastical order sprung out of similar necessities, and had for its field of work similar objects, can hardly be doubted)<b> (must be) grave, not of double speech</b> (this may mean, either, saying one thing and thinking another, or, which is more probable, as carrying out better the idea of<i> double speech</i>, saying one thing to one man and another thing to another, the two sayings being inconsistent. with singleness of conviction and purpose),<b> not addicted</b> (applying themselves)<b> to much wine</b> (see Tit. ii. 3),<b> not greedy of gain</b> (hardly, as A.V., to be<i> doubly rendered,— ‘greedy of filthy lucre.</i>’ As also Theodoret, “endeavouring to amass gain out of dis-graceful and preposterous things.” It would appear from Tit. i. 11, that all gain is<i> disgraceful</i> which is set before a man as a by-end in his work for God: so likewise in 1 Pet. v. 2,... ‘nor with a view to gain,’ such gain being necessarily base when thus sought. This particular of the deacons’ character assumes special importance, if we connect it with the collecting and distributing alms);<b> holding the mystery of the</b> (or<b> their</b>)<b> faith</b> (that great objective truth which man of himself knows not, but which the Spirit of God reveals to the faithful: compare Rom. xvi. 25 f.: 1 Cor. ii. 7–10: and even Him who in fact<br><br> is that mystery, the great object of all faith: see note on ver. 16. That expression makes it probable that the faith is here to be taken subjectively:<i> the</i>, or<i> their, faith</i>: the apprehension which appropriates to them the contents of God’s revelation of Christ. That revelation of the Person of Christ, their faith’s<b> mystery,</b> they are to hold)<b> in pure conscience</b> (see ch. i. 19. From those passages it appears, that we must not give the words a special application to their official life as deacons, but understand them of earnestness and singleness of Christian character: being in heart persuaded of the truth of that divine mystery which they profess to have apprehended by faith).
