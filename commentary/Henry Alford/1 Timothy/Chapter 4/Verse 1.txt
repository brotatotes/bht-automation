<b> 1.</b>] Howbeit (contrast to the glorious mystery of godliness which has been just dwelt on) the Spirit (viz. the Holy Spirit of prophecy, speaking in the Apostle himself, or in others,—or, which is most probable, in both—in the general prophetic testimony which He bore throughout the church: compare<i> “this know,”</i> spoken from the same point of prophetic foresight, 2 Tim. iii. 1. Some have supposed the Apostle to refer to some prophetic passage of the Old Test., or to the general testimony of the Old Test. prophecies [Dan. vii. 25; viii. 23; xi. 30], or those of our Lord [Matt. xxiv. 4ff., 11], or of the Apostles [2 Thess. ii. 3 ff. 1 John ii. 18. 2 Pet. iii. 3. Jude 18], or all these combined. But in the two former cases, we should hardly have had<b> the Spirit saith,</b> but the<i> Scripture, or the Lord,</i> or the like; the words imply rather the present agency of the Spirit: and the latter is only a less clear way of putting the explanation given above: for why should writings be referred to, when the living men were yet testifying in the power of the Spirit among them? Besides, see the way in which such written prophecies<i> are</i> referred to, in Jude 17)<b> expressly</b> ( ‘plainly,’ ‘in so many words’)<b> saith, that in after times</b> (not as A.V.<i> ‘in the latter times,’</i> which though not quite so strong as<i> ‘in the last times,’</i> yet gives the idea of close connexion with them: whereas here the Apostle speaks only of times subsequent to those in which he was writing: see the difference in 2 Tim. iii. 1: and compare Acts xx. 29)<b> some</b> (not the false teachers: rather, those who will be the result of their false teaching)<b> shall depart</b> (or decline: not by formal apostasy, or the danger would not be that which it is here represented: but subjectively, declining in their own minds and lives from holding Christ in simplicity)<b> from the faith</b> (objective—the doctrine which faith embraces, as so often),<b> giving heed to</b> (the participle contains the reason and process of their declension:<i> because they give heed to</i>)<b> seducing spirits</b> (<b>spirits</b> is in contrast with<b> the spirit,</b> ver. 1;—it is to be understood as in 1 John iv. 1 and 6, in which last verse we have the cognate expression,<i> “the spirit of error.”</i> The spirits are none other than the spirits of evil, tempting, energizing in, seducing, those who are described, just as<i> the Spirit</i> directs and dwells in those who abide in the faith),<b> and teachings of demons</b> (doctrines taught by, suggested by, evil spirits: compare James iii. 15. Two wrong interpretations have been given: (1) understanding the genitive as objective,<i> ‘teach-tings concerning dæmons;</i>’ so Mede and Heydenreich, which latter calls the term ‘a characteristic designation of the EsseneGnostic false teachers, who had so much to say of the higher spirit-world, of the æons, &c.:’—but against the context, in which there is no vestige of allusion to idolatry [notwithstanding all that is alleged by Mede], but only to a false and hypocritical asceticism: (2) applying the agency to the false teachers, who would seduce the persons under description; but this is without example harsh and improbable);<b> in the</b> (following in the...., in giving the element, in which: see below)<b> hypocrisy of those who speak lies; of men branded</b> (with the foul marks of moral crime: a form of expression often found in secular writers. The verb used in the Greek is properly to burn in a mark with a branding-instrument of hot iron. The idea seems to be, as Ellicott explains it, that ‘they knew the brand they bore, and yet, with a show of outward sanctity, they strove to beguile and seduce others, and make them as bad as themselves’) on their<b> own conscience</b> (these false teachers are not only the organs of foul spirits, but are themselves hypocritical liars, with<i> their own</i> consciences seared by crime);<b> forbidding to marry</b> (this description has been thought by some to fit the Jewish sects of Essenes and Therapeutæ, who abstained from marriage. But the abstinence by and by mentioned seems too general to suit the idea that they were Jews [see below]: besides that the Epistle does not describe them as<i> present—</i>but as to<i> come</i> in after times), (<b>commanding</b>) (not expressed in the original. See a like ellipsis, in which a second but logically necessary verb is omitted, and must be supplied from the context,—in ch. ii. 12; 1 Cor. xiv. 34)<b> to abstain from meats</b> (compare Col. ii. 16. It does not appear here from what sort of food this abstinence would be enjoined: but probably the eating of flesh is alluded to. Eusebius quotes from Irenæus [i. 28] a description of men who called themselves Abstainers, or Temperance men, who preached celibacy and abstinence from eating flesh, These seem to be the persons here pointed at: and though the announcement of their success in after time is prophetic, we may fairly suppose that the seeds of their teaching were being sown as the Apostle wrote. The existence of gnosticism in its earlier form is certainly implied in ch. vi. 20: and in 2 Tim. ii. 17, 18, we find that denial of the resurrection which characterized all the varieties of subsequent gnosticism. See the whole subject discussed in the Introd. ch. vi.§i. 12 ff.),<b> which God created unto participation with thanksgiving for those who believe and have [received the] (full) knowledge of the truth.</b> This last description of the worthy partakers of God’s bounties is Well explained by Calvin, saying that though pours forth His bounties on the just and unjust, it is only the faithful who are truly restored to that inheritance of the world which Adam had, but lost. On the words,<b> with thanksgiving,</b> see 1 Cor. x. 30: and below on ver. 4.
