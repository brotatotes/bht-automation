<p><strong> 13</strong> .] <strong> Till I come</strong> (not as De W., as long as thou in my absence presidest over the Ephesian church: for this supposes the Apostle to be the normal president of that Church and Timotheus his locum-tenens, which was not the case. Timotheus was put there with a special commission from the Apostle: that commission would cease at the Apostle’s coming, not because he would resume residence and presidence, but because he would enforce and complete the work of Timotheus, and thus, the necessity for special interference being at an end, the church would revert to the normal rule of its own presbytery), <strong> attend to the</strong> (public, see below) <strong> reading</strong> (“scripturæ sacræ, in ecclesia. Huic adjunguntur duo præcipua genera, <em> adhortatio</em> , quæ ad agendum, et <em> doctrina</em> , quæ ad cognoscendum pertinet, ch. 1Ti 6:2 fin. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:7">Romans 12:7</span> ff.” Beng.

<p>Whether the O. T. Scriptures alone, or in addition to them the earlier gospels were at this time included in this public reading, cf. Just. Mart. Apol. i. (ii.) 67, p. 83 ( τὰ ἀπομνημονεύματα τῶν αποστόλων ἢ τὰ συγγράμματα τῶν προφητῶν ἀναγινώσκεται , μέχρις ἐγχωρεῖ ), cannot be determined with any certainty), <strong> to the</strong> (also public) <strong> exhortation, to the</strong> (also public) <strong> teaching</strong> (cf. Bengel above. Chrys. takes παρακλήσει as social, διδασκαλίᾳ as public, τῇ παρακλήσει τῇ πρὸς ἀλλήλους , τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ τῇ πρὸς πάντας so Grot., ‘in <em> monendis</em> aliis privatim, <em> docendis</em> publice:’ but why so?).</p>
