<b> 14.</b>]<b> Do not neglect</b> (see 2 Tim. i. 6,<b>—</b>do not suffer to decay and smoulder by carelessness. “They neglect gifts,” says Bengel, “who do not exercise them, and fancy that they shall not lose them”)<b> the spiritual gift which is in thee</b> (see more at length on 2 Tim. i. 6. The spiritual gift was that of teaching and ruling the church: it was not teaching only, but the whole grace of God given him for the office to which he was set apart by special ordination),<b> which was given thee</b> (by God, 1 Cor. xii. 4, 6)<b> by means of prophecy</b> (ch. i. 18 refers to the same fact as this—viz. that, either at the first conversion of Timothy, or at his ordination to the ministry [and certainly the latter seems here to be pointed at], the Holy Spirit spoke, by means of a prophet or prophets, His will to invest him with<i> gifts</i> for the work, and thus the gift was said to be conferred, as to its certainty in the divine counsels, by such prophecy, the Holy Spirit commanding it by the mouth of the prophets),<b> with laying on of the hands</b> (see on Acts vi. 6. There is no real difference between this and 2 Tim. i. 6. There was a special reason there for putting Timothy in mind of the fact that the Apostle’s own hands<i> were</i> laid on him: but that fact does not exclude this) of the<b> presbytery</b> (the body of elders who belonged to the congregation in which he was ordained. Where this was, we know not: hardly in Lystra, where he was first converted: might it not be in Ephesus itself, for this particular office?).
