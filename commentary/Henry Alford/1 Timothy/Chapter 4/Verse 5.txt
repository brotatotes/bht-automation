<b>for</b> (see on<i> because</i> and<i> for</i> above) it (this<i> subject</i> is gathered out of the preceding clause by implication, and means, ‘every<i> created thing</i> which is partaken of with thanksgiving’)<b> is sanctified</b> (more than ‘<i>declared pure,</i>’ or even than<i> ‘rendered pure:’</i> the latter it does not want, the former falls far short of the work of the assigned agents. The emphasis is on this word, and a new particular is introduced by it—not purity merely, but<i> holiness</i>,—fitness for the godly usage of Christian men. To this, which is more than mere making or declaring pure, it is set apart by the<i> giving of thanks</i>; so that the lesser is proved by the greater. There is certainly a slight trace of reference to the higher consecration in the Lord’s Supper. The same word<i> thanks-giving</i> is common to both. Ordinary meals are set apart for ordinary Christian use by asking a blessing on them:<i> that meal,</i> for more than ordinary use, by asking on it its own peculiar blessing)<b> by means of the word of God and intercession</b> (<i>what</i> ‘word of God?’ how to be understood? Treating the plainer word first, the<i> intercession</i> meant is evidently intercession [see on ch, fi. 1]<i> on behalf of the thing partaken of</i>—that it may be ‘sanctified to our use.’ This may serve to guide us to the meaning of the<b> word of God.</b> And first, negatively. It cannot mean any thing which does not form part of the<i> thanksgiving:</i> such as God’s word in the Scripture just cited, or in any other place: or, God’s word in the foundation truths of Christianity. Then, positively: it must mean in some sense the<i> thanksgiving,</i> or something in it. But not the ‘word addressed to God,’ or ‘prayer made to God,’ which would be an unprecedented meaning for the<i> word of God:</i> the only way open for us is, that the<i> thanksgiving</i> itself, or some part of it, is in some sense<i> the word of God.</i> This may be (1) by its consisting in whole or in part of Scripture words, or (2) by the effusion of a Christian man, speaking in the power of God’s Spirit, being known as<i> the word of God.</i> This latter is perhaps justified: but still it seems to me hardly probable, and I should prefer the former. It would generally be the case, that any form of Christian thanksgiving before meat would contain words of Seripture, or at all events thoughts in exact accordance with them: and such utterance of God’s revealed will, bringing as it would the assembled family and their meal into harmony with Him, might well be said<i> to sanctify</i> the<i> meats</i> on the table for their use. Many of the Commentators quote from the (apocryphal but very ancient) Apostolic Constitution, the following grace before meat, used. in the primitive times: “Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who nourishest me from my youth, who givest food to all flesh. Fill our hearts with joy and gladness, that always havingall competence, we may abound unto every good work in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom be unto Thee honour and might for ever. Amen.” Here almost every clause is taken from some expression of Scripture).
