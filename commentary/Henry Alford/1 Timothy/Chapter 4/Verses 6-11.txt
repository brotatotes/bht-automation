 6 11 .]  Recommendatory application to Timotheus of what has been just said, as to form part of his teaching, to the avoidance by him of false and vain doctrine, and to the practice of godliness .  These things (hardly, as Rosenm., Heinr., Heyd., ch. 1 Timothy 3:16 f., nor as Chrys., ποῖα ; ἅπερ εἶπεν · ὅτι τὸ μυστήριον μέγα ἐστίν , ὅτι τὸ τούτων ἀπεχεσθαι δαιμόνιόν ἐστιν , ὅτι διὰ λόγου καὶ ἐντεύξεως θεοῦ ἁγιάζεται but simply the matter treated since the beginning of the chapter, the coming apostasy after these ascetic teachers and the true grounds of avoiding it. This best suits the following context and the ὑποτιθέμενος , which certainly would not be used of the μέγα μυστήριον )  suggesting (or counselling, cf. Il. θ . 36, βουλὴν δ ʼ Ἀργείοις ὑποθησόμεθ ʼ, ἥτις ὀνήσει : Herod. i. 156, Κροῖσος μὲν δὴ ταῦτά τε οἱ ὑπετίθετο : … Palm and Rost’s Lex. sub voce, 2, c; and Ellic’s note here)  to the brethren, thou wilt be a good servant of Christ Jesus, ever training thyself in (the idea of ἐντρέφομαι is not ‘  nourish oneself with ,’ but to grow up amongst, or to be trained in: cf.

The present, as Chrys., denotes  continuance in this training, τὸ διηνεκὲς τῆς εἰς τὰ τοιαῦτα προσοχῆς δηλῶν , and again, μηρυκώμενος (  ruminans ), συνεχῶς τὰ αὐτὰ στρεφων , ἀεὶ τὰ αυτὰ μελετῶν . Cf. 2Ti 3:14 )  the words of the faith (the fundamental doctrines of the Gospel),  and of the good instruction (not ‘  words of the faith and good doctrine ,’ as Conyb. The repetition of the article forbids this, severs the ᾗ παρηκολούθηκας from τοῖς λόγοις τῆς πίστεως , and attaches it to καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας only)  the course of which thou hast followed (I have thus endeavoured to give  παρηκολούθηκας : ‘hast followed along, by tracing its course and accompanying it:’ see reff.; and Ellic.’s note).
