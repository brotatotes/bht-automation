<b> 13.</b>]<b> Moreover they also learn to be idle</b> (it might be objected, that idleness is the cause, not the effect, of going about, &c.: but it may well be answered, that not only does a spirit of idleness give rise to such going about, but such going about confirms the habit of idleness),<b> going about from house to house</b> (literally, “the houses,” viz. of the faithful);<b> but</b> (so literally)<b> not only</b><b> (to be) idle, but also gossips and busybodies, speaking things which are not fitting</b> (his fear is, that these younger widows will not only do the Church’s work idly, but make mischief by bearing about tales and scandal),<b> I will therefore</b> ( ‘in consequence of these things being so, I desire’)<b> that younger widows</b> (the word<i> “widows”</i> is not in the original: but such, and not the younger<i> women</i>, is evidently the Apostle’s meaning. The whole passage has concerned<i> widows—</i>and to them he returns again, ver. 16)<b> marry</b> (not as Chrysostom, “Seeing that they wish it, I wish it too. They should indeed have cared for the things of God,—they should have kept their faith: but since this may not be so, it is better that the other should take place” [so also, characteristically, the Roman-Catholic Mack]: for it is not younger widows<i> who have been taken into the catalogue,</i> of whom he is speaking, but<i> younger widows in general:</i> Chrysostom’s interpretation would make the Apostle contradict himself. The<i> “therefore,”</i> on which Mack lays stress as favouring this meaning, simply infers from the temptations of young widows just described. There is no inconsistency here with the view expressed in 1 Cor. vii. 39, 40: the time and circumstances were different),<b> bear children, govern households</b> (i. e. in their place, and with their share of the duties),<b> give no occasion</b> (starting-point, in their behaviour or language)<b> to the adversary</b> (who is meant? Chrysostom and tho ancients for the most part understand,<i> the devil:</i> see 1 Cor. xvi. 9; Phil. i. 28: and so, lately, Huther. But St. Paul’s own usage of the word [also Tit. ii. 8] is our best guide. Ordinarily using it of human adversaries, he surely would here have mentioned.<i> the devil</i> had he intended him. And the understanding him to be here meant brings in the next verse very awkwardly, as he there has an entirely new part assigned him. Understand, therefore, any adversary, Jew or Gentile, who may be on the watch to get occasion, by the lax conduct of the believers, to slander the Church)<b> for [the sake of] reproach</b> (to be joined with the word<i> “occasion:”</i><i> the occasion,</i> when taken advantage of by the adversary, would be used<i> for the sake of reproach,</i> for the sake and purpose of reproaching the people of God).<b> For already</b> (he appeals to their experience)<b> some</b> (widows)<b> have turned away</b> (out of the<br><br> right path)<b> after</b> (so as to follow)<b> Satan</b> (De Wette doubts whether St. Paul’s experience could have been long enough to bear out such an assertion,—and thus impugns the genuineness of the Epistle. But this is very much a matter of dates: and even taking the earliest commonly assigned, the assertion might be strictly true, applying as it does not only to Ephesus, but to the far wider range of his apostolic ministry).
