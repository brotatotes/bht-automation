<b> 17.</b>]<b> Let the presbyters who well preside</b> (viz. over their portion of the Church’s work: in earnestness and self-sacrifice, also with wisdom and ability)<b> be held worthy of double</b> (not, as compared with the<i> widows,</i> or the<i> deacons,</i> or the<i> poor,</i>—but as compared with those who have not distinguished themselves by<i> presiding well</i>; and evidently it is not to be taken in the meré literal sense of<i> double,</i> but implies increase generally—see below) honour (from other considerations, as well as from the context here, it is evident that not merely honour, but<i> recompense</i> is here in question: but the word need not be<i> confined</i> to that meaning: honour, and honour’s fruit, may be both included in it. Grotius conceives an allusion to the double portion of the firstborn [Deut. xxi. 17]; Elsner, to the double share of provision which used to be set before the presbyters in the Agapæ. But as De Wette remarks, that practice was much more probably owing to a misunder-standing of this passage),<b> especially those that labour in (the) word and teaching</b> (therefore the preaching of the word, and teaching, was<i> not the office of all the presbyters.</i> Conybeare rightly remarks, that this is a proof of the early date of the Epistle. Of these two expressions the word would more properly express preaching; the<b> doctrine,</b> the work of<i> instruction,</i> by catechetical or other means).
