<p><strong> 18</strong> .] <em> Ground for the above injunction</em> . See the first citation (‘ <em> an</em> (or ‘the,’ an anarthrous emphatic word) <em> ox while treading</em> ,’ &amp;c., not, ‘ <em> the ox that treadeth</em> ,’ &amp;c., as E. V.) treated by the Apostle at more length, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:9">1 Corinthians 9:9</span> . It is doubted whether the words ἄξιος ὁ ἐργάτ . κ . τ . λ . are a citation at all. Some have referred them to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+19:13">Leviticus 19:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+24:14">Deuteronomy 24:14</span> , which passages however say nothing of the kind, being special directions about paying a labourer’s wages before night. Thdrt. and Thl. suppose it to be quoted from the New Testament; i.e. from our Lord’s saying, reff. Matt., Luke. But it is very unlikely that the Apostle should cite these under the title of ἡ γραφή : and Calvin’s view seems most probable, that he adduces the sentiment, as our Lord Himself does, as a popular and well-known saying (so Wolf and Huther). This verse it is which makes it extremely probable, that τιμή above refers to the honorarium of pecuniary recompense.</p>
