 18 .]  Ground for the above injunction . See the first citation (‘  an (or ‘the,’ an anarthrous emphatic word)  ox while treading ,’ &c., not, ‘  the ox that treadeth ,’ &c., as E. V.) treated by the Apostle at more length, 1 Corinthians 9:9 . It is doubted whether the words ἄξιος ὁ ἐργάτ . κ . τ . λ . are a citation at all. Some have referred them to Leviticus 19:13 ; Deuteronomy 24:14 , which passages however say nothing of the kind, being special directions about paying a labourer’s wages before night. Thdrt. and Thl. suppose it to be quoted from the New Testament; i.e. from our Lord’s saying, reff. Matt., Luke. But it is very unlikely that the Apostle should cite these under the title of ἡ γραφή : and Calvin’s view seems most probable, that he adduces the sentiment, as our Lord Himself does, as a popular and well-known saying (so Wolf and Huther). This verse it is which makes it extremely probable, that τιμή above refers to the honorarium of pecuniary recompense.
