<b> 19.</b>] See the summary above.<b> Against a presbyter</b> (those are certainly wrong who suppose that age, not office is again here indicated: the whole passage is of presbyters by office—compare ver. 22 below)<b> entertain not an accusation, except on the word of</b> (in the construction of the original, the accusation is represented as resting upon the testimony of these witnesses)<b> two or three witnesses</b> (De Wette asks,—but were not these required in every case, not only in that of a presbyter? Three answers are given: one, that accuracy in the number of the witnesses was to be strictly insisted on because false informations were prevalent: another, and so Calvin more at length: that Timothy was not constituted judge in private men’s matters, only over the officers of the church in faults with which they might be charged as regarded the execution of their duty: a third, that a private man might by the law of Moses be cited with one witness only, not condemned; but that St. Paul prohibits the<i> citing</i> even of a presbyter without two or three. But this is manifestly a distinction without point—the<i> receiving</i><i> an accusation</i> being used not of mere citation, but of entertaining the charge as a valid one: in other words, as including citation and conviction as well. The first reason seems the more probable: that he is only recalling the attention of Timothy to a known and prescribed precaution, which was in this case especially to be always observed).
