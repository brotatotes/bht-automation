 22 f.] The same subject is continued, and direction given whereby the<br><br> scandal just dealt with may be prevented: viz., by<i> caution in ordaining</i> at first. The reference is primarily to presbyters: of course extending also in its spirit to all other church offices. This reference, which is maintained by most Commentators, is denied by some others, who understand the command to refer to receiving back into the church excommunicated persons, or heretics, which from later testimonies they shew to have been the practice: Huther, rightly rejecting this idea, yet interprets it of laying on of hands as merely conveying ecclesiastical blessing on many various occasions. But surely this is too vague and unimportant for the solemn language here used. Regarding the whole, to ver. 25, as connected, and belonging to one subject, I cannot accept any interpretation but the obvious and ordinary one: see especially ch. iv. 14: 2 Tim. i. 6.—<b>Lay hands hastily on no one, nor be par-taker in other men’s sins</b> (as he would do by being the means of negligently admitting into the ministry unfit and ungodly persons, being properly held responsible for the consequence of those bad habits of theirs which more care might have ascertained. The word<i> sin</i> points to the former expression,<i> “them that sin</i>”):<b>—Keep THYSELF</b> (highly emphatic: not merely others over whom thou art called to preside and pronounce judgment in admitting them to the ministry. And the emphasis is peculiarly in place here, as applying to that which has just preceded. If he were to admit improper candidates to the ministry from bias or from negligence, his own character, by his becoming a partaker in their sins, would suffer: whatever thou doest therefore, be sure to maintain, by watchful care and caution,<i> thyself</i> above all stain of blame) pure (not here to be referred to personal purity and chastity, though that of course would be the most important of all elements in carrying out the precept: but as above).<b>—No longer</b> (habitually) drink water, but use a little wine, on account of thy stomach, and thy frequent illnesses (the question, why this injunction is here inserted, has never been satisfactorily answered. Many take it as a modification of<i> “keep thyself pure,”</i> so as to prevent it from being misunderstood as enjoining asceticism. But on our explanation of the words, and I may add on any worthy view of the context, such a connexion will at once be repudiated. Chrysostom has caught the right clue, when he says, “Timothy seems to me to have been generally an invalid: and this the Apostle shews when he says, &c. as here:” but he has not followed it up. Timothy was certainly of a feeble bodily frame, and this feebleness appears, from other hints which we have respecting him, to have affected his character. See especially 1 Cor. xvi. 10, 11, and note there. Is it not very possible, that such feebleness, and perhaps timidity, may have influenced him as an overseer of the church, and prevented that keen-sighted judgment and vigorous action which a bishop should ever shew in estimating the characters of those who are candidates for the ministry? If this was so, then it is quite natural that in advising him on this point, St. Paul should throw in a hint, in fatherly kindness, that he must not allow these maladies to interfere with the efficient discharge of his high office, but take all reasonable means of raising his bodily condition above them. I feel compelled to adopt this view, from the close connexion of the next verse with the whole preceding passage, and the exceedingly unnatural isolation of this, unless it bears such a reference).
