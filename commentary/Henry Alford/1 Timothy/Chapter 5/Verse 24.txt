 24 .]  The same subject continued : τὸν περὶ τῆς χειροτονίας ἀναλαμβάνει λόγον . Thdrt. If my view of the last verse is correct, the connexion will be found in the fact, that the conservation of himself in health and vigour would ensure his being able to deal ably and firmly with the cases which should come before him for decision. To guide him still further in this, the Apostle subjoins this remark, indicating two classes of characters with which he would have to deal in judging, whether favourably or unfavourably.
	 Of some men the sins (connects with ἁμαρτίαις ἀλλοτρίαις , 1Ti 5:22 )  are evident (there does not seem to be any relation of  time in  πρόδηλοι , ‘  manifest beforehand ,’ for thus the meaning would be, as in πρόδηλος πότμος , κίνδυνος , &c., that the sins were manifest  before they were committed , which would reduce this case to the other (see below): but the  προ - seems rather of place than of time, πρὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν , openly manifest, notorious by common report),  going before them (so that the man’s bad report comes to the person appointed to judge,  before the  man himself : not transitive, as Heinrichs, ‘peccata in judicium eos vocant’)  to judgment (i.e. so that when they come before thee to be judged of as candidates, their sins have arrived before them):  but some men again they (their sins)  follow (i.e. after-proof brings out the correctness or otherwise of the judgment. Their characters come before thee unanticipated by adverse rumour: but thou mayest by examination discover those flaws in their conduct which had been skilfully concealed the sins which, so to speak, follow at their heels. Therefore be watchful, and do not let the mere non-existence of previous adverse rumour lead thee always to presume fitness for the sacred office).
