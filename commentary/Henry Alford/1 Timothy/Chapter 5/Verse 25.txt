 25 .]  So also (in like manner on the other side of men’s conduct)  the good works (  of some )  are openly manifest: and those which are otherwise situated (which are not πρόδηλα )  cannot be hidden (will come out, just as the sins in 1 Timothy 5:24 , on examination. The tendency of this verse is to warn him against hasty condemnation, as the former had done against hasty approval. Sometimes thou wilt find a man’s good character go before him, and at once approve him to thee: but where this is not so, do not therefore be rash to condemn thou mayest on examination soon discover, if there really be any good deeds accompanying him: for they are things which cannot be hidden the good tree like the bad will be known by his fruits, and that speedily, on enquiry). I have abstained from detailing all the varieties of interpretation of these verses, following as they do those already specified on 1 Timothy 5:20-22 . They may be seen shortly enumerated in De W. and Ellicott, and commented on at somewhat tedious length in Wiesinger. Chrys., al., confuse the context by understanding κρίσις of eternal judgment, and the sentiment as equivalent to ἐκεῖ πάντα γυμνά ἐστιν . And so even Ellicott, who in objecting to the above interpretation (which is also Bp. Wordsworth’s) charges it somewhat naïvely with  failure in explaining the context . That  it only does explain it satisfactorily, is, in my view, the decisive consideration in its favour.
