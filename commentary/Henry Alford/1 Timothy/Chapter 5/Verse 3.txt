<b> 3. take into consideration</b>] literally,<b> honour:</b> but how? Is<i> “honour”</i> to be interpreted generally,<i> ‘honour’</i> merely, or with reference to the context? The best guide to an answer will be what follows. If the command be merely to hold them in honour, why should the destitute be held in more honour than those who had families? The command to<i> honour</i><i> widows</i> would surely apply to all alike. But seeing that it<i> does not</i> apply to all alike, we must necessarily limit its general meaning to that particular in which the one would be honoured, and the other not. Thus without giving or seeking for an unusual meaning to the word, we may fairly interpret it of this particular kind of honour, viz. being inscribed on the Church’s<i> list</i> or<i> roll</i> (ver. 9), as a-fit object of charitable sustenance. That such a roll existed in the very earliest days of the church, we know from Acts vi. 1: from Ignatius,<br><br> Justin Martyr, and Eusebius.<br><br><b> that are widows indeed</b>] Compare<b> ver. 16</b> below,<b>—those who are really in a widowed</b> (destitute)<b> state,</b> as contrasted with those described ver. 4. But then the enquiry has been made, Is this<i> being</i> a<i> widow indeed</i> to be defined by mere external circumstances, or not rather by the religious character, described below, ver. 5? Or are we to bind (as Chrysostom and others do) the two together? In a certain sense I believe we must thus unite them. The Apostle commands, ‘Honour (by placing on the list) those who are widows indeed;’ for it is these especially, they who are destitute of earthly friends, who are most likely to carry out the true religious duties of a widow. Thus, without the two qualifications being actually united, the former is insisted on as ordinarily ensuring the latter.
