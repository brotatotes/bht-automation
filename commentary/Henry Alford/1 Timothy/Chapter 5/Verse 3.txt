 3 .  τίμα ] Is this to be interpreted generally, ‘  honour ’ merely, or with reference to the context? The best guide to an answer will be what follows. If the command be merely to hold them in honour, why should the destitute be held in more honour than those who had families? The command χήρας τίμα would surely apply to all alike. But seeing that it  does not apply to all alike, we must necessarily limit its general meaning to that particular in which the one would be honoured, and the other not. Thus without giving or seeking for an unusual meaning to τίμα , we may fairly interpret it of this particular kind of honour, viz. being inscribed on the Church’s κατάλογος ( 1Ti 5:9 ) as a fit object of charitable sustenance. That such a roll existed in the very earliest days of the church, we know from Acts 6:1 . Cf. also Ignat. ad Polyc. c. 4, p. 721 f.: Justin M. Apol. i. 67, p. 84: Euseb. H. E. vi. 43. Thus Huther and De W., and Ellic., after Grot., Calv., all.
	 τὰς ὄντως χήρας ] cf. 1Ti 5:16 below,  those who are really in a widowed (destitute)  state , as contrasted with those described 1 Timothy 5:4 . But then the enquiry has been made, Is this ὄντως χήρα to be defined by mere external circumstances, or not rather by the religious character, described below, 1Ti 5:5 ? Or are we to bind (as Chrys., al.) the two together? In a certain sense, I believe we must thus unite them. The Apostle commands, ‘Honour (by placing on the list) those who are widows indeed:’ for it is these especially, they who are destitute of earthly friends, who are most likely to carry out the true religious duties of a widow. Thus, without the two qualifications being actually united, the former is insisted on as ordinarily ensuring the latter.
