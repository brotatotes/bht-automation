<b> 4.</b>] The case of the<i> widow</i> who is not a<i> widow indeed,</i> having earthly relations answerable for her support.<br><br><b> grandchildren</b>] not as A.V., ‘<i>nephews;</i>?’ at least, not in its present sense: at the time when our version was made, the word seems to have borne the meaning of<i> grandchildren</i>.<br><br><b> let these learn</b>] What is<i> the subject?</i> Who are to learn? (1) The ancient Commentators mostly understand the<i> widows,</i> implied in the words<i> “if any widow”</i> above. (2) But some of the ancients took the<i> children</i> or<i> grandchildren</i> as the subject.<br><br><b> first</b>] Either,<i> ‘first of all duties,’</i> which seems supported by ver. 8 below; or<i> first,</i> before applying to the church for sustenance. These meanings will apply to both the above alternatives: whether we understand the subject to be the Widows, or the<i> children and grandchildren.</i><br><br><b> to shew piety to their own family</b>] On hypothesis<b> (1),</b><i>—to behave piously towards, i.e. to rule religiously</i> their own household. This seems somewhat to force the meaning of the verb, see below; while the sense of<br><br> “<i>their own</i> household” is thus the simple and usual one, as the widow in question would be the head of the household: On hypothesis (2),<i> to behave piously towards, i.e. to honour with the honour which God commands,</i> their own family, i.e. the widowed mother or grandmother who is one of their own family. This sense of the verb is common enough: the reference being generally (not always, it is true) to superiors,—those who demand<i> reverence,</i>—those who stand in the place of God. This sense of<i> their own family or household</i> is not so usual, but not therefore to be rejected. To dishonour their widowed mother or grandmother, would be to dishonour their own family, in that one of its members who most required respect.<br><br><b> and to requite their parents</b>] On hypothesis (1), as Chrysostom, “They (their parents) are dead and gone—thou canst not requite them: thou didst not beget them, nor yet bring them up. Requite it to them in their grandchildren: pay your debt through their posterity.” But surely it is a very strange way of requiting our progenitors for their care of us, to be kind towards our own children: and besides, what would this have to do with the question, whether or not the widow was to be put on the charity roll of the church? But on hypothesis (2) this sentence certainly becomes more clear and natural. Let them, the children or grandchildren, learn first to be piously grateful to (these members of) their own families, and to give back returns (a return in each case) to their progenitors (so called, although living, because, the<i> mother and grandmother</i> having been both mentioned, parents was the only word which would include them in one category).<br><br><b> for this, &c.</b>] See ch. ii. 3.
