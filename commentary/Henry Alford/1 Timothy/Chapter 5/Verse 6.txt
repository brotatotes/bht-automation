<p><strong> σπαταλῶσα</strong> ] Wetst. from the glossaries, gives σπαταλᾷ , λίαν τρυφᾷ , ἀσώτως ζῇ . In the Anthol., iv. 28. 14, we have coupled πᾶν τὸ βρότων σπατάλημα κ . ἡ πολύολβος ἐδωδή .

Antig. 1183, τὰς γὰρ ἡδονὰς ὅταν | προδῶσιν ἄνδρες , οὐ τίθημ ʼ ἐγὼ | ζῇν τοῦτον , ἀλλ ʼ ἔμψυχον ἡγοῦμαι νεκρόν . The very expression is found in Stobæus; see reff. I cannot help regarding the idea as in the background, ‘and, if devoid of spiritual life, then not to be taken into account by the Church.’</p>
