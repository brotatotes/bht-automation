 6 .] Contrast (  δέ ) to the character just described: and that certainly with a view to point out that this kind of widow is no object for the charity of the Church, as not being at all a partaker of the life unto God.
	 σπαταλῶσα ] Wetst. from the glossaries, gives σπαταλᾷ , λίαν τρυφᾷ , ἀσώτως ζῇ . In the Anthol., iv. 28. 14, we have coupled πᾶν τὸ βρότων σπατάλημα κ . ἡ πολύολβος ἐδωδή . It appears to be allied to σπαθάω ( σπάω ), see Aristoph., Nub. 53, and Schol. (in Wetst.); and Ellic., here.

Wetst. quotes many such expressions from profane writers: one, as compared with this passage, remarkably illustrative of the moral difference between Christianity and heathenism: Soph. Antig. 1183, τὰς γὰρ ἡδονὰς ὅταν | προδῶσιν ἄνδρες , οὐ τίθημ ʼ ἐγὼ | ζῇν τοῦτον , ἀλλ ʼ ἔμψυχον ἡγοῦμαι νεκρόν . The very expression is found in Stobæus; see reff. I cannot help regarding the idea as in the background, ‘and, if devoid of spiritual life, then not to be taken into account by the Church.’
