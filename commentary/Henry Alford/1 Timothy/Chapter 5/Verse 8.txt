Where therefore love is not nor works, there is not, nor works, faith either: so that he who fulfils not the offices of love towards his relatives, is virtually an unbeliever.”<br><br><b> worse than an unbeliever</b>] For even among heathens the common duties of family piety are recognized: if therefore a Christian repudiates them, he lowers himself beneath the heathen. Compare Matt. v. 46, 47. Also, as Calvin suggests in addition, the Christian who lives in the light of the Gospel, has less excuse for breaking those laws of nature which even without the Gospel are recognized by men.—According to hypothesis (1) or (2) above, this general statement applies to the widows or to their children and grandchildren. But surely it would be very harsh to understand it of the widows: and this forms an additional argument for hypothesis (2).
