<i><b></b></i><b> 9.</b>]<b> Let a woman be inserted in the catalogue as a widow.</b> But now, for what purpose? What<i> catalogue</i> are we to understand? Hardly, (1) that of those who are to receive relief from the Church (so Chrysostom and many others): for thus the rule, that she is to he<i> sixty years of age,</i> would seem a harsh one, as many widows might be destitute at a far earlier age: as also the rule that she must. not have been<i> twice married,</i> especially as the Apostle himself below commands second. marriage for the younger widows. Again, the duties enjoined in ver. 10 presuppose some degree of competence, and thus, on this hypothesis, the widows of the poorer classes would be excluded from sustenance by charity,—who most of all others would require it. Also, for the reason alleged in ver. 11,<i> sustenance</i> can hardly be in question—for then the re-marrying would simply take them off the roll, and thus be rather a benefit, than a detriment to the Church. Nor again (2) can we understand the roll to be that of the<i> deaconesses,</i> as some do: although the Theodosian code, founded on this interpretation, ordained “that none should be taken into the number of the deaconesses under sixty years old, according to the precept of the Apostle.” For, a) the age mentioned is unfit for the work of the deaconesses’ office, and in the council of Chalcedon the age of the deaconesses was fixed at forty: b) not only widows but virgins were elected deaconesses: (3) it is implied in ver. 12, that these widows were bound not to marry again, which was not the ease with the deaconesses. It seems therefore better to understand here<i> some especial band of widows,</i> sustained perhaps at the expense of the church, but not the only ones who were thus supported:—set apart for ecclesiastical duties, and bound to the service of God. Such are understood here by Chrysostom himself in his homily on the passage. They are also mentioned as<i> the band of widows, as presbytresses, as having precedence of rank:</i> i.e. such widows as corresponded in office for their own sex in some measure to the presbyters,—sat unveiled in the assemblies in a separate place, by the presbyters, and had a kind of supervision over their own sex, especially over the widows and orphans: were vowed to perpetual widowhood, clad with ‘widow’s vestments,’ and ordained by laying on of hands. This institution of the early church, which was abolished by the eleventh canon of the council of Laodicea, is sufficiently affirmed by many of the Fathers. De Wette makes the allusion to this ‘institute of widows’ one proof of the post-apostolic date of the Epistle: but on this see Introd. ch, vi.§i.<b> 27. Let a woman be enrolled a widow, who is not less than sixty years old, the wife of one husband</b> (compare ch. iii. 2. Here, as contemporaneous polygamy is out of the question, and thus one element of difficulty in the other case is eliminated, we can hardly understand any thing other than that the<i> aged widow</i> spoken of should<i> have been</i> the wife of only one husband: i.e., not married a second time. So that the parallel expressions here and in ch. iii. 2 will be consistently interpreted),<b> having a good character</b> (testimony from without, compare ch. iii.<b> 7) in</b> (the element or region in which that<i> testimony</i> is versed)<b> good works; if</b> (the conditions have as yet been expressed by participles in agreement with the noun: the construction is now changed for the hypothetical)<b> she at any time brought up children</b> (her own? or those of others? If [1], the<i> barren</i> might seem hardly dealt with: if [2], the word must be somewhat forced aside from its ordinary meaning. Still this latter, considering that.<i> entertaining strangers</i> is the next good work specified, seems most probable),<b> if she</b> (at any time)<b> entertained strangers</b> (practised hospitality. This clearly points out a person above the rank of the poor and indigent: though Chrysostom pithily replies, “Even if she be poor, she has a house. For I don’ t suppose she dwells in the open air.” One is glad to hear that all the Christian widows at Constantinople were so well off. But it can hardly have been so in the apostolic age. Compare, on the subject of hospitality, ch. iii. 2: Tit. i. 8: Rom. xii. 18: Heb. xiii. 2),<b> if she</b> (at any time)<b> washed the feet of the saints</b> (this may be an expression intended to signify performing the humblest offices.<b> Still, we must not dismiss from our consideration the</b><br><br> external act itself: as Theodoret reminds us, it was an ancient practice among Christians: see John xiii. 14, and note, in which, though a formal ceremony in obedience to our Saviour’s words is repudiated, the principle of humbly serving one another, which would lead to such an act on occasion presented, is maintained),<b> if she</b> (at any time)<b> relieved the distressed</b> (not merely the<i> poor,</i> but those afflicted in any way),<b> if she followed every good work</b> (Chrysostom, in his fine homily on this passage, cited above, says: “What is the following every good work? It is, for example, the going into a prison and visiting the prisoners, the visiting the sick, the comforting the distressed, the soothing those who are in pain, the contributing in every way all that is possible, and declining nothing that may tend to the well-being and refreshment of them that are our brethren.” Bengel’s idea, “that it is the part of those in high station, and of<i> men,</i> to<i> set the example</i> of good works, and of women, to follow, in helping on as much as they can,” is ingenious but wrong. For the expression, “<i>to follow good works,</i>” is used in Greek of those who do them as a pursuit of life, without reference to any relative priority).
