<p><strong> 9</strong> .] Is <strong> χήρα</strong> subject or predicate? ‘let a widow καταλεγέσθω ,’ or ‘let a woman καταλεγέσθω χήρα ?’ I own, from the arrangement of the words, I am inclined to believe the latter to be the case. The verb καταλεγέσθω introduces the new particular. Had χήρα then been the subject, the verb, having the emphasis, must have preceded. As it is, χήρα has the emphasis, as it would have, were it the predicate, spoken of those of whom the κατάλογος consisted. I render therefore, <strong> Let a woman be inserted in the catalogue as a widow</strong> . But now, for what purpose?
	</p>
<p><strong> καταλέγειν</strong> is to enrol on a list or roll: so Aristoph. Acharn. 1029: ὅταν στρατιώτας καταλέγωσι …, Lysistr., ὁ δὲ Δημόστρατος | ἔλεγεν ὁπλίτας καταλέγειν Ζακυνθίων : Xen. Rep. Lac. iv. 3, τού ́ των δ ʼ ἕκαστος ἄνδρας ἑκατὸν καταλέγει : Lysias, p. 172. 37, οὐ τοίνυν οὐδ ʼ εἰς τὸν κατάλογον Ἀθηναίων καταλέξας οὐδένα φανήσομαι : see other examples in Palm and Rost’s Lex., and in Wetst. But <em> what catalogue</em> are we to understand? (In replying to this question I agree in the main with De Wette, from whose note the substance of the following remarks is adopted.) Hardly, (1) that of those who are to receive relief from the Church (so Chrys. h. l., Thdrt., Œc., Thl., Jer., Erasm., Calv., Est., Wolf, Neand., al.): for thus the rule, that she is to be <em> sixty years of age</em> , would seem a harsh one, as many widows might be destitute at a far earlier age: as also the rule that she must not have been <em> twice married</em> , especially as the Apostle himself below commands second marriage for the younger widows. Again, the duties enjoined in 1Ti 5:10 presuppose some degree of competence, and thus, on this hypothesis, the widows of the poorer classes would be excluded from sustenance by charity, who most of all others would require it. Also, for the reason alleged in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:11">1 Timothy 5:11</span> , <em> sustenance</em> can hardly be in question for then the re-marrying would simply take them off the roll, and thus be rather a benefit, than a detriment to the Church. Nor again (2) can we understand the roll to be that of the <em> deaconesses</em> , as Pelag., Beza, Schleierm., Mack, al.: although the Theodosian code, founded on this interpretation, ordained “nulla nisi emensis LX annis secundum præceptum Apostoli ad Diaconissarum consortium transferatur,” xvi. 2. 27 (De W.). For a) the age mentioned is unfit for the work of the deaconesses’ office, and in the council of Chalcedon the age of the deaconesses was fixed at 40: b) not only widows but virgins were elected deaconesses (Balsamon, ad Can. xix. conc. Niceni, παρθένοι … τεσσαρακονταετοῦς ἡλικίας γενόμεναι , ἠξιοῦντο καὶ χειροτονίας διακονισσῶν εὑρισκόμεναι πάντως ἄξιαι . Suicer, i. 865): (3) it is implied in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:12">1 Timothy 5:12</span> , that these widows were bound not to marry again, which was not the case with the deaconesses. It seems therefore better to understand here <em> some especial band of widows</em> , sustained perhaps at the expense of the church, but not the only ones who were thus supported: set apart for ecclesiastical duties, and bound to the service of God. Such are understood here by Chrys. himself in his homily on the passage (311 in div. N. T. loc. 3, vol. iii. p. 523, Migne), καθάπερ εἰσὶ παρθένων χοροί , οὕτω καὶ χηρῶν τὸ παλαιὸν ἦσαν χοροί , καὶ οὐκ ἐξῆν αὐταῖς ἁπλῶς εἰς τὰς χήρας ἐγγράφεσθαι . οὐ περὶ ἐκείνης οὖν λέγει τῆς ἐν πενίᾳ ζώσης καὶ δεομένης βοηθείας , ἀλλὰ περὶ ταύτης τῆς ἑλομένης χηρείαν . They are also mentioned as τάγμα χηρῶν , τὸ χηρικόν , πρεσβύτιδες , προκαθήμεναι : i.e. such widows as corresponded in office for their own sex in some measure to the presbyters, sat unveiled in the assemblies in a separate place, by the presbyters, and had a kind of supervision over their own sex, especially over the widows and orphans: were vowed to perpetual widowhood, clad with a ‘vestis vidualis,’ and ordained by laying on of hands. This institution of the early church, which was abolished by the eleventh canon of the council of Laodicea (in the translation of Dionys. Exiguus, ‘mulieres quæ apud Græcos presbyteræ appellantur, apud nos autem viduæ seniores, univiræ, et matriculariæ nominantur, in ecclesia tanquam ordinatas constitui non debere’), is sufficiently affirmed by Chrys. l. c. Epiphan. hær. lxxix. 4, vol. ii. (Migne), p. 1060 f., and long before by Tert. de veland. virg. 9, vol. ii. p. 902: ‘ad quam sedem (viduarum) præter annos LX non tantum univiræ, i.e. nuptæ aliquando, eliguntur, sed et matres et quidem educatrices filiorum.’ De W. imagines he finds also a trace of it in Herm. Pastor, i. vision 2. 4, p. 900: ‘ καὶ Γραπτὴ μὲν (‘Grapte diaconissa fuisse videtur.’ Hefele, not.) νουθετήσει τὰς χήρας καὶ τοὺς ὀρφανούς :’ and in Lucian de morte peregrini, Opp. iii. 335 Reig., ἕωθεν μὲν εὐθὺς ἦν ὁρᾷν παρὰ τῷ δεσμωτηρίῳ περιμένοντα γραιδία , χήρας τινὰς καὶ παιδία ὀρφανά . He also refers to the dissertation of Mosheim on this place, in which he has thoroughly gone into all the bearings of the subject and maintained the above view. So also Grot., Fritzsch., and Michaelis: so Wiesinger, and in a somewhat modified shape, Huther, repudiating the idea of formal ordination and setting apart of widows so early as the apostolic age. In this he is probably right. De W. makes the allusion to this ‘institute of widows’ one proof of the post-apostolic date of the Epistle: but on this see Prolegg. ch. vii. § i. 27. <strong> Let a woman be enrolled a widow, who is not less than sixty years old</strong> ( γεγονυῖα is joined by the vulg. (‘quæ fuerit unius viri uxor’), Jer., Luth., Calv., Beza, Grot., Mack, al., to the next clause: but against this is usage ( ὅτε ἐγένετο ἐτῶν δώδεκα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:42">Luke 2:42</span> ; cf. also Plato, Legg. vi. p. 765, ἐτῶν μὲν γεγονὼς μὴ ἔλαττον ἢ πεντήκοντα , and see other examples in Wetst.), and the fact that μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἄνδρα stands alone in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span> . Besides, if it belonged to the next clause, it would have in it any place but the <em> first</em> ), <strong> the wife of one husband</strong> (cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span> . Here, as contemporaneous polygamy is out of the question, and thus one element of difficulty in the other case is eliminated, we can hardly understand any thing other than that the πρεσβύτις should have been the wife of only one husband: i.e., not married a second time: so Tertull. ad uxor. i. 7, vol. i. p. 1286: “digamos non sinit præsidere, … viduam allegi in ordinem nisi univiram non concedit.” So that the parallel expressions here and in ch. 1Ti 3:2 will be consistently interpreted. See the mistaken views of Thdrt. ( τὸ σωφρόνως ἐν γάμῳ βιοῦν νομοθετεῖ ), &amp;c., treated of under ch. 1Ti 3:2 ), <strong> having a good character</strong> (testimony from without, cf. reff. and ch. 1Ti 3:7 ) <strong> in</strong> (the element or region in which that μαρτυρία is versed) <strong> good works</strong> (reff.), <strong> if</strong> (‘the conditions have as yet been expressed by participles in agreement with the noun: the construction is now changed for the hypothetical.’ De W.: but εἰ does not depend immediately on καταλεγέσθω : the intervening clauses must be taken for granted. So that it may more properly be said to be dependent on μὴ .… μαρτυρουμένη : such an one, if in addition she, &amp;c.) <strong> she</strong> (at any time keep the aor.) <strong> brought up children</strong> (her own? or those of others? If (1), the <em> barren</em> might seem hardly dealt with: if (2), the word must be somewhat forced aside from its ordinary meaning (see τεκνοτροφία in Palm and Rost’s Lex.: where in the examples cited, <em> die Kindererzeugung mitinbegrissen ist</em> ). Still this latter, considering that ἐξενοδόχησεν is the next good work specified, seems most probable: and so, but for the most part combining it with the other, Beng., De W., Huther, Wiesinger, al. Grot. understands it, ‘si nec abortum sibi fecerit, nec ob paupertatem exposuerit liberos …, sed omnes sibi natos educaverit, et quidem honeste ac pie:’ Calv., ‘non sterilitatem hic damnari a Paulo, sed matrum delicias, quæ sobolis alendæ tædia devorare recusant’), <strong> if she</strong> (at any time) <strong> received strangers</strong> (practised hospitality. This clearly points out a person above the rank of the poor and indigent: though Chrys. pithily replies, κἂν πένης ᾖ , οἰκίαν ἔχει . οὐ γὰρ δὴ αἴθριος μένει . One is glad to hear that all the Christian widows at Constantinople were so well off. But it can hardly have been so in the apostolic age. Cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:2">1 Timothy 3:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:8">Titus 1:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:13">Romans 12:13</span> ; Heb 13:2 ), <strong> if she</strong> (at any time) <strong> washed the feet of the saints</strong> (‘synecdoche partis, pro omni genere officiorum humilitatis,’ Beng. εἰ τὰς ἐσχάτας ὑπηρεσίας τοῖς ἁγίοις ἀνεπαισχύντως ἐξετέλεσε , Thl. Still, we must not dismiss from our consideration the external act itself: as Thdrt. ἐποίουν γὰρ τοῦτο πάλαι : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:14">John 13:14</span> , and note, in which, though a formal ceremony in obedience to our Saviour’s words is repudiated, the principle of humbly serving one another, which would lead to such an act on occasion presented, is maintained), <strong> if she</strong> (at any time) <strong> relieved</strong> (cf. Herod. i. 91, καιομένῳ αὐτῷ ἐπήρκεσε : Eur. Hec. 963, τί χρὴ τὸν εὖ πράσσοντα μὴ πράσσουσιν εὖ | φίλοις ἐπαρκεῖν ; and examples in Wetst. It is more rarely found with an accus.: see Palm and Rost’s Lex.) <strong> the distressed</strong> (not merely the <em> poor</em> , as Beng., but those afflicted in any way; cf. example from Herod. above), <strong> if she followed every good work</strong> (Chrys. in his fine homily on this passage, cited above, § 15, says: τί ἐστιν ἐν παντὶ ἔργ . ἀγ . ἐπηκολούθ .; ὥστε καὶ εἰς δεσμωτήριον εἰσιέναι καὶ τοὺς δεδεμένους ἐπισκέπτεσθαι , καὶ ἀῤῥωστοῦντας ἐπισκοπεῖν , καὶ θλιβομένους παραμυθεῖσθαι , καὶ ὀδυνωμένους παρακαλεῖν , καὶ πάντα τρόπον τὰ κατὰ δύναμιν εἰσφέρειν ἅπαντα , καὶ μηδὲν ὅλως παραιτεῖσθαι τῶν εἰς σωτηρίαν καὶ ἀνάπαυσιν τῶν ἀδελφῶν γινομένων τῶν ἡμετέρων . Bengel’s idea, ‘Antistitum et virorum est, <em> bonis operibus præire</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:8">Titus 3:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:14">Titus 3:14</span> ; mulierum, <em> subsequi</em> , adjuvando pro sua parte,’ is ingenious, but wrong: cf. Plato, Rep. p. 370 c, ἀλλ ʼ ἀνάγκη τὸν πράττοντα τῷ πραττομένῳ ἐπακολουθεῖν μὴ ἐν παρέργου μέρει ).</p>
