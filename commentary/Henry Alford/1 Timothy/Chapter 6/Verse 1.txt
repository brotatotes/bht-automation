<b> 1.</b>]<b> Let as many as are bondmen under the yoke</b> (I have adopted the rendering of De Wette and Huther, attaching “<i>bondmen</i>” to the predicate, as the simpler construction. The other arrangement, which is that of A.V.,<i> ‘as many bondmen as are under the yoke,’</i> making under the yoke emphatic as distinguishing either 1) those<i> treated hardly,</i> or 2) those who were<i> under unbelieving masters,</i> has undoubtedly something to be said for it, but does not seem to me so likely, from the arrangement of the words. I take then<i> “bondmen under the yoke”</i> as the predicate)<b> hold their own</b> (<i> “their own,”</i> as in Eph. v. 22, and many other places, to bring out and emphasize the relation; see note there)<b> masters worthy of all</b> (fitting)<b> honour, that the name of God and his doctrine</b> (compare Tit. ii. 10, where, writing on the same subject, he admonishes slaves, “that they adorn the doctrine of our Saviour, even God, in all things”)<b> be not spoken evil of</b> (Chrysostom gives the sense well: “The unbeliever, if he see his slaves conducting themselves insolently because they are Christians, will generally revile the doctrine of Christ as causing insubordination: but when he sees them subordinate, he will be more likely to be persuaded, and will give more attention to what is said” [by those who preach Christ]. This verse obviously applies only to those slaves who had unbelieving masters. This is brought out by the reason given, and by the contrast in the next verse, not by any formal opposition in terms. The account to be given of the absence of such opposition is, that this verse contains the general exhortation, the ease of Christian slaves under<i> unbelieving</i> masters being by far the more common. The<i> exception</i> is treated in the next verse).<b> 2.</b>]<b> But</b> (see above)<b> let those who have believing mas-ters not despise them, because</b> (this<i> “because”</i> belongs to the word<i> “despise”</i> only, containing the ground of their contempt,—not to the exhortation<i> “let them not despise them,”</i> containing the reason why they are<i> not to be despised</i>)<b> they</b> (the masters, not the slaves)<b> are brethren; but all the more serve them</b> ( “the slaves who were under heathen masters were<i> positively</i> to regard their masters as deserving of honour;—the slaves under Christian masters were,<i> negatively,</i> not to evince any want of respect. The former were not to regard their masters as their inferiors, and to be insubordinate; the latter were not to think them their equals, and to be disrespectful.” Ellicott),<b> because those who receive</b> (mutually receive: the interchange of service between them in the Christian life being taken for granted, and this word purposely used to express it)<b> the benefit</b> (of their<i> more diligent service</i>) a<b> re faithful and beloved.</b>—Very various meanings and references have been assigned to these last words: see them discussed in my Greek Testament. The A.V., “because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit,” is an impossible rendering of the original, as it violates the simplest rules of grammar.<b> These things</b> (viz. those immediately preceding, relating to slaves)<b> teach and exhort.</b>
