 1 .]  Let as many as are slaves under the yoke (I have adopted the rendering of De W. and Huther, attaching δοῦλοι to the predicate, as the simpler construction. The other, ‘  as many slaves as are under the yoke ,’ making ὑπὸ ζυγόν emphatic as distinguishing either 1) those  treated hardly , or 2) those who were  under unbelieving masters , has undoubtedly something to be said for it, but does not seem to me so likely, from the arrangement of the words. Had ὑπὸ ζυγόν been intended to bring out any distinction, it would have more naturally preceded εἰσίν . I take then ὑπὸ ζυγὸν δοῦλοι as the predicate: ‘bondsmen under yoke’)  hold their own ( ἰδίους , as in Ephesians 5:22 , al., to bring out and emphasize the relation; see note there)  masters worthy of all (fitting)  honour, that the name of God and his doctrine (cf. Titus 2:10 , where, writing on the same subject, he admonishes slaves ἵνα τὴν διδασκαλίαν τὴν τοῦ σωτῆρος ἡμῶν θεοῦ κοσμῶσιν ἐν πᾶσιν . Hence it would appear that the article here is possessive, and ἡ διδασκ . corresponding to τὸ ὄνομα )  be not spoken evil of (Chrys. gives the sense well: ὁ ἄπιστος ἂν μὲν ἴδῃ τοὺς δούλους διὰ τὴν πίστιν αὐθάδως προφερομένους , βλασφημήσει πολλάκις ὡς στάσιν ἐμποιοῦν τὸ δόγμα · ὅταν δὲ ἴδῃ πειθομένους , μᾶλλον πεισθήσεται , μᾶλλον προσέξει τοῖς λεγουένοις . This verse obviously applies only to those slaves who had unbelieving masters. This is brought out by the reason given, and by the contrast in the next verse, not by any formal opposition in terms. The account to be given of the absence of such opposition is, that this verse contains the general exhortation, the case of Christian slaves under  unbelieving masters being by far the most common. The  exception is treated in the next verse).
