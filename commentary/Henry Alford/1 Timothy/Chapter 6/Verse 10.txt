A word like ῥίζα , a recognized part of a plant, does not require an article when placed as here in an emphatic position: we might have ἡ γὰρ ῥίζα , or ῥίζα γάρ : cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:3">1 Corinthians 11:3</span> (which, notwithstanding what Ellic. has alleged against it, still appears to me to be strictly in point to shew that for which it is here adduced), παντὸς ἀνδρὸς ἡ κεφαλὴ ὁ χριστός ἐστιν , κεφαλὴ δὲ γυναικὸς ὁ ἀνήρ , κεφαλὴ δὲ τοῦ χριστοῦ ὁ θεός . Here in the first clause it is requisite to throw παντὸς ἀνδρός into emphasis: but had the arrangement been the same as that of the others, we should have read κεφαλή (not ἡ κεφ .) παντὸς ἀνδρὸς ὁ χριστός : but no one would therefore have thought of rendering ‘ <em> a</em> head’) <strong> root of all evils</strong> (not, is the only root whence all evils spring: but is the root whence all (manner of evils may and as matter of fact do arise. So that De W.’s objections to the sentiment have no force: for neither does it follow (1) that the covetous man cannot possibly retain any virtuous disposition, nor (2) that there may not be other roots of evil besides covetousness: neither of these matters being in the Apostle’s view. So Diogenes Laert. vit. Diogen. (vi. 50), τὴν φιλαργυρίαν εἶπε μητρόπολιν πάντων σῶν κακῶν : and Philo de judice 3, vol. ii. p. 346, calls it ὁρμητήριον τῶν μεγίστων παρανομηματων . See other examples in Wetst.): <strong> after which</strong> ( φιλαργυρία , see below) <strong> some lusting</strong> (the method of expression, if strictly judged, is somewhat incorrect: for φιλαργυρία is of itself a desire or ὄρεξις , and men cannot be properly said ὀρέγεσθαι after it, but after its object ἀργύριον . Such inaccuracies are, however, often found in language, and we have examples of them in St. Paul elsewhere: e.g. ἐλπὶς βλεπομένη , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:24">Romans 8:24</span> , ἐλπίδα … ἣν καὶ αὐτοὶ οὗτοι προσδέχονται , Act 24:15 ) <strong> wandered away from the faith</strong> (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:19">1 Timothy 1:19</span> ; 1Ti 4:1 ), <strong> and pierced themselves through</strong> (not all round’ or ‘all over,’ as Beza, Elsner, al.: the περί refers to the thing pierced <em> surrounding the instrument piercing</em> : so περιπ . τὴν κεφαλὴν περὶ λόγχην , Plut. Galb. 27: see Palm and Rost, and Suicer, sub voce) <strong> with many pains</strong> (the ὀδύναι being regarded as the weapons. ἄκανθαί εἰσιν αἱ ἐπιθυμίαι καὶ καθάπερ ἐν ἀκάνθαις , ὅθεν ἄν τις ἅψηται αὐτῶν , ᾕμαξε τὰς χεῖρας καὶ τραύματα ἐργάζεται · οὕτω καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐπιθυμιῶν τὸ αὐτὸ πείσεται ὁ ταύταις ἐμπεσών , κ . τὴν ψυχὴν ἀλγηδόσι περιβαλεῖ .
