Those who render the pre-position, ‘under,’ understand this<i> confession</i> of our Lord’s<i> sufferings and death</i>—which at least is far-fetched.—There is no necessity to require a strict parallel between the circumstances of the confession of our Lord and that of Timothy, nor to infer in consequence of this verse that his confession must have been one before a heathen magistrate: it is the<i> fact</i> of a confession having been made in both cases that is put in the foreground—and that our Lord’s was made in the midst of danger and with death before him, is a powerful argument to firmness for his servant in his own confession);<b> that thou keep</b> (preserve)<b> the commandment</b> (used not to designate any special command just given, but as a general compendium of the rule of the Gospel, after which our lives and thoughts must be regulated: see “<i>the command-ment</i>” in the same sense, ch. i. 5)<b> without<br><br> spot and without reproach</b> (both epithets belong to<i> the commandment</i>, not to<i> thee</i>, as most Commentators.

Far better Bengel, explaining that the faithful then set before themselves the coming of the Lord: we, the hour of our death. We may fairly say that whatever impression is betrayed by the words that the coming of the Lord would be in Timothy’s lifetime, is chastened and corrected by the words “<i>in His own seasons</i>” of the next verse.<i> That</i>, the certainty of the coming in God’s own time, was a fixed truth respecting which the Apostle speaks with the authority of the Spirit: but the day and hour was hidden from him as from us: and from such passages as this we see that the apostolic age maintained that which ought to be the attitude of all ages, constant expectation of the Lord’s return):
