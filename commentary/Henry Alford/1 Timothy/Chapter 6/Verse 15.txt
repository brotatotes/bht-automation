<b> 15.</b>]<b> which in His own seasons</b> ( “that is, in the fitting, proper seasons.” Chrysostom. Bengel remarks the plural, which seems to imply long spaces of time. See the same in Acts i. 7)<b> He shall manifest</b> (make visible, cause to appear; display), (<b>who is</b>)<b> the blessed</b> (blessed, of Himself)<b> and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords</b> (literally,<b> the King of them that reign and the Lord of them that rule</b>. This seems the place,—on account of this same designation occurring in Rev. xvii. 14; xix. 16, applied to our Lord,—to e quire whether these verses 15, 16 are said of the Father or of the Son. Chrysostom holds very strongly the latter view: but surely the term “<i>in His own seasons</i>,” compared with “<i>the seasons which the Father hath kept in His own power,</i>” Acts i. 7, determines for the former: so also does “<i>whom never man saw, &c.</i>” verse 16, which Chrysostom leaves untouched); who only hath immortality (Justin Martyr says, “God is said only to have immortality, because He hath it not by the will of another, as the rest who possess it, but of His own proper essence”),<b> dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no one of men</b> [<b>ever</b>]<b> saw, nor can see</b> (these words, as compared with John i. 18, seem to prove decisively that the whole description applies to the Father, not to the Son):<b> to whom be honour and eternal might. Amen</b> (see ch. i. 17, where a similar ascription occurs). Some of the Commentators think that verses 15, 16 are taken from an ecclesiastical hymn: and some have even arranged it metrically. See ch. iii. 16, 2 Tim. ii. 11 ff, notes.
