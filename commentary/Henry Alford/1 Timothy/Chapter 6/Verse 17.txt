<b> 17</b>.]<b> To those who are rich in this present world</b> (Chrysostom tries to bring out a distinction between those that were rich in this world, and those that were rich in the next. But such a distinction would have been improbable, as drawing a line between the two characters, which it is the object of the exhortation to keep united in the same persons. See the distinction in Luke xii. 21),<b> command not to be highminded</b> ( “this he enjoins, knowing that nothing so much engenders pride, and insolence, and assumption, as riches.” Chrysostom),<b> nor to set their hope</b> (i. e. to have hoped, and continue to be hoping: see on ch. iv. 10)<b> on the uncertainty of riches</b> (not the same as “on uncertain riches,” but far more forcible, hyperbolically representing the hope as reposed on the very quality in riches which least justifies it),<b> but in God, who affordeth us all things richly</b> ( “<i>riches</i>” of a nobler and higher kind are included in His bounty: that<i> desire of riches</i> which is a bane and snare in its worldly sense, will be far better attained in the course of His abundant mercies to them who hope in Him. And even those who would be wealthy without Him are in fact only made rich by His bountiful hand)<b> for enjoyment</b> (for the purpose of enjoying):—<b>to do good</b> ( ‘to practise benevolence,’ as Conybeare),<b> to be rich in good works</b> (honourable deeds),<b>—to be free givers, ready contributors,</b> [<b>by this means</b>]<b> laying up for themselves as a treasure</b> (hoarding up, not uncertain treasure for the life here, but a substantial pledge of that real and endless life which shall be hereafter. So that there is no difficulty whatever in the conjunction of<i> laying up a foundation</i>. For the expression, see ch. iii. 13)<b> a good foundation</b> (see Luke vi. 48)<b> for the</b><b> future, that</b> (in order that, as always: not the mere<i> result</i> of the preceding: ‘as it were,’ says De Wette, ‘setting foot on this foundation,’ or firm ground)<b> they may lay hold of</b> (ver. 12)<b> that which is really life</b> (not merely the goods of this life, but the possession and substance of that other, which, as full of joy and everlasting, is the only true life).
