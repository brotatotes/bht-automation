<p><strong> 2</strong> .] <strong> But</strong> (see above) <strong> let those who have believing masters not despise them because</strong> (belongs to καταφρονείτωσαν only, containing the ground of their contempt, not to the exhortation μὴ καταφρονείτωσαν ) <strong> they</strong> (the masters, not the slaves) <strong> are brethren, but all the more serve them</strong> ( <strong> μᾶλλον</strong> has the emphatic position: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:11">Ephesians 5:11</span> , where it merely signifies ‘rather,’ and the verb has the emphasis, μᾶλλον δὲ καὶ ἐλέγχετε . Cf. also Hom. Od. ο . 369, φίλει δέ με κηρόθι μᾶλλον : and in the same sense ἐπὶ μᾶλλον , Herod. i. 94, ἐπεί τε δὲ οὐκ ἀνιέναι τὸ κακόν , ἀλλ ʼ ἐπὶ μᾶλλον ἔτι βιάζεσθαι , iii. 104; iv. 181. “The slaves who were under heathen masters were <em> positively</em> to regard their masters as deserving of honour; the slaves under Christian masters were, <em> negatively</em> , not to evince any want of respect. The former were not to regard their masters as their inferiors, and to be insubordinate; the latter were not to think them their equals, and to be disrespectful.” Ellicott), <strong> because those who receive</strong> (mutually receive: the interchange of service between them in the Christian life being taken for granted, and this word purposely used to express it. So Eur. Andr. 742 ff., κἂν … τολοιπὸν ᾖ | σώφρων καθ ʼ ἡμᾶς , σώφρον ʼ ἀντιλήψεται . | θυμούμενος δέ , τεύξεται θυμουμένων , ἔργοισι δ ʼ ἔργα διάδοχ ʼ ἀντιλήψεται . This sense, in the active, also occurs Theogn. 110, οὔτε κακοὺς εὖ δρῶν , εὖ πάλιν ἀντιλάβοις . And Plut. Pericl. circa init. has it with the middle and the genitive construction, τῇ μὲν γὰρ αἰσθήσει , κατὰ πάθος τῆς πληγῆς ἀντιλαμβανομένῃ τῶν προστυγχανόντων …; and so Porphyr. de abstinentia, i. 46, μήτε ἐσθίων πλειόνων ἡδονῶν ἀντιλήψεται . On other senses, see below) <strong> the benefit</strong> (of their μᾶλλον δουλεύειν . There is an apt and interesting passage in Seneca, de beneficiis, iii. 18: ‘Quæritur a quibusdam, an beneficium dare servus domino possit?’ This question he answers in the affirmative: ‘servos qui negat dare aliquando domino beneficium, ignarus est juris humani: refert enim, cujus animi sit qui præstat, non cujus status:’ and at some length explains when, and how, such benefits can be said to be bestowed. The passage is remarkable, as constituting perhaps one of those curious indications of community of thought between the Apostle and the philosopher which could hardly have been altogether fortuitous. For instance, when Seneca proceeds thus, “Quidquid est quod servilis officii formulam excedit, quod non ex imperio sed ex voluntate præstatur, beneficium est,” we can hardly forbear connecting the unusual sense here of εὐεργεσία after the μᾶλλον δουλευέτωσαν , with the moralist’s discussion) <strong> are faithful and beloved</strong> .
	</p>
<p>Very various meanings and references have been assigned to these last words. Chrys., Thl., Grot., Kypke, al., interpret εὐεργεσίας of the kindness of the master to the slave (“ <em> quia fideles sunt et dilecti qui beneficii participes sunt</em> (vulg.): primum, quia fide in Deum sunt præditi: deinde diligendi eo nomine quod curam gerant, ut vobis benefaciant: id est ut vos vestiant, pascant, ab injuriis protegant.” Grot.). On the other hand, Ambr. (?), Lomb., Th.-Aq., Calv., Beza, Bengel, al., understand it of God’s grace in redemption. But thus, if we make οἱ τῆς εὐεργ . ἀντιλ . the subject, as by the article it must be, the sentence will express nothing but a truism: if we escape from this by turning those words into the predicate (as E. V., “because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit”), we are violating the simplest rules of grammar. <strong> These things</strong> (viz. those immediately preceding, relating to slaves) <strong> teach and exhort.</strong></p>
