<b> 22</b>.] CONCLUDING BENEDICTION: [<b>The</b>]<b> grace</b> (of God,—the grace for which we Christians look, and in which we stand)<b> be with thee.</b>—In the A.V. a subscription to the Epistle is found, “The first to Timothy was written from Laodicea, is the chiefest city of Phrygia Pacatiana.” A shorter notice, “from Laodicea,” is found in the Alexandrine MS. These owe their origin probably to the notion that this was the Epistle from Laodicea mentioned Col. iv. 16. The further addition in the A.V. betrays a date subsequent to the fourth century, when the province of Phrygia Pacatiana was first created.
