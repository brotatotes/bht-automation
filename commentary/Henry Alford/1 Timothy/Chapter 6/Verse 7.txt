The meaning appears to be, we were appointed by God to come naked into the world, to teach us to remember that we must go naked out of it. But this sense of ὅτι is not without difficulty. De W. cites Il. π . 35, γλαυκὴ δέ σε τίκτε θάλασσα , πέτραι τ ʼ ἠλίβατοι , ὅτι τοι νόος ἐστὶν ἀπηνής , and Od. χ . 36, ὦ κύνες , οὔ μ ʼ ἔτ ʼ ἐφάσκεθ ʼ ὑπότροπον οἴκαδ ʼ ἱκέσθαι | δήμου ἄπο Τρώων , ὅτι μοι κατεκείρετε οἶκον , in both which it has nearly the sense required, of ‘  seeing that .’ The sentiment is found in Job 1:21 , Ecclesiastes 5:14 ; and in words remarkably similar, in Seneca, Ep. 102. 24, ‘non licet plus efferre, quam intuleris.’ See other examples in Wetst.):
