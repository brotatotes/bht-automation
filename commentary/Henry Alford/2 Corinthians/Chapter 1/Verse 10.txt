<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] <strong> Who rescued us from so great a death, and will rescue us, on whom we hope that He will also continue to rescue us</strong> . The rec. ῥύεται , has been substituted for the fut. ῥύσεται , as more appropriate. But <em> it</em> regards the <em> immediate</em> future, the καὶ ἔτι ῥύσεται the <em> continuance</em> of God’s help in time distant and uncertain. The whole verse (as De W. confesses, who although he repudiates the Ephesian tumult, yet interprets the passage as alluding to external danger) seems to favour the idea of <em> bodily sickness</em> being in the Apostle’s mind.</p>
