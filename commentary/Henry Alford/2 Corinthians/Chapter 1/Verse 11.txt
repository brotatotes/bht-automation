<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] <strong> συνυπουργούντων</strong> <em> with whom?</em> From the similar passage <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:30">Romans 15:30</span> , συναγωνίσασθαί μοι ἐν ταῖς προσευχαῖς ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ , it would seem as if μοι should be supplied; but he himself could hardly be said ὑπουργεῖν , though he well might ἀγωνίσασθαι . We must therefore understand the preposition either with Chrys., Hom. ii. p. 432, τουτέστιν , εὐχομένων πάντων ὑμῶν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν , or as merely signifying <em> coincidence with the purpose to be accomplished</em> , as in μὴ προσεῶντος ἡμᾶς τοῦ ἀνέμου , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:7">Acts 27:7</span> , where see note.

<p><strong> ἵνα ἐκ πολλῶν προσώπων</strong> <strong> .…</strong> ] “Three constructions of this verse are possible: (1) to take ἐκ πολλ . προσώπ . as well as διὰ πολλῶν with, εὐχαριστηθῇ ‘ <em> in order that the mercy shewn to me may be given thanks for on my behalf by many persons with many words</em> ’ (Storr, Opusc. ii. 253): but the rendering ‘with many words,’ is objectionable, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:7">Matthew 6:7</span> : (2) to take ἐκ πολλ . προσώπ . with εὐχαρ ., and διὰ πολλῶν with τὸ εἰς ἡμ . χάρ . ‘ <em> in order that the mercy shewn to me by means of</em> (the intercession of) <em> many, may be given thanks for by many persons on my behalf</em> ’ (Theophyl., Billroth, Meyer, who explain ἐκ π . προσώπ . ‘ex multis oribus:’ Stanley, ‘from many upturned <em> faces</em> ’): but the position of the words is against this, and it is more natural that the mention of the effect of the intercession should precede that of the thanksgiving. (3) Consequently, the best method is to take ἐκ πολλ . προσώπ . with τὸ εἰς ἡμ . χάρ ., and διὰ πολλῶν with εὐχαρ . (Beza, Calov., Estius, Fritz., Rückert, al.): <strong> in order that the mercy shewn to us by the intercession of many persons, may by many be given thanks for on our behalf</strong> .” De Wette.

<p>The emphasis of the whole being on the <strong> ἐκ πολλῶν προσώπων</strong> , he places it first, even before the art., after which it would naturally come.
	</p>
<p><strong> προσώπων</strong> , ‘ <em> persons</em> ,’ a later meaning, which Phrynichus (see Wetst.) blames as used by οἱ ἀμφὶ τὰς δίκας ῥήτορες .</p>
