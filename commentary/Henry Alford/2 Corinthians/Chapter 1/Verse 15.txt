 15. ]  ταύτῃ τῇ πεπ ., i.e. of my character being known to you as that of an earnest and sincere man.
	 πρότερον belongs to ἐλθεῖν , not to ἐβουλόμην .  πρότερον , viz.  before he visited Macedonia, where he now was.
	 ἵνα δευτέραν χάριν σχῆτε ]  that you might have a second benefit (effusion of the divine χάρις by my presence: not = χαράν as Chrys., see var. read.).
	 δευτέραν  second , because there would thus have been opportunity for  two visits, one in going towards Macedonia, the other in returning. This is the interpretation of De Wette, Bleek, and Wieseler, and I believe the only one which the words will bear. The other, according to which δευτέραν χάριν would mean ‘a second benefit,’ by my visiting you  for the second time , is in my view unnatural, and would hardly have justified the use of δευτέραν at all. For  come when he would , the χάρις of the  second visit would be the δευτέρα χάρις , and the conferring a δευτέρα χάρις would have been of no signification in the present connexion, which is to state a purpose of paying them  two visits in one and the same journey . The first  of these he characterizes by πρότερον … ἐλθεῖν , the second by δευτέρα χάρις , implying also the first. So that I do not believe this passage to be relevant to the question respecting the number of visits which Paul  had made to Corinth  previously to writing these Epistles. See on that question, Prolegg. to 1 Cor. § v.
