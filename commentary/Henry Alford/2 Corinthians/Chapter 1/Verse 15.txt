<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] <strong> ταύτῃ τῇ πεπ</strong> ., i.e. of my character being known to you as that of an earnest and sincere man.
	</p>
<p><strong> πρότερον</strong> belongs to ἐλθεῖν , not to ἐβουλόμην . <strong> πρότερον</strong> , viz. <em> before</em> he visited Macedonia, where he now was.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἵνα δευτέραν χάριν σχῆτε</strong> ] <strong> that you might have a second benefit</strong> (effusion of the divine χάρις by my presence: not = χαράν as Chrys., see var. read.).
	</p>
<p><strong> δευτέραν</strong> <em> second</em> , because there would thus have been opportunity for <em> two</em> visits, one in going towards Macedonia, the other in returning. This is the interpretation of De Wette, Bleek, and Wieseler, and I believe the only one which the words will bear. The other, according to which δευτέραν χάριν would mean ‘a second benefit,’ by my visiting you <em> for the second time</em> , is in my view unnatural, and would hardly have justified the use of δευτέραν at all. For <em> come when he would</em> , the χάρις of the <em> second visit</em> would be the δευτέρα χάρις , and the conferring a δευτέρα χάρις would have been of no signification in the present connexion, which is to state a purpose of paying them <em> two visits in one and the same journey</em> . The first <em> of these</em> he characterizes by πρότερον … ἐλθεῖν , the second by δευτέρα χάρις , implying also the first. So that I do not believe this passage to be relevant to the question respecting the number of visits which Paul <em> had made</em> to Corinth <em> previously</em> to writing these Epistles. See on that question, Prolegg. to 1 Cor. § v.</p>
