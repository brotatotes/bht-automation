<p><strong> 16</strong> .] <em> If this is the same journey</em> which is announced in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:5">1 Corinthians 16:5</span> , the idea of visiting them <em> in the way</em> to Macedonia as well as after having passed through it, must have occurred to him subsequently to the sending of that Epistle; or may even then have been a <em> wish</em> , but not expressed, from uncertainty as to its possibility, the main and longer visit being there principally dwelt on. But perhaps the following is the more likely account of the matter. He had announced to them in the lost Epistle (see 1Co 5:9 ) his intention, as here, of visiting them <em> on his way</em> to Macedonia: but the intelligence from “them of Chloe” had altered his intention, so that, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:0">1 Corinthians 16:0</span> , he speaks of visiting them <em> after he should have passed through</em> Macedonia. For this he was accused of levity of purpose. Certainly, some intention of coming to them seems to have been mentioned in that lost Epistle: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:18">1 Corinthians 4:18</span> . But the προπεμφθῆναι εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν can hardly but be coincident with the alms-bearing scheme of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:4">1 Corinthians 16:4</span> ; in which case the two plans certainly are modifications of one and the same.</p>
