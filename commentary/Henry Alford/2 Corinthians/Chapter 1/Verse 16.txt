<b> 16.]</b><i><b></b> If this is the same journey</i> which is announced in 1 Cor. xvi. 5, the idea of visiting them<i> in the way to</i> Macedonia as well as after having passed through it, must have occurred to him subsequently to the sending of that Epistle; or may even then have been a<i> wish</i>, but not expressed, from uncertainty as to its possibility,—the main and longer visit being there principally dwelt on. But perhaps the following is the more likely account of the matter. He had announced to them in the lost Epistle (see 1 Cor. v. 9) his intention, as here, of visiting them<i> on his way</i> to Macedonia: but the intelligence from “them of the household of Chloe” had altered his intention, so that, in 1 Cor. xvi., he speaks of visiting them<i> after he should have passed through</i> Macedonia. For this he was accused of levity of purpose. Certainly, some intention of coming to them seems to have been mentioned in that lost Epistle; see 1 Cor. iv. 18. But the “<i>being brought on his way to Judæa</i>” can hardly but be coincident with the almsbearing scheme of 1 Cor. xvi. 4: in which case the two plans certainly are modifications of one and the same.
