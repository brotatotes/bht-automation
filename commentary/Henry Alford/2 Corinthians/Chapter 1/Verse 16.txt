 16 .]  If this is the same journey which is announced in 1 Corinthians 16:5 , the idea of visiting them  in the way to Macedonia as well as after having passed through it, must have occurred to him subsequently to the sending of that Epistle; or may even then have been a  wish , but not expressed, from uncertainty as to its possibility, the main and longer visit being there principally dwelt on. But perhaps the following is the more likely account of the matter. He had announced to them in the lost Epistle (see 1Co 5:9 ) his intention, as here, of visiting them  on his way to Macedonia: but the intelligence from “them of Chloe” had altered his intention, so that, in 1 Corinthians 16:0 , he speaks of visiting them  after he should have passed through Macedonia. For this he was accused of levity of purpose. Certainly, some intention of coming to them seems to have been mentioned in that lost Epistle: see 1 Corinthians 4:18 . But the προπεμφθῆναι εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν can hardly but be coincident with the alms-bearing scheme of 1 Corinthians 16:4 ; in which case the two plans certainly are modifications of one and the same.
