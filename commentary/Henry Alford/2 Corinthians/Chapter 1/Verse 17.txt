<b> 17.]</b> Literally,<b> Did I at all use levity (of purpose)? Or those things which I plan, do I plan according to the flesh</b> (i. e. according to the changeable, self-contradictory, and insincere purposes of the mere worldly and ungodly man),<b> that there should be with me</b> (not, ‘<i>so that there is</i> with me:’ he is speaking not merely of the result, but of the design: ‘<i>do I plan like the worldly, that I may shift and waver as suits me?</i>’) the yea yea, and the nay nay (i. e. both affirmation and negation concerning the same thing)? Chrysostom and many others take it thus, which is an allowable translation: ‘<i>Or those things which I plan, do I plan after the flesh</i> (as fleshly men do),<i> so that my yea must</i> (at all events)<i> be yea, and my nay nay</i>?’ i.e. as worldly men who perform their promise at all hazards, and whatever the consequences, whereas I am under the guidance of the Spirit, and can only journey whither He permits. But this explanation is directly against the next verse, where yea and nay is clearly parallel to yea yea, and nay nay, here, the words being repeated, as in Matt. v. 37, without altering the sense: and inconsistent with ver. 23 and ch. ii. 1, where he says that his alteration of plan arose<i> from a desire to spare them.</i>
