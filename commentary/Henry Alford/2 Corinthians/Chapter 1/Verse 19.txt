 19 .]  Confirmation of the last verse , by affirming the same of the great Subject of that doctrine, as set before them by Paul and his colleagues.
	 χριστός , personal not for ‘  doctrina de Christo ’ HE HIMSELF is the centre and substance of all Christian preaching: see 1 Corinthians 1:23 , and note at 2 Corinthians 2:2 .
	 ὁ τοῦ θεοῦ υἱός is prefixed for solemnity, and to shew how unlikely fickleness or change is in Christ,  being such as He is . Cf. 1 Samuel 15:29 , ‘the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent.’

This seems to me far better than with De Wette, al., to make ναί the subject, and γέγονεν predicatory. The absence of the art. before ναί , as well as the sense, stamps it as the predicate. ‘Christ preached as the Son of God by us,  has become yea in Him ,’ i.e. has been affirmed and substantiated as verity by the agency of the Lord Himself.
