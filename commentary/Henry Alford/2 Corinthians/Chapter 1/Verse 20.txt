<p><strong> 20.</strong> ] <strong> ὅσαι γὰρ</strong> <strong> …</strong> is an independent relative clause, as in ref., not the subject answering to ἐν αὐτῷ τὸ ναί as a predicate, as E. V.: <strong> For how many soever be the promises of God, in Him is the yea</strong> (the affirmation and fulfilment of them all); <strong> wherefore also through Him is the Amen, for glory to God by our</strong> (the Apostles’) <strong> means</strong> . This reading, which has the stronger external authority, <em> may</em> have arisen from an idea that the clause had reference to <em> the Amen uttered at the end of prayers</em> . So Theodoret, οὗ δὴ χάριν καὶ δι ʼ αὐτοῦ τὸν τῆς εὐχαριστίας αὐτῷ προσφέρομεν ὕμνον , from which comment De Wette thinks the reading has sprung. The apparent objection to it is, that then <strong> ἡμῶν</strong> must mean ἡμῶν καὶ ὑμῶν , which without notice it perhaps could hardly do. In the next verse, when such is about to be its meaning, we have first <strong> ἡμᾶς σὺν ὑμῖν</strong> , and then in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:22">2 Corinthians 1:22</span> , ἡμᾶς … ἡμῶν in the general sense: but here, without any such preparatory notice, δι ʼ ἡμῶν must signify ‘by means of <em> us Apostles</em> ,’ ‘by our work in the Lord.’ Thus ἀμήν will be merely a strengthening of ναί the <em> affirmation and completion</em> of God’s promises.</p>
