 20. ]  ὅσαι γὰρ  … is an independent relative clause, as in ref., not the subject answering to ἐν αὐτῷ τὸ ναί as a predicate, as E. V.:  For how many soever be the promises of God, in Him is the yea (the affirmation and fulfilment of them all);  wherefore also through Him is the Amen, for glory to God by our (the Apostles’)  means . This reading, which has the stronger external authority,  may have arisen from an idea that the clause had reference to  the Amen uttered at the end of prayers . So Theodoret, οὗ δὴ χάριν καὶ δι ʼ αὐτοῦ τὸν τῆς εὐχαριστίας αὐτῷ προσφέρομεν ὕμνον , from which comment De Wette thinks the reading has sprung. The apparent objection to it is, that then  ἡμῶν must mean ἡμῶν καὶ ὑμῶν , which without notice it perhaps could hardly do. In the next verse, when such is about to be its meaning, we have first  ἡμᾶς σὺν ὑμῖν , and then in 2 Corinthians 1:22 , ἡμᾶς … ἡμῶν in the general sense: but here, without any such preparatory notice, δι ʼ ἡμῶν must signify ‘by means of  us Apostles ,’ ‘by our work in the Lord.’ Thus ἀμήν will be merely a strengthening of ναί the  affirmation and completion of God’s promises.
