<b> 23.]</b><i> His reason for not coming to them.</i><br><br><b> upon</b> [i. e. against]<b> my soul</b>,—with that testimony against me if I fail in the truth.<br><br><b> to spare you,</b> i.e. out of a feeling of compassion for you.<br><br><b> I forebore coming]</b> literally, “<i>I no longer came</i>,” viz. after the first time: see Introd. to 1 Cor.§v. 6. The following verse seems to be added to remove any false inference which might have been drawn from the word “<i>spare</i>” as seeming to assert an unreasonable degree of power over them. But why<b> over your faith?</b> He<i> had power</i> over them, but it was in matters of<i> discipline, not of faith:</i> over matters of faith not even an Apostle has power, seeing it is in<i> each man’s faith</i> that he<i> stands before God.</i> And he puts this strongly, that in matters of faith he is only a fellow-helper of their joy (the “<i>joy in believing,</i>” Rom. xv. 18), in order to shew them the<i> real department</i> of his apostolic power, and that, however exercised, it would not attempt to rule their faith, but only to secure to them, by purifying them, joy in believing. He proceeds to say, that it was the probable disturbance of this joy, which induced him to forego his visit.
