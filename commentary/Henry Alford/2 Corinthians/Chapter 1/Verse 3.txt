<b> 3.] Blessed</b> (above all others)<b> is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ]</b> Here, as in Rom. xv. 6, De Wette would render,<i> “God, and the Father....,”</i> which grammatically is allowable; but I prefer the other rendering, on account of its greater likelihood and simplicity.<br><br><b> the Father of mercies]</b> i.e. who has shewn us so great mercies.<b> 4.]</b> The Apostle in this Epistle uses mostly the<i> first person plural</i>, perhaps including Timothy, perhaps, inasmuch as he writes<i> apostolically</i> (compare<i> “us the apostles,”</i> said of himself and Apollos, 1 Cor. iv. 9), as speaking of the Apostles in common. This however will not explain all places where it occurs elsewhere: e.g. 1 Thess. ii. 18,<i> “We would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again,”</i>—where see note. So that after all perhaps it is best to regard it merely as an idiomatic way of speaking, when often only the singular is intended.<br><br><b> that we may be able]</b> “The Apostle lived not for himself, but for the Church: so that whatever grace God conferred on him, he thought given not for himself alone, but to enable him the better to help others.” Calvin.
