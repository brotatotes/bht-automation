 3. ]  εὐλ  ., Blessed (above all others)  is.…
	 ὁ θ  .   κ  .   πατ  … ]  The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . Here, as in ref. Rom., De Wette would render, ‘  God, and the Father ’.…, which grammatically is allowable; but I prefer the other rendering, on account of its greater verisimilitude and simplicity.
	 ὁ π  .   τ  .   οἰκτιρ .] οἰκτ . can hardly be the gen. of the  attribute , as De W. and Grot., seeing that οἰκτ . is plural and refers to  acts of mercy; but as Chrys., p. 421, ὁ οἰκτιρμοὺς τοσούτους ἐπιδειξάμενος : see ref. James. This meaning De W. himself recognizes in ὁ θ . πάσης παρακλ ., ‘the God who works all (possible) comfort,’ and refers to ὁ θεὸς τ . ἐλπίδος , Romans 15:13 .
