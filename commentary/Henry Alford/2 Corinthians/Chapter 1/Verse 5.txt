 5 .] ‘As He is, so are we in this world:’ 1 John 4:17 .  As the sufferings of Christ (  endured by Christ , whether in his own person, or in his mystical body the Church, see Matthew 25:40 ; Mat 25:45 )  abound towards us (i.e.  in our case , see reff.);  even so through Christ our consolation also abounds . The form of expression is altered in the latter clause: instead of ἡ παράκλησις τοῦ χριστοῦ περις . we have ἡ παράκ . ἡμῶν περισς . διὰ τοῦ χριστοῦ . And not without reason: we  suffer , because  we are His members : we  are consoled because  He is our Head . There is no  comparison (as Chrys., p. 422, οὐ γὰρ ὅσα ἔπαθε , φησίν , ἐπάθομεν μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ περισσά ) between the personal sufferings of Christ, and theirs.
