<b> 5.]</b> ‘As He is, so are we in this world:’ 1 John iv. 17.<br><br><b> as the sufferings of Christ</b> (<i>endured by</i> Christ, whether in his own person, or in his mystical body, the Church, see Matt. xxv. 40, 45)<b> abound towards us</b> (i. e.<i> in our case,</i> see reff.),<b> even so through Christ our consolation also aboundeth.</b>—The form of expression is altered in the latter clause: instead of<i> “the comfort of Christ aboundeth,”</i> we have<b> through Christ aboundeth also our comfort</b>. And not without reason:—we<i> suffer</i>, because<i> we are His members: we are consoled,</i> because<i> He is our Head.</i>
