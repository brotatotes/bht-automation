<p><strong> 6</strong> .] And all this for your benefit. <strong> But whether we are afflicted</strong> , (it is) <strong> on behalf of your comfort</strong> ( εἰς τὸ δύνασθαι κ . τ . λ . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:4">2 Corinthians 1:4</span> , only now applied to the Corinthians) <strong> and salvation</strong> (the great end of the παράκλησις ), <strong> which</strong> (viz. παράκλησις and σωτηρία ) <strong> is working</strong> (not, as Chrys., Theophyl., Estius, Beza, al., ‘ <em> being worked</em> :’ the passive does not occur in St. Paul) <strong> in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer; and our hope is stedfast on your behalf</strong> (that you <em> will</em> endure hardness, and be consoled and saved); or <strong> whether we are comforted</strong> , (it is) <strong> for your comfort and salvation</strong> . This place of the words καὶ ὑμῶν agrees best with the sense, besides being in accordance with the best MSS. Their position has perhaps been altered to bring the two parts of the dilemma closer together, and because ἐλπὶς ἡμῶν seemed to suit the part. εἰδότες , and the future supposed to be implied after οὕτως καί (as in E. V.). The objection to this is (as De W.) that the ἐλπίς clearly must be referred to σωτηρία , which however is not hinted at in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:7">2 Corinthians 1:7</span> .</p>
