	It is generally supposed that the tribulation here spoken of was the danger into which Paul was brought by the tumult at Ephesus, related in Acts 19:0 . This opinion has been recently defended by Neander, Wieseler, and Dr. Davidson, but impugned by De Wette, on the grounds, (1) that ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ can hardly refer to Ephesus, which Paul generally  names , 1 Corinthians 15:32 ; 1 Corinthians 16:8 ; (2) that he was not in danger of his life in this tumult. The first ground is hardly tenable: there would be an appropriateness in ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ here, as he has in his mind an apologetic account of the reasons which hindered him from leaving those parts and coming to them. I own, however, that the strong expressions here used do not seem to me to find their justification in any thing which we know of that tumult or its consequences. I am unable to assign  any other event as in the Apostle’s mind: but the expressions seem rather to regard a  deadly sickness , than a persecution: see below, 2 Corinthians 1:9-10 .
	 καθ  ʼ   ὑπερβ . signifies the greatness of the affliction itself, objectively considered:  ὑπὲρ  δύν ., the relation of it to our power of endurance, subjectively.
	 ὥστε ἐξ .]  So that we utterly despaired even of life . Such an expression surely would not be used of a tumult, where life would have been  the first thing in danger, if Paul had been at all mixed up in it, but to some wearing and tedious suffering, inducing despondency in minor matters, which  even reached the hope of life itself.
