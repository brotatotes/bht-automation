<b> 8.]</b> It is generally supposed that the tribulation here spoken of was the danger into which St. Paul was brought by the tumult at Ephesus, related in Acts xix. This opinion has been recently defended by Neander, Wieseler, and Dr. Davidson, but impugned by De Wette, on the grounds, (1) that<i> “in Asia”</i> can hardly refer to Ephesus, which St. Paul generally<i> names</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 82; xvi. 8; (2) that he was not in danger of his life in this tumult. The first ground is hardly tenable: there would be an appropriateness in the expression “in Asia” here, as he has in his mind an apologetic account of the reasons which hindered him from leaving those parts and coming to them. I own, however, that the strong expressions here used do not seem to me to find their justification in any thing which we know of that tumult or its consequences. I am unable to assign<i> any other event</i> as in the Apostle’s mind: but the expressions seem rather to regard a<i> deadly sickness,</i> than a persecution: see below, verses 9, 10.
