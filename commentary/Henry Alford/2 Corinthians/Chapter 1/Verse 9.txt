 9. ]  ἀλλά  , moreover , carries on and intensifies the description of his hopeless state.
	 We had in ourselves the response of death , i.e. our answer within ourselves to the question, ‘Life or Death?’ was, ‘Death.’ So Vulg., Estius, Billroth, Rückert, Meyer, De Wette.
	 τ  .   ἀπόκρ . may perhaps mean, the ‘  sentence ,’ as Hesych [1] : ἀπόκριμα , κατάκριμα , ψῆφον , and most Commentators. The perfect ἐσχήκαμεν is here (see also ch. 2Co 2:12-13 ) in a historical sense, instead of the aorist: which is unusual. Winer, edn. 6, § 40. 4 (see Moulton’s note 4, p. 340), illustrates the usage by ἦλθεν καὶ εἴληφεν ( τὸ βιβλίον ), Revelation 5:7 ; see also Revelation 8:5 .

	To see in this expression merely a figure (De W.), and understand ‘Who  raiseth the dead ’ as = ‘Who  delivers men from peril of their lives ?’ because such peril is below and elsewhere (ch. 2Co 11:23 ) called θάνατος , is surely very forced. Understanding it literally as above, I cannot see how it can be spoken with reference to the Ephesian tumult. If it alludes to  any external danger , I should be disposed to refer it to the same obscure part of Paul’s history to which he alludes 1 Corinthians 15:32 , where he also speaks of the  hope of the resurrection as his great support. But there would be this objection, that these two passages can hardly refer to the  same event;  this evidently had taken place  since the sending of the first Epistle.
