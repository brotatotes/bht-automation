Understanding it literally as above, I cannot see how it can be spoken with reference to the Ephesian tumult. If it alludes to<i> any external danger</i>, 1 should be disposed to refer it to the same obscure part of St. Paul’s history to which he alludes 1 Cor. xv. 32, where he also speaks of the<i> hope of the resurrection</i> as his great support. But there would he this objection, that these two passages can hardly refer to the<i> same</i> event;<i> this</i> evidently had taken place<i> since</i> the sending of the first Epistle.<b> 10.] who delivered us from so great a death, and will deliver us,—on whom we hope that He will also continue to deliver us.</b> The first “<i>will deliver</i>” regards the<i> immediate</i> future,—the “<i>will continue to deliver</i>” the<i> continuance</i> of God’s help in time distant and uncertain.—The whole verse (as De Wette confesses, who although he repudiates the Ephesian tumult, yet interprets the passage as alluding to external danger) seems to favour the idea of<i> bodily sickness</i> being in the Apostle’s mind.
