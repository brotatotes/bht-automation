<p><strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀπόκρ</strong> . may perhaps mean, the ‘ <em> sentence</em> ,’ as Hesych [1] : ἀπόκριμα , κατάκριμα , ψῆφον , and most Commentators. The perfect ἐσχήκαμεν is here (see also ch. 2Co 2:12-13 ) in a historical sense, instead of the aorist: which is unusual. Winer, edn. 6, § 40. 4 (see Moulton’s note 4, p. 340), illustrates the usage by ἦλθεν καὶ εἴληφεν ( τὸ βιβλίον ), <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+5:7">Revelation 5:7</span> ; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+8:5">Revelation 8:5</span> .

<p>To see in this expression merely a figure (De W.), and understand ‘Who <em> raiseth the dead</em> ’ as = ‘Who <em> delivers men from peril of their lives</em> ?’ because such peril is below and elsewhere (ch. 2Co 11:23 ) called θάνατος , is surely very forced. Understanding it literally as above, I cannot see how it can be spoken with reference to the Ephesian tumult. If it alludes to <em> any external danger</em> , I should be disposed to refer it to the same obscure part of Paul’s history to which he alludes <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:32">1 Corinthians 15:32</span> , where he also speaks of the <em> hope of the resurrection</em> as his great support. But there would be this objection, that these two passages can hardly refer to the <em> same</em> event; <em> this</em> evidently had taken place <em> since</em> the sending of the first Epistle.</p>
