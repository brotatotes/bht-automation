 3 11 .] THANKSGIVING FOR DELIVERANCE FROM GREAT DANGER OF HIS LIFE: HIS ABILITY TO COMFORT OTHERS IN AFFLICTION. Commentators have endeavoured to assign a definite purpose to this opening of the Epistle. De Wette thinks that Paul had  no definite purpose, except to pour out the thankfulness of his heart, and to begin by placing himself with his readers in a position of religious feeling and principle far above all discord and dissension. But I cannot agree with this. His purpose shews so plainly through the whole latter part of the chapter, that it is only consistent with 2Co 1:12-24 to find it beginning to be introduced here also. I believe that Chrys. has given the right account: ἐλύπει λίαν αὐτοὺς κ . ἐθορύβει τὸ μὴ παραγενέσθαι ἐκεῖ τὸν ἀπόστολον , καὶ ταῦτα ἐπαγγειλάμενον , ἀλλὰ τὸν ἅπαντα ἐν Μακεδονίᾳ ἀναλῶσαι χρόνον , καὶ δοκεῖν αὐτῶν ἑτέρους προτετιμηκέναι . διὰ τοῦτο πρὸς τοῦτο ἱστάμενος τὸ θορυβεῖν (al. ἀνθορμοῦν ), λέγει τὴν αἰτίαν δι ʼ ἣν οὐ παρεγένετο · οὐ μὴν ἐξ εὐθείας αὐτὴν τίθησιν , οὐδὲ λέγει ὅτι οἶδα μὲν ὑποσχόμενος ἥξειν , ἐπειδὴ δὲ διὰ τὰς θλίψεις ἐνεποδίσθην , σύγγνωτε , κ . μὴ καταγνῶτέ τινα ὑπεροψίαν ἢ ῥᾳθυμίαν ἡμῶν · ἀλλ ʼ ἑτέρως αὐτὸ (al. τοῦτο ) κ . μεγαλοπρεπέστερον κ . ἀξιοπιστότερον κατασκευάζει , ἐπαίρων τῇ παραμυθίᾳ τὸ πρᾶγμα , ἵνα μηδὲ ἐρωτῶσι λοιπὸν τὴν αἰτίαν , δι ʼ ἣν ὑστέρησε . Hom. i. p. 420. Calvin, somewhat differently: “Incipit ab hac gratiarum actione, partim ut Dei bonitatem prædicet, partim ut animet Corinthios suo exemplo ad persecutiones fortiter sustinendas: partim ut pia gloriatione se efferat adversus malignas obtrectationes pseudapostolorum.” But this does not touch the matter of  the postponed journey to Corinth , which through the latter part of the chapter is coming more and more visibly into prominence, till it becomes the direct subject in 2 Corinthians 1:23 .
