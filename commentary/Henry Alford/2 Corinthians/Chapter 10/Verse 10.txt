 10. ]  φησίν , taken by Winer (edn. 6, § 58. 9.  b . [ β ]), De W., and Meyer, as impersonal  heißt es , ‘  men say :’ but why should not the τις of 2 Corinthians 10:7 , and ὁ τοιοῦτος of 2 Corinthians 10:11 , be the subject?
	 βαρεῖαι ] see in Wetst., definitions from the rhetoricians of βαρύτης in discourse. Among other illustrations of it, Aristides mentions ὅταν τι ἄτοπον ἑαυτῷ καταράσῃ · οἷον , τεθνάναι μᾶλλον ἢ ταῦτ ʼ εἰρηκέναι βούλομαι (see 1Co 9:15 ), and ὅταν εἰς κρίσιν ἀγάγῃς τῶν τεθνεώτων ἐνδόξων , … οἷον , πηλίκον ἂν στενάξαιεν οἱ πρόγονοι (see 1Co 15:18 ).
	 παρουσία  …   ἀσθενής ] No countenance is given by these words to the idea that Paul was of weak physical constitution, or short in stature. His own explanation of them is sufficient as given in 1 Corinthians 2:1 ff. It is, that when he was present among them, he brought, not the strength of presence or words of the carnal teachers, but abjured all such influence and in fear and trembling preached Christ crucified. It was this, and not weakness of voice, which made his λόγος to be ἐξουθενημένος . At the same time, the contrast being between his  epistles and his  word of mouth , his authority as  unaccompanied or  accompanied by his presence, it must be assumed, that there was  something (see on ch. 2Co 12:7 ) which discommended his appearance and delivery. See the traditional authorities for the Apostle’s personal appearance, in Winer’s Realw. vol. ii. p. 221, note.
