<b> 10. his bodily presence is weak]</b> No countenance is given by these words to the idea that Paul was of weak physical constitution, or short in stature. His own explanation of them is sufficient as given in 1 Cor. ii. 1 ff. It is, that when he was present among them, he brought, not the strength of presence or words of the carnal teachers, but abjured all such influence, and in fear and trembling preached Christ crucified. It was this, and not weakness of voice, which made his<i> speech</i> to be<i> contemptible</i>. At the same time, the contrast being between his<i> epistles</i> and his<i> word of mouth</i>, his authority as<i> unaccompanied or accompanied</i> by his presence, it must be assumed, that there was<i> something</i> (see on ch. xii. 7) which discommended his appearance and delivery.
