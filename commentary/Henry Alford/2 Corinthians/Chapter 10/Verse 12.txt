<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] disclaims resemblance to those false teachers who made <em> themselves</em> their only standard. <strong> For we do not venture</strong> (ironical; “dum dicit quod non faciat, notat quid isti faciant.” Bengel) <strong> to number ourselves with</strong> ( συναριθμῆσαι , Theophy., Œcum., ‘inserere,’ Vulg.: see examples of this usage, with εἰς principally, but also with μετά and ἐπί w. gen, in Wetst.), <strong> or compare ourselves with</strong> ( συγκρίνειν is properly, in classical Greek, ‘ <em> to compound</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> unite</em> :’ but in later Greek, <em> to compare</em> :’ ὁ συγκριτικὸς τρόπας , with the grammarians, is the <em> comparative degree</em> ) <strong> some of those who commend themselves</strong> (the charge made against <em> him</em> , ἑαυτὸν συνιστάνει , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:1">2 Corinthians 3:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:12">2 Corinthians 5:12</span> , he makes as a true one against the false teachers); <strong> but (they), themselves measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise</strong> . The renderings are <em> very various</em> . Chrys. al., read συνιοῦσιν , and make it a particip., τουτέστι , μὴ αἰσθανομένοις πῶς εἰσι καταγέλαστοι τοιαῦτα ἀλαζονευόμενοι , p. 590: and see again below. Others, reading the same, take it rightly, as = συνιᾶσιν , but make μετροῦντες , &amp;c., the object of συνιοῦσιν : ‘ <em> know not that they are measuring</em> ,’ &amp;c.: but the corresponding sentence, ἡμεῖς δὲ κ . τ . λ ., shews that this sense would be irrelevant; for the Apostle does not oppose their <em> ignorance of</em> their foolish estimate of themselves to his own practice, but that foolish estimate itself.
	</p>
<p>Others again, as Emmerling and Olshausen, take ἀλλὰ συνιοῦσιν (or - ᾶσιν ) to apply to the <em> Apostle himself</em> , as contrasted with the τινές : ‘ <em> We do not venture, &amp;c., but we ourselves measure</em> (supply ἐσμεν , ‘are in the habit of measuring’) <em> ourselves by ourselves</em> (i.e. as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:18">2 Corinthians 10:18</span> , by what the Lord has really made us to be), <em> and compare ourselves with ourselves, foolish as we are</em> (reputed to be: συνιοῦσιν being a participle). <em> But foolish we are not: we will not boast ourselves,’ &amp;c</em> .
	</p>
<p>But (1) this rendering would absolutely require the article before οὐ συνιοῦσιν , which, anarthrous, would imply, not an imputation, but <em> the fact</em> : (2) the mode of expression ( αὐτοὶ ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἑαυτ . μετρ .) would be a most extraordinary one to convey the meaning supposed: and (3) the meaning itself would be irrelevant when obtained. Another variety of this rendering is to take (as Bos, Schrader, al.) ἑαυτοῖς , οὐ συνιοῦσιν , = ἑαυτοῖς , οὐ <strong> τοῖς</strong> συνιοῦσιν with ourselves, not with the wise: which is also inadmissible.
	</p>
<p>Others again (see var. read.) would omit οὐ συνιᾶσιν (or - οῦσιν )· ἡμεῖς δέ , which has been an evident correction, on the supposition that ἀλλὰ αὐτοὶ κ . τ . λ . belonged to <em> the Apostle</em> , to expunge words so much in the way of such an interpretation.
	</p>
<p>I may observe that much of the difficulty has arisen from taking αὐτοί with ἀλλά as the subject to οὐ συνιᾶσιν , whereas it belongs to what follows, ἀλλὰ αὐτοὶ ἐν ἑαυτ . ἑαυτ . μετρ . κ . τ . λ ., as in the version given above: the subject of συνιᾶσιν being to be supplied, and the construction being an inaccurate one. Calvin well illustrates the <em> sense</em> , by the reputation which any moderately learned man gained among the ignorant monks of his day “Si quis tenuem modo gustum elegantioris literaturæ habeat, … spargitur de eo mirabilis fama, adoratur inter sodales.… Inde præcipue monachis insolentissimus ille fastus quod se metiuntur ex seipsis: quum in eorum claustris nihil sit præter barbariem, illic nihil mirum, si regnet luscus inter cæcos. Tales erant isti Pauli æmuli: sibi enim intus plaudebant, non considerantes quibus virtutibus constaret vera laus, quantumque a Pauli et similium excellentia distarent.”</p>
