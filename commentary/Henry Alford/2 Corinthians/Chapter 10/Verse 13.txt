<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] <strong> But we</strong> (opposed to those spoken of in last verse) <strong> will not</strong> (ever: will never allow ourselves to) <strong> boast without measure</strong> (lit. ‘ <em> boast as far as to things unmeasured</em> .’ <strong> εἰς</strong> with an adj. and the art. is used to signify the <em> extent to which</em> ; so Herod. vii. 229, κατεκέατο ἐν Ἀλπηνοῖσι ὀφθαλμιῶντες ἐς τὸ ἔσχατον : as ἐπί with the same denotes the <em> direction towards which</em> , as ἐπὶ τὸ μεῖζον κοσμοῦντες , … ἐπὶ τὸ μυθῶδες ἐκνενικηκότα , Thucyd. i. 21, <strong> without measure</strong> , scil. as they do who compare themselves with themselves and measure themselves by themselves, for there is no standard for, no limit to, a man’s good opinion of himself. The plur. τὰ ἄμετρα , instead of τὸ ἄμετρον , seems to be chosen to generalize the negative ‘we adopt no such vague standard for our boasting’), <strong> but according to the measure of the rule</strong> ( τὸ μέτρ . τοῦ καν . ‘the measure <em> pointed out</em> by the rule,’ gen. subj.) <strong> which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach as far as to you</strong> οὗ ἐμέρισεν ἡμῖν ὁ θ . μέτρου = <strong> ὂν</strong> ἐμέρ . ἡμ . ὁ θ . μέτρον , <strong> which</strong> ( κανών ) <strong> God apportioned to us as a measure</strong> , or, as De W., τοῦ μέτρου ὃ ἐμέρ . ἡμ . ὁ θ ., in which latter case μέτρου is in appos. with κανόνος : but I prefer the former. Mr. Green, Grammar of the N. T. dialect, p. 269, makes μέτρου governed by ἐφικέσθαι , as in οὕτω τάρβους ἀφικόμην , Eur. Phoen. 361; τοῦ βίου εὖ ἥκοντι , Herod. i. 30. My objections to this construction are, (1) that ἐφικνούμενοι εἰς ὑμᾶς is used absolutely in the very next clause, which makes it probable that the same usage is found here: (2) that an unnecessary harshness is introduced, which I cannot persuade myself that the Apostle would have used, and which is apparent even in Mr. G.’s English, ‘of advancing in standard as far as even you.’ See Stanley’s note.

<p><strong> ἐφικέσθαι</strong> is the inf. of the purpose, <strong> that we should reach</strong> : or perhaps (but not so well) of the result, ‘ <em> so that we reach</em> .’</p>
