 13. ]  But we (opposed to those spoken of in last verse)  will not (ever: will never allow ourselves to)  boast without measure (lit. ‘  boast as far as to things unmeasured .’  εἰς with an adj. and the art. is used to signify the  extent to which ; so Herod. vii. 229, κατεκέατο ἐν Ἀλπηνοῖσι ὀφθαλμιῶντες ἐς τὸ ἔσχατον : as ἐπί with the same denotes the  direction towards which , as ἐπὶ τὸ μεῖζον κοσμοῦντες , … ἐπὶ τὸ μυθῶδες ἐκνενικηκότα , Thucyd. i. 21,  without measure , scil. as they do who compare themselves with themselves and measure themselves by themselves, for there is no standard for, no limit to, a man’s good opinion of himself. The plur. τὰ ἄμετρα , instead of τὸ ἄμετρον , seems to be chosen to generalize the negative ‘we adopt no such vague standard for our boasting’),  but according to the measure of the rule ( τὸ μέτρ . τοῦ καν . ‘the measure  pointed out by the rule,’ gen. subj.)  which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach as far as to you οὗ ἐμέρισεν ἡμῖν ὁ θ . μέτρου =  ὂν ἐμέρ . ἡμ . ὁ θ . μέτρον ,  which ( κανών )  God apportioned to us as a measure , or, as De W., τοῦ μέτρου ὃ ἐμέρ . ἡμ . ὁ θ ., in which latter case μέτρου is in appos. with κανόνος : but I prefer the former. Mr. Green, Grammar of the N. T. dialect, p. 269, makes μέτρου governed by ἐφικέσθαι , as in οὕτω τάρβους ἀφικόμην , Eur. Phoen. 361; τοῦ βίου εὖ ἥκοντι , Herod. i. 30. My objections to this construction are, (1) that ἐφικνούμενοι εἰς ὑμᾶς is used absolutely in the very next clause, which makes it probable that the same usage is found here: (2) that an unnecessary harshness is introduced, which I cannot persuade myself that the Apostle would have used, and which is apparent even in Mr. G.’s English, ‘of advancing in standard as far as even you.’ See Stanley’s note.
	 ἐφικέσθαι is the inf. of the purpose,  that we should reach : or perhaps (but not so well) of the result, ‘  so that we reach .’
