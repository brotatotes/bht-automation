<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] <strong> The</strong> γάρ here shews that this verse is not the refutation of the charge κατὰ σάρκα περιπατεῖν , but a reason rendered for the δέομαι above; and ἐν σαρκί and κατὰ σάρκα <em> allude</em> only to the charge just mentioned. This indeed is shewn by the use, and enlargement in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:4-6">2 Corinthians 10:4-6</span> , of στρατευόμεθα , instead of περιπατοῦμεν : they who accuse us of walking after the flesh, shall find that we do not <em> war</em> after the flesh: therefore compel us not to use our weapons.

<p><strong> ἐν σαρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> περιπ</strong> .] <strong> Although we walk in the flesh</strong> , i.e. are found in the body, yet we do not take our apostolic weapons from the flesh do not make its rule our rule of warfare.</p>
