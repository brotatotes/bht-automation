 3. ]  The γάρ here shews that this verse is not the refutation of the charge κατὰ σάρκα περιπατεῖν , but a reason rendered for the δέομαι above; and ἐν σαρκί and κατὰ σάρκα  allude only to the charge just mentioned. This indeed is shewn by the use, and enlargement in 2 Corinthians 10:4-6 , of στρατευόμεθα , instead of περιπατοῦμεν : they who accuse us of walking after the flesh, shall find that we do not  war after the flesh: therefore compel us not to use our weapons.
	 ἐν σαρ  .   γ  .   περιπ .]  Although we walk in the flesh , i.e. are found in the body, yet we do not take our apostolic weapons from the flesh do not make its rule our rule of warfare.
