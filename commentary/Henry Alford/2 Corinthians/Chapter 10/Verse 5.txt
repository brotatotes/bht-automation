<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] The nom. καθαιροῦντες refers to ἡμεῖς , the implied subject of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:4">2 Corinthians 10:4</span> ; this verse carrying on the figure in <strong> ὀχυρωμάτων</strong> . By <strong> λογισμούς</strong> he means, as Chrys., p. 585, τὸν τῦφον τὸν Ἑλληνικόν , καὶ τῶν σοφισμάτων κ . τῶν συλλογισμῶν τὴν ἰσχύν : but not only these: every towering conceit κατὰ σάρκα is also included.

<p><strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πᾶν ὕψ</strong> .] <strong> And every lofty edifice</strong> (fortress or tower) <strong> which is being raised</strong> (or, raising itself) <strong> against the knowledge of God</strong> (i.e. the true knowledge of Him in the Gospel: not subjective here, but taken objectively, the <em> comparata</em> being <em> human knowledge</em> , as lifted up against the <em> knowledge of God,</em> i.e. the Gospel itself), <strong> and leading captive every intent of the mind</strong> (not ‘ <em> thought</em> ,’ as E. V.: not <em> intellectual</em> subjection <em> here</em> , but that of the <em> will</em> , is intended) <strong> into subjection to Christ</strong> (in the figure he treats ἡ ὑπακοὴ τ . χριστοῦ , the new state into which the will is brought by its subjection, as the <em> country into which it is led captive</em> : compare Luk 21:24 ).</p>
