 6. ] But perhaps some will not thus be subjected. In that case we are ready to inflict punishment on them: but not till every opportunity has been given them to join the ranks of the obedient;  when your obedience (stress on ὑμῶν )  shall have been completed .

More complete ignorance of the Apostle’s style, and non-appreciation of the fine edge of his hortatory irony, can hardly be evinced, than this.
