This indeed is shewn by the use, and enlargement in vv. 4–6, of the idea of<i> warring</i>, instead of that of<i> walking</i>:—they who accuse us of walking after the flesh, shall find that we do not<i> war</i> after the flesh: therefore compel us not to use our weapons.<br><br><b> Although we walk in the flesh,</b> i.e. are found in the body,—yet we do not take our apostolic weapons from the flesh—do not make its rule, our rule of warfare.<br><br><b> 8.]</b> This is shewn to be so. Even more boasting than he had ever yet made of his apostolic power, would not disgrace him, but would be borne out by the fact.<br><br><b> For if</b> (literally)<b> we were to boast somewhat more abundantly</b> (than we have ever done: or than in vv. 3–6)<b> concerning our power which the Lord has given for building you up and not for casting you down</b> ( “how then has he before said, ‘<i>casting down reasonings?</i>&c.,’ because thus, to cast down the unsound and rotten parts, and to remove obstacles, is the best way of building up.” Chrysostom),<b> I shall not be put to shame</b> ( “I shall not be shewn to be acting falsely, nor assuming too much.” Chrysostom).
