 9. ] follows on 2 Corinthians 10:8 , but requires some clause to be supplied such as ‘And I say this,’ or the like. Meyer would join it  immediately to αἰσχυνθ ., and regard it as the purpose to be served by  the fact verifying his boast . But as De W. observes, a  particular result like this can hardly be bound on to a  general assertion like that of 2 Corinthians 10:8 . To suppose the  purpose of Paul’s boast of apostolic power being borne out, to be merely ἵνα μὴ δόξω , &c., would be out of keeping with the importance of the fact. So that ἵνα μὴ δόξω is much better taken  subjectively  I say this, because I wish not to seem, &c.  ὡς ἄν , as Vulg. ‘tanquam terrere vos.’ It takes off the harshness of ἐκφοβεῖν . “ ὡς ἄν in later (? see ref.) Greek, has the sense of ‘quasi, tanquam,’  ἄν losing its proper force, in a commonly current expression; and the sense is much the same as that of ὡς alone.” Meyer. Winer takes ὡς ἂν ἐκφοβεῖν as = ὡς ἂν ἐκφοβοῖμι , edn. 6, § 42. 6 (but see Moulton’s note, p. 390, 1, who prefers the account given above), and is followed by Olsh., but this, in the presence of the above idiom, is unnecessary.
