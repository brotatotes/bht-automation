<p><strong> 9.</strong> ] follows on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:8">2 Corinthians 10:8</span> , but requires some clause to be supplied such as ‘And I say this,’ or the like. Meyer would join it <em> immediately</em> to αἰσχυνθ ., and regard it as the purpose to be served by <em> the fact verifying his boast</em> . But as De W. observes, a <em> particular</em> result like this can hardly be bound on to a <em> general</em> assertion like that of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:8">2 Corinthians 10:8</span> . To suppose the <em> purpose</em> of Paul’s boast of apostolic power being borne out, to be merely ἵνα μὴ δόξω , &amp;c., would be out of keeping with the importance of the fact. So that ἵνα μὴ δόξω is much better taken <em> subjectively</em> <strong> I say this, because I wish not to seem, &amp;c.</strong> <strong> ὡς ἄν</strong> , as Vulg. ‘tanquam terrere vos.’ It takes off the harshness of ἐκφοβεῖν . “ ὡς ἄν in later (? see ref.) Greek, has the sense of ‘quasi, tanquam,’ <strong> ἄν</strong> losing its proper force, in a commonly current expression; and the sense is much the same as that of ὡς alone.” Meyer. Winer takes ὡς ἂν ἐκφοβεῖν as = ὡς ἂν ἐκφοβοῖμι , edn. 6, § 42. 6 (but see Moulton’s note, p. 390, 1, who prefers the account given above), and is followed by Olsh., but this, in the presence of the above idiom, is unnecessary.

<p><strong> διὰ τῶν ἐπιστολῶν</strong> ] He had written <em> two</em> before this, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:9">1 Corinthians 5:9</span> ; but this is not necessarily here implied: for he may reckon this which he is now writing. Still less can we infer hence that a <em> third</em> had been written before this (Bleek).</p>
