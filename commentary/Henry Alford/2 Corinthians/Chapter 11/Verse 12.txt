<b> 12.]</b><i> The true reason:</i><b>—But that which I do, I will also continue to do, in order that I may cut off the occasion</b> (which would be furnished if I did not so)<b> of those who wish for an occasion</b> (viz. of depreciating me by misrepresenting my motives if I took money of you)<b>; that, in the matter of which they boast, they may be found even as we.</b> Such appears generally acknowledged to be the<i> rendering</i>: but as to the<i> meaning</i>, there is great variety of opinion. (1) Many of the ancient Commentators assume that they<i> taught gratis</i>, and were proud of it,—and that St. Paul would also teach gratis, to put both on an equality and take this occasion of boasting from them. This would suit the sense of the<i> present verse,</i> but seems (see above) at variance with the fact. (2) Theodoret and others suppose them to have<i> pretended</i> to the credit of self-denial, while really making gain, and that St. Paul means, that he will<i> reduce them from pretended to real</i> self-denial. But this too is inconsistent with the context. St. Paul’s boast of disinterested teaching was peculiarly<i> his own,</i> and there is nothing to shew that the false teachers ever professed or made any boast, of the like. His resolution did not spring out of an actual comparison instituted by them between their own practice and what they might falsely allege to be his, but was adopted even before his coming to Corinth, arguing<i> à priori</i> that it was best to cut off any possible occasion of such depreciation of him from his probable adversaries. (3) I cannot adopt any one of the above accounts of the sentence, for the negative reasons already given, and because all of them seem to me to have missed the clue to the meaning which the chapter itself furnishes. This clue I find in vv. 18 ff. See the other interpretations discussed in any Greek Test. I have endeavoured there to shew that the meaning is, ‘<i>that in the matter (s) of which they boast they may be found even as we:</i>’ i.e. we may be on a fair and equal footing:’ ‘that there may be no adventitious comparisons made between us arising out of misrepresentations of my course of procedure among you, but that in every matter of boasting, we may be fairly compared and judged by facts.’ And then, before the<b> for</b> of ver. 13 will naturally be supplied, ‘And this will end in their discomfiture:<i> for</i> realities they have none, no weapons but misrepresentation, being<i> false apostles</i>,’&c.
