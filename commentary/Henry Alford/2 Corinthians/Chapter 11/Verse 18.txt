<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] <strong> Since many</strong> (viz. the false teachers, but not only they: ‘since it is a common habit,’ for he is here speaking as εἷς τῶν ἀφρόνων , see Job 2:10 ) <strong> boast according to the flesh</strong> (not = ἐν σαρκί , as Chrys., al., but ‘in a spirit of fleshly regard,’ ‘having regard to their extraction, achievements, &amp;c.’ as below <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:22">2 Corinthians 11:22</span> ff.), <strong> I also will boast</strong> (scil. κατὰ τὴν σάρκα . Rückert thinks these words are omitted purposely, thereby to imply that tbe Apostle’s boasting <em> was not</em> fleshly; but this is distinctly contradicted by the context: he is speaking as one of the πολλοί , of οἱ ἄφρονες , see next verse).</p>
