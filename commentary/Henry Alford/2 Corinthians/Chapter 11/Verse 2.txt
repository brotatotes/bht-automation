 2. ] ‘That forbearance which you do really extend to me, and for more of which I now pray, is due from you, and I claim to have it exercised by you, because I have undertaken to present you to Christ as a chaste bride to her husband, and ( 2Co 11:3 ) I am jealous for fear of your falling away from Him.’
	 θεοῦ ζήλῳ ] so εἰλικρινείᾳ τοῦ θεοῦ , ch. 2 Corinthians 1:12 ;  a godly jealousy : see note there. Meyer after Chrys., Estius, al., would render it, ‘  with God’s jealousy ,’ ‘with such a jealousy as God has.’ But though θεοῦ ζήλῳ and τῷ τοῦ θεοῦ ζήλῳ are for most purposes identical, I cannot but think that the latter expression would have been chosen to express such an idea as ‘  with the zeal which God has .’ And the rendering, ‘with a  godly zeal,’ i.e. one which  has God’s honour at heart , satisfies well what follows: see below.

But in Philo we have γάμος ὃν ἁρμόζεται ἡδονή , ed Abr. § 20, vol. ii. p. 15)  to one husband, to present (i.e. in order that I may present in you [, present you as])  a chaste virgin to Christ (viz. at  His coming : ὁ μὲν οὖν παρὼν καιρὸς μνηστείας ἐστίν · ὁ δὲ μέλλων τῶν γάμων , ὅτε κραυγὴ γίνεται , ἰδοὺ ὁ νυμφίος . Theophyl.)  τῷ χρ . is not in constructive apposition with ἑνὶ ἀνδρί , but explains and fixes it: the emphasis being on παρθένον ἁγνήν .
