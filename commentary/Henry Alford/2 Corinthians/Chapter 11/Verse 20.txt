<p><strong> 20.</strong> ] <strong> for</strong> (proof that they could have no objection to so innocent a man as a <em> fool</em> , when they tolerated such noxious ones as are adduced) <strong> ye endure (them), if</strong> (as is the case) <strong> one brings you into slavery</strong> (the mere abstract act as regarded <em> them</em> , not the man’s own selfish view, being in the Apostle’s mind, the <em> active</em> , not the <em> middle</em> , is used. Thucyd. iii. 70, uses the active similarly: λέγοντες τοὺς Ἀθηναίους τὴν Κέρκυραν καταδουλοῦν . But the enslaving understood, is <em> to the man himself</em> , not to the <em> law</em> : see ref. Gal.), <strong> if one devours you</strong> (by exaction on your property, see reff. Mk. L. So Hom. Od. γ . 315: μή τοι κατὰ πάντα φάγωσι κτήματα , and Plaut., Ter., and Quintil., in Wetstein), <strong> if one catches you</strong> (as with a snare, ref.: not, ‘ <em> takes from you</em> ’), <strong> if one uplifts himself</strong> (so freq. in Thucyd., e.g. vi. 11, χρὴ μὴ πρὸς τὰς τύχας τῶν ἐναντίων ἐπαίρεσθαι . See other examples in Wetst.), <strong> if one smites you on the face</strong> (in insult, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:24">1 Kings 22:24</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:39">Matthew 5:39</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:64">Luke 22:64</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:2">Acts 23:2</span> . This is put as the climax of forbearance. “That such violence might literally be expected from the rulers of the early Christian society, is also implied in the command in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span> , that the ‘bishop’ is not to be ‘a striker.’ Even so late as the seventh century the council of Braga (c. 7), A.D. 675, orders that no bishop at his will and pleasure shall <em> strike</em> his clergy, lest he lose the respect which they owe him.” Stanley).</p>
