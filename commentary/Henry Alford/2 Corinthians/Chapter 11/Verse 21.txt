<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] <strong> By way of disparagement</strong> ( κατ ʼ ἀτιμ ., so κατὰ ληΐην ἐκπλώσαντες , Herod, ii. 152; κατὰ θέαν ἧκεν , Thucyd. vi. 31) <strong> I assume that</strong> ( ὡς ὅτι , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19">2 Corinthians 5:19</span> , note, does not positively state a fact, but assumes one, or states the import of a saying) WE (emphatic) <strong> were weak</strong> (when we were among you). An ironical reminiscence of his own abstinence when among them from all these acts of self-exaltation at their expense, q. d. (ironically), ‘I feel that I am much letting myself down by the confession that <em> I</em> was too weak ever to do any of these things among you.’ This I believe with Schrader, De Wette, and Meyer, to be the only satisfactory rendering. See also Stanley. Most expositors (1) refer λέγω back to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:20">2 Corinthians 11:20</span> , ‘ <em> I say it’ ‘I speak</em> ,’ as E. V. So Chrys., Theophyl., Theodoret, Pelag., Erasm., Calv., al. (Chrys. remarks on ὡς ὅτι , ἀσαφὲς τὸ εἰρημένον . ἐπειδὴ γὰρ φορτικὸν ἦν , διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως αὐτὸ τέθεικεν , ἵνα κλέψῃ τὴν ἐπάχθειαν τῇ ἀσαφείᾳ ,. p. 609), and (2) understand κατὰ ἀτιμ , ‘to <em> your shame</em> ,’ and (3) ὡς ὅτι , ‘ <em> as though</em> .’ But (1) can hardly be, seeing that λέγω below and λαλῶ 2Co 11:23 have a forward reference: (2) would require ὑμῶν , and even then would be exceedingly harsh, cf. the similar meaning <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:34">1 Corinthians 15:34</span> , where we have πρὸς ἐντροπὴν ὑμῖν λαλῶ : and (3) it may be doubted whether ὡς ὅτι ever can mean ‘ <em> as though</em> ,’ even in ref. 2 Thess., where Winer. edn, 6, § 65. 9 (see German edn.), renders it by <em> mie baß</em> : it is pleonastic, answering to our expression ‘ <em> how that</em> ’ ‘I told him, how that’ … Winer, in a <em> former edition</em> , instances the use of <em> wie daß</em> in a somewhat similar way: <em> wie daß ich gehort habe</em> , … where either <em> wie</em> or <em> daß</em> would be enough. Besides the instances given on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19">2 Corinthians 5:19</span> , Meyer quotes from Dion. Hal. ix. (with no further ref.) ἐπιγνούς , ὡς ὅτι ἐν ἐσχάτοις εἰσὶν οἱ κατακλεισθέντες .

<p><strong> ἐν ᾧ δ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἄν</strong> ] <strong> But in whatsoever matter any one</strong> (the τις of 2Co 11:20 ) <strong> is bold</strong> (the ἄν signifies habit, recurrence: so Soph. Philoct. 290, ταῦτ ʼ ἂν ἐξέρπων τάλας ἐμηχανώμην · εἶτα πῦρ ἂν οὐ παρῆν , and Eur. Phœn. 412, ποτὲ μὲν ἐπ ʼ ἦμαρ εἶχον , εἶτ ʼ οὐκ εἶχον ἄν where see Porson). Throughout this passage, compare by all means Stanley’s interesting notes.
