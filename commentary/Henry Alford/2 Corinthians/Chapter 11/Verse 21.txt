 21. ]  By way of disparagement ( κατ ʼ ἀτιμ ., so κατὰ ληΐην ἐκπλώσαντες , Herod, ii. 152; κατὰ θέαν ἧκεν , Thucyd. vi. 31)  I assume that ( ὡς ὅτι , see ch. 2 Corinthians 5:19 , note, does not positively state a fact, but assumes one, or states the import of a saying) WE (emphatic)  were weak (when we were among you). An ironical reminiscence of his own abstinence when among them from all these acts of self-exaltation at their expense, q. d. (ironically), ‘I feel that I am much letting myself down by the confession that  I was too weak ever to do any of these things among you.’ This I believe with Schrader, De Wette, and Meyer, to be the only satisfactory rendering. See also Stanley. Most expositors (1) refer λέγω back to 2 Corinthians 11:20 , ‘  I say it’ ‘I speak ,’ as E. V. So Chrys., Theophyl., Theodoret, Pelag., Erasm., Calv., al. (Chrys. remarks on ὡς ὅτι , ἀσαφὲς τὸ εἰρημένον . ἐπειδὴ γὰρ φορτικὸν ἦν , διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως αὐτὸ τέθεικεν , ἵνα κλέψῃ τὴν ἐπάχθειαν τῇ ἀσαφείᾳ ,. p. 609), and (2) understand κατὰ ἀτιμ , ‘to  your shame ,’ and (3) ὡς ὅτι , ‘  as though .’ But (1) can hardly be, seeing that λέγω below and λαλῶ 2Co 11:23 have a forward reference: (2) would require ὑμῶν , and even then would be exceedingly harsh, cf. the similar meaning 1 Corinthians 15:34 , where we have πρὸς ἐντροπὴν ὑμῖν λαλῶ : and (3) it may be doubted whether ὡς ὅτι ever can mean ‘  as though ,’ even in ref. 2 Thess., where Winer. edn, 6, § 65. 9 (see German edn.), renders it by  mie baß : it is pleonastic, answering to our expression ‘  how that ’ ‘I told him, how that’ … Winer, in a  former edition , instances the use of  wie daß in a somewhat similar way:  wie daß ich gehort habe , … where either  wie or  daß would be enough. Besides the instances given on ch. 2 Corinthians 5:19 , Meyer quotes from Dion. Hal. ix. (with no further ref.) ἐπιγνούς , ὡς ὅτι ἐν ἐσχάτοις εἰσὶν οἱ κατακλεισθέντες .
	 ἐν ᾧ δ  ʼ   ἄν ]  But in whatsoever matter any one (the τις of 2Co 11:20 )  is bold (the ἄν signifies habit, recurrence: so Soph. Philoct. 290, ταῦτ ʼ ἂν ἐξέρπων τάλας ἐμηχανώμην · εἶτα πῦρ ἂν οὐ παρῆν , and Eur. Phœn. 412, ποτὲ μὲν ἐπ ʼ ἦμαρ εἶχον , εἶτ ʼ οὐκ εἶχον ἄν where see Porson). Throughout this passage, compare by all means Stanley’s interesting notes.
