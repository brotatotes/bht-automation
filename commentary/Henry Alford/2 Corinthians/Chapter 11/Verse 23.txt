<b> 23.]</b> Meyer remarks, that all three points of Judaistic comparison, of so little real consequence in the matter, were dismissed with the short and contemptuous.<b> so am I.</b> But that is not enough, now that we are come to the<i> great</i> point of comparison; the consciousness of his real standing, and their nullity as ministers of Christ, requires the<b> I am more,</b> and the holy earnestness of this consciousness pours. itself forth as a stream over the adversaries, so as to overwhelm their conceited aspirations to apostolic dignity.<br><br><b> I speak as beside myself] I say it as a madman.</b> This is far stronger than “<i>I speak in foolishness</i>:” it is said from a deep sense of his own unworthiness, and conscious how utterly untrue was “I<i> am more</i>,” in any boasting sense. He therefore repudiates it even more strongly than the “<i>I am bold also</i>,” before. The assertion,<b> I am more,</b> must not be misunderstood. He<i> concedes</i> to them their being<i> ministers of Christ,</i> and assumes (as it were<i> in madness</i>) for himself, something more, if more abundant labours and sufferings are to be any criterion of the matter. That this is the sense, is obvious from the comparison being in the<i> amount</i> of labours and sufferings,—and not, that he denies to them the office of<i> ministers</i><i> of Christ,</i> and merely puts it hypothetically: “Well, then, if<i> they</i> are to be considered ministers of Christ,<i> I</i> must be something more.” If so, the comparison would not be in the<i> degree</i> of ministerial self-sacrifice, but in the<i> credentials of the ministry itself.</i><i> Both</i> are now assumed. to be ministers; but if so, Paul is a minister in a much higher degree, more faithful, more self-denying, richer in gifts and divine tokens, than they.<br><br><b> in</b> (the matter of: or,<b> by</b>, by virtue of)<b> labours</b> (occurring)<b> more abundantly,—in prisons</b> (imprisonments)<b> more abundantly</b> (but<i> one</i> such is mentioned in the Acts [xvi. 23 ff.] previous to the writing of this Epistle—Clement, in the celebrated passage of his Ast Epistle to the Corinthians on the labours of Paul, describes him as<i> having seven times borne chains.</i> This whole catalogue should shew the chronologists of the Apostle’s life and epistles, how exceedingly unsafe it is to build<i> only</i> on the history in the Acts for a complete account of his journeys and voyages),<b> in stripes above measure</b> (particularized below),<b> in deaths oft</b> (see reff. and ch. iv. 10.
