<b>thrice was I beaten with rods</b> (viz. by the Roman magistrates, see Acts xvi. 22, 23, which is the only occasion mentioned in the Acts),<b> once was I stoned</b> (Acts xiv. 19),<b> thrice I suffered shipwreck</b> (not one of these shipwrecks is known to us. Thus we see that perhaps three, perhaps two, voyages of Paul, but certainly one,â€”previous to this time, must be somewhere inserted in the history of the Acts),<b> a night and day have I spent in the deep</b> (i. e. the sea: probably on some remnant of a wreck after one of his shipwrecks alone or with others).
