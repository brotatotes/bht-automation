 30. ] partly refers back to what has passed since 2 Corinthians 11:23 . The ἀσθένεια not being that mentioned in a different connexion in 2 Corinthians 11:29 , but that of 2 Corinthians 11:21 , to which all since has applied. But the words are not without a forward reference likewise. He will boast of his weaknesses of ( τὰ τῆς ἀσθ .)  those things which made him appear mean and contemptible in the eyes of his adversaries. He is about to adduce an instance of escape from danger, of which this is eminently the case: he might be scoffed at as ὁ σαργανοφόρητος , or the like but he is carried on in his fervency of self-renunciation amidst his apparent self-celebration, and he will even cast before his enemies the  contemptible antecedents of his career, boasting in being despised, if only for what Christ had done in him. The asseveration in 2Co 11:31  may be applied to the whole, but I had rather view it as connected with the strange history about to be related: ‘I will glory in my weaknesses yea, and I will yet more abase myself God knows that I am telling sober truth &c.’ If the solemnity of the asseveration seem out of proportion to the incident, the fervid and impassioned character of the whole passage must be taken into account. It will be seen that I differ from all Commentators here, and cannot but think that they have missed the connexion. Meyer supposes that 2Co 11:32-33 were only  the beginning of a catalogue of his escapes , which he breaks off at ch. 2 Corinthians 12:1 ; and that the asseveration was meant to apply to the whole catalogue: but surely this is very unnatural.
