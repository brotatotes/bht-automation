<p><strong> 32.</strong> ] <strong> ἐν Δαμ</strong> . followed by Δαμασκηνῶν is pleonastic, but the pleonasm is common enough, especially when for any reason, our words are more than usually precise and formal.

<p><strong> ἐθνάρχης</strong> ] <strong> Prefect</strong> , or <strong> governor</strong> , stationed there by the Arabian king. The title appears to have been variously used. The High Priest Simon, as a vassal of Syria, is so named in reff. 1 Macc., and Jos. Antt. xiii. 6. 7. It was bestowed by Augustus on Archelaus after his father’s death, Jos. Antt. xvii. 11. 4; B. J. ii. 6. 3. The presidents of the seven districts into which Egypt was divided under the Romans, bore it (Strabo, xvii. 798): as did a petty prince of the Bosporus under Augustus (Lucian, Macrob. 17). Also the chief magistrates of the Jews living under their own laws in foreign states had this title (Jos. Antt. xiv. 7. 2; xiv. 8. 5. B. J. vii. 6. 3). But apparently it must here be taken in its wider sense, and not in this latter: for the mere <em> chief magistrate of the Jews</em> would not have had the power of guarding the city. Doubtless he was <em> incited</em> by the Jews, who would represent Paul as a malefactor.
