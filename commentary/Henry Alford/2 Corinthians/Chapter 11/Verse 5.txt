<b>For I reckon that in no respect do I fall short of</b> (literally,<i> have I fallen short of</i>)<b> these overmuch apostles</b>. This expression has very commonly been taken to mean<i> bona fide ‘the greatest Apostles,</i> i.e. Peter, James, and John, or perhaps<i> the Twelve:</i> but (1) this hardly seems to suit the expression<b> overmuch</b>, in which I cannot help seeing some bitterness: (2) it would be alien from the spirit of the passage, in which he institutes no comparison whatever between himself and<i> the other Apostles,</i> but only between himself and the false teachers: (3) had any such comparison been here intended, the point of comparison would not have been,<i> personal eminence in fruits of apostolic work and sufferings,</i> still less, seeing that the other Apostles were unlearned also, the distinction which immediately follows, between a “<i>common man,</i>” and one pretending to more skill,—but priority of arrival and teaching in Corinth: (4) the expression “<i>false Apostles,</i>” ver. 18, seems to me to refer to, and give the plain sense ot, this ironical designation of “<i>overmuch Apostles</i>:” (5) the same expression ch. xii. 11 appears even more plainly than here to require this explanation. It has been the practice of Protestant Commentators to adduce this verse against the primacy of Peter, and of the Romanists, to evade the inference by supposing the pre-eminence to be only in gifts and preaching, not in power and jurisdiction. All this will fall to the ground with the supposed reference to the other Apostles.
