<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] Explains that, <em> though in one particular he may fall short of them</em> , viz. in <em> rhetorical finish</em> and <em> word-wisdom</em> , yet <em> in real knowledge, not so</em> .

<p><strong> ἰδιώτης</strong> ] <strong> a laic</strong> , a man not professionally acquainted with that which he undertakes, see reff. The Apostle disclaims mere rhetorical aptitude and power in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1">1 Corinthians 2:1</span> ff.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀλλά</strong> brings out the contrast, see reff.: εἴ τοι σύ γε σεωϋτοῦ μὴ προορᾷς , ἀλλ ʼ ἡμῖν τοῦτό ἐστι οὐ περιοπτέον , Herod. 11:39.

<p><strong> ἀλλ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἐν παντί</strong> ] <strong> But in every matter we made things manifest</strong> (i.e. <em> the things of the gospel</em> , thereby shewing our γνῶσις ; not, τὴν γνῶσιν . Meyer and De W. suppose φανερώσαντες to have been a gloss for φανερωθέντες , especially as it is followed in some mss. by ἑαυτούς , and to have been the more readily received into the text, because it might easily be taken with γνῶσιν . But how improbable that the easy φανερωθέντες should have been replaced by the harsh - σαντες . Much rather would the latter be replaced by φανερωθέντες from ch. 2Co 5:11 ) <strong> before all men</strong> ( ἐν πᾶσιν , being separated from ἐν παντί by the verb, cannot be coupled with it, as in ref. Phil., but must mean <em> among all</em> ) <strong> unto you</strong> (i.e. with a view to your benefit: not = ‘ <em> to you</em> ,’ in which sense the <em> dative</em> is always found after φανερόω : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:21">Romans 3:21</span> , πεφανέρωται … εἰς πάντας κ . ἐπὶ πάντας .…).</p>
