 8. ] The ‘  other churches ’ were the Macedonian, cf. 2 Corinthians 11:9 . Among them the Philippians were probably conspicuous, retaining as doubtless they did, their former affection to him; see Philippians 4:15-16 .

	 κατενάρκησα ] apparently = κατεβάρησα , ch. 2 Corinthians 12:16 . Hesych [16] interprets it ἐβάρυνα . Jerome, Ep. cxxi. (cli.) ad Algasiam, quæst. 10, vol. i. p. 879, says, ‘multa sunt verba, quibus juxta morem urbis et provinciæ suæ familiarius Apostolus utitur: e quibus ex. gr. pauca ponenda sunt … Et, οὐ κατενάρκησα ὑμᾶς , hoc est, non gravavi vos … quibus et aliis multis usque hodie utuntur Cilices.’ Theophylact and Œcum. mention a rendering, οὐκ ἠμέλησα , ἢ ῥᾳθυμοτέρως πρὸς τὸ κήρυγμα γέγονα : and Beza, following the etymology; interprets οὐκ ἐνάρκησα κατ ʼ οὐδενός , ‘  cum cujusquam incommodo .’ But the former meaning suits the context better. The word is found no where else in Greek. ἀποναρκάω occurs in Plutarch, de Liber. Educatione, p. 8, F (Wetst.), ἀποναρκῶσι κ . φρίττουσι πρὸς τοὺς πόνους . On the government of the genitive by verbs compounded with κατά , see Matthiæ, § 376.
