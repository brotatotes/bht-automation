<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] <strong> I am</strong> BECOME (the emphasis on γέγονα , I am verily <em> become</em> a fool, viz. by this boasting, which I have now concluded. ‘Receptui canit:’ Bengel. But it is still ironical, spoken from the situation of his adversaries) <strong> a fool: ye compelled me</strong> ( ὑμεῖς emphatic). <strong> For I</strong> ( ἐγώ also emphatic, but more with reference to what has passed: ‘ <em> ye compelled me</em> , it was no doing of <em> mine</em> , for <em> I</em> &amp;c.’ The meaning is not, as De W., “ <em> I</em> , not mine adversaries,” who are an element foreign to the present sentence) <strong> ought to have been recommended by you</strong> (emphatic, by <em> you, not by himself</em> ): <strong> for I was nothing behind</strong> (when I was with you) <strong> these overmuch Apostles</strong> (see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:5">2 Corinthians 11:5</span> ; but here even more plainly than there, the expression cannot be applied to the other Apostles, seeing that the aor. would in that case be inconsistent with the fact the Corinthians never having had an opportunity of comparing him with them), <strong> even though I am nothing</strong> (see similar expressions of humility, 1Co 15:9-11 ).</p>
