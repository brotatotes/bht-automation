<b> 14.]</b> The words must,<i> from the context,</i> mean,<b> the third time I am ready to come,</b> i.e. ‘I am ready to<i> come the third time</i>;’—not, ‘<i>I am the third time ready to come</i>,’ i.e. ‘this is the third time that I have been<i> ready to come</i> to you.” This latter meaning has been “adopted by many Commentators, in order to evade the difficulty of supposing St. Paul to have been before this time at Corinth. But on this see Introd. to 1 Cor.§y. Here, the context has absolutely nothing to do with his<i> third preparation</i> to come, which would be a new element, requiring some explanation, as in 1 Thess. ii. 18. The natural, and I am persuaded, only true inference from the words here is, ‘I am coming to you a third time,—and I will not burden you this time, any more than I did at<i> my two previous visits.</i>’—Our business in such cases is, not to wrest plain words to fit our preconceived chronology, but to adapt our<i> confessedly most uncertain and imperfect history of the Apostle’s life,</i> to the data furnished by the plain honest sense of his Epistles.
