 18. ]  παρεκάλεσα , scil. ‘  to go to you :’ see reff. This journey of Titus cannot, of course, be the one spoken of ch. 2Co 8:6 ; 2 Corinthians 8:17 ; 2 Corinthians 8:22 ; 2 Corinthians 8:24 ; but some previous mission to them before this Epistle was written: probably that from which he returned with the report of their penitence to Paul in Macedonia, ch. 2 Corinthians 7:6 ff. We certainly have not elsewhere any hint of ὁ ἀδελφός having accompanied him on this journey: but this is no reason why it should not have been so.
	 τὸν ἀδελφόν perhaps, one of the two mentioned ch. 2 Corinthians 8:18 ; 2 Corinthians 8:22 ; some other, well known to the Corinthians, but absolutely unknown to us: but not,  a brother , as in E. V. It is plain from this and from what follows, that this brother was quite subordinate to Titus in the mission.
	 τῷ αὐτῷ πνεύμ .] dat. of the  manner ; see ref. The Spirit in which they walked was the  Holy Spirit : τῷ αὐτῷ πνευματικῷ χαρίσματι · χάρισμα γὰρ καλεῖ τὸ στενούμενον μὴ λαβεῖν , Theophyl.
	 τοῖς αὐτ  .   ἴχν .]  in the same footsteps , viz. each as the other: οὐδὲ μικρόν , φησί , παρεξῆλθον τὴν ἐμὴν ὁδόν , Theophyl. The dative ἴχνεσιν , as in ref.=  ἐν ἴχνεσιν : see also Acts 14:16 ; Jude 1:11 . Meyer cites Pind. Pyth. 2 Corinthians 12:20 , ἐμβέβακεν ἴχνεσιν πατρός , and Nem. vi. 27, ἴχνεσιν ἐν Πραξιδάμαντος ἑὸν πόδα νέμων . Cf. also Philo de Caritate, § 2, vol. ii. p. 385, τοῖς αὐτοῖς ἴχνεσιν ἐπακολουθῆσαι .
