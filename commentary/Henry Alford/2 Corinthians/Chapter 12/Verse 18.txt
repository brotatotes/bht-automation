<b> 18.]</b> This journey ot Titus cannot, of course, be the one spoken of ch, viii. 6, 17, 22; but some previous mission to them before this Epistle was written: probably that from which he returned with the report of their penitence to Paul in Macedonia, ch. vii. 6 ff. We certainly have not elsewhere any hint of “<i>the brother</i>” having accompanied him on this journey: but this is no reason why it should not have been so.<br><br><b> our brother</b>—perhaps one of the two mentioned ch. viii. 18, 22: some other, well known to the Corinthians, but absolutely unknown to us: but not ‘<i>a brother</i>, as in A.V. It is plain from this and from what follows, that this brother was quite subordinate to Titus in the mission.<br><br><b> in the same spirit]</b> The Spirit in which they walked was<i> the Holy Spirit.</i><br><br><b> in the same footsteps,</b> viz. each as the other: they did not in the minutest particular deviate from my path.
