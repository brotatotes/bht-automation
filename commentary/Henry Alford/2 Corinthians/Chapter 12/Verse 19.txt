<p><strong> 19.</strong> ] <strong> πάλαι</strong> was misunderstood, and πάλιν appears to have been a conjectural emendation, from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:1">2 Corinthians 3:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:12">2 Corinthians 5:12</span> . <strong> πάλαι</strong> does not suit the <em> interrogative</em> form of the sentence, which would throw it out into too strong emphasis. Lachmann, Tischdf. (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:0">Exodus 7:0</span> [and 8]), Meyer, De Wette read it as in text: <strong> Ye have been some time imagining</strong> (i.e. during this my self-defence) <strong> that it is to you that I am defending myself</strong> . Then the answer follows: the assumption being made, and elliptically answered, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:16">2 Corinthians 12:16</span> .

<p><strong> κατ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θεοῦ</strong> is emphatic, and opposed to ὑμῖν .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν χρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λαλοῦμεν</strong> , as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span> , which see.

<p><strong> τὰ δὲ πάντα</strong> ] supply either λαλοῦμεν , or better understand τὰ πάντα <em> as ‘all our things</em> ’ ( 1Co 16:14 ), i.e. our words and deeds, and supply γίνεται , as there. Grot., Gries-bach, Scholz, and Olsh., would read τάδε πάντα , and join with λαλοῦμεν . But (1) Paul never uses the pronoun ὅδε ; and (2) if he did, it must apply to what follows, not to what has preceded.

<p>The insertion of the personal pronoun between the article and the noun, as in <strong> τῆς ὑμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οἰκοδομῆς</strong> , occurs, as A. Buttmann has correctly remarked (see Moulton’s Winer, p. 193, note 4), in Paul only (see reff.), and with no other pronoun than ὑμῶν .</p>
