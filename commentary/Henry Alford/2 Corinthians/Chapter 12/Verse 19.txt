 19. ]  πάλαι was misunderstood, and πάλιν appears to have been a conjectural emendation, from ch. 2 Corinthians 3:1 ; 2 Corinthians 5:12 .  πάλαι does not suit the  interrogative form of the sentence, which would throw it out into too strong emphasis. Lachmann, Tischdf. (Exodus 7:0 [and 8]), Meyer, De Wette read it as in text:  Ye have been some time imagining (i.e. during this my self-defence)  that it is to you that I am defending myself . Then the answer follows: the assumption being made, and elliptically answered, as in 2 Corinthians 12:16 .
	 κατ  .   θεοῦ is emphatic, and opposed to ὑμῖν .
	 ἐν χρ  .   λαλοῦμεν , as in ch. 2 Corinthians 2:17 , which see.
	 τὰ δὲ πάντα ] supply either λαλοῦμεν , or better understand τὰ πάντα  as ‘all our things ’ ( 1Co 16:14 ), i.e. our words and deeds, and supply γίνεται , as there. Grot., Gries-bach, Scholz, and Olsh., would read τάδε πάντα , and join with λαλοῦμεν . But (1) Paul never uses the pronoun ὅδε ; and (2) if he did, it must apply to what follows, not to what has preceded.
	The insertion of the personal pronoun between the article and the noun, as in  τῆς ὑμ  .   οἰκοδομῆς , occurs, as A. Buttmann has correctly remarked (see Moulton’s Winer, p. 193, note 4), in Paul only (see reff.), and with no other pronoun than ὑμῶν .
