<b> 2.] I know</b> (not,<i> ‘knew</i>,’ as A.V.: which is a mistake in grammar, and introduces serious confusion, making it seem as if the fourteen years ago were the date of the<i> knowledge</i>, not, as it really is, of the<i> vision</i>)<b> a man in Christ</b> (i. e., ‘a Christian” ‘a man whose standing is in Christ; so in Rom. xvi. 7),<b> fourteen years ago</b> (the<i> date</i> refers entirely to the event about to be narrated, and probably refers back to the time when he was at Tarsus waiting for God to point out his work, between Acts ix. 30 and xi. 25. See the chronological table in the introduction to the Acts),<b> whether in the body, I know not; or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth</b> (if<i> in the body,</i> the idea would be that he was taken up<i> bodily</i>: if<i> out of the body</i>, to which the alternative manifestly inclines,—that his spirit was rapt from the body, and taken up disembodied);<b> such an one</b> (so ‘<b>such an one</b>’<i> resumes</i> after a parenthesis, 1 Cor. v. 5)<b> caught up</b> (snatched or taken up)<b> as far as the third heaven.</b>—<i>What is the third heaven?</i> The Jews knew no such limit of number, but commonly recognized<i> seven</i> heavens: and if their arrangement is to be followed, the third heaven will be very low in the celestial scale, being only the<i> material clouds.</i> The safest explanation is,<i> not to follow any fixed division</i>, but judging by the evident intention of the expression, to understand<i> a high degree</i> of celestial exaltation.
