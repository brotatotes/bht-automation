V.: which [is a mistake in grammar, and] introduces serious confusion, making it seem as if the πρὸ ἐτῶν δεκατ . were the date of the <em> knowledge</em> , not, as it really is, of the <em> vision</em> ) <strong> a man in Christ</strong> ( ἐν χρ . belongs to ἄνθρ ., not to οἶδα as Beza; ἄνθ . ἐν χρ . = ‘a Christian,’ ‘a man whose standing is in Christ:’ so οἳ καὶ πρὸ ἐμοῦ γέγοναν ἐν χριστῷ , Rom 16:7 ), <strong> fourteen years ago</strong> (belongs not to οἶδα , nor to ἐν χρ . as Grot.: ‘hominem talem, qui per 14 annos Christo serviat;’ but to ἁρπαγέντα . On the <em> idiom</em> see reff., the <em> date</em> probably refers back to the time when he was at Tarsus waiting for God to point out his work, between <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:30">Acts 9:30</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:25">Acts 11:25</span> .

Aug [19] de genesi ad litteram xii. 2 5 (3 14), vol. iii. pp. 455 ff., discusses the matter at length, and concludes thus, ‘Proinde quod vidit raptus usque in tertium cœlum, quod etiam se scire confirmat, proprie vidit, non imaginaliter. Sed quia ipsa a corpore alienata utrum omnino mortuum corpus reliquerit, an secundum modum quendam viventis corporis ibi anima fuerit, sed mens ejus ad videnda vel audienda ineffabilia illius visionis arrepta sit, hoc incertum erat, ideo forsitan dixit, “sive in corpore sive extra corpus, nescio, Deus scit.” ’, And similarly Thom. Aq. and Estius: not, as Meyer thinks, making the alternative consist between <em> reality</em> and a <em> mere vision</em> , but between the <em> anima</em> , the <em> life</em> , being rapt out of the body, leaving it dead, and the <em> mens</em> , the <em> intelligence</em> or <em> spirit</em> , being rapt out of the body, leaving it ‘secundum modum quendam vivens’); <strong> such an one</strong> (so τὸν τοιοῦτον <em> resumes</em> after a parenthesis, 1Co 5:5 ), <strong> rapt</strong> (snatched or taken up, reff.) <strong> as far as the third heaven</strong> .

<p><em> What is the third heaven</em> ? The Jews knew no such number, but commonly (not universally: Rabbi Judah said, “Duo sunt cœli, Deu 10:14 ”) recognized <em> seven</em> heavens: and if their arrangement is to be followed, the third heaven will be very low in the celestial scale, being only the <em> material clouds</em> . That the threefold division into the <em> air</em> (nubi-ferum), the <em> sky</em> (astriferum), and the <em> heaven</em> (angeliferum), was in use among the Jews, Meyer regards as a <em> fiction</em> of Grotius. Certainly no Rabbinical authority is given for such a statement: but it is put forward confidently by Grotius, and since his time adopted without enquiry by many Commentators. It is uncertain whether the <em> sevenfold</em> division prevailed so early as the Apostle’s time: and at all events, as we must not invent Jewish divisions which never existed, so it seems rash to apply here, one about whose date we are not certain, and which does not suit the context: for to be rapt only to the clouds, even supposing 2Co 12:4 to relate a further <em> assumption</em> , would hardly be thus solemnly introduced, or the preposition ἕως used. The safest explanation therefore is, <em> not to follow any fixed division</em> , but judging by the evident intention of the expression, to understand a <em> high degree</em> of celestial exaltation. I cannot see any cogency in Meyer’s argument, that ‘the third heaven must have been an idea well known and previously defined among his readers,’ seeing that in such words as τρὶς μακάριος , &amp;c. it is manifestly inapplicable.</p>
