<b> 21. will humble me]</b> “There was nothing in which the Apostle more exulted than in the prosperous success of his preaching: nothing on the other hand by which he was made more sad and downcast than when he saw that he had laboured in vain.” Beza. That this<i> humbling</i>, and<i> not</i> that of<i> being obliged to punish</i>, is intended, seems evident: the exercise of judicial au-thority being no humiliation, but the con-trary, and humiliation being the natural result of want of'success.
