<b> 21. will humble me]</b> “There was nothing in which the Apostle more exulted than in the prosperous success of his preaching: nothing on the other hand by which he was made more sad and downcast than when he saw that he had laboured in vain.” Beza. That this<i> humbling</i>, and<i> not</i> that of<i> being obliged to punish</i>, is intended, seems evident: the exercise of judicial au-thority being no humiliation, but the con-trary, and humiliation being the natural result of want of'success.<br><br><b> my GOD</b> expresses the conviction that whatever hu-miliation God might have in store for him would be a part of His will respecting him.<br><br><b> I shall bewail]</b> Some explain it that he would have to punish them, and thus be afflicted over them: but<i> punishment</i> seems out of place in this verse, which expresses his fear lest he should be humbled for, and have to lament the case of the im-penitent,—and then, as he declares, ch. xiii. 2, be forced to proceed to discipline; but: this point is not yet introduced. “He shews the feeling of a true and genuine shepherd, when he says that he should have to grieve for the sins of others. Every shepherd ought thus to carry the church in his own soul, be affected by its diseases as by his own, grieve at its sorrows, mourn for its loss.” Calvin.<br><br><b> many of those]</b> Why many? why not<i> all</i>? I believe he<b> uses many of those which have sinned</b><i> as a mild expression for the many which have sinned</i>, and that we must not therefore press too closely the enquiry.
