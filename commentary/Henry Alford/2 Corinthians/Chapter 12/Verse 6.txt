 6. ]  For (supply the sentence for which γάρ renders a reason: ‘  Not but that I might boast concerning myself if I would ’)  if I shall wish to boast ὑπὲρ ἐμαυτοῦ ),  I shall not be a fool (I shall not act rashly or imprudently, for I shall not boast without solid ground for it):  for I shall speak the truth: but I abstain (reff.),  that no one may reckon of me (reff. and add εἰς μαλακίαν σκώπτων , Demosth. 308. 18)  beyond (by a standard superior to that furnished by)  what he sees me (to be),  or hears (if τι form part of the text,  or hears any thing : a pleonastic construction = ἢ εἴ τι ἀκούει )  from me . Lest he should seem to undervalue so legitimate a subject of boasting, he alleges the reason why he abstains: not that he had not this and more such exaltations, truly to allege: but because he wished to be judged of by what they really had seen and heard of and from himself in person.
