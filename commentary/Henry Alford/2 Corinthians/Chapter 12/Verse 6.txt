<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] <strong> For</strong> (supply the sentence for which γάρ renders a reason: ‘ <em> Not but that I might boast concerning myself if I would</em> ’) <strong> if I shall wish to boast</strong> ὑπὲρ ἐμαυτοῦ ), <strong> I shall not be a fool</strong> (I shall not act rashly or imprudently, for I shall not boast without solid ground for it): <strong> for I shall speak the truth: but I abstain</strong> (reff.), <strong> that no one may reckon of me</strong> (reff. and add εἰς μαλακίαν σκώπτων , Demosth. 308. 18) <strong> beyond</strong> (by a standard superior to that furnished by) <strong> what he sees me</strong> (to be), <strong> or hears</strong> (if τι form part of the text, <strong> or hears any thing</strong> : a pleonastic construction = ἢ εἴ τι ἀκούει ) <strong> from me</strong> . Lest he should seem to undervalue so legitimate a subject of boasting, he alleges the reason why he abstains: not that he had not this and more such exaltations, truly to allege: but because he wished to be judged of by what they really had seen and heard of and from himself in person.</p>
