 2 4. ]  An example of such a vision and revelation . The adoption of the third person is remarkable: it being evident from 2Co 12:7 that  he himself is meant. It is plain that a contrast is intended between the rapt and glorified person of 2 Corinthians 12:2 ; 2 Corinthians 12:4 , and  himself , the weak and afflicted and almost despairing subject of the σκόλοψ τῇ σαρκί of 2 Corinthians 12:7 ff. Such glory  belonged not to him , but the weakness did. Nay, so far was the glory from being  his , that he knew not whether he was in or out of the body when it was put upon him: so that the ἐγὼ αὐτός , compounded of the νοῦς and σάρξ ( Rom 7:25 ), clearly was not the subject of it, but as it were another form of his personality, analogous to that which we shall assume when unclothed of the body.
	It may be remarked in passing, as has been done by Whitby, that the Apostle here by implication  acknowledges the possibility of consciousness and receptivity in a disembodied state .
	Let it not be forgotten, that in the context, this vision is introduced not so much for the purpose of making it a ground of boasting, which he does only passingly and under protest, but  that he may by it introduce the mention of the  σκόλοψ τῇ σαρκί ,  which bore so conspicuous a part in his  ἀσθένειαι , TO BOAST OF WHICH  is his present object .
