<p><strong> 2 4.</strong> ] <em> An example of such a vision and revelation</em> . The adoption of the third person is remarkable: it being evident from 2Co 12:7 that <em> he himself</em> is meant. It is plain that a contrast is intended between the rapt and glorified person of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:2">2 Corinthians 12:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:4">2 Corinthians 12:4</span> , and <em> himself</em> , the weak and afflicted and almost despairing subject of the σκόλοψ τῇ σαρκί of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span> ff. Such glory <em> belonged not to him</em> , but the weakness did. Nay, so far was the glory from being <em> his</em> , that he knew not whether he was in or out of the body when it was put upon him: so that the ἐγὼ αὐτός , compounded of the νοῦς and σάρξ ( Rom 7:25 ), clearly was not the subject of it, but as it were another form of his personality, analogous to that which we shall assume when unclothed of the body.

<p>Let it not be forgotten, that in the context, this vision is introduced not so much for the purpose of making it a ground of boasting, which he does only passingly and under protest, but <em> that he may by it introduce the mention of the</em> <strong> σκόλοψ τῇ σαρκί</strong> , <em> which bore so conspicuous a part in his</em> <strong> ἀσθένειαι</strong> , TO BOAST OF WHICH <em> is his present object</em> .</p>
