<p><strong> 3, 4.</strong> ] <em> A solemn repetition of the foregoing, with the additional particular of his having had unspeakable revelations made to him</em> . Some, as Clem [20] Strom. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:12">2 Corinthians 12:12</span> (80), p. 693 P., Iren [21] ii. 30.7, p. 162, Athan. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+20:0">Revelation 20:0</span> , vol. i. p. 263, Orig [22] (or his interpreter) on Rom. xvi. lib. x. 43, vol. iv. p. 688, Œcum., al., think that this was a <em> fresh assumption</em> , ἕως τρίτου οὐρανοῦ κἀκεῖθεν εἰς τὸν παράδεισον , and with these Meyer agrees: but surely had this been intended, some intimation would have been given of it, either by καί , or by placing εἰς τὸν παράδεισον (as the stress would be then no longer on the fact ἁρπαγῆναι as before, but on the <em> new place to which</em> ἡρπάγη ) in the place of emphasis before ἡρπάγη ; or, by both combined, ὅτι καὶ εἰς τὸν παράδεισον ἡρπάγη . As it is, with the verb <em> preceding</em> in both clauses, and therefore no prominence given to the places as distinguished from one another, I must hold ἕως τρίτου οὐρ . to be at least so far equivalent to εἰς τὸν παράδεισον , as to be a general local description of the situation in which ὁ παράδεισος is found. The <em> repetition</em> of εἴτε … οἶδεν is equally accountable on either explanation, being made for solemnity and emphasis.

<p>The <strong> παράδεισος</strong> cannot here be the Jewish Paradise, the blissful division or side of Hades (Scheol), where the spirits of the just awaited the resurrection, see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:22">Luke 16:22</span> , but the Paradise of which our Lord spoke on the Cross, the place of happiness into which He at His Death introduced the spirits of the just: see on ref. Luke.

<p><strong> ἄῤῥητα ῥήματα</strong> , i.e. as explained below, <strong> words which it is not lawful to utter</strong> : as Vulg., “ <em> arcana verba, quæ non licet homini loqui</em> .” The interpretation, “ <em> quæ dici nequeunt</em> ,” as Beza, Estius, Calov., Olsh., al., is hardly consistent with the narrative; for in that case, as Bengel remarks, ‘Paulus non potuisset audire.’ The passages adduced by Wetst. mostly refer to the <em> mysteries</em> , or some secret rites: e.g. Demosth. contra Neæram, p.1369, αὕτη ἡ γυνὴ ὑμῖν ἔθυε τὰ ἄῤῥητα ἱερὰ ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως , καὶ εἶδεν , ἃ οὐ προσῆκεν αὐτὴν ὁρᾷν ξένην οὖσαν .

<p><strong> ἃ οὐκ ἐξόν</strong> ] <strong> which it is not lawful for a</strong> MAN <strong> to utter</strong> (see above): imparted by God, but not to be divulged to others: and therefore, in this case, intended, we may presume, for the Apostle’s own consolation and encouragement. <em> Of what kind</em> they were, on <em> by whom</em> uttered, we have no hint given, and it were worse than trifling to conjecture. “Sublimitatis certe magnæ fuere: nam non omnia cœlestia sunt ineffabilia, v. gr. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:6">Exodus 34:6</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:3">Isaiah 6:3</span> , quæ tamen valde sublimia.” Bengel.</p>
