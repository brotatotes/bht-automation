<b> 1.] This third time I am coming to you:</b> i.e. ‘<i>this is the third visit which I am now about to pay you.’</i> Had not chronological theories intervened, no one would ever have thought of any other rendering. The usual one,«This is the third time that I have been intending to come to you,’ introduces here, as also in ch, xii. 14, an element not only foreign to, but detrimental to, the purpose. The Apostle wishes to impress on them the<i> certainty</i> of this coming, and to prepare them for it by solemn self-examination; and in order to this, he (<i>on this interpreta-tion</i>) uses an expression which would only remind them of the charge of<i> lightness</i> which had been brought against him, and<i> tend to diminish the solemnity of the warning.</i> On St. Paul’s visits to Corinth, see Introd. to 1 Cor.§v.
