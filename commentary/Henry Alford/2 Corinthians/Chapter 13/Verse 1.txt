<b> 1.] This third time I am coming to you:</b> i.e. ‘<i>this is the third visit which I am now about to pay you.’</i> Had not chronological theories intervened, no one would ever have thought of any other rendering. The usual one,«This is the third time that I have been intending to come to you,’ introduces here, as also in ch, xii. 14, an element not only foreign to, but detrimental to, the purpose. The Apostle wishes to impress on them the<i> certainty</i> of this coming, and to prepare them for it by solemn self-examination; and in order to this, he (<i>on this interpreta-tion</i>) uses an expression which would only remind them of the charge of<i> lightness</i> which had been brought against him, and<i> tend to diminish the solemnity of the warning.</i> On St. Paul’s visits to Corinth, see Introd. to 1 Cor.§v.<br><br><b> In the mouth of, &c.]</b> i.e. ‘I will not now, as be-fore, be with you<i> in all long-suffering,</i> as regards the offenders: but will come to a regular process, and establish the truth in a legal manner.’—This explanation, however, has not been the usual one: Chrysostom, Calvin, and others, understanding the two or three witnesses, of St. Paul’s<i> two or three visits,</i> as establishing cither (1) the truth of the facts, or (2) the reality of his threats. But it is decisive against this interpretation, as Meyer remarks, that thus the sins committed<i> since the Apostle’s last visit</i> would remain altogether unnoticed.<br><br><b> and three,</b> not for “<i>or three,</i>”—<b>two</b> (and in cases where only two can be had)<b>, and three</b> (where so many can be obtained):<i> ‘two and three respectively.’</i><br><br><b> 11]</b> GENERAL EXHORTATIONS. “Paul had written severely: he now turns to a more kindly address, yet without forgetting his main subject.” Bengel.<br><br><b> rejoice</b>, viz.<i> in the Lord,</i> as Phil. iii. 1; iv. 4.
