 2. ]  I  have forewarned yon, and I now forewarn you, as (I did, προείρηκα )  when present the second time, so also (I do)  now ( προλέγω )  when absent . It certainly seems to me that this is the only natural way of taking the words. Grot., Est., Bengel, al., and De Wette, take ὡς παρὼν τὸ δεύτ . to mean, ‘  as if I were present the second time ,’ meaning  this next time . But is it possible that the Apostle should have written so confusedly, as to have said in the same sentence τρίτον τοῦτο ἔρχομαι , and ὡς παρὼν τὸ δεύτερον ,  both , according to these interpreters, with reference to the  same journey ? And would he not have even on such an hypothesis have said τὸ δεύτερον τοῦτο ? But if we render as above, the  προείρηκα (perf. because the warning yet endured in force) refers to his  second visit ( παρὼν τὸ δεύτ .), and the  προλέγω to his present condition of absence ( ἀπὼν νῦν ),  ὡς being  as (‘  I did ’ or ‘  do ,’ for it applies to both clauses), and  καί the simple copula.
