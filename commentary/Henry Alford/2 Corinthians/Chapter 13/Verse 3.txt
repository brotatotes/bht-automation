<p><strong> δοκιμὴν</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> χριστοῦ</strong> ] The genitive is either objective, <strong> a proof of Christ speaking in me</strong> , i.e. ‘that Christ speaks in me,’ or subjective, <strong> a proof given by Christ speaking in me</strong> ‘a token of my authority vouchsafed by Christ speaking in me.’ This latter meaning is more suited to what follows, where <em> Christ</em> becomes the <em> subject</em> . Such proof would be, the immediate execution, by divine power, of some punishment denounced by Paul’s word, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:11">Acts 13:11</span> .

<p><strong> δυνατεῖ</strong> , to answer to ἀσθενεῖ , refers both to gifts and miracles, and to the Power of Christ which He would exert in punishment; εἰς ὑμᾶς and ἐν ὑμῖν differ the εἱς being hypothetical, the ἐν , matter of fact. The assertion tends to remind them of the danger of provoking Christ, who spoke by Paul.</p>
