<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] <em> Confirmation of the foregoing</em> οὐκ ἀσθενεῖ , ἀλλὰ δυνατεῖ . The rec. text, καὶ γὰρ εἰ , would be quite beside the purpose, and would mean, ‘ <em> For even if He were crucified</em> ’, ‘for even putting the case that He was crucified:’ καὶ εἰ cannot he = εἰ καί , <em> though</em> , as in Vulg. ‘etsi,’ and E. V. Hartung, Partikellehre i. 139, shews that in καὶ εἰ , the climax belongs only to the hypothetical particle εἰ , not as in εἰ καί , to the fact presupposed: ‘ <em> even if</em> ,’ not ‘ <em> if even</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> although</em> .’ Examples of καὶ εἰ are Plato, Sympos. 185, καὶ ἐὰν τοῦτο ποιήσῃς ἅπαξ ἢ δίς , καὶ εἰ πάνυ ἰσχυρά ἐστι , παύσεται . Eur. Androm. 266, καὶ γὰρ εἰ πέριξ σ ʼ ἔχει τηκτὸς μόλυβδος , ἐξαναστήσω σ ʼ ἐγώ . Sappho, καὶ γὰρ αἰ φεύγει , ταχέως διώξει . See more in Hartung, l. c.

<p><strong> For he was even crucified</strong> (that καὶ γάρ always means ‘ <em> for</em> … <em> even</em> ’ …, or ‘ <em> for</em> … <em> also</em> ,’ and never simply ‘ <em> for</em> ,’ see Hartung, i. 137 f., where he has collected many examples, e.g.: Il. α . 63, καὶ γάρ τ ʼ ὄναρ ἐκ Διός ἐστιν , Herod. i. 77, καὶ γὰρ πρὸς τούτους αὐτῷ ἐπεποίητο συμμαχίη ) <strong> from</strong> (as the source, the conditional element, by which His crucifixion became possible) <strong> weakness, yet He lives by</strong> (source [of His life]) <strong> the Power of God</strong> (which raised Him from the dead, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span> ; Php 2:9 ). <strong> For we also are weak in Him</strong> (i.e. <em> in Him</em> , in our communion with and imitation of Christ, we, as He did, lay aside our power and spare you: we partake of His voluntary abnegation of power which we might have used. The context requires this explanation, and refutes that of Chrys., p. 644, τί ἐστιν , ἀσθ . ἐν αὐτῷ ; διωκόμεθα , ἐλαυνόμεθα , τὰ ἔσχατα πάσχομεν , so Theodoret, Theophyl., Grot., Estius, al.), <strong> but shall live</strong> (exercise our apostolic authority, in contrast to the ἀσθένεια above) <strong> with Him</strong> (as He now exercises His power in His glorified resurrection life) <strong> from</strong> (source) <strong> the power of God [with respect to you</strong> ( εἰς ὑμᾶς , if genuine, may belong either to δυνάμεως θεοῦ , = δυνάμ . θεοῦ <strong> τῆς</strong> εἰς ὑμᾶς , the art. being often omitted in such constructions, or to ζήσομεν , ‘ <em> we shall live with respect to you</em> ,’ which agrees better with the parallelism, but not so well with the arrangement of the sentence. The sense seems to require the <em> latter</em> interpretation, for the δύναμις θεοῦ <strong> εἰς ὑμ</strong> . would be rather the <em> result</em> , than the <em> source</em> of the apostolic energy indicated by ζήσομεν )]. I have taken ζήσομεν , as the context plainly requires, figuratively (see ref.): but many Commentators take it literally, of <em> the resurrection</em> : e.g. Grot. ‘vitam consequemur immortalem.’</p>
