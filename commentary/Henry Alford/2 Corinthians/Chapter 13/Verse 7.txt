 7. ] Yet he prays God rather that they may require no such demonstration of his apostolic power, even though he lose in reputation by it.
	 μὴ ποιῆς  .   ὑμ  .   κακ  .   μηδ .] Not, as Grot., al., ‘  that I may not have to inflict on you any evil ’ (an extraordinary rendering of κακὸν ποιεῖν ), but  that ye may do no evil , corresponding to  ἵνα ὑμεῖς τὸ καλὸν ποιῆτε below.
	 οὐχ ἵνα …] ‘And the purpose of this my prayer is not to gain any repute by your Christian graces, but that you may be highly endowed with them, and (if it so happen) we may be as of no repute (‘hominum scilicet judicio,’ Beza).’ That this is the sense, and that  δόκιμοι is not in this verse to be applied to  substantiation of power by punishment , is necessitated by the construction, it being plainly shewn by the infin. after εὐχόμ ., that ἵνα is not here meant to apply, even in part, to the  purport of the prayer (as in Colossians 1:9 ; 2 Thessalonians 1:11 ; see note on 1Co 14:13 ), but to its  purpose . And that being settled,  we pray … not in order that we may appear  δόκιμοι , it follows that the  appearing δόκιμοι would be a result of the  fulfilment of the prayer , viz. of your  doing no evil , and this it couid only be by their  doing no evil bringing credit on the Apostle’s ministry. It is not  for this end that we pray that you may do no evil, but  for your own good , even if that tend to the non-exercise, and so depreciation, of our apostolic power.
