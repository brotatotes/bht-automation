<b> 1.] this</b> refers to what follows: see reff.<br><br><b> not come again to you in sorrow]</b> This is the only fair rendering of the words; implying, that<i> some former visit had been in grief.</i> Clearly the first visit, Acts xviii. 1 ff., could not be thus described: we must therefore infer, that an<i> intermediate unrecorded visit</i> had been paid by him. On this subject, compare ch. xii. 14; xiii. 1 and notes: and see Introd. to 1 Cor.§v.<br><br><b> in sorrow</b> is explained in vv. 2, 3 to mean<b> in mutual grief.</b> ‘I grieving you (ver. 2), and you grieving me’ (ver. 3): not St. Paul’s grief alone, nor grief alone inflicted on them by St. Paul.
