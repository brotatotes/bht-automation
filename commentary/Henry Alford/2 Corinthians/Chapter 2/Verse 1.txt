 1. ]  δέ is merely transitional, and does not imply any contrast with what has preceded.
	 ἐμαυτῷ , not = παρ ʼ ἐμαυτῷ (as most Commentators and E. V.), but ‘dat. commodi,’  for my own sake , as is evident by the consideration in the next verse.
	 τοῦτο refers to what follows: see reff.
	 τὸ μὴ πάλιν ἐν λύπῃ πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐλθεῖν ]  not again to come to you in grief . This is the only fair rendering of the words; implying, that  some former visit had been in grief . Clearly the first visit Acts 18:1 ff., could not be thus described: we must therefore infer, that an  intermediate unrecorded visit had been paid by him. On this subject, compare ch. 2Co 12:14 ; 2Co 13:1 and notes: and see Prolegg. to 1 Cor. § v.
	 ἐν λύπῃ ] is explained in 2Co 2:2-3 to mean (so Estius, Bengel, Rückert, Olsh., De Wette, al.)  in mutual grief : ‘I grieving you ( 2Co 2:2 ), and you grieving me’ ( 2Co 2:3 ): not, as Chrys., al., Paul’s grief alone, nor, as Meyer, al., grief inflicted on them by Paul.
