<p><strong> 1.</strong> ] <strong> δέ</strong> is merely transitional, and does not imply any contrast with what has preceded.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐμαυτῷ</strong> , not = παρ ʼ ἐμαυτῷ (as most Commentators and E. V.), but ‘dat. commodi,’ <strong> for my own sake</strong> , as is evident by the consideration in the next verse.
	</p>
<p><strong> τοῦτο</strong> refers to what follows: see reff.
	</p>
<p><strong> τὸ μὴ πάλιν ἐν λύπῃ πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐλθεῖν</strong> ] <strong> not again to come to you in grief</strong> . This is the only fair rendering of the words; implying, that <em> some former visit had been in grief</em> . Clearly the first visit <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:1">Acts 18:1</span> ff., could not be thus described: we must therefore infer, that an <em> intermediate unrecorded visit</em> had been paid by him. On this subject, compare ch. 2Co 12:14 ; 2Co 13:1 and notes: and see Prolegg. to 1 Cor. § v.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν λύπῃ</strong> ] is explained in 2Co 2:2-3 to mean (so Estius, Bengel, Rückert, Olsh., De Wette, al.) <strong> in mutual grief</strong> : ‘I grieving you ( 2Co 2:2 ), and you grieving me’ ( 2Co 2:3 ): not, as Chrys., al., Paul’s grief alone, nor, as Meyer, al., grief inflicted on them by Paul.</p>
