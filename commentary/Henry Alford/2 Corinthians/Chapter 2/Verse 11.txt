<b> 11.]</b> follows out and explains “<i>for your sakes:</i>”—to<b> prevent Satan getting any advantage over us</b> (the Church generally: or better,<i> us Apostles</i>), in robbing us of some of our people,—viz., in causing the penitent offender to despair and full away from the faith. Chrysostom remarks, “The word<i> ‘advantage’</i> is used appropriately, in a case where Satan would be conquering us by our own weapons. For him to make a man his prey by means of<i> sin</i>, is his proper attribute: but not through<i> penitence</i>: the weapon is ours, not his.” The word has yet another propriety: the offender was to be delivered over to<i> Satan for the destruction of the flesh</i>—care must be taken lest we be overreached by Satan, and his<i> soul perish likewise.</i><br><br><b> his devices]</b> such devices,<i> as coming from him,</i> are special matters of observation and caution to every Christian minister; much more to him who had the care of all the churches. See 1 Pet. v. 8.—The personality and agency of the Adversary can hardly be recognized in plainer terms than in both these passages.
