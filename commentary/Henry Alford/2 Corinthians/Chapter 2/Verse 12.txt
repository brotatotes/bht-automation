<b> 12.]</b> To<i> Troas</i>, viz., on his journey from Ephesus, Acts xx. 1, 2; 1 Cor. xvi. 5–9.<br><br><b> for</b> (the purpose of preaching)<b> the gospel of Christ]</b> He had been before at Troas, but the vision of a Macedonian asking for help prevented his remaining there. He now revisited it, purposely to stay and preach. On his return to Asia he remained there seven days, Acts xx. 6–12.<br><br><b> and a door,</b>&c.<b>]</b><b> and an opportunity of apostolic action being afforded me.</b><br><br><b> in the Lord</b> defines the<i> sort</i> of action implied, and that to which the door was opened. It is remarkable that in speaking of this joy, though not of the same place, St. Paul uses this expression, 1 Cor. xvi. 9. Compare the interesting passage at Troas on his return from Europe the next spring, Acts xx. 6–13.
