<b> 14. leadeth us in triumph]</b><i> Two kinds of persons</i> were led in triumph: the<i> participators of the victory,</i> and the<i> victims of the defeat.</i> In Col. ii. 15, where only the same word is used in the original, the<i> latter</i> are plainly meant; here, according to many Commentators, the<i> former</i>: which however is never elsewhere the reference of the word, but it always implies<i> triumphing over.</i> The proud Cleopatra refused the terms offered her by Augustus, using this word, and saying, “<i>I will not be triumphed over</i>.” Meyer in consequence understands it in this sense here:<b> who ever triumphs over us,</b> i.e. “who ceases not to exhibit us, His former foes, as overcome by Him:’—and adds, “God<i> began</i> His triumph over them at their conversion:—over Paul at Damascus, where he made him a servant, from being an enemy. This triumph he ever continues, not ceasing to exhibit before the world these his former foes, by the results of their present service, as overcome by Him. This, in the case before us, was ffected by Paul, in that (as Titus brought him word to Macedonia) his Epistle had produced such good results in Corinth.” De Wette objects to this as a strange way of expressing thankfulness for deliverance from our anxiety. But<i> is it</i> so to those who look beneath the surface? In our spiritual course,<i> our only true triumphs</i> are<i> God’s</i> triumphs over us. His defeats of<i> us</i>, are<i> our only</i> real victories. I own that this yet appears to me to be the<i> only admissible rendering.</i> We must not violate the known usage of a word, and invent another for which there is no precedent, merely for the sake of imagined perspicuity. Such is that of ‘<i>causeth us to triumph,</i>” A.V., and some Commentators. See also the following context.<br><br><b> in Christ,</b> as usually,<b> in our connexion with,</b> ‘as members of” Christ: not ‘<i>by</i> Christ.’<br><br><b> the savour</b>, i.e. smell. The similitude is not that of a sacrifice, but still the same as before: during a triumph, sweet spices were thrown about or burnt in the streets. As the fact of the triumph, or approach of the triumphal procession, was made known by these odours far and wide, so God diffuses by our means, who are the materials of His triumph, the sweet odour of the knowledge of Christ (who is the Triumpher, Col. ii. 15).<br><br><b> of the knowledge]</b> genitive of apposition; the<i> odour</i>, which, in the interpretation of the figure,<i> is</i> the knowledge.<br><br><b> of him]</b> i.e. Christ: see next verse.
