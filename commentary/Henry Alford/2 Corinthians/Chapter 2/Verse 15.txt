<b> 15.]</b> Here the propriety of the figure is lost, and the source of the odour identified with the Apostles themselves.<b> For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ</b> (i. e. of that which was diffused by the odour, viz.<i> the knowledge of Christ.</i> Estius says, “As of some fragrant unguent of flowers or herbs, we diffuse among all, as a wholesome and sweet odour, the report of His name”),<b> among them that are being saved, and among them that are perishing,</b> “Whether men be saved, or whether they perish, the gospel continues to possess its own virtue, and we continue being that which we are; and as the light, though it blind the weak-eyed, is light, for all this darkening: and honey, though it be bitter to the sick, is sweet by nature: so the gospel is of sweet savour, even though some be perishing through disbelief of it.” Chrysostom and Theophylact.
