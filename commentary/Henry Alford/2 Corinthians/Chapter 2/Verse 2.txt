 2. ]  γάρ , reason why I would not come to you in grief: because I should have to grieve those who formed my proper material for thankfulness and joy.
	 ἐγώ has a peculiar emphasis: ‘If  I cause you grief’.… implying, ‘there are who cause you sufficient.’
	 καί prefixed to a question denotes  inconsequence on , or  inconsistency with , the foregoing supposition or affirmation: so Eur. Med. 1388, ὦ τέκνα φίλτατα ! “ μητρί γε , σοὶ δ ʼ οὔ .” κἄπειτ ʼ ἔκτας ; see other examples in Hartung, Partikellehre, i. p. 147. It is best expressed in English by ‘  then :’  who is he then , &c. as in E. V.
	The explanation of Chrys., who has been followed by Erasm., Bengel, Olsh., al., is curious, and certainly inconsistent with the context: εἰ καὶ λυπῶ ὑμᾶς , χάριν μοι παρέχετε κἀν τούτῳ μεγίστην , ὅτι δάκνεσθε ὑπὸ τῶν παρ ʼ ἐμοῦ λεγομένων . Hom. iv. p. 456. Some of these Commentators refer the  singular to the offender, 2 Corinthians 2:5-8 . But however the words may  bear the meaning, and however  true the saying might be, it is pretty clear that it would be beside the subject: nay, would give a reason the other way, why he  should come to them.
