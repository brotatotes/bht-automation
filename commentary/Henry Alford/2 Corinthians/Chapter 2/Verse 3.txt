 3. ]  ἔγραψα τοῦτο αὐτό ,  I put in writing this same thing , viz. the τοῦτο which I ἔκρινα , 2 Corinthians 2:1 ; the announcement of my change of purpose in 1 Corinthians 16:7 , which had occasioned the charge of fickleness against him. The theories of Commentators have given rise to various interpretations of τοῦτο αὐτό : Chrys. understands,  ch. 2Co 12:21  of this same Epistle : Beza, Meyer, al.,  my blame of you in the first Epistle : so Estius, especially 1 Corinthians 4:19 ; 1 Corinthians 4:21 : Bleek supposes  a lost Epistle to be referred to: De Wette wavers, but is disposed with Erasm., Rückert, al., to render αὐτὸ τοῦτο ‘  on this account ,’ as Plato, Protag. p. 310, ἀλλ ʼ αὐτὰ ταῦτα καὶ νῦν ἥκω : but Meyer rejoins, that this idiom is foreign to the style of Paul. I imagine that  two meanings are open to us: (1) as above,  the announcement which caused the charge of fickleness: (2)  the reproaches in the 1  st Epistle which grieved them. Of these, specious as is the latter on account of the following context, I prefer the former because of the τοῦτο in 2 Corinthians 2:1 .
	 ἀφ  ʼ   ὧν , ellipt. for ἀπὸ τούτων , ἀφ ʼ ὧν , see reff.
	 πεποιθὼς  .… ]  having trust in (reposing trust on)  you all, that my joy is (the pres. expressing the purport of the trust when felt)  that of all of you : i.e. trusting that you too would feel that there was sufficient reason for the postponement, if it interfered with cur mutual joy. Meyer well observes, that  πάντας ὑμᾶς , in spite of the existence of an anti-pauline faction in the Corinthian church, is a true example of the love which πάντα πιστεύει , πάντα ἐλπίζει , 1 Corinthians 13:7 .
