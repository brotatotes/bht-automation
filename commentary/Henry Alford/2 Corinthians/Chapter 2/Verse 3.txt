<p><strong> 3.</strong> ] <strong> ἔγραψα τοῦτο αὐτό</strong> , <strong> I put in writing this same thing</strong> , viz. the τοῦτο which I ἔκρινα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:1">2 Corinthians 2:1</span> ; the announcement of my change of purpose in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:7">1 Corinthians 16:7</span> , which had occasioned the charge of fickleness against him. The theories of Commentators have given rise to various interpretations of τοῦτο αὐτό : Chrys. understands, <em> ch.</em> 2Co 12:21 <em> of this same Epistle</em> : Beza, Meyer, al., <em> my blame of you in the first Epistle</em> : so Estius, especially <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:19">1 Corinthians 4:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:21">1 Corinthians 4:21</span> : Bleek supposes <em> a lost Epistle</em> to be referred to: De Wette wavers, but is disposed with Erasm., Rückert, al., to render αὐτὸ τοῦτο ‘ <em> on this account</em> ,’ as Plato, Protag. p. 310, ἀλλ ʼ αὐτὰ ταῦτα καὶ νῦν ἥκω : but Meyer rejoins, that this idiom is foreign to the style of Paul. I imagine that <em> two meanings</em> are open to us: (1) as above, <em> the announcement</em> which caused the charge of fickleness: (2) <em> the reproaches in the</em> 1 <em> st Epistle</em> which grieved them. Of these, specious as is the latter on account of the following context, I prefer the former because of the τοῦτο in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:1">2 Corinthians 2:1</span> .

<p><strong> πεποιθὼς</strong> <strong> .…</strong> ] <strong> having trust in</strong> (reposing trust on) <strong> you all, that my joy is</strong> (the pres. expressing the purport of the trust when felt) <strong> that of all of you</strong> : i.e. trusting that you too would feel that there was sufficient reason for the postponement, if it interfered with cur mutual joy. Meyer well observes, that <strong> πάντας</strong> ὑμᾶς , in spite of the existence of an anti-pauline faction in the Corinthian church, is a true example of the love which πάντα πιστεύει , πάντα ἐλπίζει , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7">1 Corinthians 13:7</span> .</p>
