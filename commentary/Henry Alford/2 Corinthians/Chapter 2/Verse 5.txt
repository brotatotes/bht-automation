<b> 5.] But if any one hath caused sorrow</b> (a delicate way of pointing out<i> the one</i> who had occasioned it), he hath grieved, not me (not,— ‘<i>not only</i> me,’ which destroys the meaning,— ‘<i>I</i> am not<i> the aggrieved</i> person, but<i> you’</i>), but in part (i. e. more or less; ‘<i>partially’</i>),<b> that I be not too heavy on him</b> (this gives the reason why he used the expression “<i>more or less</i>,” which qualifies the blame cast on the offender),<b> all of you.</b> See the other renderings discussed in my Greek Test.
