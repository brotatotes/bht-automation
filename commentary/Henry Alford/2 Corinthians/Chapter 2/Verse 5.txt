<p><strong> 5</strong> .] <strong> δέ</strong> , transitional. <strong> Now if any one hath occasioned sorrow</strong> (a delicate way of pointing out <em> the one</em> who had occasioned it), <strong> he hath grieved, not me</strong> (not, ‘not <em> only</em> me,’ which destroys the meaning, ‘ <em> I</em> am not <em> the aggrieved</em> person, but <em> you</em> ’), <strong> but, [in part</strong> (i.e.] <strong> more or less</strong> , <em> partially</em> :’ ref.), <strong> that I be not too heavy on him</strong> (refers to ἀπὸ μέρους , which qualifies the blame cast on the offender), <strong> all of you</strong> . The above punctuation and rendering is adopted by Chrys. ( ἵνα μὴ βαρήσω ἐκεῖνον τὸν πορνεύσαντα , p. 459), Beza, Calvin (but not in his <em> text</em> ), al., with Meyer, De Wette. But Theodoret, Vulg., Luther, Bengel, Wetst., al., join ἐπιβαρῶ πάντας ὑμ ., thus: ‘ <em> he hath not grieved me</em> (alone and principally) <em> but only in part</em> (having grieved you also), <em> that I may not lay the fault on all of you</em> ,’ which I should in this case do, by making myself the only person aggrieved, and classing you with the offender. But this can hardly be; ἀλλά must be εἰ μή .

<p>Another way is adopted by Mosheim, Billroth, and Olsh., to join πάντας with ἵνα μὴ ἐπιβ ., ‘ <em> but in part, that I burden not all, you</em> :’ ἐπιβαρῶ being variously understood, either (1) of including you in the blame of the offender, or (2) as Olsh., of extending to them all the burden of this sorrow; he supposes it to be ironically spoken; their highest praise would have been that <em> all</em> had been troubled. But as Meyer remarks, irony is entirely out of place in this part of the Epistle. The meanings are well discussed in Stanley.</p>
