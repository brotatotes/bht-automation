 5 .]  δέ , transitional.  Now if any one hath occasioned sorrow (a delicate way of pointing out  the one who had occasioned it),  he hath grieved, not me (not, ‘not  only me,’ which destroys the meaning, ‘  I am not  the aggrieved person, but  you ’),  but, [in part (i.e.]  more or less ,  partially :’ ref.),  that I be not too heavy on him (refers to ἀπὸ μέρους , which qualifies the blame cast on the offender),  all of you . The above punctuation and rendering is adopted by Chrys. ( ἵνα μὴ βαρήσω ἐκεῖνον τὸν πορνεύσαντα , p. 459), Beza, Calvin (but not in his  text ), al., with Meyer, De Wette. But Theodoret, Vulg., Luther, Bengel, Wetst., al., join ἐπιβαρῶ πάντας ὑμ ., thus: ‘  he hath not grieved me (alone and principally)  but only in part (having grieved you also),  that I may not lay the fault on all of you ,’ which I should in this case do, by making myself the only person aggrieved, and classing you with the offender. But this can hardly be; ἀλλά must be εἰ μή .
	Another way is adopted by Mosheim, Billroth, and Olsh., to join πάντας with ἵνα μὴ ἐπιβ ., ‘  but in part, that I burden not all, you :’ ἐπιβαρῶ being variously understood, either (1) of including you in the blame of the offender, or (2) as Olsh., of extending to them all the burden of this sorrow; he supposes it to be ironically spoken; their highest praise would have been that  all had been troubled. But as Meyer remarks, irony is entirely out of place in this part of the Epistle. The meanings are well discussed in Stanley.
