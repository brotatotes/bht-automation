	 τῷ τοιούτῳ ] Meyer remarks on the expression as being used in mildness, not to designate any particular person: but the same designation is employed in 1 Corinthians 5:5 , παραδοῦναι τὸν τοιοῦτον τῷ σατανᾷ .
	 ἡ ἐπιτ  .   αὕτη ]  This punishment (= ἐπιτίμιον , see reff.):  what it was , we are unable with certainty to say; but 1 Corinthians 5:0 seems to point to  excommunication as forming at least a  part of it.

	 ἱκανόν ]  enough , not in  duration , though that would be  the case , but in  magnitude : sufficient, as having produced its desired effect, penitence.
