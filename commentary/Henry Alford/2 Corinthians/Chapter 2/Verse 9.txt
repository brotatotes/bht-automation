 9 .]  Reason why they should now be ready to shew love to him again, the end of Paul’s writing to them having been accomplished by their obeying his order.  For to this end I also wrote : the  καί signifying that my former epistle, as well as my present exhortation, tended to this, viz. the  testing your obedience . Meyer (Exodus 2:0 ) explains the καί as implying that other orders to the same effect were sent by word of mouth. He alludes beyond doubt to the former Epistle, ch. 5. Yet the ancient Commentators, Chrys., &c., and Erasm., Wolf, Bengel, al. (not Olsh., as De Wette says), interpret it of  this Epistle : which certainly is grammatically allowable (see 1 Corinthians 5:9 , note), but opposed to the context (see 2 Corinthians 2:3-4 , besides the manifest sense here, that the object of his writing  had been accomplished) .  That I might know the proof of you, whether in all things (emphatic)  ye are obedient . This was that one among the various objects of his first Epistle, which belonged to the matter at present in hand, and which he therefore puts forward: not by any means implying that he had  no other view in writing it.
