 10. ]  For (substantiation of the foregoing πολλῷ μᾶλλον )  even that which has been glorified (viz. the διακ . τ . κατακρίς ., which was ἐν δόξῃ by the brightness on the face of Moses)  has not been glorified (has lost all its glory)  in this respect (i.e. when compared with the gospel, κατὰ τὸν τῆς συγκρίσεως λόγον , Chrys. Hom. vii. p. 481.
	De W. takes ἐν τ . τῷ μέρ . with δεδοξασμένον , ‘that which was in this particular glorified,’ viz. in the brightness on the face of Moses: but that would more naturally be τὸ ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει δεδοξασμένον : as it now stands I cannot divide otherwise than οὐ δεδόξασται | τὸ δεδοξασμένον | ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει . Meyer takes τὸ δεδοξ . as  abstract , and ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει as pointing to the  concrete : ‘that which has been glorified (general and abstract) has in this particular department (concrete, viz. the διακ . τ . κατακρίς . which was δεδοξασμ .) no glory: q. d. the glorified is unglorified in this case.’ This may certainly be, and is ingenious: but the other is simpler)  on account of (i.e. when we take into consideration)  the surpassing glory (viz. of the other διακονία :  present , because spoken of qualitatively).
