<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] <strong> For</strong> (a fresh ground of superiority in glory of the Christian over the Mosaic ministry) <strong> if that which is transitory</strong> (not here, as above, the brilliancy of the visage of Moses, for that <em> was</em> the δόξα , but <em> the ministry itself</em> , the whole purpose which that ministry served, which was parenthetical and to come to an end) <strong> was with glory</strong> ( διὰ , see reff., of the condition or circumstances in which a thing takes place), <strong> much more is that which abideth</strong> (the everlasting gospel) <strong> in glory</strong> . Estius says, “ <em> per gloriam</em> ( διὰ δ .) innuere videtur aliquid momentaneum ac transitorium: <em> in gloria</em> , aliquid manens et stabile.” Similarly, Olshausen: but it is quite in the style of our Apostle to use various prepositions to express nearly the same relation, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:22">Romans 3:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:30">Romans 3:30</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:10">Romans 5:10</span> .</p>
