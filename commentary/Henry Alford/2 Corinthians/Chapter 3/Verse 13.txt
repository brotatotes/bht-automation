<b> 13.] and</b> (do)<b> not</b> (place a vail on our face)<b> as Moses placed a vail on his face, inorder that</b> (see below)<b> the sons of Israel might not look stedfastly on the termination of that which was being done away</b> (viz. his<i> ministration</i>, see ver. 11, but spoken of as<i> glorified</i>: ‘the glory of his ministra tion’).—A mistake has been made with regard to the history in Exod. xxxiv. 35, which has considerably obscured the understanding of this verse. It is commonly assumed, that, Moses<i> spoke</i> to the Israelites,<i> having the vail on his face;</i> and this is implied in our version— ‘till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.” But the Hebrew and Septuagint gave a different account: “and<i> when he ceased speaking to them</i>, he put a vail over his face.” He spoke to them<i> without</i> the vail, with his face shining and glorified:—<i>when he had done speaking,</i> he placed the vail on his face: and that, not because they were afraid to look on him, but as here,<i> that they might not look on the end,</i> or the fading,<i> of that transitory glory</i>; that they might only see it as long as it was the credential of his ministry, and then it might be withdrawn from their eyes. Thus the declaration of God’s will to then was not in openness of speech, but was interrupted and broken by intervals of concealment, which ours is not. The opposition is twofold: (1) between the<i> vailed</i> and the<i> unvailed</i> ministry, as regards the mere fact of concealment in the one case, and openness in the other: (2) between the ministry which was suspended by the vailing, that its end might not be seen, and that which proceeds from glory to glory,<i> having no termination.</i> On the common interpretation, Commentators have found an almost insuperable difficulty in the purpose here stated, “<i>that the children of Israel might not</i>,”&c. The usual escape from it has been to render it (see A.V.),<i> ‘so that the Israelites could not,</i> as in vér. 7. But this is an ungrammatical rendering of the Greek. I may remark also, that the narrative in Exodus, the Septuagint version of which the Apostle here closely follows (see below on ver. 16), implies that the brightness of Moses’ face had<i> place not on that one occasion only, but throughout his whole ministry</i> between the and the people.<i> When he ceased speaking to them, he put on the vail:</i> but<i> whensoever he went in before the Lord</i> to speak to Him, the<i> vail</i><i> was removed</i> till he came out, and<i> had spoken to the Israelites all that the Lord had commanded him,</i> during which speaking they saw that his face shone,—and after which speaking he<i> again put on the vail.</i> So that the vail was the symbol of concealment and transitoriness: the part revealed they might see: beyond that, they could not: the ministry was a broken, interrupted one; its end was wrapped in obscurity.—In the words,<i> “the end of that which was being done away,”</i> we must not think, as some Commentators have done, of<i> Christ</i> (Rom. x. 4), any further than it may be hinted in the background that when the law came to an end, He appeared.
