<b> 13.] and</b> (do)<b> not</b> (place a vail on our face)<b> as Moses placed a vail on his face, inorder that</b> (see below)<b> the sons of Israel might not look stedfastly on the termination of that which was being done away</b> (viz. his<i> ministration</i>, see ver. 11, but spoken of as<i> glorified</i>: ‘the glory of his ministra tion’).—A mistake has been made with regard to the history in Exod. xxxiv. 35, which has considerably obscured the understanding of this verse. It is commonly assumed, that, Moses<i> spoke</i> to the Israelites,<i> having the vail on his face;</i> and this is implied in our version— ‘till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.” But the Hebrew and Septuagint gave a different account: “and<i> when he ceased speaking to them</i>, he put a vail over his face.” He spoke to them<i> without</i> the vail, with his face shining and glorified:—<i>when he had done speaking,</i> he placed the vail on his face: and that, not because they were afraid to look on him, but as here,<i> that they might not look on the end,</i> or the fading,<i> of that transitory glory</i>; that they might only see it as long as it was the credential of his ministry, and then it might be withdrawn from their eyes. Thus the declaration of God’s will to then was not in openness of speech, but was interrupted and broken by intervals of concealment, which ours is not. The opposition is twofold: (1) between the<i> vailed</i> and the<i> unvailed</i> ministry, as regards the mere fact of concealment in the one case, and openness in the other: (2) between the ministry which was suspended by the vailing, that its end might not be seen, and that which proceeds from glory to glory,<i> having no termination.</i> On the common interpretation, Commentators have found an almost insuperable difficulty in the purpose here stated, “<i>that the children of Israel might not</i>,”&c. The usual escape from it has been to render it (see A.V.),<i> ‘so that the Israelites could not,</i> as in vér. 7. But this is an ungrammatical rendering of the Greek. I may remark also, that the narrative in Exodus, the Septuagint version of which the Apostle here closely follows (see below on ver. 16), implies that the brightness of Moses’ face had<i> place not on that one occasion only, but throughout his whole ministry</i> between the and the people.<i> When he ceased speaking to them, he put on the vail:</i> but<i> whensoever he went in before the Lord</i> to speak to Him, the<i> vail</i><i> was removed</i> till he came out, and<i> had spoken to the Israelites all that the Lord had commanded him,</i> during which speaking they saw that his face shone,—and after which speaking he<i> again put on the vail.</i> So that the vail was the symbol of concealment and transitoriness: the part revealed they might see: beyond that, they could not: the ministry was a broken, interrupted one; its end was wrapped in obscurity.—In the words,<i> “the end of that which was being done away,”</i> we must not think, as some Commentators have done, of<i> Christ</i> (Rom. x. 4), any further than it may be hinted in the background that when the law came to an end, He appeared.<br><br><b> the same vail]</b> ‘the vail once on Moses’ face,’ is now regarded as laid on<i> their hearts</i>. It denoted the ceasing, the covering up, of his oral teaching; for it was put on<i> when he had done</i> speaking to the people.<i> Now,</i> his oral teaching has altogether ceased, and the<i> ministry</i> is carried on by<i> a book</i>. But as when we<i> listen</i>, the speaker is the<i> agent</i>, and the hearers are<i> passive</i>,—so on the other hand, when we<i> read</i>,<i> we</i> are the<i> agents</i>, and the book is<i> passive</i>. The book is the same to all: the difference between those who understand and those who do not understand is now a<i> subjective</i> difference—the vail is no longer on the face of the speaker, but on the<i> heart of the reader.</i> So that of necessity the form of the similitude is changed.<br><br><b> For</b> (answering to an understood clause, ‘and remain hardened’)<b> to the present day the same vail</b> (which was once on the face of Moses)<b> remains at the reading of the Old Covenant</b> (i. e.<b> ‘Testament</b>: as we now popularly use the words,<i> the book comprising the ancient Covenant</i>),<b> the discovery not being made</b> (by the removal of the vail: literally, it<b> not being unvailed</b>),<b> that it</b> (the Old Test.)<b> is done away</b> (or, being done away: but the other is better here)<b> in Christ</b> (that the Old Covenant has passed away, being superseded by Christ). This I believe to be the only admissible sense of the words,<i> consistently with the symbolism of the passage.</i> The renderings,<i> ‘remains not taken away—for it</i> (i. e the vail)<i> is done away in Christ,’</i> and (as A.V.) ‘<i>remaineth.... untaken away... which vail is done away in Christ,</i>’—are inadmissible: (1) because they make the verb<b> is done away,</b> which thronghout the passage belongs to the<i> glory of the ministry,</i> to apply to the<i> vail</i>: and (2) because ‘they give no satisfactory sense. It is not<i> because</i> the vail can only be done away in Christ, that it now remains untaken away on their hearts, but<i> because their hearts are hardened.</i> The word in the original,<b> unvailed</b>, has been probably chosen, as is often the practice of the Apostle, on account of its relation to<i> vail</i>,—<b>it not being unvailed to them that</b>...
