<b> 16.]</b> Here, the object of comparison is,<i> the having on a vail, and taking it off on going into the presence of the Lord.</i> This<i> Moses did</i>: and the choice of the<i> same words</i> as those of the Septuagint, shews the closeness of the comparison: “<i>But whensoever Moses went in before the Lord to speak to Him, the vail was taken away.</i>” This shall likewise be done in the case of the Israelites:<b> when it</b> (i. e.<i> their heart</i>,—not<i> Israel</i>, as some think,—nor<i> Moses</i>, as others)<b> turneth to the Lord</b> (here again the word is carefully chosen, being the very expression of the Septuagint, when the Israelites, having been afraid of the glory of the face of Moses, returned to him after being summoned by him:— “<i>they were afraid to</i><i> come nigh him; and Moses called them, and they</i><b> turned to</b><i> him</i>...,”—a<b> nd the Lord</b> appears to be used for the same reason),<b> the vail is taken away</b> (not, as A.V.,<i> ‘shall</i> be,’ because “<i>their heart</i>” is the subject, and thus the<i> taking away</i> becomes an individual matter, happening whenever and wherever conversion takes place). Let me restate this,—as it is all-important towards the understanding of verses 17, 18. ‘When their heart<i> goes in to speak with God,</i>—ceases to contemplate the dead letter, and begins to commune with the Spirit of the old covenant (the Spirit of GOd), then the veil is removed, as it was from the face of Moses.’
