<p><strong> 16</strong> .] Here, the tertium comparationis is, <em> the having on a vail, and taking it off on going into the presence of the Lord</em> . This <em> Moses did; and the choice</em> of the <em> same words</em> as those of the LXX, shews the closeness of the comparison; <strong> ἡνίκα δ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἂν</strong> εἰσεπορεύετο Μωυσῆς ἔναντι <strong> κυρίου</strong> λαλεῖν αὐτῷ , <strong> περιῃρεῖτο τὸ κάλυμμα</strong> . This shall likewise be done in the case of the Israelites: <strong> when it</strong> (i.e. ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν , not <em> Israel</em> , as Chrys., Theod., Theophyl., Erasm., al., nor <em> Moses</em> , as Calv., Estius, nor τίς , as Orig [4] , al.) <strong> shall turn to the Lord</strong> (here again ἐπιστρέψῃ πρός is carefully chosen, being the very expression of the LXX, when the Israelites, having been afraid of the glory of the face of Moses, returned to him after being summoned by him: ἐφοβήθησαν ἐγγίσαι αὐτῷ · καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτοὺς Μωυσῆς , καὶ <strong> ἐπεστράφησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν</strong> <strong> .…</strong> , and κύριον appears to be used for the same reason) <strong> the vail is taken away</strong> (not, <em> shall</em> be, because ἡ καρδία is the subject, and thus the <em> taking away</em> becomes an individual matter, happening whenever and wherever conversion takes place). Let me restate this, as it is all-important towards the understanding of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:17-18">2 Corinthians 3:17-18</span> . ‘When their heart <em> goes in to speak with God</em> , ceases to contemplate the dead letter, and begins to commune with the Spirit of the old covenant (the Spirit of God), then the vail is removed, as it was from the face of Moses.’
