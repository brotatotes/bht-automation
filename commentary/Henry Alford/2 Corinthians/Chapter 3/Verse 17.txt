<b> 17.] Now the Lord is the Spirit:</b> i.e. the<b> Lord</b> of ver. 16 is the<i> Spirit</i>, whose word the O.T. is: the<i> spirit</i>,—as opposed to the<i> letter</i>;—which<i> giveth life,</i> ver. 6: meaning, ‘<i>thé Lord</i>,’ as here spoken of, “Christ,” ‘<i>is the Spirit</i>,’ is identical with the Holy Spirit: not personally nor essentially, but, as is shewn by the words “<i>the Spirit of the Lord</i>” following,<i> in this department of His divine working</i>:—<i>Christ</i>, here,<i> is the Spirit of Christ.</i><b> and where the Spirit of the Lord</b> (see above)<b> is, is liberty.</b> They are fettered in spirit as Jong as they are slaves to the letter, as long as they have the vail on their hearts; but when they turn to the Lord the Spirit, which is not<i> a Spirit of bondage, but of adoption</i>, Rom. viii. 15,—and by virtue of whom “<i>thou art no longer a slave, but a son</i>,” Gal. iv. 7,—then they are at liberty.
