 17. ]  Now ( δέ exponentis. τίς δὲ οὗτος πρὸς ὃν δεῖ ἀποβλέψαι ; Theodoret)  the Lord is the Spirit: i.e. the  κύριος of 2 Corinthians 3:16 , is, the  Spirit , whose word the O. T. is: the πνεῦμα , as opposed to the γράμμα , which ζωοποιεῖ , 2 Corinthians 3:6 .
	But it is not merely, as Wetst., ‘Dominus  significat Spiritum,’ nor is πνεῦμα merely, as Olsh.,  the spiritual sense of the law : but, ‘  the Lord ,’ as here spoken of, ‘Christ,’ ‘  is the Spirit ,’ is identical with the Holy Spirit: not personally nor essentially, but, as is shewn by  τὸ πνεῦμα κυρίου following,  in this department of His divine working: Christ , here,  is the Spirit of Christ . The principal mistaken interpretation (among many, see Pool’s Synops., Meyer, De Wette) is that of Chrys., Theodoret, Theophyl., Œcum., Estius, Schulz, making τὸ πνεῦμα the subject, and ὁ κύρ . the predicate, which though perhaps (but would δέ then have had its present position?) allowable, is against the context, ὁ δὲ κύρ . being plainly resumed from ὁ κύρ . in 2 Corinthians 3:16 . The words are then used by them as a proof of the Divinity of the Holy Spirit.
	 But ( δέ appealing to a known or evident axiom, as in a mathematical demonstration)  where the Spirit of the Lord (see above)  is, is liberty ( ἐκεῖ has probably been inserted, as being usual after οὗ : but, as Meyer remarks, not in St. Paul’s style, see Romans 4:15 ; Rom 5:20 ). They are fettered in spirit as long as they are slaves to the letter, = as long as they have the vail on their hearts; but when they turn to the Lord the Spirit, which is not πνεῦμα δουλείας but πν . υἱοθεσίας , Romans 8:15 , and by virtue of whom οὐκ ἔτι εἶ δοῦλος , ἀλλὰ νἱός , Galatians 4:7 , then they are at liberty. There can hardly be any allusion to a vail over the head implying subjection, as 1 Corinthians 11:10 , (Erasm., Beza, Grot., Bengel, Fritz.,) for here the  covering of the head with a vail is not thought of, but merely intercepting the sight.
