<b> 18.] But</b> (the sight of the Jews is thus intercepted; in contrast to whom)<b> WE all</b> ( ‘<i>all Christians</i>: not ‘we Apostles and teachers:’ the contrast is to the children of Israel above),<b> with unvailed face</b> (the vail having been removed at our conversion: the stress is on these words)<b> beholding in a mirror the glory of the Lord</b> (i. e. Christ: from ver. 16, 17. The gospel is this mirror, the ‘<i>Gospel of the glory of God,’</i> ch. iv. 4, and we, looking on it with unveiled face, are the contrast to the Jews, with veiled hearts reading their law),<b> are being transfigured into the same image</b> (which we see in the mirror: the image of the glory of Christ, see Gal. iv. 19; and 1 John iii. 3. But the change here spoken of is a<i> spiritual</i> one, not the bodily change at the Resurrection: it is going on here in the process of sanctification)<b> from glory to glory</b> (this is explained, either [1] ‘<i>from one degree of glory to another</i>:’ so most Commentators and De Wette, or [2]<i> ‘from</i> [by]<i> the glory which we see, into glory</i>,’ as Chrysostom: “from the glory of the Spirit, into our own glory which shall be wrought in us.” I prefer the former, as the other would introduce a tautology, the sentiment being expressed in the words following), as<b> by the Lord the Spirit.</b> The transformation is effected<i> by the Spirit,</i> the Author and Upholder of spiritual life, who “takes of the things of Christ, and<i> shews them</i> to us,” John xvi. 14, see also Rom. viii. 10, 11,—who sanctifies us till we are holy as Christ is holy; the process of renewal after Christ’s image is<i> such a transformation as may be expected by the agency of the Lord, the Spirit,—</i>Christ Himself<i> being the image,</i> see ch. iv. 4. The other renderings are out of the question, viz.: (1) “<i>the Lord of the Spirit,</i>” i.e. Christ, whose Spirit He is; which seems fo me to convey very little meaning, besides being an expression wholly unprecedented: (2) that of A.V. and of the Vulgate, and others, ‘<i>the Spirit of the Lord,</i>’ and (3) that of Chrysostom and others, ‘<i>the Spirit who is the Lord.’</i>
