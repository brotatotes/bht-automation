<p><strong> 3</strong> .] <strong> manifested to be</strong> (that ye are) <strong> an epistle of Christ</strong> (i.e. <em> written by Christ</em> , not, as Chrys. al., <em> concerning</em> Christ: He is the Recommender of us, the Head of the church and Sender of us His ministers) <strong> which was ministered</strong> (aor.) <strong> by us</strong> (i.e. <em> carried about, served in the way of ministration</em> by us as tabellarii, not, as Meyer and De W. and al., <em> written by us as amanuenses</em> : see below), <strong> having been inscribed, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God</strong> (so the tables of the law were γεγραμμέναι τῷ δακτύλῳ τοῦ θεοῦ , Exo 31:18 ), <strong> not on stone tables</strong> (as the old law, ib.), <strong> but on</strong> (your) <strong> hearts</strong> (which are) <strong> tables of flesh</strong> (Meyer calls the reading καρδίαις a <em> mistake of the pen</em> . But surely internal as well as external evidence is strong in its favour, the correction to καρδίας being so obvious to those who found the construction harsh). The apparent change in the figure in this verse requires explanation. The Corinthians are his Epistle of recommendation, both to themselves and others; <em> an Epistle, written</em> by Christ, <em> ministered</em> by Paul; the <em> Epistle itself</em> being now the subject, viz. the Corinthians, <em> themselves the writing of Christ</em> , inscribed, not on tables of stone, but on hearts, tables of flesh. The Epistle itself, written and worn on Paul’s heart, and there known and read by all men, consisted of <em> the Corinthian converts</em> , on whose hearts Christ had written it by His Spirit. <em> I bear on my heart, as a testimony to all men, that which Christ has by His Spirit written in your hearts</em> . On the tables of stone and of flesh, see Exod. as above; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:3">Proverbs 3:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="pr+7:3">Proverbs 7:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:31-34">Jeremiah 31:31-34</span> , and on the contrast, also here hinted at in the background, between the heart of stone and the heart of flesh, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+11:19">Ezekiel 11:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:26">Ezekiel 36:26</span> .</p>
