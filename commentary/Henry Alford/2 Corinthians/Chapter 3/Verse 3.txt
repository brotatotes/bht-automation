<b> 3.]</b> literally,<b> manifested to be</b> (that ye are) a<b> n epistle of Christ</b> (i. e.<i> written by Christ</i>,—not, a3 Chrys., al.,<i> concerning Christ</i>:—He is the Recommender of us, the Head of the church and sender of us His ministers)<b> which was ministered by us</b> (i. e.<i> carried about, served in the way of ministration</i> by us as its bearers,—not, as some explain it,<i> written by us as amanuense</i> s: see below),<b> having been inscribed, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God</b> (so the tables of the law were “<i>written with the finger of God</i>,” Exod. xxxi. 18);<b> not on stone tables</b> (as the old law, ib.),<b> but on</b> (your)<b> hearts</b>, (which are)<b> tables of flesh.</b> The apparent change in the figure in this verse requires explanation. The Corinthians are his Epistle of recommendation, both to themselves and others;<i> an Epistle,</i><i> written</i> by Christ,<i> ministered</i> by St. Paul;<i> the Epistle itself</i> being now the subject, viz. the Corinthians,<i> themselves the writing of Christ</i>, inscribed, not on tables of stone, but on hearts, tables of flesh. The Epistle itself, written and worn on St. Paul’s heart, and there known and read by all men, consisted of the<i> Corinthian converts,</i> on whose hearts Christ had written it by His Spirit.<i> I bear on my heart, as a testimony to all men, that which Christ has by His Spirit written in your hearts.</i> On the tables of<i></i> stone and of flesh, see Exodus, as above, Prov. iii. 3; vii. 3; Jer. xxxi. 31–34, and on the contrast, also here hinted at in the background, between the heart of stone and the heart of flesh, Ezek. xi. 19; xxxvi. 26.
