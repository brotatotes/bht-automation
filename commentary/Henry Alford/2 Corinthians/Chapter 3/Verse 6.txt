Hebrews 12:24 , καὶ διαθήκης νέας μεσίτῃ Ἰησοῦ )  new Covenant (i.e. the  gospel , Ephesians 3:7 ; Colossians 1:23 , as distinguished from the  law ; see 1 Corinthians 11:25 ; Galatians 4:24 : the πλάκες λίθιναι and σάρκιναι are still borne in mind, and lead on to a fuller comparison of the two covenants),  not of (governed by διακόνους , not by καινῆς διαθ . ‘  ministers, not of ’.…)  letter (in which, viz. in formal and literal precept, the Mosaic law consisted),  but of Spirit (in which, viz. in the inward guiding of the Spirit of God, the gospel consists. Bengel remarks: ‘Paulus etiam dum hæc  scripsit , non literæ, sed  spiritus ministerium egit. Moses in proprio illo officio suo, etiam cum haud scripsit, tamen in litera versatus est’):  for the letter (mere formal and literal precept, of the law)  killeth (as in Romans 7:0 , brings the knowledge of sin, its guilt and its punishment.
