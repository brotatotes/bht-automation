The ministration of <em> condemnation</em> , because (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:9">Romans 7:9</span> ff.) the Law detects and condemns sin: the ministration of <em> righteousness</em> , because ( Rom 1:17 ) therein the righteousness of God is revealed and imparted by faith.</p>
