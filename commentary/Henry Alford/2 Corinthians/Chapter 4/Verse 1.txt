<b> 1.]</b><b> For this cause</b> refers to the previous description of the freeness and unvailedness of the ministry of the Gospel, and of the state of Christians in general (ch. iii. 18).<br><br><b> seeing we have this ministry</b> further expands and explains the opening words.<br><br><b> even as we received mercy</b> (from God at the time of our being appointed; compare the same expression, 1 Tim. i. 16) belongs to what went before, not to what follows, and is a qualification, in humility,<b> of seeing we have</b>— ‘possessing it, not as our own, but in as far as we were shewn mercy.’<br><br><b> we shrink not back</b>; i.e.<b> we do not behave ourselves in a cowardly manner</b>, do not shrink from plainness of speech and action.
