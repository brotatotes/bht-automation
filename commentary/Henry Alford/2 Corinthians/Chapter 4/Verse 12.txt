 12. ] By it is also brought out that which is here the immediate subject, the vast and unexampled trials of the apostolic office, all summed up in these words:  So that death works in us, but life in you; i.e. ‘  the trials by which the dying of Jesus is exhibited in us, are exclusively and peculiarly OUR OWN,  whereas (and this is decisive for the  spiritual sense of ζωή )  the life, whereof we are to be witnesses, extends beyond ourselves, nay finds its field of action and energizing IN YOU.’ Estius, Grot., and apparently Olsh., take ἐνεργεῖται passively, ‘is wrought’ (‘mors agitur et exercetur … perficitur vita.’ Est.): but it is never so used in N. T. Chrys., Calv., al., take the verse ironically, τὰ μὲν ἐπικίνδυνα ἡμεῖς ὑπομένομεν , τῶν δὲ χρηστῶν ὑμεῖς ἀπολαύετε , but such a sentiment seems alien from the spirit of the passage. Meyer, as unfortunately, limits ζωή to  natural life, whereas (as above) the context plainly evinces  spiritual life to be meant, not merely natural.
	In Romans 8:10-11 , the vivifying influence of His Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead is spoken of as extending to the body also;  here , the upholding influence of Him who delivers and preserves the body, is spoken of as vivifying the whole man: LIFE, in both places, being  the higher and spiritual life, including the lower and natural. ‘And, in our relative positions, of this  life , YE are the examples, a church of believers, alive to God through Christ in your various vocations, and not called on to be θεατριζόμενοι [cf. 1 Corinthians 4:9 ; Heb 10:33 ] as WE are, who are (not indeed excluded from that  life , nay it flows from us to you, but are) more especially examples of conformity to the  death of our common Lord: in whom DEATH WORKS.’
