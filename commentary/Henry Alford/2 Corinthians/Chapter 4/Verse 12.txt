<b> 12.]</b> By it is also brought out that which is here the immediate subject,—the vast and unexampled trials of the apostolic office, all summed up in these words:<b> So then death worketh in us, but life in you;</b> i.e. ‘<i>the trials by which the dying of Jesus is exhibited in us, are exclusively and peculiarly OUR OWN,—whereas</i> (and this is decisive for the spiritual sense of the word<b> life</b>)<i> the life, whereof we are to be witnesses, extends beyond ourselves, nay, finds its field of action and energizing IN YOU</i>.’ Chrysostom, Calvin, and others, take the verse ironically, “<i>so we have all the danger, and you all the profit</i>:’ but such a sentiment seems alien from the spirit of the passage. Meyer, as unfortunately, limits the meaning to<i> natural life,</i> whereas (as above) the context plainly evinces<i> spiritual life</i> to be meant, not merely natural.—In Rom. viii. 10, 11, the vivifying influence of His Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead is spoken of as extending to the body also;<i> here</i>, the upholding influence of Him who delivers and preserves the body, is spoken of as vivifying the whole man: LIFE, in both places,<i> being the higher and spiritual life</i>,<i> including</i> the lower and natural. ‘And, in our relative positions,—of this<i> life</i>, YE are the examples,—a church of believers, alive to God through Christ in your various vocations, and not called on to be exhibited in an arena (1 Cor. iv. 9: Heb. x. 33), as WE are, who are (not indeed excluded from that<i> life</i>,—nay, it flows from us to you,—but are) more especially examples of conformity to the<i> death</i> of our common Lord:—in whom DEATH WORKETH.’
