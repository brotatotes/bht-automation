 14. ]  knowing (fixes and expands in detail the indefinite πιστεύομεν , and thus gives the  ground of λαλοῦμεν , not as commonly understood, the  matter of which we speak)  that He who raised up (from the dead)  the Lord Jesus, will raise up us also (  from the dead hereafter , see 1 Corinthians 6:13-14 : not in a figurative resurrection from danger, as Beza, who afterwards changed his opinion, al., and lately Meyer, whose whole interpretation of this passage is singularly forced, and his defence of it unfair, see below)  with Jesus ( σὺν Ἰησοῦ is not necessarily figurative, as Meyer; even in the passages where a figurative sense is the prevailing one, it is only as built upon the fact of a  literal ‘raising with Christ,’ to be accomplished at the great day: see Ephesians 2:6 ; Colossians 3:1 ; Colossians 3:3 ; 1Th 5:10 )  and present us with you (i.e. as in Jude 1:24 , τῷ δυναμένῳ … στῆσαι κατενώπιον τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ ἀμώμους ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει …, and in reff.,  at the day of His coming ).
	Meyer’s objection to the meaning above given, that the Apostle could not thus speak of the resurrection, because he expected (1 Corinthians 15:51-52 ; 1 Corinthians 1:8 ; ch. 2Co 1:13-14 ) to be  alive at the day of Christ, is best refuted by this very passage, ch. 2 Corinthians 5:1 ff., where  his admission of at least the possibility of his death is distinctly set forth. The fact is that the ἐγερεῖ here, having respect rather to the contrast of the future glory with the present suffering, does not necessarily imply one or other side of the alternative of being quick or dead at the Lord’s coming, but embraces all, quick and dead, in one blessed resurrection-state.
	This confidence, of being presented at that day σὺν ὑμῖν , is only analogous to his expressions elsewhere; see ch. 2 Corinthians 1:14 ; 1 Thessalonians 2:19-20 ; 1 Thessalonians 3:13 .
