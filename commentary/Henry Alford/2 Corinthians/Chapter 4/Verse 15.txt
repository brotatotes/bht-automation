<b> 15.]</b> Explanation of<b> together with you</b> as a ground of his trust: with reference also to what was said of<i> life working in you</i>, ver. 12; viz. that all, both the sufferings and victory of the ministers, are<i> for the church</i>: see the parallel expression, ch. i. 6, 7.<br><br><b> For all things</b> (of which we have been speaking: or perhaps hyperbolically, ALL THINGS, the whole working and arrangements of God, as in 1 Cor. iii. 22)<b> are on your behalf, that Grace, having abounded by means of the greater number</b> (who have received it),<b> may multiply the thanksgiving</b> (which shall accrue)<b> to the glory of God.</b> Besides this rendering (1),<i> three others</i> are possible: (2) ‘<i>that Grace,</i><i> having abounded, may, on account of the thanksgiving of the greater number, be multiplied to the glory of God:</i> (3)<i> ‘that Grace, having abounded, may, by means of the greater number, multiply the thanksgiving to the glory of God:</i> (4)<i> ‘that Grace, having multiplied by means of the greater number the thanksgiving, may abound to the glory of God.’</i> See these discussed, and my reason for preferring (1), in my Greek Test. As to the<i> sense</i> see the very similar sentiment, ch. i. 11),<i> thanksgiving</i> is the highest and noblest offering of the Church to God’s glory (compare Ps. 1. 23):<i> that this may be rendered</i>, in the best sense, as the result of the working of grace which has become abundant by means of the many recipients, is the great end of the Christian ministry.
