 18. ]  Subjective condition under which this working out takes place .  While we regard not (‘propose not as our aim,’ ‘spend not our care about,’ reff.)  the things which are seen (ref. = τὰ ἐπίγεια , Philippians 3:19 . Chrys. strikingly says, ubi sup., τὰ βλεπόμενα πάντα , κἂν κόλασις ᾖ , κἂν ἀνάπαυσις · ὥστε μήτε ἐκεῖθεν χαυνοῦσθαι , μήτε ἐντεῦθεν βιάζεσθαι ),  but the things which are not seen (‘aliud significat ἀόρατα ,  invisibilia , nam multa quæ non cernuntur, erunt visibilia, confecto itinere fidei.’ Bengel.
	 μὴ βλ ., not οὐ , perhaps because μή stands with participles in clauses of a subjective character, so στήκετε … μὴ πτυρόμενοι ἐν μηδενὶ …, Philippians 1:27-28 . Winer, edn. 6, § 55. 5. g. β , or rather perhaps, as ib. α , as hypothetic (see also Moulton’s note, p. 606. 1): τὰ  οὐ βλεπόμ . would be the things which  as a matter of fact at  any given time we  do not see , cf. οἱ οὐκ ἠλεημένοι , 1 Peter 2:10 ; τὰ  μὴ βλ .,  generally and  hypothetically , the things not seen. So ὁ μὴ ὢν μετ ʼ ἐμοῦ Matthew 12:30 , in a case indefinite and hypothetical. This amounts to much the same as when in the ordinary account of such clauses, we say that μή belongs to the  subject , οὐ to the  predicate , but is a better explanation, inasmuch as that account gives only the logical  fact, this , the logical  reason of the usage):  for the things which are seen are temporary (not ‘  temporal ,’ belonging to time,’ but ‘  fleeting ,’ ‘only for a time,’ see reff.; i.e. till the day of Christ):  but  the things which are not seen are eternal . Chrys. again: κἂν βασιλεία , κἂν κόλασις ᾖ πάλιν · ὥστε καὶ ἐκεῖθεν φοβῆσαι , καὶ ἐκεῖσε (al. ἐντεῦθεν ) προτρέψασθαι , ib.
	Seneca, Ep. 59 (Wetst.), has a very similar sentiment: ‘ista imaginaria sunt, et ad tempus aliquam faciem ferunt. Nihil horum stabile nec solidum est … Mittamus animum ad ea, quæ æterna sunt.’
