It is historically curious, that Irenæus (Hær. iv. 39. 2, p. 266), Origen, Tertull.

Meyer well remarks, that if it had merely been τὰ νοήματα , it would have only expressed in the concrete the νοήμ . of those signified by ἐν οἷς , whereas now, by the addition of τῶν ἀπίστ ., the blinding inflicted on the ἀπολλ . is marked as falling under its  category .

The object of the god of this world was not merely to prevent  them from being illuminated, but to stop the shining forth altogether]: the rendering, ‘  that they might not see ,’ Grot., al., is inadmissible).
