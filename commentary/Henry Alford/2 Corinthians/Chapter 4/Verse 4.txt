It is historically curious, that Irenæus (Hær. iv. 39. 2, p. 266), Origen, Tertull.

The object of the god of this world was not merely to prevent <em> them</em> from being illuminated, but to stop the shining forth altogether]: the rendering, ‘ <em> that they might not see</em> ,’ Grot., al., is inadmissible).
