 6. ]  Because (explains and substantiates the last clause, that we are your servants for Jesus’ sake) (  it is )  God, who said Out of (not, ‘  after the darkness;’ this meaning of ἐκ , though allowable, e.g. ἐκ κυμάτων γὰρ αὖθις αὖ γάλην ʼ ὁρῶ , does not occur in N. T.)  darkness light shall shine (allusion to Genesis 1:3 ; the change to λάμψαι appears to have been made because the words cited are not the exact ones spoken by the Creator),  who shined (Grot., Fritz., Meyer, would render ἔλαμψεν , ‘caused light to shine,’ using the verb in the  factitive sense, as ἀνατέλλω , Matthew 5:45 , and ὦ λάμπουσα πέτρα πυρὸς δικόρυφον σέλας , Eur. Phœn. 226. But this usage of the word seems entirely poetical, and the intransitive sense would as well express the divine act)  in our hearts (the physical creation bearing an analogy to the spiritual)  in order to the shining forth (to others)  of the knowledge (in us)  of the glory of God in the face of Christ (= τῆς δόξης τ . θεοῦ  τῆς ἐν προσώπῳ χρ ., ‘the glory of God manifested in Christ’). The figure is still derived from the history in ch. 3, and refers to the brightness on the face of Moses: the only true effulgence of the divine glory is from the face of Christ. Meyer contends for the connexion of ἐν προσώπ . χρ . with φωτισμόν but his explanation fails to convey to my mind any satisfactory sense. He says that when the γνῶσις is imparted by preaching, it shines, and its brightness illuminates  the face of Christ , because it is His face whose glory is looked on in the mirror of preaching. But I cannot think that any thing so very far-fetched would be in the Apostle’s mind.
	As to the necessity of the art. τῆς before ἐν , none will assert it who are much versed in the many varieties of expression in such sentences in the Apostle’s style.
