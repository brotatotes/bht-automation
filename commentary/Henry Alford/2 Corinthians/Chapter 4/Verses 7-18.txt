<p><strong> 7 18.</strong> ] <em> This glorious ministry is fulfilled by weak, afflicted, persecuted, and decaying vessels, which are moreover worn out in the work</em> (7 12). <em> Yet the spirit of faith, the hope of the resurrection, and of being presented with them, for whom he has laboured, bears him up against the decay of the outer man, and all present tribulation</em> (13 18). We are not justified in assuming with Calvin, Estius, al., that a definite reproach of personal meanness had induced the Apostle to speak thus. For he does not deal with any such reproach here, but with matters common to all human ministers of the word.

<p>All this is a following out in detail of the οὐκ ἐγκακοῦμεν of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:1">2 Corinthians 4:1</span> , already enlarged on in <em> one of its departments</em> , that of <em> not shrinking from openness of speech</em> , and now to be put forth in <em> another</em> , viz. <em> bearing up against outward and inward difficulties</em> . If <em> any</em> polemical purpose is to be sought, it is the setting forth of the abundance of sufferings, the glorying in weakness (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span> ; 2Co 11:30 ), which substantiated his apostolic mission: but even such purpose is only in the background; he is pouring out, in the fulness of his heart, the manifold discouragements and the far more exceeding encouragements of his office.</p>
