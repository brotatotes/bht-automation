 10. ]  For (explanation and fixing of εὐάρεστοι αὐτῷ εἶναι , as to  when , and  how testified )  we all (and myself among the number)  must be made manifest (not merely ‘  appear ’ = παραστῆναι [which is a most unfortunate rendering of the E. V., giving to the reader merely the idea of “appearing before” as when summoned to a magistrate], but ‘  appear in our true light ,’ appear as we have never done before, as in reff., where the word is used of our Lord Himself: see also 1Co 4:5 )  before the judgment-seat (on  βῆμα , see Stanley’s note)  of Christ, that each may receive (the technical word for  receiving wages )  the things (done) through the body (as a medium or organ of action. Meyer cites τῶν ἡδονῶν αἱ διὰ τοῦ σώματός εἰσιν , Plato, Phædo, p. 65, and αἰσθήσεις αἱ διὰ τοῦ σώματος , Phædr, p. 250),  according to the things which he did (in the body),  whether (it were)  good, or bad (singular, as abstract). I may observe that no more definite inference must be drawn from this verse as to the place which the saints of God shall hold in the general judgment, than it warrants; viz. that they as well as others, shall be manifested and judged by Him ( Mat 25:19 ):  when , or  in company with whom , is not here so much as hinted.
