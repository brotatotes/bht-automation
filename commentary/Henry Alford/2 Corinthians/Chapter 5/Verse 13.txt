<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] <strong> For</strong> (ye have good reason to boast of me as your teacher; seeing that) <strong> whether we have been mad</strong> (there is no need to soften the meaning to ‘ <em> inordinately praise ourselves</em> ,’ as Chrys., al.; or ‘ <em> act foolishly</em> ,’ as others; or ‘ <em> ultra modum agimus</em> ,’ as Bengel, Luther: μαίνῃ , Παῦλε , was once said, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:24">Acts 26:24</span> , and doubtless this charge was among the means taken to depreciate his influence at Corinth), <strong> it was to God</strong> (in God’s work and to His glory): [or] <strong> whether we be of sound mind, it is for you</strong> (on your behalf). ‘So that you have reason to glory in us either way; if you will ascribe to us madness, it is a holy madness, <em> for God</em> : if you maintain and are convinced of our sobriety, it is a soundness <em> in your service</em> .’

<p>On the interpretation of Chrys. above, he explains the last clause, ἄν τε μέτριόν τι κ . ταπεινὸν ( φθεγξώμεθα ), δι ʼ ὑμᾶς , ἵνα μάθητε ταπεινοφρονεῖν . Hom. xi. p. 513. But he gives our interpretation also, as an alternative: μαίνεσθαί τις ἡμᾶς φησί ; διὰ τὸν θεὸν τοιαῦτα μαινόμεθα .</p>
