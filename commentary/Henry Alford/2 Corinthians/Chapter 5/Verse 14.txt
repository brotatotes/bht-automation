<b> 14.] For</b> (reason of his devotion under all reports and circumstances,<i> to God</i> and<i> to you</i>, as in last verse)<b> Christ’s love</b> (not<i> love to Christ,</i> as “<i>the love of Christ</i>” in English may mean,—but<i> Christ’s love to men,</i> subjective, as most Commentators; as shewn in<i> His death</i>, which is the greatest proof of love, see Rom. v. 6–8. Meyer remarks that the genitive of the person after “<i>love</i>” is with St. Paul<i> always</i> subjective,—Rom. v. 5, 8; viii. 35, 39; ch. viii. 24; xiii. 13; Eph. ii. 4; Phil. i. 9 al., whereas with St. John it is not always so, 1 John v. 3.—St. Paul expresses love<i> of</i>, i.e.<i> towards,</i> by the preposition ‘<i>to</i>,’ Col. i. 4. 1 Thess. iii. 12)<b> constraineth us</b> (a better word could not be found: the idea is that of<i> forcible limitation,</i> either in a good or a bad sense,—of<i> confining to one object,</i> or<i> within certain bounds</i>, be that one object a painful or glorious one,—those bounds the narrow limits of distress, or the course of apostolic energy, as here. ‘<i>Constraineth us,</i>’ generally:—limits us to one great end, and prohibits our taking into consideration any others. “There is a figure in this verb<i> constraineth</i>: it is signified, that it cannot be but that he who truly weighs and considers that marvellous love which Christ testified towards us by His death, being as it were bound to Him and attached by the tightest bond, should devote himself to His service.” Calvin),<b> having judged this</b> (i. e.,<b> because we formed this judgment</b>, viz. at our conversion:—learned to regard this as a settled truth),<b> that One died for all</b> (not only, for the benefit of all,—but<i> instead of</i> all, suffered death in the root and essence of our humanity, as the second Adam. This death on behalf of<i> all men</i> is the absolute objective fact: that<i> all</i> enter not into the benefit of that Death, is owing to the nonfulfilment of the subjective condition which follows),<b> therefore all died</b> (i. e. therefore, in the death of Christ,<i> all</i>,<i> the</i> all for whom He died,<i> died too</i>: i.e. see below, became planted in the likeness of His death,—died to sin and to self, that they might live to Him. This was true,<i> objectively</i>, but<i> not subjectively</i> till such death to sin and self is realized in each: see Rom. vi. 8 ff. The rendering of the A.V., “<i>then were all dead</i>,” is inadmissible both from the construction of the original, and the context: ‘<i>One on behalf of all</i> died, therefore<i> all</i> died: if One died the death of [belonging to, due from] all, then all died [in and with Him]’):
