<b> 16.] So that</b> (<i>accordingly</i>,—consistently with our judgment expressed ver. 15)<b> we</b> (in opposition to our adversaries, the false teachers; not<i> general</i> of<i> all Christians</i>,—but as yet spoken of the Apostle himself [and his colleagues?]) henceforth (since this great event, the Death of Christ)<b> know no man according to</b> (as he is in)<b> the flesh</b> (Meyer well remarks: “Since all are [ethically] dead, and each man is bound to live only to Christ, not to himself, our knowledge of others must be altogether independent of that which they are<i> according to the flesh</i>,—must not be regulated<i> according to the flesh.</i> And the connexion of ver. 16 with ver. 15 shews that we must not take these words as furnishing the<i> subjective</i> rule of<i> our knowledge</i>,—so that the explanation would be, ‘according to mere human knowledge,’ ‘apart from the enlightening of the Holy Spirit,’ see ch. i. 17; 1 Cor. i. 26,—but as the<i> objective</i> rule, cf. ch. xi. 18; John viii. 15; Phil. ili, 4,—so that ‘<i>to know any one according to the flesh</i>’ means ‘<i>to know any one according to his mere human individuality</i>,— ‘to know him as men have judged him by what he is in the flesh, not by what he is<i> according to the spirit,</i> as a Christian, as<i> a new creature,</i> ver. 17. He who knows no man<i> according to the flesh</i> has, e.g. in the case of the Jew, entirely lost sight of his Jewish origin,—in that of the rich man, of his riches,—in that of the learned, of his learning,—in that of the slave, of his servitude, &c., see Gal. iii. 28”)<b>: if even we have known Christ according to the flesh, now however we know Him (thus) no longer.</b>—The fact alluded to in the concessive clause, is, not any personal knowledge of the Lord Jesus while He was on earth, but that view of Him which St. Paul took<i> before his conversion,</i> when he knew Him only according to His outward apparent standing in this world,<i> only as Jesus of Nazareth</i>.—Observe, the stress is not on the word<b> Christ</b>, ‘If we have known even Christ after the flesh,’&c., as usually understood; but on have known, as belonging to the<i> past</i>, contrasted with our<i> present</i> knowledge. Observe likewise, that “<i>according to the flesh</i>,” as above also, is not to be taken as the subjective qualification of our knowledge, but as belonging to the word<b> Christ</b>,— ‘<i>Christ according to the flesh</i>.’—St. Paul now, since his conversion, knew Him no longer as thus shewn, but as declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness. At that time God was pleased to<b> reveal His Son</b> in him, Gal. i. 16. See by all means Stanley’s remarks, om the absence of all local and personal recollections of our Lord’s life, in the apostolic age.
