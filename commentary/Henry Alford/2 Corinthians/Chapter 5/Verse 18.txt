<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] <strong> And all things</strong> (in this new creation: he passes to a more general view of the effects of the death of Christ viz. our <em> reconciliation to God</em> ) <strong> are from God</strong> (as their source), <strong> who reconciled us</strong> ( <em> all men</em> , from next verse, where κόσμον is parallel with it) <strong> to Himself by means of Christ</strong> (as an atonement, an expiatory sacrifice, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span> , for sin which made us ἐχθροὶ θεοῦ , see Rom 5:10 ), <strong> and gave</strong> (committed) <strong> to us</strong> (Apostles, not mankind in general; for had it been so, in the next verse, which is parallel, ἐν αὐτοῖς , not ἐν ἡμῖν , must have stood, after αὐτοῖς and αὐτῶν just preceding) <strong> the ministration of the reconciliation</strong> (the duty of ministering in that office, whose peculiar work it is to proclaim this reconciliation: so διακονία τῆς δικαιοσύνης , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:9">2 Corinthians 3:9</span> .
	</p>
<p>Observe, that the reconciliation spoken of in this and the next verse, is that of <em> God to us</em> , absolutely and objectively, through His Son: that whereby He can complacently behold and endure a sinful world, and receive all who come to Him by Christ. This, the subjective reconciliation, <em> of men to God</em> , follows as a matter of exhortation, 2Co 5:20 ),</p>
