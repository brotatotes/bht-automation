Hell. iii. 2. 14, εἰπὼν τῷ φάρακι ὡς ὅτι ὀκνοίη μὴ ὁ Τισσαφ . κ . τ . λ ., and argum. Isocr. Busir. p. 520 (cited by Winer, edn. 6, § 65. 9), κατηγόρουν αὐτοῦ , ὡς ὅτι καινὰ δαιμόνια εἰσφέρει )  God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself (  ἦν καταλλάσσων not exactly = κατήλλασσεν , any more than ἦν κηρύσσων Luke 4:44 = ἐκήρυσσεν : in both cases the habitual state is more emphatically implied than could be done by the imperfect merely: the shade of difference can, however, hardly be expressed in English.

Apostles and teachers)  the word of the reconciliation (as ὁ λόγος ὁ τοῦ σταυροῦ , 1Co 1:18 ).
