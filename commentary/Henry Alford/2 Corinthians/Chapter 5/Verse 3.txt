<b> 3.] seeing that we shall verily be found</b> (shall prove to be)<b> clothed</b> ( ‘<i>having put on clothing,</i>’ viz.<i> a body</i>),<b> not naked</b> (<i>without a body:</i> see this rendering justified in my Greek Test., where I have also discussed the other translations. The verse<i> asserts strongly,</i> with a view to substantiate and explain ver. 2, the<i> truth of the resurrection</i> or<i> glorified body;</i> and I see in it a reference to the deniers of the resurrection, whom the Apostle combated in 1 Cor. xv.: its sense being this: “<i>For I do assert again, that we shall in that day prove to be clothed with a body, and not disembodied spirits.”</i><b> 4.]</b><i> Confirmation and explanation of ver. 2.</i><br><br><b> For also</b> (a reason, why we long to clothe ourselves with our house which is from heaven, as in ver. 2)<b> we who are in this tabernacle</b> (literally, the tabernacle, i.e., before spoken of)<b> do groan, being burdened</b> (not by<i> troubles and</i><i> sufferings</i>, nor by the<i> body itself,</i> which would be directly opposite to the sense: but. for the reason which follows):<b> because we are not willing</b> (literally, as follows)<b> to</b><b> divest ourselves (of it), but to put on (that other) over it, that our mortal part may</b> (not, die, but)<b> be swallowed up by life</b> (absorbed in and transmuted by that glorious principle of life which our new clothing shall superinduce upon us).—The feeling expressed in these verses was one most natural to those who, as the Apostles, regarded the coming of the Lord as<i> near</i>, and conceived the possibility of their living to behold it. It was no terror of death as to its consequences—but a natural reluctance to undergo the<i> mere act of death</i><i> as such,</i> when it was within possibility that this mortal body might be superseded by the immortal one,<i> without it.</i>
