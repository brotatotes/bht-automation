 9, 10. ]  Wherefore (this being so, our confidence, in event whether of death, or of life till the coming of the Lord, being such)  it is also (besides our confidence)  our aim, whether present (dwelling in the body)  or absent (from the body at the time of His appearing),  to be well pleasing to Him, i.e. ‘  whether He find us ἐνδημ .  or ἐκδημ .,  to meet with His approval in that day .’ That this is the sense, the next verse seems to me to shew beyond question. For there he renders a reason for the expressions, and fixes the participles as belonging to the time of His coming. But this meaning has not, that I am aware, been seen by the Commentators, and in consequence, the verse has seemed to be beset with difficulties. The ordinary rendering is represented by Chrys., p. 508, τὸ … ζητούμενον τοῦτό ἐστι , φησίν . ἄν τε ἐκεῖ ὦμεν , ἄν τε ἐνταῦθα , κατὰ γνώμην αὐτοῦ ζῆν · the objection to which of course is, that when  there with Him , there will be  no striving to be εὐάρεστοι αὐτῷ , the acceptance  having taken place . Nor is De Wette’s interpretation free from objection ‘  whether we live till His coming, or we die :’ because no sufficient account is given of the present participles.
	Of all renderings, Meyer’s is in this place the most absurd, misled as he is by his interpretation of 2 Corinthians 5:8 . He would make ἐνδημοῦντες and ἐκδ . here  merely literal , the similitude being dropped: ‘  whether at home, or on travel .’ But, all else aside, can he tell us  where Paul’s home was , subsequently to Acts 9:0 ? For this would be necessary, though he shrinks from any ‘  geographische Bestimmung .’
