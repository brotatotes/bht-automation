<p><strong> 9, 10.</strong> ] <strong> Wherefore</strong> (this being so, our confidence, in event whether of death, or of life till the coming of the Lord, being such) <strong> it is also</strong> (besides our confidence) <strong> our aim, whether present</strong> (dwelling in the body) <strong> or absent</strong> (from the body at the time of His appearing), <strong> to be well pleasing to Him,</strong> i.e. ‘ <em> whether He find us</em> ἐνδημ . <em> or</em> ἐκδημ ., <em> to meet with His approval in that day</em> .’ That this is the sense, the next verse seems to me to shew beyond question. For there he renders a reason for the expressions, and fixes the participles as belonging to the time of His coming. But this meaning has not, that I am aware, been seen by the Commentators, and in consequence, the verse has seemed to be beset with difficulties. The ordinary rendering is represented by Chrys., p. 508, τὸ … ζητούμενον τοῦτό ἐστι , φησίν . ἄν τε ἐκεῖ ὦμεν , ἄν τε ἐνταῦθα , κατὰ γνώμην αὐτοῦ ζῆν · the objection to which of course is, that when <em> there with Him</em> , there will be <em> no striving</em> to be εὐάρεστοι αὐτῷ , the acceptance <em> having taken place</em> . Nor is De Wette’s interpretation free from objection ‘ <em> whether we live till His coming, or we die</em> :’ because no sufficient account is given of the present participles.

<p>Of all renderings, Meyer’s is in this place the most absurd, misled as he is by his interpretation of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:8">2 Corinthians 5:8</span> . He would make ἐνδημοῦντες and ἐκδ . here <em> merely literal</em> , the similitude being dropped: ‘ <em> whether at home, or on travel</em> .’ But, all else aside, can he tell us <em> where Paul’s home was</em> , subsequently to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:0">Acts 9:0</span> ? For this would be necessary, though he shrinks from any ‘ <em> geographische Bestimmung</em> .’</p>
