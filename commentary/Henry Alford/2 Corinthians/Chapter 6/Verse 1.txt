<p><strong> 1.</strong> ] <strong> συνεργοῦντες</strong> , viz. τῷ θεῷ , Whose representatives they were, and Whose grace they recommended. This is implied not only in what went before, but in the τοῦ θεοῦ of our verse itself. Meyer makes it τῷ χριστῷ , referring it to the ὑπὲρ χρ . above: Chrys., Theodoret, Bengel, Olsh., al., ὑμῖν , which certainly would have been <em> expressed</em> , and does not suit the sense, nor Paul’s habit of speaking of the ministry, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span> . Flatt and Emmerling would make the σύν imply, working <em> with our exhortations</em> , aiding them by our example: which sense, though occasionally belonging to σύν and πρός in composition, could hardly have place here without some plainer indication in <em> what went before</em> , of that to which the preposition refers, and would not suit the καί , which severs συνεργ . from παρακαλ .

<p>The δέ is one of transition, introducing a new feature. <strong> Moreover, while working with God, we also exhort, that you</strong> (when preaching to <em> you</em> , or others, when preaching to others: he still is <em> describing his practice</em> in his ministry, not using a direct exhortation to the Corinthians) <strong> receive not</strong> (‘recipiatis;’ not ‘ <em> receperitis</em> ,’ ‘that ye will not <em> have received</em> ,’ i.e. ‘will not by apostasy shew that ye have received …’ as Erasm., al., and De Wette. This mistake arises mainly from regarding the words as <em> directly addressed</em> to the Corinthians instead of a <em> description of his apostolic practice</em> ) <strong> the grace of God</strong> (i.e. the reconciliation above spoken of) <strong> to no purpose</strong> (i.e. unaccompanied by sanctification of life; so Chrys., ἵνα … μὴ νομίσωσιν ὅτι τοῦτό ἐστι καταλλαγὴ μόνον , τὸ πιστεῦσαι τῷ καλοῦντι , ἐπάγει ταῦτα , τὴν περὶ τὸν βίον σπουδὴν ἀπαιτῶν . Hom. xii. p. 521.)</p>
