 10. ] Here even more clearly than before, the first member of the clause ὡς λυπ . ἀεὶ δὲ χαίρ . cannot express the opinion of his adversaries. For however παιδευόμενος might be wrested to signify ‘a man under the chastisement of God’ as a ground of reproach,  λυπούμενος will surely not bear the meaning  solcher der nach gemohnlicher menschlicher Unsicht traurig sehn mußte ,’ ‘one in such a situation, that according to ordinary human estimation he must be wretched,’ as De Wette, but must point to the matter of fact, that he is really ‘  afflicted .’ See reff.
	 πτωχοί again can hardly have been a  reproach , but sets forth the  fact  as poor men, but enriching (not by distribution of alms, as Chrys., Theodoret, Estius, but by imparting spiritual riches, see 1Co 1:5 )  many: as having nothing (in the sense in which οἱ ἔχοντες are ὡς μὴ ἔχοντες , 1 Corinthians 7:29 , in the improper sense of ‘to  possess ’ in which we here use the word  thus , we have nothing, are destitute),  but possessing (finally and as our own, our inheritance never to be taken away; in that sense of the word ‘  to possess ’ which this world’s buyers are  not to use οἱ ἀγοράζοντες , ὡς  μὴ κατέχοντες , 1Co 7:30 )  all things . See a similar ‘possession of all things,’ 1 Corinthians 3:22 ; though this reaches further than even that, to the boundless riches of the heavenly inheritance.
