 2. ]  Ground of the exhortation : viz. the importance of the present time as the day of acceptance, shewn by a Scripture citation.  For he (God, with whom we συνεργοῦμεν and whose grace we recommend)  saith, ‘In an accepted time (Heb. בְּעֵת רָצוֹן , ‘  in a season of grace ’)  I heard thee, and in the day of salvation I helped thee:’ behold (inserted for solemnity to mark the importance of what follows), NOW  is the favourably accepted time ( εὐπρόσδεκτος , a far stronger term than δεκτός , q. d. the  very time of  most favourable acceptance, said from the fulness of his feeling of the greatness of God’s grace),  behold , NOW  is the day of salvation . ὁ γὰρ ἐν τοιούτῳ καιρῷ ἀγωνιζόμενος , ἐν ᾧ τοσαύτη κέχυται δωρεά , ἐν ᾧ τοσαύτη χάρις , εὐκόλως ἐπιτεύξεται τῶν βραβείων . Chrys. p. 522. The prophecy is one directly of the Lord Jesus, as the restorer and gatherer of his people; and the time of acceptance is the interval of the offer of the covenant to men, conceded to Him by the Father.
