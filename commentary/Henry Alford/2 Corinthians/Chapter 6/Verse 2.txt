<b> 2.]</b><i> Ground of the exhortation:</i> viz. the importance of the present time as the day of acceptance, shewn by a Scripture cita-tion.—<b>For He</b> (God, with whom we are fellow-workers, and whose grace we re-commend) saith, “<b>In an accepted time</b> (Heb. ‘<i>in the season of grace</i>’)<b> I heard thee, and in the day of salvation I helped thee:” behold</b> (inserted for solemnity—to mark the importance of what follows),<b> NOW is the favourably-accepted time</b> (the word is a strong term,—the<i> very</i> time of<i> most</i><i> favourable</i> acceptance, said from the ful-ness of his feeling of the greatness of God’s grace);<b> behold</b>,<b> NOW is the day of salva-tion.</b> “For he who striveth in such a time, when so much of God’s gift is shed “abroad, in which grace is so great, shall easily gain the prize.” Chrysostom. The prophecy is one directly of the Lord Jesus, as the restorer and gatherer of his people; and the time of acceptance is the interval of the offer of the covenant to men, con-ceded to Him by the Father.
