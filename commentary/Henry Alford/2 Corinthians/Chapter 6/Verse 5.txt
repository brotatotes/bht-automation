<b> 5.]</b> On<b> stripes</b>, see Acts xvi. 23, and ch. xi. 23, 24.<br><br><b> imprisonments]</b> At Philippi only<i> as yet</i>, as far as we know from the narrative of the Acts;—but there must have been many other occasions, see eh. xi. 23. He<i> may</i> have been imprisoned at Antioch in Pisidia, Acts xiii. 50, and at Lystra, xiv. 19, and at Corinth, xviii, 12, 11: and we cannot tell what may have befallen him during his journeys, Acts xv. 41; xvi. 6; xviii, 23.<br><br><b> in tumults]</b> See Acts xiii. 50; xiv. 5, 19; xvi. 22; xvii. 5; xviii. 12, and above all, xix. 23–41.<br><br><b> labours]</b> The word usually, and here, signifies ‘<i>labour in the Lord</i>,’ for His sake. So also the verb ‘<i>to labour</i>,’ Rom. xvi. 6, 12 (twice), Chrysostom and others interpret it of his manual work, 1 Cor. iv. 12; but see ch. xi. 23, where this can hardly be; it is most probable that the<i> weariness of his excessive apostolic labour</i> was in his mind.<br><br><b> watchings]</b> Chrysostom says, “During the nights in which he taught, or perhaps even wrought with his hands also.” But I would rather believe the<i> watchings</i> to have been<i> watchings through anxiety</i> for the churches.<br><br><b> in fastings]</b> This is generally taken to refer to involuntary hunger and thirst. But the word does not appear to be ever so used; and in ch, xi. 27, Paul himself distinguishes “<i>in fastings</i>” from “<i>in hunger and thirst.</i>” The strict meaning of fastings must therefore be retained.
