<p><strong> φυλακ</strong> .] At Philippi only <em> as yet</em> , as far as we know from the narrative of the Acts; but there must have been many other occasions, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span> . He <em> may</em> have been imprisoned at Antioch in Pisidia, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:50">Acts 13:50</span> , and at Lystra, Act 14:19 and at Corinth, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:12">Acts 18:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:14">Acts 18:14</span> ; and we cannot tell what may have befallen him during his journeys, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:41">Acts 15:41</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:6">Acts 16:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:23">Acts 18:23</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν ἀκαταστ</strong> .] <strong> in tumults</strong> , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:50">Acts 13:50</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:5">Acts 14:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:19">Acts 14:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:22">Acts 16:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:12">Acts 18:12</span> , and above all, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:23-41">Acts 19:23-41</span> . The sense given by Chrys. (p. 522), al., τὸ μηδαμοῦ δύνασθαι στῆναι ἐλαυνόμενον , is philologically allowable, cf. Demosth. 383. 7, ἀκατάστατον ὥσπερ ἐν θαλάττῃ πνεῦμα , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:8">James 1:8</span> , and Polyb. xxxi. 13. 6, ὑποδεικνύων αὐτοῖς τὴν ἀκαταστασίαν τῆς βασιλείας , but not found in N. T.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν κόποις</strong> ] usually, and here, signifies ‘ <em> labour in the Lord</em> ,’ for his sake, see reff. So also <strong> κοπιάω</strong> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:6">Romans 16:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:12">Romans 16:12</span> (bis), and reff. Chrys., al., interpret it of his manual work, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:12">1 Corinthians 4:12</span> ; and ἀστατοῦμεν and κοπιῶμεν occurring there together certainly gives some semblance to the view: but see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span> , where this can hardly be; it is most probable that the <em> weariness of his excessive apostolic labour</em> was in his mind.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀγρυπνίαις</strong> ] Chrys. says, p. 523, τὰς νύκτας ἐν αἷς ἐδίδασκεν . ἢ ὅτι καὶ ἐν αὐταῖς εἰργάζετο . But I would rather believe the ἀγρυπνίαι to have been <em> watchings through anxiety</em> for the churches.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν νηστείαις</strong> ] This is generally, and by De W. against Meyer, taken to refer to involuntary hunger and thirst. But, as the latter remarks, the word does not appear to be ever so used; and in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:27">2 Corinthians 11:27</span> , Paul himself distinguishes ἐν νηστείαις from ἐν λιμῷ κ . δίψει . The meaning of <strong> fastings</strong> must therefore be retained. So Chrys., Theodoret, and Calvin.</p>
