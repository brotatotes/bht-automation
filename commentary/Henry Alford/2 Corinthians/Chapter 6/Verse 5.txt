 5. ] On  πληγ ., see reff.
	 φυλακ .] At Philippi only  as yet , as far as we know from the narrative of the Acts; but there must have been many other occasions, see ch. 2 Corinthians 11:23 . He  may have been imprisoned at Antioch in Pisidia, Acts 13:50 , and at Lystra, Act 14:19 and at Corinth, Acts 18:12 ; Acts 18:14 ; and we cannot tell what may have befallen him during his journeys, Acts 15:41 ; Acts 16:6 ; Acts 18:23 .
	 ἐν ἀκαταστ .]  in tumults , see Acts 13:50 ; Acts 14:5 ; Acts 14:19 ; Acts 16:22 ; Acts 17:5 ; Acts 18:12 , and above all, Acts 19:23-41 . The sense given by Chrys. (p. 522), al., τὸ μηδαμοῦ δύνασθαι στῆναι ἐλαυνόμενον , is philologically allowable, cf. Demosth. 383. 7, ἀκατάστατον ὥσπερ ἐν θαλάττῃ πνεῦμα , and James 1:8 , and Polyb. xxxi. 13. 6, ὑποδεικνύων αὐτοῖς τὴν ἀκαταστασίαν τῆς βασιλείας , but not found in N. T.
	 ἐν κόποις ] usually, and here, signifies ‘  labour in the Lord ,’ for his sake, see reff. So also  κοπιάω , Romans 16:6 ; Romans 16:12 (bis), and reff. Chrys., al., interpret it of his manual work, 1 Corinthians 4:12 ; and ἀστατοῦμεν and κοπιῶμεν occurring there together certainly gives some semblance to the view: but see ch. 2 Corinthians 11:23 , where this can hardly be; it is most probable that the  weariness of his excessive apostolic labour was in his mind.
	 ἀγρυπνίαις ] Chrys. says, p. 523, τὰς νύκτας ἐν αἷς ἐδίδασκεν . ἢ ὅτι καὶ ἐν αὐταῖς εἰργάζετο . But I would rather believe the ἀγρυπνίαι to have been  watchings through anxiety for the churches.
	 ἐν νηστείαις ] This is generally, and by De W. against Meyer, taken to refer to involuntary hunger and thirst. But, as the latter remarks, the word does not appear to be ever so used; and in ch. 2 Corinthians 11:27 , Paul himself distinguishes ἐν νηστείαις from ἐν λιμῷ κ . δίψει . The meaning of  fastings must therefore be retained. So Chrys., Theodoret, and Calvin.
