 6. ] The nine preceding datives (see on 2Co 6:4 ) have expanded ὑπομονῇ . We now resume the main catalogue, with  ἐν ἁγνότητι ,  in purity : which is variously explained: of  bodily chastity , Grot.: of  unselfishness , Theodoret, and Chrys., as an alternative ( ἢ σωφροσύνην … ἢ τὴν ἐν ἅπασι καθαρότητα , ἢ τὸ ἀδωροδόκητον , ἢ καὶ τὸ δωρεὰν τὸ εὐαγγ . κηρύττειν . ib.): I prefer the second of Chrys.’s meanings,  general purity of character , εἰλικρίνεια , unblamableness of life, and singleness of purpose.
	 ἐν γνώσει ]  knowledge of the Gospel , in a high and singular degree; see 1 Corinthians 2:6 ff. So Chrys.: σοφίᾳ τῇ παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ δεδομένῃ .
	 χρηστότητι ]  kindness : a kind and considerate demeanour.
	 ἐν πν  .   ἁγίῳ ]  in the Holy Spirit , as the Power by Whom all these motives are wrought. The omission of the article, aft. ἐν , constitutes no objection to this rendering, as Bp. Middleton (in loc.) supposes: cf. διὰ πν . ἁγίου τοῦ δοθέντος ἡμῖν , Romans 5:5 , and the very same words as these, 1 Thessalonians 1:5 , in both which places the meaning is undoubted; neither of which, however, is noticed by Middleton. The words do not appear to hold any  logical place in the list, any more than ἐν δυν . θεοῦ below.
