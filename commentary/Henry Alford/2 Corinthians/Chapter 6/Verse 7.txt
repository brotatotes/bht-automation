<p><strong> 7.</strong> <strong> ἐν λόγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀληθ</strong> .] is taken by De W., Meyer, al., as subjective, ‘in speaking, or teaching truth’ ‘ <em> in discourse, the contents whereof were truth</em> :’ but their objection against the sense <strong> in the word of truth</strong> , = ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τῆς ἀληθείας , as it is expressed <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span> , is not valid, on account (1) of the government by a preposition, which would make the insertion of the article optional, (2) of the whole catalogue being anarthrous, which would cause the article to be omitted for uniformity’s sake.

<p><strong> ἐν δυν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θεοῦ</strong> ] viz. the Power spoken of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:7">2 Corinthians 4:7</span> , the power manifested in every part of our apostolic working, not merely in miracles.
	</p>
<p><strong> διὰ τ. ὅπλ. τ. δικ</strong> .] <strong> By means of</strong> ( ἐν is changed for διὰ , first apparently <em> on account of</em> τὰ ὅπλα , marking them more distinctly as <em> instruments</em> , and then continued) <strong> the weapons of righteousness</strong> ( <em> belonging to</em> , or as Meyer, <em> furnished by, the righteousness which is of faith</em> . That panoply, <em> part of which</em> only in the more particular specification of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13-17">Ephesians 6:13-17</span> , viz. the θῶραξ , is allotted to δικαιοσύνη , is here <em> all</em> assigned to it.
	</p>
<p>Some of the ancient Commentators, Chrys., Œcum., al., and Grot., Estius, al., understand by ὅπλα , ‘ <em> instruments</em> ,’ as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:13">Romans 6:13</span> , and interpret these instruments to be, <em> situations and opportunities of life</em> , whether prosperous, δεξιά , or adverse, ἀριστερά : but the other interpretation is in better accordance with the Apostle’s habit of comparison, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:4">2 Corinthians 10:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span> ff.; 1Th 5:8 ).

<p><strong> τῶν δεξ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀριστ</strong> .] <strong> which are on the right and left</strong> : i.e. encompassing and guarding the whole person. Grot., Bengel, and most recent Commentators, even De W. and Meyer, explain it, both <em> righthanded</em> , i.e. of <em> attack</em> , the sword and spear, and <em> left-handed</em> , i.e. of <em> defence</em> , the shield: but it seems to me that this would require: τῶν δεξιῶν καὶ τῶν ἀριστερῶν : whereas now, no article being inserted before ἀριστ ., it is implied that <em> the panoply</em> ( τὰ ὅπλα ) is <em> on both sides</em> ( δεξιὰ κ . ἀριστερά ) of the person. On the interpretation <em> prosperity</em> and <em> adversity</em> , see above.</p>
