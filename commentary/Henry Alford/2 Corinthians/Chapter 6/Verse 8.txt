The preposition, once adopted, is kept for the sake of parallelism, though with various shades of meaning. Here it points out the<i> medium through which.</i> Thus understood, these two pairs in ver. 8 will form an easy transition from instrumental, through medial, to the passive characteristics which follow.<br><br><b> as deceivers]</b> From speaking of<i> repute</i>, he passes to the<i> character</i> of the repute.—In all these capacities and under all these representations or misrepresentations, we, as ministers of God, recommend ourselves. In these following clauses a new point is perhaps brought out, viz. the difference of our<i> real state</i> from our<i> reputed one.</i> That this is the case with<i> “as dying, and, behold, we live</i>,” and all following, is of course clear. But is it so with the two clauses preceding that one? Do they mean, ‘<i>as deceivers, and yet true, as unknown, and yet well known</i>,’ or,— ‘<i>as deceivers, and as true men, as unknown, and as well known?</i>’ I own I am not clear on this point: but rather prefer the latter alternative (see in my Greek Test.). In the English text, I have kept literally to the Greek, supplying nothing, but leaving the ambiguity where it was.
