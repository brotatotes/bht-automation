<b> 10.]</b><i> How</i> ‘grief according to God’<i> produces such an effect.</i><b> For</b><b> grief according to God</b> (so literally)<b> works</b> (brings about, promotes, see reff.)<b> repentance unto salvation never to be regretted.</b> The epithet ‘<i>never to be regretted</i>’ belongs not to “<i>repentance</i>,” but to “<i>salvation:</i>” ‘<i>salvation which none will ever regret</i>’ having attained, however difficult it may have been to reach, however dearly it may have been bought.<br><br><b> the sorrow of the world</b>,<b> i.e.</b> ‘<i>the grief felt by the children of this world:</i>’ grief for worldly substance, for character, for bereavement, without regard to God’s hand in it.<br><br><b> worketh death]</b> i.e. death eternal, as contrasted with “<i>salvation</i>:” not ‘<i>deadly sickness,</i>’ or<i> ‘suicide</i>,’ as some explain it. The grief which contemplates nothing but the blow given, and not the God who chastens, can produce nothing but more and more alienation from Him, and result in eternal banishment from His presence. The verbs used in the two clauses differ: the former is rather<b> works</b>, ‘<i>contributes to</i>,’ and the latter<b> works out</b>, ‘<i>results in.’</i>
