 10. ]  How ‘grief according to God’  produces such an effect .  For grief according to God works (brings about, promotes, see ref.)  repentance unto salvation never to be regretted .
	 ἀμεταμέλητον best belongs to σωτηρίαν , as Vulg., Theophyl., Aug [10] , Est., Fritzsche, Meyer, De Wette; not to μετάνοιαν , as most Commentators: not necessarily however from the position of the words, as Meyer and De Wette maintain: for what more common than for the predicate of a substantive ( εἰς σωτηρίαν ) to be placed between it and a qualifying adjective? but on account of the  sense , and the fact that not ἀμετανόητον , but ἀμεταμέλητον is chosen, so that the play in E. V., ‘  repentance not to be repented of ,’ does not seem to have been intended. De W. well explains σωτηρία ἀμεταμέλητος ‘  salvation which none will ever regret ’ having attained, however difficult it may have been to reach, however dearly it may have been bought.

	 ἡ τ  .   κόσμου λύπη ] τί δέ ἐστι , κατὰ κόσμον ; ἐὰν λυπηθῇς διὰ χρήματα , διὰ δόξαν , διὰ τὸν ἀπελθόντα . Chrys. ib.  τοῦ κόσμ  . is  subjective : ‘  the grief felt by the children of this world .’
	 θάνατον ]  Death eternal , as contrasted with  σωτηρίαν : not ‘  deadly sickness ,’ or ‘  suicide ,’ as Theophyl. (in part, πάντως μὲν τὸν ψυχικόν , πολλάκις δὲ καὶ τὸν σωματικόν ), al. The grief which contemplates nothing but the blow given, and not the God who chastens, can produce nothing but more and more alienation from Him, and result in eternal banishment from His presence. So that  ἐργάζ . is rather  works , ‘  contributes to ,’ and  κατεργάζ .,  works out , ‘  results in .’
