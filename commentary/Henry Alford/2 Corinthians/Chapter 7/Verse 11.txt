 11. ]  The blessed effects of godly grief on themselves, as shewn by fact .
	 αὐτὸ τοῦτο ,  this very thing ,  of which I have been speaking .
	 σπουδήν ,  earnestness , as contrasted with your former  carelessness in the matter.
	 ἀλλά ] nay, not σπουδήν merely, that is saying too little;  but …
	 ἀπολογίαν ] viz. to Paul by means of Titus, asserting their innocence in the matter; see below.
	 ἀγανάκτησιν ] πρὸς τὸν πεπορνευκότα . Theophyl.
	 φόβον ] ‘ne cum virga venirem,’ Bengel: fear  of Paul : not here  of God . The context is brought out well by Chrys. and Theophyl. The latter says, on  ἐπιπόθησιν , πρὸς ἐμέ . εἰπὼν δὲ  φόβον , ἵνα μὴ δόξῃ αὐθεντεῖν , συντόμως διωρθώσατο ,  ἐπιπόθησιν εἰπών · ὅπερ ἐνδεικτικὸν ἀγάπης , οὐκ ἐξουσίας .
	 ζῆλον ]  on God’s behalf, to punish the offender;  ἐκδίκησιν being the  infliction of justice itself .
	Bengel remarks, that the six accusatives preceded by ἀλλά fall into three pairs: ἀπολογ . and ἀγανάκτ ., relating to  their own feelings of shame, φόβ . and ἐπιπόθ . to Paul, ζῆλ . and ἐκδίκ . to the  offender.
	 ἐν παντί must be understood only of participation of  guilt : by their negligence, and even refusal to humble themselves ( 1Co 5:2 ), they had in some things made common cause with the offender. Of this, now that they had shewn so different a spirit, the Apostle  does not speak.
	 συνεστήσατε ]  have commended yourselves by proving that ye are; a pregnant construction.
	 τῷ πρ ., the dat. of regard: see Romans 6:20 , and Winer, edn. 6, § 31.1.  k ,  the matter , perhaps, as in ref., not only, ‘of which I have been speaking,’ but with allusion to the  kind of sin which was in question.
	 ἁγνούς ,  pure of stain.
