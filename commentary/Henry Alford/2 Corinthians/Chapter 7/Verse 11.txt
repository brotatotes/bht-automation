<b> 11.]</b><i> The blessed effects of godly grief on themselves, as shewn by fact.</i><br><br><b> this selfsame thing</b>,<i> of which I have been speaking.</i><br><br><b> what carefulness,</b> i.e. earnestness, as contrasted with your former<i> carelessness</i> in the matter.<b></b><br><br><b> yea]</b> nay, not<i> carefulness</i>, merely,—that is saying too little;—<b>but....</b><b> what clearing of yourselves]</b> viz. to Paul by means of Titus, asserting their innocence in the matter; see below.<br><br><b> what indignation]</b> against the offender.<br><br><b> what fear]</b> “lest I should come with a rod,” Bengel:<i> fear of Paul:</i> not here<i> of God.</i> The context is brought well out by<i> Chrysostom</i>. He says, on<b> what longing desire,</b> “meaning, towards myself. Having mentioned<b> fear</b>,—in order that he might not seem to be lording it over them, he immediately sets them right by saying,<b> what longing desire:</b> which last points to love, not to power.”<br><br><b> what zeal]</b><i> on God’s behalf,</i> to punish the offender;—<b>exacting of punishment</b> being the<i> infliction of justice itself.</i> Bengel remarks, that the six nouns preceded by<i> yea</i>, fall into three pairs: the first relating to<i> their own feelings of shame</i>,—the second to<i> Paul</i>, and the third to the<i> offender</i>.<br><br><b> In every thing</b> must be understood only of participation of<i> guilt</i>: by their negligence, and even refusal to humble themselves (1 Cor. v. 2), they had in some things made common cause with the offender. Of this, now that they had shewn so different a spirit, the Apostle<i> does not speak.</i><br><br><b> the matter,</b>—perhaps, not only, ‘of which I have been speaking,’—but with allusion to the<i> kind of sin</i> which was in question.
