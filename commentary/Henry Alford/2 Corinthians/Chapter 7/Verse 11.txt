<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] <em> The blessed effects of godly grief on themselves, as shewn by fact</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> αὐτὸ τοῦτο</strong> , <strong> this very thing</strong> , <em> of which I have been speaking</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> σπουδήν</strong> , <strong> earnestness</strong> , as contrasted with your former <em> carelessness</em> in the matter.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀλλά</strong> ] nay, not σπουδήν merely, that is saying too little; <strong> but</strong> …
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀπολογίαν</strong> ] viz. to Paul by means of Titus, asserting their innocence in the matter; see below.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀγανάκτησιν</strong> ] πρὸς τὸν πεπορνευκότα . Theophyl.
	</p>
<p><strong> φόβον</strong> ] ‘ne cum virga venirem,’ Bengel: fear <em> of Paul</em> : not here <em> of God</em> . The context is brought out well by Chrys. and Theophyl. The latter says, on <strong> ἐπιπόθησιν</strong> , πρὸς ἐμέ . εἰπὼν δὲ <strong> φόβον</strong> , ἵνα μὴ δόξῃ αὐθεντεῖν , συντόμως διωρθώσατο , <strong> ἐπιπόθησιν</strong> εἰπών · ὅπερ ἐνδεικτικὸν ἀγάπης , οὐκ ἐξουσίας .
	</p>
<p><strong> ζῆλον</strong> ] <em> on God’s behalf,</em> to punish the offender; <strong> ἐκδίκησιν</strong> being the <em> infliction of justice itself</em> .
	</p>
<p>Bengel remarks, that the six accusatives preceded by ἀλλά fall into three pairs: ἀπολογ . and ἀγανάκτ ., relating to <em> their own feelings</em> of shame, φόβ . and ἐπιπόθ . to Paul, ζῆλ . and ἐκδίκ . to the <em> offender.
	</em></p>
<p><strong> ἐν παντί</strong> must be understood only of participation of <em> guilt</em> : by their negligence, and even refusal to humble themselves ( 1Co 5:2 ), they had in some things made common cause with the offender. Of this, now that they had shewn so different a spirit, the Apostle <em> does not speak.
	</em></p>
<p><strong> συνεστήσατε</strong> ] <strong> have commended yourselves by proving that ye are;</strong> a pregnant construction.
	</p>
<p><strong> τῷ πρ</strong> ., the dat. of regard: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:20">Romans 6:20</span> , and Winer, edn. 6, § 31.1. <em> k</em> , <strong> the matter</strong> , perhaps, as in ref., not only, ‘of which I have been speaking,’ but with allusion to the <em> kind of sin</em> which was in question.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἁγνούς</strong> , <strong> pure of stain.</strong></p>
