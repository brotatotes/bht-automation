<b> 12.]</b><i> He shews them that to bring out this zeal in them was the real motive of his writing to them, and no private considerations</i>.<br><br><b> Wherefore,</b> i.e. ‘in accordance with the result just mentioned.’<br><br><b> he that suffered wrong</b> would be the<i> father</i> of the incestuous person who “<i>had his father’s wife,</i>” 1 Cor. v. 1.—<b>It would be</b> easy for any of the Apostle’s adversaries to maintain that the reproof had been administered from private and interested motives.<i> But he wrote, in order to bring out their zeal on his behalf</i> (i. e. to obey his command),<i> and make it manifest to themselves in God’s sight.</i> It was not to exhibit to them<i> his</i> zeal for them that he wrote, but to make manifest to them, to bring out among them,<i> their zeal to regard and obey him.</i><br><br><b> 13. For this cause</b> (literally,<b> on this account:</b> on account of the fulfilment of this purpose)<b> we are comforted; but in addition to</b> (or, on the occurrence of)<b> our comfort we rejoiced very much more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.</b> A similar declaration to that in ver. 7, where not only the arrival of Titus, but his comfort wherewith he was comforted by them, is described as the ground of the Apostle’s joy. According to the received reading ( ‘<i>your comfort</i>,’ see A.V.), the sense would hardly represent the real state of things.
