 13. ]  On this account (on account of the fulfilment of this purpose)  we are comforted: but in addition to (or, on the occurrence of)  our comfort, we rejoiced very much more (reff.)  at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all. A similar declaration to that in 2 Corinthians 7:7 , where not only the arrival of Titus, but his comfort wherewith he was comforted by them, is described as the ground of the Apostle’s joy. According to the received reading, the sense is: ‘  Therefore we are consoled on account of your consolation (either gen. subj., ‘that which you feel on account of the good issue of the affair,’ or gen. object., ‘the consolation received from you’):  but we rejoiced very much more ,’ &c. This however would hardly represent the real state of things.
