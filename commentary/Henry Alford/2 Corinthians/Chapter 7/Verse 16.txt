 16. ]  I rejoice (more expressive than with a connecting particle)  that in every thing I am (  re )-  assured by you; ‘am of good courage, in contrast to my former dejection, owing to your good conduct.’ The ordinary rendering, ‘  I can have confidence in you ,’ is wrong in not giving the indic. θαῤῥῶ , and still more, in making θαῤῥεῖν ἐν mean ‘  to have confidence in ,’ which is unexampled. Meyer, who remarks this, does not notice, that the strongest reason against it is not mere want of usage, but the psychological meaning of θαῤῥεῖν , which is not like πεποιθέναι , descriptive of a  relative, but of an  absolute state of mind,  to be of good courage: and this admits only of qualification as to the  ground of that good courage; thus we have θαῤῥεῖν ὑπέρ περί , ἐπί , in the sense of ‘rejoicing at,’ ‘feeling confident concerning:’ but θαῤῥεῖν  ἐν for  ‘to trust in,’ as πεποιθέναι ἐν , would, I think, be inadmissible. Meyer quotes ἐν σοὶ πᾶσ ʼ ἔγωγε σώζομαι , Soph. Aj. 519, where, as here, ἐν gives the  ground of the verb as  in the person spoken of.
