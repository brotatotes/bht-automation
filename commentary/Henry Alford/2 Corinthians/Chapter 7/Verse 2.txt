<b> 2.] Receive</b>, make room for, see above on ch. vi. 13.<br><br><b> wronged no man]</b><i> Reasons why they should make room for him in their hearts</i>:<b> we</b> (when he dwelt among them,—the verbs refer to a set time, not to his course hitherto)<b> wronged no man</b> (in outward acts, namely,—in the exercise of his apostolic authority, or the like),—<b>we ruined no man</b> (this probably also of outward conduct towards others),—<b>we cheated no man.</b>—To understand these verbs as applying to the contents of the former Epistle, is very forced. If “<i>wronged</i>” had really referred to the severe punishment of the incestuous person, “<i>ruined</i>” to the delivering him over to Satan, and “<i>defrauded</i>” to the power which Paul gained over them by this act of authority, surely we should have found more express indication of such reference in the text. But no allusion has<i> as yet</i> been made to the former Epistle; and therefore it is much better to understand the words generally of the time when he resided among them, “In how many ways of which history says nothing, may such ruining of others be laid to the charge of Paul? How easily might his severe visitation of sin, his zeal for eleemosynary collections, his habit of lodging with members of the churches, and the like, have been thus unfavourably characterized!” Meyer.
