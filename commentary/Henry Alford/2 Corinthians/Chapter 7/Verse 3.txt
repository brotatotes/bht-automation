 3. ]  I do not say it ( 2Co 7:2 )  for condemnation (with a condemnatory view, in a spirit of blame: there is no ὑμῶν expressed, nor should it be supplied. He means, ‘I do not say 2Co 7:2 in any but a loving spirit’):  for (and this shews it)  I have said before (viz. ch. 2 Corinthians 6:11 f. see note there)  that ye are in our hearts (this was implied in ἡ καρδία ἡμῶν πεπλάτυνται , 2 Corinthians 6:11 . In the qualifying words, εἰς τὸ συν . κ . τ . λ ., Paul, as Meyer says, is his own commentator),  to die together and live together . This is ordinarily understood, ‘  so that I could die with you or live with you ,’ as Hor., ‘Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens,’ Od. iii. 9. 24: which Meyer controverts, owing to ὑμεῖς being the subject of the sentence, and renders, ‘in order to die and to live with us:’ i.e. ‘if our lot is to die,  in death , and if our lot is to live,  in life , never to be torn from our hearts.’ But to this I would reply, that though ὑμεῖς is the subject of ἐν ταῖς καρδ . ἡμ . ἐστε , it is but an accidental and secondary subject as regards the  whole sentence ; that  they are present in  his heart, is a sign, not of their state of mind, but of  his : therefore the purpose,  εἰς τό , must refer logically to  him , the main subject, of  whom only the  purposes can come into consideration.
