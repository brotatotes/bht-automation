<b> 5.] For</b> gives a reason for the mention of<i> tribulation</i> above:<b> indeed</b> connects with ch. ii. 12, 13, where he has spoken of the trouble which he had before leaving Troas.<b> For indeed</b> (literally, also),<b> after our coming to Macedonia, our flesh had no rest</b> (there is a slight, but very slight distinction, from ‘<i>I had no rest in my spirit</i>,” ch. ii. 12. Titus<i> was now present,</i> so that that source of inquietude was removed; but the outward ones, of tightings generating inward fears (but see below), yet remained. No further distinction must be drawn—for the words “<i>within were fears</i>,” evidently shew that “<i>flesh</i>” must be taken in a wide sense);<b> without, fightings</b> (the omission of “<i>were</i>” renders the description more graphic),<b> within, fears.</b> It is best, as St. Paul speaks of<i> our flesh,</i> to understand<b> without</b> of<i> the state of things without him</i> personally, contentions with adversaries, either within or without the church, and<b> within</b> of<i> that within him</i> personally, fears, for ourselves, for others, or for<i> you</i>, how you might have received our letter.<b></b>
