<b> 8.]</b><b> Because</b> (reason of the joy just expressed)<b> though I even grieved you with</b> (by means of)<b> my epistle, I do not</b> (now)<b> repent</b> (having written it),<b> though I even did repent it</b> (before the coming of Titus). Erasmus and others take the words to mean ‘<i>even supposing I repented it before, which was not the case:’</i> Calvin and others think that the word<b> repent</b> is loosely used for<i> regret</i>. The reason of these departures from grammatical construction and the meaning of words, is, for fear the Apostle should seem to have<i> repented of</i> that which he did under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. But there. is no difficulty, even on the strictest view of inspiration, in conceiving that the Apostle may have afterwards regretted the severity which he was guided to use; we know that Jonah, being directed by inspiration to pronounce the doom cf Nineveh, endeavoured to escape the unwelcome duty: and doubtless St. Paul, as a man, in the weakness of his affection for the Corinthians, was tempted to wish that he had never written that which had given them pain. But the result shewed that God’s Spirit had ordered it well, that he should thus write; and this his repentance was<i> repented of again.</i>
