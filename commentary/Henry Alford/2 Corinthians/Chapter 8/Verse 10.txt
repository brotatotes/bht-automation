<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] 2Co 8:9 was parenthetic: he now resumes the οὐ κατ ʼ ἐπιταγὴν λέγω … <strong> And I give my opinion</strong> [not ‘ <em> judgment</em> ,’ as rendered in the Version of the Five Clergymen, which is objectionable here, as conveying the very idea which the Apostle wishes to negative, that of an authoritative decision] <strong> in this matter</strong> , the stress being on <strong> γνώμην</strong> , as distinguished from ἐπιταγήν .

<p><strong> τοῦτο γὰρ</strong> .…] <strong> For this</strong> (viz. ‘ <em> my giving my opinion, and not commanding</em> ,’ as Billroth and Meyer. De Wette controverts this, and would make τοῦτο refer to the <em> proof of their love</em> in the act of charity, contending that τοῦτο must refer to the same as ἐν τούτῳ . But Meyer rightly answers that this need not be, for ἐν τούτῳ is altogether unemphatic and insignificant, and the whole sense of the clause is in the words γνώμην δίδωμι ) <strong> is expedient for you</strong> (better than <em> “befitting,”</em> or <em> “suitable,”</em> as suggested by Bloomf. after the Schol. ἁρμόζει , συνᾴδει . This sense of συμφέρει is not found in the N. T., and is very doubtful elsewhere. See Palm and Rost’s Lex.), <strong> seeing that you</strong> (‘quippe qui;’ οἵτινες is decisive for the above meaning of τοῦτο . ‘My giving my opinion, rather than commanding, is expedient for you, who have already shewn yourselves so willing.’ A <em> command</em> from me would be a <em> lowering</em> of you, and depreciation of your zeal) <strong> began before them</strong> (the Macedonian churches, see below) <strong> not only the act, but also the mind to act, from a year ago:</strong> i.e. ‘not only were you before them in the deed itself, but also in the will to do it.’

<p>The sense has been missed by many of the Commentators, from not observing the <em> comparison</em> implied in <strong> προενήρξασθε</strong> , and applying it only to the <em> Corinthians themselves</em> beginning. In that case, as the <em> will</em> comes before the <em> deed,</em> to say, you began <em> not only to do, but also to will,</em> would be unmeaning. Some, in consequence, as Grot., al., and the Peschito, have arbitrarily assumed an <em> inversion of terms,</em> so that <em> ‘non solum facere, sed velle’</em> should = <em> ‘non solum velle, sed facere.’</em> Others, as Chrys., Theodoret, al., Erasm., Calv., Beza., al., Billroth, Olsh., Rückert, al. m., have taken θέλειν = <em> ‘to do with a good will,’</em> which is certainly not its sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:11">2 Corinthians 8:11</span> . The above explanation is that of Cajetan, Estius, De Wette, Winer, Meyer, and Wieseler, and puts the climax in its right order, making it a backward one of comparison. For as Wieseler remarks (Chron. Apost. Zeit. p. 364, note), there are <em> three steps</em> in the collection for the saints, the wishing it ( θέλειν ), the setting about it ( ποιῆσαι ), and the completion of it ( ἐπιτελέσαι ). And the Corinthians had begun <em> not only the second,</em> but <em> even the first</em> of these, before the Macedonians. Long employed as they had then been in the matter, it was more creditable to them to receive <em> advice</em> from the Apostle, than <em> command.

<p>“ <strong> θέλειν</strong> is not a historic act like <strong> ποιῆσαι</strong> , but a permanent state: hence the pres. inf.” Meyer.

<p>In saying <strong> ἀπὸ πέρυσι</strong> <em> ‘from last year</em> ,’ it seems probable that Paul would speak as a Jew, regarding the year as beginning in Tisri.</p>
