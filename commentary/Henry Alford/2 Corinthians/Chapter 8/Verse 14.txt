The reference<b></b> is still, as is evident from the next verse, to the supply of<i> temporal wants,</i> in respect of which there should be a mutual relieving and sharing among Christians. But the passage has been curiously misunderstood to mean, ‘<i>that their</i> (the Jewish Christians’)<i> abundance in spiritual things may be imparted to you to supply your deficiency”</i> Thus Chrysostom and others,—the<i> ancients</i> regarding this imparting as the<i> Gospel-benefit</i><i> received from them by the Gentiles</i> (which however was<i> past</i>, not future, and is urged as a<i> motive for gratitude,</i> see Rom. xv. 27), and the modern Romanists introducing the monstrous perversion of the attribution of the merits of the saints to others in the next world. So Estius: ‘This passage of the Apostle shews, against the heretics of our time, that Christians of inferior sanctity may be helped, even in another world, by the merits of the saints. And we may note the virtue of alms, which make a man partaker of the merits of him on whom they are conferred.”
