 15. ]  that there may be equality, as it is written (i.e. according to the expression used in the Scripture history: παράγει παλαιὰν ἱστορίαν , Chrys., of the gathering of the manna)  He that (gathered) much, did not exceed (the measure prescribed by God):  and he that (gathered) little, did not fall short (of it). The fact of  equality being the only point brought into comparison as between the Israelites of old and Christians now, it is superfluous to enquire minutely  how this equality was wrought among the Israelites. The quotation is according to the reading of the LXX generally supported by MSS.; except that ἔλαττον appears for ὀλίγον in A  a secunda manu. Grabe (not F) and the Aldine edition have ᾧ τὸ πολύ and ᾧ τὸ ὀλίγον , probably a correction. The context supplies συλλέξας from the συνέλεξαν in the preceding verse, and is presumed by the Apostle to be familiar to his readers.
