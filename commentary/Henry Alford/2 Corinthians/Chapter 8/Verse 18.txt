 18. ]  ὁ ἀδελφός cannot surely be, as some Commentators (Heumann, Rückert) have understood, ‘  the brother of Titus :’ the delicate nature of the mission would require that there should be at least no family connexion between those sent to fulfil it. This and the other are called in 2 Corinthians 8:23 , ἀδελφοὶ ἡμῶν , and were unquestionably  Christian brethren in the usual sense.  Who this was , we know not. Chrys., Theodoret, Œcum., Luther, Calvin, suppose  Barnabas to be meant; but there is no historical ground for this, and we can hardly suppose him put under Titus. Baronius and Estius suppose,  Silas ; to whom this last objection would also apply; besides that he was well known to the Corinthians, and therefore would not need this recommendation. Orig [12] , Jerome, τινές in Chrys., Ambrose, Pelagius, Primasius, Anselm, Cajetan, Grot., Olsh., al., suppose  Luke : and of these all before Grot. (who pointed out the mistake; which however I see reproduced in Mr. Birks’s Horæ Apostolicæ, p. 242 f.) suppose οὗ ὁ ἔπαινος ἐν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ to refer to his gospel, διὰ τὴν ἱστορίαν ἥνπερ ἔγραψε , Chrys. Hom. xviii. p. 564; but this is altogether without proof, as is the assumption that it was  Mark (Lightfoot, Storr). It may have been  Trophimus , who ( Act 20:4 ) accompanied Paul into Asia, and ( Act 21:29 ) to Jerusalem: so De Wette, Wieseler. If the expression  whose praise in (the matter of)  the Gospel is throughout all the Churches , is to be compared with any similar eulogium, that of Gaius in Rom 16:23 seems to correspond most nearly: Γάϊος ὁ ξένος μου  καὶ ὅλης τῆς ἐκκλησίας : but he was  resident at Corinth , see 1 Corinthians 1:14 . A Gaius, a Macedonian, is mentioned Acts 19:29 , as one of the συνέκδημοι of Paul, as here, together with Aristarchus, which latter we know accompanied him to Jerusalem (but see below on ch. 2Co 9:4 ).
