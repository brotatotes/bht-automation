<b> 18.] the brother</b> cannot surely be, as some Commentators have understood, ‘<i>the brother of Titus</i>:’ the delicate nature of the mission would require that there should be at least no family connexion between those sent to fulfil it. This and the other are called in ver. 23 “<i>our brethren</i>,” and were unquestionably<i> Christian brethren</i> in the usual sense.<i> Who this was</i>, we know not. Chrysostom and others suppose<i> Barnabas</i> to be meant: but there is no historical ground for this, and we can hardly suppose him put under Titus. Others suppose<i> Silas</i>: to whom this last objection would also apply: besides that he was well known to the Corinthians, and therefore would not need this recommendation. Origen, Jerome, and others,<i> Luke</i>:—and of these, all before Grotius (who pointed out the mistake; which however I see lately reproduced in Mr. Birks’s Horæ Apostolicæ, p. 242 f.) suppose the words,<i> “whose praise in the Gospel,”</i> to refer to his<i> gospel</i>, which he wrote;—but this is altogether without proof, as is the assumption by others that it was<i> Mark</i>. It may have been<i> Trophimus</i>, who (Acts xx. 4) accompanied Paul into Asia, and (xxi. 29) to Jerusalem: so De Wette and Wieseler. If the expression<b> whose praise in</b> (the matter of)<b> the Gospel is throughout all the Churches</b>, is to be compared with any similar eulogium, that of Gaius in Rom. xvi. 23, seems to correspond most nearly: “<i>Gaius, mine host and [the host] of the whole church:</i>” but he was<i> resident at Corinth</i>, see 1 Cor. i. 14. A Gaius, a Macedonian, is mentioned Acts xix. 29, as one of the fellow-travellers of Paul, as here, together with Aristarchus, which latter we know accompanied him to Jerusalem (but see below on ch. ix. 4).—It must then rest in uncertainty.
