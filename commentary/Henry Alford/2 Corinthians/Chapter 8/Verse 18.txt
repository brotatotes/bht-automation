<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] <strong> ὁ ἀδελφός</strong> cannot surely be, as some Commentators (Heumann, Rückert) have understood, ‘ <em> the brother of Titus</em> :’ the delicate nature of the mission would require that there should be at least no family connexion between those sent to fulfil it. This and the other are called in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23">2 Corinthians 8:23</span> , ἀδελφοὶ ἡμῶν , and were unquestionably <em> Christian brethren</em> in the usual sense. <em> Who this was</em> , we know not. Chrys., Theodoret, Œcum., Luther, Calvin, suppose <em> Barnabas</em> to be meant; but there is no historical ground for this, and we can hardly suppose him put under Titus. Baronius and Estius suppose, <em> Silas</em> ; to whom this last objection would also apply; besides that he was well known to the Corinthians, and therefore would not need this recommendation. Orig [12] , Jerome, τινές in Chrys., Ambrose, Pelagius, Primasius, Anselm, Cajetan, Grot., Olsh., al., suppose <em> Luke</em> : and of these all before Grot. (who pointed out the mistake; which however I see reproduced in Mr. Birks’s Horæ Apostolicæ, p. 242 f.) suppose οὗ ὁ ἔπαινος ἐν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ to refer to his gospel, διὰ τὴν ἱστορίαν ἥνπερ ἔγραψε , Chrys. Hom. xviii. p. 564; but this is altogether without proof, as is the assumption that it was <em> Mark</em> (Lightfoot, Storr). It may have been <em> Trophimus</em> , who ( Act 20:4 ) accompanied Paul into Asia, and ( Act 21:29 ) to Jerusalem: so De Wette, Wieseler. If the expression <strong> whose praise in</strong> (the matter of) <strong> the Gospel is throughout all the Churches</strong> , is to be compared with any similar eulogium, that of Gaius in Rom 16:23 seems to correspond most nearly: Γάϊος ὁ ξένος μου <strong> καὶ ὅλης τῆς ἐκκλησίας</strong> : but he was <em> resident at Corinth</em> , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span> . A Gaius, a Macedonian, is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span> , as one of the συνέκδημοι of Paul, as here, together with Aristarchus, which latter we know accompanied him to Jerusalem (but see below on ch. 2Co 9:4 ).
