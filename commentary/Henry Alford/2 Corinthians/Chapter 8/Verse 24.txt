<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] <strong> Shew then to them the proof of your love</strong> (‘to us,’ or perhaps, ‘ <em> to your poor brethren</em> ’ (Meyer): but the word has not been so used throughout this passage, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:7">2 Corinthians 8:7</span> ; χάρις has been the word), <strong> and of our boasting concerning you, in the sight of the churches</strong> . I may remark, (1) that the participial construction is elliptic, as in Rom 12:16 al. (2) That πρόσωπον τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν does not actually <em> import</em> ‘the representatives of the churches,’ as Meyer (which would be τὸ πρόσωπον or τὰ πρόσωπα , without εἰς ), but as above, it being <em> implied</em> that they, being the ἀπόστολοι τ . ἐκκλ ., <em> are such representatives</em> . And this is all that Theodoret seems to mean, whom Meyer quotes in support of his view: τὸ πρόσωπον γὰρ τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν ἐπέχουσιν οὗτοι τῶν πεμψασῶν αὐτούς .</p>
