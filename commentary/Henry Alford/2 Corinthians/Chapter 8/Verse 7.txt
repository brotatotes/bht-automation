 7. ] ἀλλά marks the transition to an exhortation, as in reff. It at the same time implies, as Herm. ad Viger. p. 812 (in Meyer), ‘satis argumentorum allatum esse.’
	 πίστει , see ch. 2 Corinthians 1:24 .
	 λόγῳ κ  .   γνώσει see ref. and for γν ., 1 Corinthians 8:1 .
	 πάσῃ σπουδῇ , because σπουδή may be manifold even in a good sense. Grot. well explains it, ‘stadium ad agendas res bonas.’
	 τῇ ἐξ ὑμ  .   ἐν ἡμ  .   ἀγ .]  your love to us; the love which, arising from you, has us for its object: see reff. According to the reading, ἐξ ἡμῶν ἐν ὑμ ., the only meaning agreeing with the context is,  ‘the love (to God and man)  which, arising from our teaching, is planted in you.’
	 ἵνα καὶ κ . τ . λ .] the sense is  imperative , κελεύω , or βούλομαι , (or  βλέπετε , see 1 Corinthians 16:10 ,) being omitted. So Soph. Œd. Col. 156, ἀλλ ʼ ἵνα τῷδ ʼ ἐν ἀφθέγκτῳ , μὴ προσπέσῃς νάπει . See Hartung, Partikellehre, ii. 148, 9.
	 ταύτῃ is emphatic here, although ταύτην is not in 2 Corinthians 8:6 ; ‘  this grace also;’ other graces having been enumerated.
	Grotius remarks, ‘non ignoravit Paulus artem rhetorum, movere laudando.’
