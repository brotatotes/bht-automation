<b> 1.]</b> The connexion with the last verse is thus, ‘I beseech you to receive the brethren whom I send, courteously: for concerning the<i> duty of ministration to the saints,</i> it is surely superfluous for me to write to you who are so prompt already.” No new subject begins, as some have supposed; nor is there any break in the sense at all. Some obscurity has been introduced unnecessarily, by taking<b> the ministration for the saints</b> for<i> merely this collection which is now making</i>: whereas the Apostle chooses such general terms as a mild reproof to the Corinthians, who, well aware as they were of the duty of ministering to the saints, were yet somewhat remiss in this particular example of the duty. There is an emphasis on<b> write</b>, inasmuch as those who carried this letter would be present witnesses of their conduct.
