<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] <em> Assurance that God</em> will <em> do this</em> . <strong> But</strong> (introduces the new assurance) <strong> He that ministers seed to the sower and bread for eating</strong> (in the physical world: from ref. Isa., LXX. The Vulg., E. V., Luther, Calv., Grot., al., commit the mistake of joining κ . ἄρτον εἰς βρῶσιν with χορηγήσαι , or - ει . <strong> βρῶσις</strong> , <em> the act of eating</em> : not = βρῶμα ), <strong> shall supply and multiply your seed</strong> (i.e. the money for you to bestow, answering to σπέρμα τῷ σπείροντι ), <strong> and will increase the fruits of your righteousness</strong> (from ref. Hos. the everlasting reward for your bestowals in Christ’s name, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:42">Matthew 10:42</span> ; answering to ἄρτον εἰς βρῶσιν , which is the <em> result</em> of the sower’s labours).</p>
