 14. ] The construction is very difficult. δεήσει may depend on περισσεύουσα , 2 Corinthians 9:12 (but then we should expect διὰ as there), or on δοξάζοντες (but then it should also depend on ἐπί and they could not be said to glorify God  for their own prayers. If on δοξάζοντες as the instrument whereby, it seems strange that αὐτῶν Should be expressed), or αὐτῶν δεήσει ὑπὲρ ὑμ . ἐπιπ . ὑμ . may be (as Meyer) a gen. absol., ‘  while they desire you in prayers for you ’ (but this seems forced, and as De W. observes, would require τῇ either before or after δεήσει ). In the midst of these difficulties I see no way but this: the datives preceding, ὑποταγῇ and ἁπλότητι , have occasioned this also to be expressed in the dative, as though it depended on ἐπί , whereas it is in reality parallel with διὰ πολλῶν εὐχαριστιῶν and dependent on περισσεύουσα . Again, the words in another point of view are parallel with τῇ ὑποταγῇ and ἁπλότητι , inasmuch as these are  ὑμῶν , and this δέησις is αὐτῶν . Amidst such complicated antitheses and attracted constructions, it may suffice if we discover the  clue to the original formation of the sentence: the  meaning is obvious enough, viz. that  glory also accrues to God by the prayers of the recipients, who are moved with the desire of Christian love (reff.)  to you, on account of the grace of God which abounds eminently towards (over)  you (  ἐφ  ʼ   ὑμ . belonging to  ὑπερβ  . not to  χάριν , which would, but not of absolute necessity, require τήν ).
