<p><strong> 14.</strong> ] The construction is very difficult. δεήσει may depend on περισσεύουσα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:12">2 Corinthians 9:12</span> (but then we should expect διὰ as there), or on δοξάζοντες (but then it should also depend on ἐπί and they could not be said to glorify God <em> for</em> their own prayers. If on δοξάζοντες as the instrument whereby, it seems strange that αὐτῶν Should be expressed), or αὐτῶν δεήσει ὑπὲρ ὑμ . ἐπιπ . ὑμ . may be (as Meyer) a gen. absol., ‘ <em> while they desire you in prayers for you</em> ’ (but this seems forced, and as De W. observes, would require τῇ either before or after δεήσει ). In the midst of these difficulties I see no way but this: the datives preceding, ὑποταγῇ and ἁπλότητι , have occasioned this also to be expressed in the dative, as though it depended on ἐπί , whereas it is in reality parallel with διὰ πολλῶν εὐχαριστιῶν and dependent on περισσεύουσα . Again, the words in another point of view are parallel with τῇ ὑποταγῇ and ἁπλότητι , inasmuch as these are <strong> ὑμῶν</strong> , and this δέησις is αὐτῶν . Amidst such complicated antitheses and attracted constructions, it may suffice if we discover the <em> clue</em> to the original formation of the sentence: the <em> meaning</em> is obvious enough, viz. that <strong> glory also accrues to God by the prayers of the recipients, who are moved with the desire of Christian love</strong> (reff.) <strong> to you, on account of the grace of God which abounds eminently towards</strong> (over) <strong> you</strong> ( <strong> ἐφ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ὑμ</strong> . belonging to <strong> ὑπερβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> not to <strong> χάριν</strong> , which would, but not of absolute necessity, require τήν ).</p>
