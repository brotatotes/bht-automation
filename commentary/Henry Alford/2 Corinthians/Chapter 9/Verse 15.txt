 15. ] Having entered, in the three last verses, deeply into the thankful spirit which would be produced in these recipients of the bounty of the Corinthians,  he concludes with an ascription , in the spirit also of a thankful recipient,  of unfeigned thanks to Him, who hath enriched us by the gift of His only Son, which brings with it that of all things else ( Rom 8:32 ), and is, in all its wonders of grace and riches of mercy, truly  ineffable , ἀνεκδιήγητος . It is impossible to apply such a term, so emphatically placed as here, to any gift short of THAT ONE. And the ascription, as coming from Paul’s fervent spirit, is very natural in this connexion. This interpretation is preferred by Chrys. Hom. xx. p. 579 f. ( δωρεὰν δὲ ἐνταῦθα λέγει καὶ τὰ τοσαῦτα ἀγαθὰ τὰ διὰ τῆς ἐλεημοσύνης γινόμενα καὶ τοῖς λαμβάνουσι καὶ τοῖς παρέχουσιν · ἢ τὰ ἀπόῤῥητα ἀγαθὰ τὰ διὰ τῆς παρουσίας αὐτοῦ τῇ οἰκουμένῃ πάσῃ μετὰ πολλῆς δωρηθέντα τῆς φιλοτιμίας · ὃ καὶ μάλιστὰ ἐστιν ὑποπτεῦσαι . ἵνα γὰρ καὶ καταστείλῃ , καὶ δαψιλεστέρους ἐργάσηται , ὧν ἔτυχον παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ , τούτων αὐτούς ἀναμιμνήσκει . καὶ γὰρ μέγιστον τοῦτο εἰς προτροπὴν ἀρετῆς ἁπάσης · διὸ καὶ ἐνταῦθα τὸν λόγον κατέκλεισεν ), and Thl. who, after beginning as Chrys., proceeds: ἡ καὶ τῶν ἀγαθῶν ἀναμιμνήσκει ὧν ἠξιώθημεν διὰ τῆς σαρκώσεως τοῦ χριστοῦ , ὡσανεὶ τοιαῦτα λέγων Μηδὲν μέγα νομίσητε ὑμεῖς ποιεῖν · ἀνεκδιήγητα γάρ εἰσι τὰ ἀγαθὰ ἃ ἐλάβομεν παρὰ θεοῦ · καὶ εἰ ὀλίγα καὶ φθαρτὰ δῶμεν , τί μέγα ;) It is also given by Bengel (“Deus nobis dedit abundantiam bonorum internorum et externorum, quæ et ipsa est inenarrabilis, et fructus habet consimiles”), Meyer, al. The other explanation (see Chrys. above) is that of Calv., Grot., Est., al.
