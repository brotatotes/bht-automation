<b> 5.]</b><b> I therefore</b> (because of ver. 4)<b> thought it necessary to exhort the brethren</b> (Titus and the two others),<b> that they should go before (my coming) unto you, and previously prepare your long announced beneficence</b> (i. e. long announced by me to the Macedonians, ver. 2.<br><br><b> beneficence</b>, literally,<b> blessing</b>; not used only of a blessing in<i> words</i>, but of one expressed by a<i> present,</i> as Gen. xxxiii. 11; Judg. i. 15. This sense of<i> blessing</i>, combined with the primitive sense, affords the Apostle an opportunity for bringing out the true spirit in which Christian gifts should be given),<b> that this same may be ready in such sort as beneficence, and not as covetousness</b> (i. e. as the fruit of blessing, poured out from a beneficent mind, not of a sparing covetous spirit which gives no more than it need).<br><br><b> this]</b> Some supply ‘<i>I say</i>,’ as 1 Cor. vii. 29. But I would rather take it as an imperfect construction, in which<b> this</b> is used merely to point at the sentiment which is about to follow:—<b>But this— (is true)</b>, or<b> But (notice) this....</b><br><br><b> with blessings]</b> This refers to the<i> spirit</i> of the giver, who must be ‘<i>a cheerful giver</i>,’ not giving murmuringly, but<i> with blessings,</i> with a beneficent charitable spirit: such an one shall reap also with blessings, abundant and unspeakable. The only change of meaning in the second use of the expression is that the<i> blessings</i> are<i> poured on him,</i> whereas in the first they<i> proceeded from him:</i> in both cases they are the element in which he works. So, we<i> bestow</i> the seed, but<i> receive</i> the harvest. The spirit with which we<i> sow</i>, is of ourselves: that with which we<i> reap</i>, depends on the<i> harvest</i>. So that the change of meaning is not arbitrary, but dependent on the nature of things.
