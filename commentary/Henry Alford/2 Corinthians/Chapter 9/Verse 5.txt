 5. ]  I therefore (because of 2Co 9:4 )  thought it necessary to exhort the brethren (Titus and the two others)  that they would go before (my coming)  to you, and previously prepare your long announced beneficence (i.e. long announced by me to the Macedonians, 2 Corinthians 9:2 .
	 εὐλογία ,  blessing ; not used only of a blessing in  words , but of one expressed by a  present , as Genesis 33:11 ; Judges 1:15 . (See Stanley.) But beware of the blunder of connecting it with εὖ and λογία , ‘  a good collection .’ This sense of  blessing , combined with the primitive sense, affords the Apostle an opportunity for bringing out the true spirit in which Christian gifts should be given),  that this same may be ready (the construction is unusual: ταύτην refers back to εὐλ . and the inf. must have ὥστε supplied. De W. compares Hebrews 5:5 . Perhaps the nearest is Col 4:6 )  in such sort as beneficence, and not as covetousness (i.e. as the fruit of blessing, poured out from a beneficent mind, not of a sparing covetous spirit which gives no more than it need. There is no need to alter the primitive meaning, or to make the  word signify ‘tenacity,’ as Calv., De Wette, al.: he who defrauds the poor by stinting them πλεονεκτεῖ , in the literal sense. Still less must we with Chrys., al., refer πλεονεξ . to the Apostle, μὴ νομίσητε , φησίν , ὅτι ὡς πλεονεκτοῦντες αὐτὴν λαμβάνομεν , Hom xix. p. 573, which is inconsistent with the interpretation φειδομένως below, and with εὐλογίαν , the corresponding word, which applies to the  spirit of the givers).
