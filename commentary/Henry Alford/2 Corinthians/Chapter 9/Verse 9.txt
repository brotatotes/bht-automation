<p><strong> 9.</strong> ] <strong> as it is written</strong> (i.e. fulfilling the character described in Scripture), <strong> He scattered abroad</strong> (metaph. from <em> seed</em> : μετὰ δαψιλείας ἔδωκε , Chrys.), <strong> he gave to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever</strong> . In what sense is δικαιοσύνη used? Clearly in the only one warranted by the context that of ‘ <em> goodness proved by beneficence</em> ,’ ‘a righteous deed, which shall not be forgotten, as a sign of righteousness in character and conduct.’ To build any inference from the text inconsistent with the great truths respecting δικαιοσύνη ever insisted on by Paul (as Chrys., p 574, καὶ γὰρ δικαίους ποιεῖ ( ἡ φιλανθρωπία ), τὰ ἁμαρτήματα καθάπερ πῦρ ἀναλίσκουσα , ὅταν μετὰ δαψιλείας ἐκχέηται ) is a manifest perversion.</p>
