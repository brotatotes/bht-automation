 9. ]  as it is written (i.e. fulfilling the character described in Scripture),  He scattered abroad (metaph. from  seed : μετὰ δαψιλείας ἔδωκε , Chrys.),  he gave to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever . In what sense is δικαιοσύνη used? Clearly in the only one warranted by the context that of ‘  goodness proved by beneficence ,’ ‘a righteous deed, which shall not be forgotten, as a sign of righteousness in character and conduct.’ To build any inference from the text inconsistent with the great truths respecting δικαιοσύνη ever insisted on by Paul (as Chrys., p 574, καὶ γὰρ δικαίους ποιεῖ ( ἡ φιλανθρωπία ), τὰ ἁμαρτήματα καθάπερ πῦρ ἀναλίσκουσα , ὅταν μετὰ δαψιλείας ἐκχέηται ) is a manifest perversion.
