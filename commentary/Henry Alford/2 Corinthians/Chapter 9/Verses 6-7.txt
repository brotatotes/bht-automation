<p><strong> 6, 7.</strong> ] <em> He enforces the last words by an assurance grounded in Scripture and partly cited from it, that as we sow, so shall we reap</em> .

<p><strong> τοῦτο</strong> ] Some supply φημί , as in ref.: others, as Meyer, would take it as an accus. absol., ‘ <em> as regards this</em> ,’ viz. what has gone before. But I would rather take it as an imperfect construction, in which τοῦτο is used merely to point at the sentiment which is about to follow: <strong> But this (is true), or But (notice) this</strong> …

V. μετὰ δαψιλείας , <em> bountifully</em> : which gives indeed the <em> sense</em> , but misses the meaning of the expression: see above. It refers to the <em> spirit</em> of the giver, who must be ἱλαρὸς δότης , not giving murmuringly, but <em> with blessings</em> , with a beneficent charitable spirit: such an one shall reap also with blessings, abundant and unspeakable. The only change of meaning in the second use of the expression is that the εὐλογίαι are <em> poured on him</em> , whereas in the first they <em> proceeded from him</em> : in both cases they are the element in which he works. So, we <em> bestow</em> the seed, but <em> receive</em> the harvest. The spirit with which we <em> sow</em> , is of ourselves: that with which we <em> reap</em> , depends on the <em> harvest</em> . So that the change of meaning is not arbitrary, but dependent on the nature of things.
