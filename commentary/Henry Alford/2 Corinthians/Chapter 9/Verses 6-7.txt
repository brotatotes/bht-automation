 6, 7. ]  He enforces the last words by an assurance grounded in Scripture and partly cited from it, that as we sow, so shall we reap .

V. μετὰ δαψιλείας ,  bountifully : which gives indeed the  sense , but misses the meaning of the expression: see above. It refers to the  spirit of the giver, who must be ἱλαρὸς δότης , not giving murmuringly, but  with blessings , with a beneficent charitable spirit: such an one shall reap also with blessings, abundant and unspeakable. The only change of meaning in the second use of the expression is that the εὐλογίαι are  poured on him , whereas in the first they  proceeded from him : in both cases they are the element in which he works. So, we  bestow the seed, but  receive the harvest. The spirit with which we  sow , is of ourselves: that with which we  reap , depends on the  harvest . So that the change of meaning is not arbitrary, but dependent on the nature of things.
