<b> 21.</b>]<i> Parting warning against idols.</i><b> Little children</b> (he parts from them with his warmest and most affectionate word of address),<b> keep yourselves from idols</b> (or more literally,<b> from the idols</b>, viz. which are about you. The<b> idol</b> is properly a figure of an<i> imaginary</i> deity,—while an<i> image</i>, or<i> likeness</i>, is that of some real person or thing made into an object of worship. See Rom. i. 23, 1 Cor. x. 19, xii. 2, and especially 1 Thess. i. 9, where, as here, “<i>the living and true God</i>” is opposed to<i> idols</i>. And there seems no justification for the departing from the plain literal sense in this place. All around the Christian Church was heathenism: the born of God, and they that were lying in the wicked one, were the only two classes: those who went out of one, went into the other: God’s children are thus then finally warned of the consequence of letting go the only true God, in whom they can only abide by abiding in His Son Jesus Christ, in these solemn terms,—to leave on their minds a wholesome terror of any the least deviation from the truth of God, seeing into what relapse it would plunge them).<h1 class="new-page" id="2 JohnTOC"><a href="#2 John"> 2 John</a></h1><table><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tr><td><h2><a href="#2 John 1"> Chapter 1</a></h2></td></tr></table><h1 class="new-page" id="2 John"> The Second Epistle Of John</h1>
