<b> 11.</b>]<b> for he that biddeth him good speed partaketh in his evil deeds</b> (these words must be understood with their right reference: “not of men who have never had any relation with the church,—1 Cor. v. 10,—but of men who wish to be thought brethren, and overthrow the truth,” as Grotius says. These were not, to be received with the<i> hospitality</i> with which all Christian brethren were to be entertained. Such reception of them would in fact be only opening an inlet for their influence. But this is not the point on which the Apostle mainly dwells. It is the participation which the host in such a case would incur with them and their antichristian designs, by encouraging them. And this is further impressed by the caution against saying<i> good speed</i> to them: which is a further intensification of the exclusion from the house, and forms a climax,—do not even by wishing him good speed, which, if spoken by a Christian, would mean<i> God</i> speed,—identify yourselves with his course and fortunes. If you do, you pronounce approval of his evil deeds, and so far share his guilt, advancing their success by your wishes for it.
