 4 .]  I rejoiced greatly (at some definite time indicated by the aor.,  perhaps : and so it is taken by Huther and Düsterdieck; but it may also be the epistolary aor., as ἔγραψα so often: and this is made more probable by the perf. εὕρηκα which follows. See however 3Jn 1:3 ),  that I have found (there is not a word nor a hint of the assumption of Sander, that this finding was the result of proof and trial. The most obvious interpretation is, that at some place where the Apostle was, he  came upon these who are presently mentioned: as in Acts 18:2 , ( ὁ Παῦλος ) … ἦλθεν εἰς Κόρινθον · καὶ  εὑρών τινα Ἰουδαῖον ὀν .
