<p><strong> 4</strong> .] <strong> I rejoiced greatly</strong> (at some definite time indicated by the aor., <em> perhaps</em> : and so it is taken by Huther and Düsterdieck; but it may also be the epistolary aor., as ἔγραψα so often: and this is made more probable by the perf. εὕρηκα which follows. See however 3Jn 1:3 ), <strong> that I have found</strong> (there is not a word nor a hint of the assumption of Sander, that this finding was the result of proof and trial. The most obvious interpretation is, that at some place where the Apostle was, he <em> came upon</em> these who are presently mentioned: as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:2">Acts 18:2</span> , ( ὁ Παῦλος ) … ἦλθεν εἰς Κόρινθον · καὶ <strong> εὑρών</strong> τινα Ἰουδαῖον ὀν . Ἀκύλαν , κ . τ . λ .) <strong> of thy children</strong> (no τινάς is needed as a supply: it is contained in the participle which follows) <strong> walking in truth</strong> (i. e. not only in honesty and uprightness, but in that truth which is derived from and is part of the truth of God and Christ: see above on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:1">2 John 1:1</span> .

<p>Again, there is no hint whatever given that the rest, or that others, of her children were not walking in truth. The Apostle apparently, as above, in some place where he was, lit upon these children of the κυρία , and sends her their good report. Respecting the rest, he makes no mention nor insinuation) <strong> according as we received commandment from the Father</strong> (viz. to walk in the truth: not, as Lücke, to love one another, making this clause a further description of the manner in which they were walking in truth. And τοῦ πατρός must not be taken with Œc., πατέρα νῦν · τὸν χριστὸν καλεῖ , ἐπεὶ καὶ πατήρ ἐστι τῶν διὰ τῆς οἰκονομίας αὐτῷ παρὰ τοῦ ἑαυτοῦ πατρὸς δοθέντων υἱῶν , which is unlikely and unprecedented, but as applying to the Father, as in 2Jn 1:6 ).</p>
