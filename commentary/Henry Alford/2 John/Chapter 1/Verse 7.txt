<b> 7.</b>]<b> Because many deceivers</b> (makers to wander)<b> went forth</b> (here probably, on account of the past tense, “<i>from us,</i>” as in 1 John ii. 19. In 1 John iv. 1, it is perfect, “<i>are gone forth,</i>” where I have preferred the sense, “are gone forth from him who sent them,” viz. the evil one. Huther prefers this latter sense here also)<b> into the world,</b> [<b>namely</b>]<b> they who confess not</b> (instead of “<i>not confessing,</i>” the Apostle writes<b> they who confess not,</b> thereby not merely characterizing the<i> deceivers</i> as not confessing, but absolutely identifying all who repudiate the confession which follows, as belonging to the class of<i> deceivers</i>)<b> Jesus Christ coming in</b> [<b>the</b>]<b> flesh</b> (<b>coming</b>, altogether timeless, and representing the great truth of the Incarnation itself, as distinguished from its historical manifestation [1 John v. 6], and from the abiding effect of that historical manifestation [1 John iv. 2]. He who denies the<i> coming in the flesh</i>, denies the<i><b> possibility</b></i> of the Incarnation: he who denies the<i> having come</i>, denies its<i> actuality</i>).<b> This</b> (viz. “he that fulfils the above character”) is the deceiver and the anti-christ (see notes on 1 John ii. 18, 22, as to the personal relation of these “<i>many</i>” to the one great Antichrist of prophecy. The word<b> this</b>, pointing to a class, makes each one of these, in his place, a representative and “precursor of Antichrist”).
