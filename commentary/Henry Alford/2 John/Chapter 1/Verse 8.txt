<b> 8.</b>] The warming is suddenly introduced without any coupling particle, and becomes thereby so much the more solemn and forcible.<b> Look to yourselves</b> (<b>yourselves</b> here probably implies not as Bengel,<i> during my absence</i>, but “yourselves,” as contrasted with the deceivers, that ye too become not as they),<b> that ye lose not the things which ye wrought</b> (the reading of this is somewhat uncertain. We had better give the explanation of all three forms, 1)<i> “that</i><b> ye</b><i> lose not the things which</i><b> we</b><i> wrought,”</i> i.e. that ye, Christian converts, lose not that your Christian state of truth and love which we, Apostles and Teachers, wrought in you. The Apostles were God’s<i> workmen</i>, Matt. ix. 37; 2 Tim. ii. 15:<i> the false apostles were crafty workmen</i>, 2 Cor. xi. 13;<i> bad workmen</i>, Phil. iii. 2: the true<i> work</i> was to cause men to believe on Christ, John vi. 29: and this<i> work</i> the false teachers put in peril of loss. If 2) the whole be in the first person, “<i>that</i><b> we</b><i> lose not the things which</i><b> we</b><i> wrought,</i>” then the<i> apostolic</i> reward, the souls which are to be their hire, must be understood: if 3) in the secend,—<i> “that</i><b> ye</b><i> lose not the things which</i><b> ye</b><i> wrought,”</i>—no human merit, but the reward laid up for faithfulness, and for every thing done in His name, must ho understood, which is reckoned of grace, and not of debt),<b> but receive reward in</b><b> full</b> (the connexion of<i> work</i> with<i> reward</i> must not be broken. The idea is a complex one. Ye, our converts, are our<i> reward</i> in the day of the Lord: and this has suggested thé use of the well-known word, even where it manifestly applies not to the teachers but to the taught, whose<i> reward</i> is the eternal life, which shall receive on that day its glorious completion: which is<i> having the Son and the Father</i>: see 1 John iii. 2.—If readings 1) or 2) be right, the use which Roman-Catholic expositors have tried to make of this verse to establish the merit of human works falls at once to the ground. Nor indeed does it fare much better if the other reading be taken).
