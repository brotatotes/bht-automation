<p><strong> 10, 11</strong> .] The exercise of the love of the brethren is conditioned and limited by the truth: and is not to be extended to those who are enemies and impugners of the truth. Those who harbour or encourage such, make common cause with them, and their evil deeds. <strong> If any cometh to you, and bringeth not</strong> (the indic. after εἰ shews that the case supposed actually existed: that such persons were sure to come to them: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:12">John 11:12</span> , 2Co 2:5 , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:11">1 John 4:11</span> . It is not = ἐάν with subj., which always carries a purely hypothetical force, corresponding to an interrogation, whereas the other corresponds to an assertion: e. g. in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:15">1 John 2:15</span> , ἐάν τις ἀγαπᾷ τὸν κόσμον , which may be resolved, “Does any among you love the world? If he do,” &amp;c. On the other hand, εἴ τις ἔρχεται πρὸς ὑμᾶς may be resolved, “Some will come to you,” &amp;c., “If any does,” &amp;c.) <strong> this doctrine</strong> (the expression ταύτην τὴν διδαχὴν <strong> οὐ φέρει</strong> points out the person as a teacher, not a mere traveller seeking hospitality. And the <strong> οὐ</strong> , not μή , distinctly reverses the φέρει : he not only comes without this doctrine, but by so doing brings the contrary doctrine. The absence of testimony for the truth is, in one who brings any testimony at all, equivalent to testifying for error), <strong> receive him not into (your) house, and do not bid him good speed: for he that biddeth him good speed, partaketh in his evil deeds</strong> (these words must be understood with their right reference: “non de iis qui alieni semper fuerunt ab ecclesia, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:10">1 Corinthians 5:10</span> , sed de iis qui volunt fratres haberi et doctrinam evertunt,” as Grot. These were not to be received with the φιλοξενία with which all Christian brethren were to be entertained. Such reception of them would in fact be only opening an inlet for their influence. But this is not the point on which the Apostle mainly dwells. It is the κοινωνία which the host in such a case would incur with them and their antichristian designs, by encouraging them. And this is further impressed by the caution against saying χαίρειν to them: which is to be understood not with Clem.-Alex [3] , of the solemn salutation after prayer, “quoniam in oratione quæ fit in domo, postquam ab orando surgitur salutatio gaudii est et pacis indicium,” Adumbrat. in 2 Joan. juxt. fin., p. 1011 P. (not in Migne): nor with Corn.-a-lap., of all intercourse whatever, “omne colloquium, omne consortium, omne commercium cum hæreticis:” but it is a further intensification of the exclusion from the house, and forms a climax, καὶ μὴ = μηδέ : do not even, by wishing him χαίρειν , good speed, and if spoken by a Christian, <em> God</em> speed, identify yourselves with his course and fortunes. If you do, you pronounce approval of his evil deeds, and so far share his guilt, advancing their success by your wishes for it.

<p>This command has been by some laid to the fiery and zealous spirit of St. John, and it has been said that a true Christian spirit of love teaches us otherwise. But as rightly understood, we see that this is not so. Nor are we at liberty to set aside direct ethical injunctions of the Lord’s Apostles in this manner. Varieties of individual character may play on the surface of their writings: but in these solemn commands which come up from the depths, we must recognize the power of that One Spirit of Truth which moved them all as one. It would have been infinitely better for the Church now, if this command had been observed in all ages by her faithful sons).</p>
