<p><strong> 12, 13</strong> .] CONCLUSION. <strong> Having many things to write to you, I would not (communicate them) by means of paper and ink</strong> (“ <strong> ὁ χάρτης</strong> ,” says Lücke, “the Egyptian papyrus, probably the so-called Augustan or Claudian, <strong> τὸ μέλαν</strong> , the ink, commonly made of soot and water thickened with gum, <strong> ὁ κάλαμος</strong> ( 3Jn 1:13 ), the writing-reed, probably split, μεσοσχιδής or μεσότομος , were the N. T. writing materials”), <strong> but I hope to come to you</strong> (reff., and note on Rev 1:9 ) <strong> and to speak mouth to mouth</strong> (so πρόσωπον πρὸς πρόσωπον <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span> . στόμα πρὸς στόμα in Xen. Mem. ii. 6. 32 is not said of conversation), <strong> that your joy may be filled full</strong> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:4">1 John 1:4</span> , viz. by hearing from the mouth of the Apostle himself those messages of life and truth which he forbore writing now; not, as Schlichting and Benson, by his bodily presence: still less as Bart.-Petrus, “Apostolos non omnia voluisse scripto committere quæ ad salutem pertinentia vellent nota esse fidelibus, sed multa sermone solo tradidisse” (see also Corn.-a-lapide h. l.), than which it is hardly possible to imagine a sillier comment: for <em> the first Epistle was written</em> with this very same view, 2Jn 1:4 ). <strong> There greet thee the children of thine elect sister</strong> (these words are variously interpreted according as the κυρία is understood of a lady, or of a church. The non-mention of the κυρία herself here seems, it must be confessed, rather to favour the latter hypothesis). See on the whole, the prolegomena.
