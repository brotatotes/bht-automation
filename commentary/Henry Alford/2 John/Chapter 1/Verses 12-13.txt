 12, 13 .] CONCLUSION.  Having many things to write to you, I would not (communicate them) by means of paper and ink (“  ὁ χάρτης ,” says Lücke, “the Egyptian papyrus, probably the so-called Augustan or Claudian,  τὸ μέλαν , the ink, commonly made of soot and water thickened with gum,  ὁ κάλαμος ( 3Jn 1:13 ), the writing-reed, probably split, μεσοσχιδής or μεσότομος , were the N. T. writing materials”),  but I hope to come to you (reff., and note on Rev 1:9 )  and to speak mouth to mouth (so πρόσωπον πρὸς πρόσωπον 1 Corinthians 13:12 . στόμα πρὸς στόμα in Xen. Mem. ii. 6. 32 is not said of conversation),  that your joy may be filled full (see 1 John 1:4 , viz. by hearing from the mouth of the Apostle himself those messages of life and truth which he forbore writing now; not, as Schlichting and Benson, by his bodily presence: still less as Bart.-Petrus, “Apostolos non omnia voluisse scripto committere quæ ad salutem pertinentia vellent nota esse fidelibus, sed multa sermone solo tradidisse” (see also Corn.-a-lapide h. l.), than which it is hardly possible to imagine a sillier comment: for  the first Epistle was written with this very same view, 2Jn 1:4 ).  There greet thee the children of thine elect sister (these words are variously interpreted according as the κυρία is understood of a lady, or of a church. The non-mention of the κυρία herself here seems, it must be confessed, rather to favour the latter hypothesis). See on the whole, the prolegomena.
