<b> 1.] Symeon</b> (the form as belonging to our Apostle, is found, besides here, only in Acts xv. 14. Its occurrence is at all events a testimony in favour of the independence of the second Epistle. It has not, in order to make the name uniform, been<i> adapted</i> to the first: which, considering that it<i> refers</i> to the first, is a note, however slight, on the side of its genuineness)<b> Peter a servant</b> (Rom. i. 1)<b> and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained</b> (not got for themselves)<b> like precious faith</b> (<i>faith</i>,—i. e. substance of truth believed: faith objective, not subjective,—<i>of equal value:</i> not, which confers equal right to God’s kingdom, equal honour and glory. The A.V. has hit the meaning very happily by<i> like precious</i>. See 1 Pet. ii. 7)<b> with us</b> (apparently, in the first place, the Apostles: but more probably, in a wider sense, the Jewish Christians, with whom the Gentiles had been admitted into the same covenant, and the inheritance of the like precious promises)<b> in the righteousness of our God and [our] Saviour Jesus Christ</b> (first, concerning the words,<b> in the righteousness</b>. Some Commentators take<i> righteousness</i> for an attribute of God, and “<i>in</i>” as instrumental, by the righteousness, goodness, truth, of God: others understand it as the righteousness which God gives us, and Christ won for us, explaining “<i>in</i>” as<i> with</i> or<i> by</i>: but this is objectionable, seeing that righteousness comes by faith, not faith by righteousness. The best explanation seems to me that “<i>righteousness</i>” here betokens the righteous dealing of God, corresponding to His attribute of righteousness, as opposed to<i> respect of persons</i>, and that the words are to be taken in close connexion with the foregoing, “<i>in</i>” being used of the conditional element, in which the<i> obtaining like precious faith</i> is grounded: so that tho sense is, in His righteousness, which makes no difference between the one party and the other, God has given to you the like precious faith, as to us. The objection made to this, that thus the Epistle must be regarded as written to Gentile Christians, is not valid, or proves too much: for at all events there must be two parties in view in the words “<i>like precious</i>…<i>with us,</i>” whatever these parties be. Next, in the words,<b> of our God and [our] Saviour Jesus Christ</b>, I would interpret, as in Titus ii. 13 [where see note]<b> our God</b> of<i> the Father</i>, and<b> [our] Saviour Jesus Christ</b> of<i> the Son</i>. Here, there is the additional consideration in favour of this view, that the Two are distinguished most plainly in the nest verse):
