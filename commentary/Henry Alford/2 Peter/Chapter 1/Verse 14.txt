And the sentence does not mean to say, as commonly understood, that he must<i> soon</i> put off his tabernacle, but that the putting off, whenever it did come, would be sudden and quick. Missing this point, some have imagined that some other special revelation to St. Peter is implied: and such revelations are related in tradition. But even if the adjective be understood to mean ‘<i>soon,’</i> ‘<i>not far off</i>,’ no such inference need be drawn. For it might well be that advancing old age might lead the Apostle to the conclusion that the end prophesied to him could not be far off.
