<p><strong> 14</strong> .] <strong> knowing</strong> (as I do: reason for δίκαιον ἡγοῦμαι above) <strong> that rapid is</strong> (see below. <strong> ἔστιν</strong> , of that which is to be: the normal present) <strong> the putting off</strong> (the two figures, of a tabernacle or tent, and a garment, are intermingled, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span> ff.) <strong> of my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ declared to me</strong> (the allusion is to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:18">John 21:18</span> ff., where a swift and sharp death is announced to St. Peter by our risen Lord. And the sentence does not mean to say, as commonly understood, that he must <em> soon</em> put off his tabernacle, but that the putting off, whenever it did come, would be sudden and quick; so vulg: “certus quod velox est depositio tabernaculi mei” (which can hardly be interpreted with Estius, “id est, brevi futura est”): so Bengel, “ <em> repentina est</em> ; præsens. Qui diu ægrotant, possunt alios adhuc pascere. Crux id Petro non erat permissura. Ideo prius agit quod agendum est.” So Eur. Hippol. 1044, ταχὺς γὰρ ᾅδης ῥᾷστος ἀνδρὶ δυστυχεῖ : Soph. Ajax 833, σὺν ἀσφαδάστῳ καὶ ταχεῖ πηδήματι πλευρὰν διαῤῥήξαντα : Mosch. iii. 26, σεῖο , Βίων , ἔκλαυσε ταχὺν μόρον αὐτὸς Ἀπόλλων . Missing this point, some have imagined that some other special revelation to St. Peter is implied: and such revelations are related by Hegesippus de excid. Hierosol. iii. 2, Ambros. Sermo de bas. trad. Ep. 21 (32), vol. iii., p. 867: see especially Corn.a-Lapide h. l. But even if <strong> ταχινή</strong> be understood ‘ <em> soon</em> ,’ ‘ <em> not far off</em> ,’ no such inference need be drawn. For it might well be that advancing old age might lead the Apostle to the conclusion that the end prophesied to him ὅταν γηράσῃς could not be far off. The Commentators quote Jos. Antt. iv. 8. 2, where Moses says, ἐπεὶ … δεῖ με τοῦ ζῇν ἀπελθεῖν .… δίκαιον ἡγησάμην μηδὲ νῦν ἐγκαταλιπεῖν τὸ ἐμὸν ὑπὲρ τῆς ὑμετέρας εὐδαιμονίας πρόθυμον ).</p>
