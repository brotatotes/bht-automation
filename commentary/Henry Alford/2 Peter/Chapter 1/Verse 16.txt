<b> 16.]</b><b> For</b> (reason for the zeal which he had just predicated of himself)<b> not in pursuance of cunningly-devised fables</b> (such cunningly-devised fables would be the mythologies of the heathen, the cabalistic stories of the Jews; and these may be alluded to, and perhaps also the fables of the Gnostics, which could, it is true, only be in their infancy, but still might be pointed at by St. Peter, as by St. Paul in 1 Tim. i. 4, iv. 7; 2 Tim. iv. 4; Tit. i. 14)<b> did we make known unto you</b> (the writer of this Epistle, says De Wette, wishes to appear to stand in closer relation to his readers, than the writer of 1 Peter: see 1 Pet. i. 12. But why so? May not the same Apostle in one place mean the actual preachers who delivered the Gospel to them; in the other, the Apostles, who were its first witnesses? For observe, that first Epistle is addressed to certain definite churches; this, to all Christians generally. Or, again, why should it be regarded as absolutely impossible that the publication of some one or more of the existing Gospels may have taken place, and may be alluded to in these words?)<b> the power</b> (viz. that conferred on Him by the Father at His glorification, of which the following scene testified, and the actuality of which He himself asserted, when He said, Matt. xxviii. 18,<i> All power is given unto me in heaven and earth:</i> in the strength of which He will come to judge the world)<b> and coming</b> (i. e., as ever, second and glorious coming: not, as Erasmus and many others, His first coming)<b> of our Lord Jesus Christ, but [in virtue of] having been admitted</b> (the participle, as so often, renders the reason,—the enabling cause of the act)<b> eye-witnesses</b> (the word used is a technical term, used of those who were admitted to the highest degree of initiation in the Eleusinian mysteries: and, considering the occasion to which allusion is made, there seems no reason for letting go altogether this reference here: “admitted as initiated spectators.” Still, in English, we have no other way of expressing this than as above, Any attempt to introduce the allusion would overcharge the language. The word “admitted” gives a faint hint of it)<b> of His majesty</b> (viz. on the occasion to be mentioned. The words must not be generalized, to reach to all occasions of such witnessing: but it is obvious that neither must the Transfiguration be regarded as standing altogether alone in such an assertion. It is indeed here that incident which marked, to the Apostle’s mind, most certainly the reality of Christ's future glory: but it was not the only occasion when he had seen the exhibition of divine power by Him as a foretaste of his power at his return to judgment: compare John v. 25–28, with John xi. 40–44).
