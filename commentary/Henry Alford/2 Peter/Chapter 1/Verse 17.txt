<b> 17.] For</b> (justification of the above assertion that we were admitted witnesses of His majesty)<b> having received</b> (the construction is an interrupted one: so in the original)<b> from God the Father honour and glory</b> (honour, in the voice which spoke to him: glory, in the light which shone from Him),<b> when a voice was borne to Him</b> (the occurrence of a similar expression in 1 Pet. i. 13 is to be noticed)<b> of such a</b><b> kind</b> (viz. is stated in what follows: “purporting as follows”)<b> by</b> (uttered by)<b> the sublime glory</b> (the words seem to be a way of designating God Himself. Others understand them of the bright cloud which overshadowed the company: others of the heaven: but the preposition<b> by</b>, in its only admissible meaning [see above], will not suit either interpretation),<b> This is my beloved Son, in whom</b> (literally,<b> on whom</b>)<b> I am well pleased</b> (the words are as in Matt. xvii. 5, where however we have “<i>in</i> whom” for “<b>on</b> whom,” and “<i>hear him</i>” is added. In Mark and Luke the words “<i>in whom I am well pleased</i>” are wanting: and in the critical text of St. Luke is, “<i>my chosen Son.</i>” It is worth notice, that the words are in an independent form here.<b> on whom</b> is what is culled a pregnant construction,— “on whom my pleasure has lighted and abides”).
