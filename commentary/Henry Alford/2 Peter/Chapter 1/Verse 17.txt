<p><strong> 17</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (justification of the above assertion that we were admitted witnesses of His majesty) <strong> having received</strong> (the construction is an interrupted one, and seems rightly explained by Winer, as in reff.: “the construction is broken off by the parenthetical clause φωνῆς .… εὐδόκησα , and the Apostle continues, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:18">2 Peter 1:18</span> , καὶ ταύτην τὴν φωνὴν ἡμεῖς ἠκούσαμεν , instead, as he would have said, ἡμᾶς εἶχε ταύτην τὴν φωνὴν ἀκούσαντας (- οντας ?), or the like.” So that the participle does not want supplying by ἦν or ἐτύγχανε , nor is it put for the finite verb) <strong> from God the Father</strong> (not τοῦ πατρός , or τοῦ π . αὐτοῦ , because θεὸς πατήρ was a term well known: cf. the same in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:3">Galatians 1:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:23">Ephesians 4:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:11">Philippians 2:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:2">2 Timothy 1:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4">Titus 1:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:3">2 John 1:3</span> ; Jud 1:1 ) <strong> honour and glory</strong> (honour, in the voice which spoke to him: glory, in the light which shone from Him), <strong> when a voice was borne to Him</strong> (the occurrence of a similar expression in ref. 1 Pet. is to be noticed. The dative is purely local) <strong> of such a kind</strong> (viz. as is stated in what follows: “purporting as follows”) <strong> by</strong> (uttered by: the ὑπό of agency after a passive verb. As Winer remarks, § 47, all other renderings are arbitrary) <strong> the sublime glory</strong> (the words seem to be a periphrasis of God Himself. In ref. Deut., God is called ὁ μεγαλοπρεπὴς τοῦ στερεώματος . So Gerh., De Wette, Huther. Others understand them of the bright cloud which overshadowed the company: others of the heaven: but ὑπό , in its only admissible meaning (see above), will not suit either interpretation), <strong> This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased</strong> (the words are as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:5">Matthew 17:5</span> , where however we have ἐν ᾧ for εἰς ὅν , and αὐτοῦ ἀκούετε is added. In Mark and Luke the words εἰς ὃν κ . τ . λ . are wanting [and in the critical text of St. Luke. it is ὁ υἱός μου ὁ ἐκλελεγμένος ]. It is worth notice, that the words are in an independent form here. <strong> εἰς ὅν</strong> is a pregnant construction, “on whom my pleasure has lighted and abides.” <strong> εὐδόκησα</strong> , aor., but only to be given in Eng. by the present. If an account is to be given of the aoristic sense, it must be “my pleasure rested from eternity”).</p>
