<b> 18.]</b> Substantiation of the personal testimony above adduced by reference to the fact.<b> And this voice we</b> (Apostles: Peter, James, and John)<b> heard borne from heaven</b> (not, as A. V, ungrammatically, “<i>this voice which came from heaven:</i>” we heard it borne, witnessed its coming, from heaven),<b> being with Him in the holy mount</b> (De Wette is partly right, when he says that this epithet “holy” shews a later view of the fact than that given us in the evangelistic narrative. The epithet would naturally arise when the Gospel history was known, as marking a place where a manifestation of this divine presence and glory had taken place. The place whereon Moses stood is said, in Exodus iii. 5, to be<i> holy ground.</i> So that really all we can infer from it is, that the history was assumed to be already well known: which is one entirely consistent with the probable date of the Epistle: see Introd. It is hardly necessary to refute Grotius’s idea, that Mount Sion is meant, and that the voice referred to is that related in John xii. 28).
