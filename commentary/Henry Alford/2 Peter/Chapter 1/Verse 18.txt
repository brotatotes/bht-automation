<p><strong> 18</strong> .] Substantiation of the personal testimony above adduced by reference to the fact. <strong> And this voice we</strong> (Apostles: Peter, James, and John) <strong> heard borne from heaven</strong> (not, as E. V. ungrammatically, “ <em> this voice which came from heaven</em> ” ( τὴν ἐξ οὐρ . ἐν .): we heard it borne, witnessed its coming, from heaven), <strong> being with Him in the holy mount</strong> (De Wette is partly right, when he says that this epithet “holy” shews a later view of the fact than that given us in the evangelistic narrative: but not right when he designates that later view <em> wunderglaubigere</em> . The epithet would naturally arise when the gospel history was known, as marking a place where a manifestation of this divine presence and glory had taken place. The place whereon Moses stood is said, ref. Exod., to be <em> holy ground</em> . So that really all we can infer from it is, that the history was assumed to be already well known: which is one entirely consistent with the probable date of the Epistle: see Prolegg. It is hardly necessary to refute Grotius’s idea, that Mount Sion is meant, and that the voice referred to is that related in Joh 12:28 ).</p>
