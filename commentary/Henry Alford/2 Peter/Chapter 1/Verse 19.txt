<b> 19.]</b><b> And we have more sure</b> (i. e. hold more surely)<b> the prophetic word</b> (a double explanation is possible: 1) that the comparative alludes to what has gone before as its<i> reason,</i> as if it had been said,<i> Wherefore,</i> or<i> Now,</i> or<i> Henceforth</i> we have, &c.: i.e. ‘on account of this voice from heaven which we heard, we have firmer hold of, or esteem [possess] more sure, the prophetic word, as now having in our own ears begun its fulfilment.’ The great objection to such a view is, the omission of any such connecting particles as those above supplied. It is true the Apostle may have omitted them: but even supposing that, it is further against the view, that if such be the force of the comparative, the thought is not at all followed up in the ensuing verses, We come then to the other possible force of the comparative: 2) that it is used as comparing the prophetic word with something which has been mentioned before, as being firmer, more secure than that other. And if so, what is that other? The most obvious answer is, the voice from heaven: and this is at first sight confirmed by the consideration that one<i> word</i> would thus be compared with another. But then comes in the great difficulty. How could the Apostle designate the written word of God, inspired into and transmitted through men, as something firmer, more secure, than the uttered voice of God Himself? And our reply must be, that only in one sense can this be so, viz. as being of wider and larger reference, embracing not only a single testimony to Christ as that divine voice did, but “<i>the sufferings which were destined for Christ, and the glories that were to follow:</i>” as presenting a broader basis for the Christian’s trust, and not only one fact, however important. This is a modification of Huther’s view, which takes the comparison to be, that the testimony of the Transfiguration presented only the glory of Christ in the days of His flesh, whereas the prophetic word substantiates His future glory also. But this is insufficient, or rather is not strictly correct: for the Apostle clearly does regard the voice at the Transfiguration as a pledge of Christ’s future glory)<b> to which ye do well in paying attention, as to a candle</b> (the figure is taken from the lighting of a candle at night, and the imagery is as in Rom. xiii. 12)<b> shining in a dark place, until day shall dawn</b> (i. e. shall have dawned: the dawn coming in upon and putting an end to the state indicated above),<b> and the morning star shall rise in your hearts</b> (the dawn of the day is accompanied by the rising of the morning star.
