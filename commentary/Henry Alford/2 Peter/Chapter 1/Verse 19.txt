<b> 19.]</b><b> And we have more sure</b> (i. e. hold more surely)<b> the prophetic word</b> (a double explanation is possible: 1) that the comparative alludes to what has gone before as its<i> reason,</i> as if it had been said,<i> Wherefore,</i> or<i> Now,</i> or<i> Henceforth</i> we have, &c.: i.e. ‘on account of this voice from heaven which we heard, we have firmer hold of, or esteem [possess] more sure, the prophetic word, as now having in our own ears begun its fulfilment.’ The great objection to such a view is, the omission of any such connecting particles as those above supplied. It is true the Apostle may have omitted them: but even supposing that, it is further against the view, that if such be the force of the comparative, the thought is not at all followed up in the ensuing verses, We come then to the other possible force of the comparative: 2) that it is used as comparing the prophetic word with something which has been mentioned before, as being firmer, more secure than that other. And if so, what is that other? The most obvious answer is, the voice from heaven: and this is at first sight confirmed by the consideration that one<i> word</i> would thus be compared with another. But then comes in the great difficulty. How could the Apostle designate the written word of God, inspired into and transmitted through men, as something firmer, more secure, than the uttered voice of God Himself? And our reply must be, that only in one sense can this be so, viz. as being of wider and larger reference, embracing not only a single testimony to Christ as that divine voice did, but “<i>the sufferings which were destined for Christ, and the glories that were to follow:</i>” as presenting a broader basis for the Christian’s trust, and not only one fact, however important. This is a modification of Huther’s view, which takes the comparison to be, that the testimony of the Transfiguration presented only the glory of Christ in the days of His flesh, whereas the prophetic word substantiates His future glory also. But this is insufficient, or rather is not strictly correct: for the Apostle clearly does regard the voice at the Transfiguration as a pledge of Christ’s future glory)<b> to which ye do well in paying attention, as to a candle</b> (the figure is taken from the lighting of a candle at night, and the imagery is as in Rom. xiii. 12)<b> shining in a dark place, until day shall dawn</b> (i. e. shall have dawned: the dawn coming in upon and putting an end to the state indicated above),<b> and the morning star shall rise in your hearts</b> (the dawn of the day is accompanied by the rising of the morning star.<br><br> It is not quite clear,<i> what time</i> is here pointed out by the “<i>until&c.</i>” Various meanings have been assigned. Some think that Old Test. times preceded the rising of the day star of the New Test. dispensation. But it is entirely against this view, that the present,<i> whereunto ye do well that ye take heed</i>, makes it necessary, as indeed does the whole context, that the time spoken of, which the “<i>until</i><i>&c.</i>” is to put an end to, should be<i> present</i>. De Wette modifies this last view by saying, that this Old Test. darkness of the pre-Christian time still endures for those who have not yet embraced the Christian faith. But this would make the readers, who are said, ver. 12, to be<i> established in the truth which is present</i>, to be still unconverted to Christianity. Bede, Calvin, &c., understand it of the glorious day which is to come when the Lord shall be manifested. Others, as Grotius, De Wette, Huther, &c., think that some state<i> in the readers themselves</i> is pointed at, which is to supervene upon their present less perfect state: Grotius interpreting it of their attainment of the gift of prophecy: De Wette, of their arriving at full conviction of the certainty of the coming of Christ: Huther, much the same, adding, “The writer distinguishes between two degrees of the Christian life: in the first, faith rests upon outward evidences, in the second, on inward revelations of the Spirit: in the first, each detail is believed separately as such: in the second, each is recognized as a necessary part of the whole. And hence the being in the former is naturally called a walking<i> in a dark place</i>, in the light of a<i> candle</i>, while the being in the latter is a walking in the light of the morning.” And this latter I believe to be nearly the true account. That which refers the words to the time of the Lord’s coming is objectionable, because thus 1) the time of the Christian’s walk here, in which he is said to be light in the Lord, would, not comparatively, but absolutely, be described as a walking in darkness by the slender light of Old Test. prophecy: 2) the morning star arising in<i> men’s hearts</i> is not a description which can apply to the Lord’s coming. So that, whatever apparent analogy there may be with the comparison used in Rom. xiii. 11 ff, the matters treated of seem to be different. At the same time it may well be, that the Apostle should have mingled both ideas together as he wrote the words; seeing that even in our hearts the fulness of the spiritual day will not have arisen, until that time when we see face to face, and know even as God knew us):
