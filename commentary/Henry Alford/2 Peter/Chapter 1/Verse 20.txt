<b> 20.]</b><i> Caution as to interpretation of Old Testament prophecy:</i> to be borne in mind, while taking heed to it.<b> This first knowing</b> (viz. what follows, introduced by “that:”<i> first</i>, as most important in applying yourselves to prophetic interpretation),<b> that no prophecy of Scripture (Scripture</b> most probably here imports the Old Test. only, from the whole cast of the passage)<b> comes of private interpretation</b> (how are these words to be understood? Two references seem to be possible: 1)<i> to us,</i> who try to understand written prophecies: 2)<i> to the prophets themselves</i>, as they spoke them. Of these the former, maintained by the Commentators, seems precluded by the context; the next verse assigning as a reason for the position in this, that the prophets spoke not of themselves, but as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. So we seem driven to the conclusion that the saying regards, not our interpretation of prophecy, but its<i> resolution</i>, of<i> interpretation by the prophets themselves.</i> So several Commentators: and De Wette, adding, that this is said to excuse the difficulty of the interpretation of prophecy, and to remove occasion of unbelief und scotfing [ch. iii. 3]. But as Huther well remarks, this last purpose is not only not indicated in the context, but is quite out of the question; the Apostle referring to prophecy not as difficult of interpretation, but as a candle shining in a dark place, nay, as being even more firm and secure than external proofs of the same truths. I believe Huther’s view to be the true one: which arises from this consideration, that by the word<b> interpretation</b> we are not to understand the subsequent interpretation of a prophecy already given, but the intelligent apprehension of the meaning of the prophecy, out of which [but not<i> private</i> on the part of those by whom it is sent] the prophecy itself springs. So that the sense will be, that prophecy<i> springs not out of human interpretation</i>, i.e. is not a prognostication made by a man knowing what he means when he utters it: but&c. Thus, and thus alone, the whole context coheres).
