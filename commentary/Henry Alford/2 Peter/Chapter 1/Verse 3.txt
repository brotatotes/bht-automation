 3 .]  Seeing that (the connexion with the greeting which precedes must not be broken: it is characteristic of this Epistle, to dilate further when the sense seems to have come to a close. The sense of  ὡς with a gen. absolute is, “assuming that,” “seeing that;” cf. Plato, Alcib. i. p. 10, οὐκοῦν ὡς διανοουμένου σου ταῦτα ἐρωτῶ , ἀφίημί σε διανοεῖσθαι : Xen. Cyr. iii. 1. 9, ἀλλ ʼ ἐρώτα , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , ὅτι βούλει , ὡς τἀληθῆ ἐροῦντος . See Matthiæ, § 568. 2. Winer, § 65. 9. The latter explains the usage thus, “ ὡς with a participle in the gen. absolute construction, gives to the idea of the verb a subjective character, of assumption, or intention”)  His divine (  θεῖος , a word peculiar in N. T., as an adjective, to this Epistle: see reff.)  power hath given (  δεδωρημένης , middle in signification, as perfect passives so often: so προσκέκλημαι αὐτούς , Acts 13:2 ; Acts 16:10 ; Acts 25:12 ; ὃ ἐπήγγελται , Romans 4:21 ; Hebrews 12:26 ; see Winer, § 39. 3)  us all things (  πάντα is prefixed by way of emphasis)  which are (  requisite )  for (reff.)  life and godliness (  εὐσέβεια is a mark of the later apostolic period: reff.),  through (by means of, as the medium of attainment: “Dei cognitio principium est vitæ ( Joh 17:3 ) et primus in pietatem ingressus.” Calv.)  the knowledge (  ἐπι γν . see above)  of Him that called us (i. e. of God, who is ever the Caller in the N. T.: see e. g. 1Pe 2:9 )  by (dat. of the instrument, as in Acts 2:33 ; Acts 5:31 ; Jam 3:7 )  His own glory and virtue ( αἱ ἀρεταί are predicated of God in ref. 1 Pet. However these words be read, whether as in text, or διὰ δόξης κ . ἀρετῆς , both substantives belong to God, not to us: still less must we render, as in E. V., “called us to glory and virtue,” of which meaning there is not a trace in either reading. Bengel seems to give the meaning well, “ad gloriam referuntur attributa Dei naturalia, ad virtutem ea quæ dicuntur moralia: intime unum sunt utraque” Cf. Galatians 1:15 , καλέσας διὰ τῆς χάριτος αὐτοῦ ),
