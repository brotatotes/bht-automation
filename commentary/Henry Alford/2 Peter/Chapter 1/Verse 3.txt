The sense of <strong> ὡς</strong> with a gen. absolute is, “assuming that,” “seeing that;” cf. Plato, Alcib. i. p. 10, οὐκοῦν ὡς διανοουμένου σου ταῦτα ἐρωτῶ , ἀφίημί σε διανοεῖσθαι : Xen. Cyr. iii. 1. 9, ἀλλ ʼ ἐρώτα , ἔφη , ὦ Κῦρε , ὅτι βούλει , ὡς τἀληθῆ ἐροῦντος . See Matthiæ, § 568. 2. Winer, § 65. 9. The latter explains the usage thus, “ ὡς with a participle in the gen. absolute construction, gives to the idea of the verb a subjective character, of assumption, or intention”) <strong> His divine</strong> ( <strong> θεῖος</strong> , a word peculiar in N. T., as an adjective, to this Epistle: see reff.) <strong> power hath given</strong> ( <strong> δεδωρημένης</strong> , middle in signification, as perfect passives so often: so προσκέκλημαι αὐτούς , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:10">Acts 16:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:12">Acts 25:12</span> ; ὃ ἐπήγγελται , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:21">Romans 4:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:26">Hebrews 12:26</span> ; see Winer, § 39. 3) <strong> us all things</strong> ( <strong> πάντα</strong> is prefixed by way of emphasis) <strong> which are</strong> ( <strong> requisite</strong> ) <strong> for</strong> (reff.) <strong> life and godliness</strong> ( <strong> εὐσέβεια</strong> is a mark of the later apostolic period: reff.), <strong> through</strong> (by means of, as the medium of attainment: “Dei cognitio principium est vitæ ( Joh 17:3 ) et primus in pietatem ingressus.” Calv.) <strong> the knowledge</strong> ( <strong> ἐπι</strong> γν . see above) <strong> of Him that called us</strong> (i. e. of God, who is ever the Caller in the N.

However these words be read, whether as in text, or διὰ δόξης κ . ἀρετῆς , both substantives belong to God, not to us: still less must we render, as in E. V., “called us to glory and virtue,” of which meaning there is not a trace in either reading. Bengel seems to give the meaning well, “ad gloriam referuntur attributa Dei naturalia, ad virtutem ea quæ dicuntur moralia: intime unum sunt utraque” Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:15">Galatians 1:15</span> , καλέσας διὰ τῆς χάριτος αὐτοῦ ),</p>
