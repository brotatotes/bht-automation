<p><strong> 5</strong> .] <strong> And on this very account</strong> ( <strong> αὐτὸ τοῦτο</strong> , lit. “ <em> this very thing</em> :” but just as τί , “ <em> what</em> ,” has come to mean “ <em> why?</em> ” “ <em> for what reason?</em> ” so <strong> αὐτό</strong> , or <strong> τοῦτο</strong> , or the strengthened demonstrative produced by the juxtaposition of both, has come to mean, “ <em> wherefore</em> ,” “ <em> for this reason</em> .” See Winer in reff.: and cf. Xen. Anab. i. 9. 21, αὐτὸ τοῦτο οὗπερ αὐτὸς ἕνεκα φίλων ᾤετο δεῖσθαι , … καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπειρᾶτο συνεργὸς τοῖς φίλοις κράτιστος εἶναι , ‘for the very reason, for which he thought that he himself wanted friends.… he also tried to be’ &amp;c.: and Plato, Protag. p. 310 E, αὐτὰ ταῦτα νῦν ἥκω παρά σε . The reason here being, ὡς .… δεδωρημένης κ . τ . λ ., above: so that this forms a sort of apodosis to that sentence. The E. V. ‘ <em> beside this</em> ’ is entirely at fault. Nor can we, as Dietlein, make αὐτὸ τοῦτο the object after ἐπιχορηγήσατε ) <strong> giving on your part</strong> ( <strong> παρεισενέγκαντες</strong> , lit. <em> introducing by the side of</em> ; i. e. besides those precious promises on God’s part, bringing in on your part) <strong> all diligence</strong> (so σπουδὴν εἰσενέγκαι or εἰσενέγκασθαι in Libanius, Josephus, Antt. xx. 9. 2, Diod. Sic. p. 554, in Wetst.), <strong> furnish</strong> (from the original meaning of the verb, to <em> provide expenses for a chorus</em> , it easily gets this of <em> furnishing forth</em> : see reff. And the construction and meaning of the following clauses is not as Horneius and the E. V., “adjicite fidei virtutem &amp;c.,” but the <strong> ἐν</strong> is each time used of that which is assumed to be theirs, and the exhortation is, to take care that, in the exercise of that, the next step is developed: “præsens quisque gradus subsequentem parit et facilem reddit: subsequens priorem temperat ac perficit,” Bengel) <strong> in your faith</strong> (Bengel remarks, “fides, Dei donum: ideo non jubemur subministrare fidem, sed in fide fructus illos, qui septem enumerantur: fide chorum ducente, amore concludente”) <strong> virtue</strong> (best perhaps understood with Bengel as “strenuus animi tonus ac vigor.” Œc. gives it τὰ ἔργα ; but this seems too general: it is indeed that which <em> produces</em> τὰ ἔργα , without which faith is dead: and hence the connexion), <strong> and in your virtue, knowledge</strong> (probably that practical discriminating knowledge, of which it is said <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:17">Ephesians 5:17</span> , μὴ γίνεσθε ἄφρονες , ἀλλὰ συνίετε τί τὸ θέλημα τοῦ κυρίου : “quæ malum a bono secernit, et mali fugam docet,” Beng.: not as Œc., ἡ τῶν τοῦ θεοῦ ἀποκρύφων μυστηρίων εἴδησις ),</p>
