 12 .] Cf. Jude 1:10 . In words this verse is very similar to that, but in meaning quite different: and this fact, so often occurring in the passage, strongly confirms the view of the common matter taken in the Prolegg., [ch. iv. § iii., and specially par. 11, p. 147.] See the separate sense of this verse and of Jude 1:10 , in the notes on each verse.  But (contrast to the angels, just mentioned)  these, as irrational animals, born naturally (thus vulg. rightly, ‘  naturaliter ,’ according to the transposition in the text;  φυσικά being nearly = ψυσικῶς . According to the other reading,  φυσικά is a second epithet to ἄλογα ζῶα , as Œc.: κατ ʼ αἴσθησιν μόνον ζῶντα , οὐ κατὰ νοῦν κ . τὴν νοερὰν ζωήν )  for (with a view to)  capture and destruction (i. e. not to take and to destroy, but to be taken and destroyed. Wetst. quotes from the Rabbinical Bava Mezia, p. 85. 1, “Quidam vitulus, cum ad mactandum adduceretur, R. Judam accessit, caputque in ejus gremium reponens flevit. Sed ille, Abi, inquit, in hunc finem creatus es”),  speaking evil (as they do: the part. includes the ground of their perishing)  in the matter of things which they know not (thus, viz., by ἐν τούτοις , ἃ ἀγνοοῦσι , βλασφ . and not by ταῦτα , ἐν οἷς ἀγνοοῦσιν , βλ ., I prefer to resolve the attraction. We have βλασφημεῖν εἰς as analogous to βλασφ . ἐν : on the other hand ἀγνοεῖν ἐν might be tolerated, as ἀγνοεῖν περί , 1 Corinthians 12:1 ; 1 Thessalonians 4:13 . But the former construction seems better; because, it being almost necessary to suppose οἷς neuter, not masculine, it is not so natural to have a  neut. accus. after βλασφημεῖν , as a neut. dative with ἐν ),  in their corruption (in their practising, and following out, of this corruption to which they have devoted themselves)  shall even perish (shall go on till they perish; not only being found in it, living in it, advancing in it, but going on also to its final issue, viz. eternal perdition).
