Some take them as meaning<i> day by day</i>, which seems unallowable. Some, as A.V., take them for “<i>in the daytime</i>,” as implying absence of all shame; but this would give a very lame and frigid sense, and is inconsistent with what is laid to the charge of these persons, which is not revelling or rioting, but delicate living, which those who practise carry on as much in the daytime as by night, being the habit of their lives. There can be little doubt that the true rendering is as the vulgate has it, and as we have given it,<b> which is but for a day</b>)<b>; spots</b> (but “<i>rocks</i>:” see Jude 12, where see note)<b> and blemishes</b> (disgraces, disfigurements, causing shame),<b> luxuriating in their deceits</b> (i. e. as explained by Huther, in those things or materials of luxury, which they have fraudulently gotten, the abstract for the concrete. But, granting that interpretation as the words stand, there seems to be considerable doubt and difficulty about both reading und meaning, which can hardly be explained to the English reader. I may say that it arises from the confusion, here and in Jude, between<i> agapais</i>, love-feasts, and<i> aputais</i>, deceits. Here, the preponderance of MS. testimony is for the latter of these: in Jude, for the former. But it may be questioned whether<i> agapais</i>, love-feasts, was not the original reading here as well as there. And on this supposition, the meaning will be, that in their love-feasts [see on Jude] they find occasion of luxuriating and delicate living, while feasting with you)<b> while they feast with you</b> (this at all events refers to the love-feasts, whatever be read above. See on Jude)<b>, having eyes full of an adulteress</b> (so literally: meaning that their prurient imagination has ever the forbidden image before it, as if they saw it with their eyes),<b> and that cannot be made to cease from sin</b> (see 1 Pet. iv. 1),<b> laying baits for unstable souls</b> (unfixed, not formed nor established in faith and the feature of piety),<b> having a heart practised in covetousness, children of curse</b> (i. e. as in 2 Thess, ii. 8; John xvii. 12, persons devoted to the curse, accursed. But the A.V., “<i>cursed children</i>,” does not give the meaning, “<i>children</i>” being used in the original simply with reference their origin,<i> the curse</i>),
