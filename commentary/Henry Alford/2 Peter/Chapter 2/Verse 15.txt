<b> 15.]</b> The last clauses, comprising our ver. 14, have no representatives in Jude. Now again the parallelism begins, see Jude 11: but the sentiment is more expanded here.<b> Which have forsaken the right way</b> (see Acts xiii. 10)<b> and are gone astray, following out the way of Balaam</b> (not merely figuratively, the way [of life], but literally, seeing that it was by a<i> journey</i> that Balaam displeased God: compare the frequent repetition of the word in Num. xxii. 23, and the words of the angel in ver. 32 there)<b> [the son] of Bosor</b> (<i>Bosor</i> seems to be a Galilean form, which [Matt. xxvi. 73] St. Peter would naturally use, of Beor, the name of Balaam’s father in Numbers),<b> who loved the wages of unrighteousness</b> (viz. which he vainly thought he might get by disobeying the command of God. See Bp. Butler’s masterly sermon on the character of Balaam, in his well-known volume),<b> but had a rebuke for his own iniquity</b> (what sort of a reproof is shewn below. If any force can be given to the insertion of<i> own</i>, it will be found in the fact that the reproof came from an animal which was part of his own substance: he himself furnished the conviction of his own iniquity, from the animal on which he rode):<b> a dumb beast of burden</b> (this expression is apparently used as synonymous with an<i> ass</i> in Matt. xxi. 5. If so, the universal practice of riding on the ass in Palestine must be regarded as the reason)<b> speaking in man’s voice hindered</b> (not in matter of fact, for Balaam went on his way: but subjectively, was hindering, i.e. tried to hinder: “<i>withstood,</i>” or as A.V. “<i>forbad</i>”)<b> the madness of the prophet</b> (a discrepancy has been discovered between this and the Mosaic account, seeing that it was the angel, and not the ass, from whom the rebuke came, the ass having merely deprecated ill-treatment at Balaam’s hands. But the Apostle evidently regards not so much the words of rebuke uttered, as the miraculous fact, as being the hindrance. It was enough to have prevented his going onward, when the dumb animal on which he rode was gifted with speech to shew him his madness).
