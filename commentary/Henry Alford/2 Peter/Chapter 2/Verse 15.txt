<p><strong> 15</strong> .] The last clauses, from ὀφθαλμούς to τέκνα , have no representatives in Jude. Now again the parallelism begins, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:11">Jude 1:11</span> ; but the sentiment is more expanded here. The construction is altered, and becomes direct and regular, καταλιπόντες … ἐπλανήθησαν . <strong> Which have forsaken the right way</strong> (ref.) <strong> and are gone astray</strong> (the aor. part. and aor. verb are contemporary: and both require, as so often, to be rendered by our English perfect; the English bare past not involving any present consequence, but rather leaving it to be inferred that the state predicated is over now), <strong> following out</strong> (this seems to be all that the ἐξ - implies; see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16">2 Peter 1:16</span> . It is noticeable, that in [17] Jude the expression is ἐξεχύθησαν ) <strong> the way of Balaam</strong> ( <strong> τῇ ὁδῷ</strong> , not merely figuratively, the way (of life), but literally, seeing that it was by a <em> journey</em> that Balaam displeased God: cf. the frequent repetition of the word in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:23">Numbers 22:23</span> , and the words of the angel in ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:32">Numbers 22:32</span> , οὐκ ἀστεία <strong> ἡ ὁδός</strong> σου ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ ) ( <strong> the son</strong> ) <strong> of Bosor</strong> (Grot, supposes Bosor to be a corruption of the name פְּתוֹרָה , “Pethor,” <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:5">Numbers 22:5</span> ; Vitringa, Observ. Sacræ, vol. i. pp. 936 f., maintains rightly that τοῦ βοσόρ rather signifies parentage than habitation, and that βοσόρ is a way of writing בְּעוֹר , Beor, owing to a peculiar pronunciation of the ע , which he traces in the formation of <em> salio</em> from עָלָה , and in the case of other sibilants from aspirates, as <em> sal</em> from ἅλς , <em> septem</em> from ἑπτά , <em> sisto</em> from ἵστημι . And he conjectures that, coupled with an intimation that the Galileans gave a softer sound than others to the ע , this may have been connected with the Galilean dialect which betrayed Peter on a memorable occasion, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:73">Matthew 26:73</span> . So far well: but he goes on also to say, that the Apostle had a mystical reason for choosing this form, in allusion to the temptation which Balaam cast before Israel, because בָּשָׂר signifies <em> flesh</em> , “elegante hoc lusu subinnuens, Bileamum, suadendo voluptatum carnalium exercitium, merito dicendum esse filium βοσόρ , id est, carnis.” It certainly is not beyond possibility that a Hebrew ear may have found such an allusion obvious: but the reference seems here rather to be to Balaam’s attempt to curse Israel, than to his subsequent temptation of them), <strong> who loved the wages of unrighteousness</strong> (viz. Which he vainly thought he might get by disobeying the command of God. See Bp. Butler’s masterly sermon on the character of Balaam, in his well-known volume),
