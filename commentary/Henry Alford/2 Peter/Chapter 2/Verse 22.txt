 22 .]  Further description of their state by two proverbial expressions .  There hath happened to them that of the true proverb (for construction, see reff.: and Lucian, dial. mort. viii. 1, τοῦτο ἐκεῖνο τὸ τῆς παροιμίας , ὁ νεβρὸς τὸν λέοντα ),  The dog gone back (i. e. “  which has gone back :”  ἐπιστρέψας is not a finite verb, but simply a predicate of κύων )  to his own vomit (in ref. Prov. we have ὥσπερ κύων ὅταν ἐπέλθῃ ἐπὶ τὸν ἑαυτοῦ ἔμετον καὶ μισητὸς γένηται , οὕτως ἄφρων τῇ ἑαυτοῦ κακίᾳ ἀναστρέψας ἐπὶ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ἁμαρτίαν . It may seem however somewhat doubtful, whether the proverbs, as here cited, be meant to be taken from Scripture, or rather not both of them from the popular parlance, as here expressed.
	 ἐξέραμα seems hardly to be found elsewhere than here (Schleusner cites Dioscorides vi. 19: adding “et alii,” but qu.?): the verb ἐξεράω occurs in ref., and Aristoph, Vesp. 993, Hippocrates, al. See Lobeck on Phryn. p. 64: and Schleusner in voce):  and, The sow after washing (the middle sense must not be pressed: it is the word commonly used of men, transferred to an animal)  to ( ἐπιστρέψασα is generally understood before  εἰς . But it seems better, with Huther, to understand the proverb as self-contained, and elliptical, as in “Sweets to the sweet”: so, “The washed sow to the mire”)  wallowing in the mire (if we read κύλισμ  α , we must render “the place of wallowing.” In either case, the gen.  βορβόρου imports that which characterizes the wallowing, and is a possessive gen. It is of, belongs to, mire).
