V. “  through ”)  covetousness with feigned speeches (Wetstein quotes Artemid. i. 53, πλάσσειν δοκεῖ … ἀγαθὸν ῥήτορσι … καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ἀπατεῶσι , διὰ τὸ τὰ μὴ ὄντα ὡς ὄντα δεικνύειν τὰς τέχνας ταύτας )  they will make gain of you (“quæstum ex vobis facient, ad quæstum suum vobis abutentur.” Gerh. See ref., and Athenag. xiii. 569, Ἀσπασία ἐνεπορεύετο πλήθη γυναικῶν : Philo in Flacc. § 16, vol. ii. p. 536, ἐνεπορεύετο τὴν λήθην τῶν δικαστῶν (Huther). Pott tries to give the word the classic meaning of  lucrari , ‘to gain over:’ “sectæ suæ conciliare conantur:” and this is borne out by Proverbs 3:14 , LXX, κρεῖσσον αὐτὴν ἐμπορεύεσθαι , ἢ χρυσίου κ . ἀργυρίου θησαυρούς : but the other meaning seems better here.

Rather, with most Commentators, should ἔκπαλαι be taken adverbially with the following verb. The word is found, besides ref., in Arrian, Exp. Alex. i. 9, εἰς λογισμὸν τοῦ ἔκπαλαι : Jos. Antt. xvi. 8. 4, ἔκπαλαι μὲν συνεδρεύων αὐτῷ προσέκειτο : Plut. Aristid. p. 328 E, ἀνὴρ θυμοειδὴς κ . φιλοκίνδυνος , ἔκπαλαι πρὸς τὴν μάχην σπαργῶν . Phrynichus, p. 45, condemns it: ἀπόπαλαι , ἔκπαλαι · ἀμφοῖν δυσχέραινε , ἐκ παλαιοῦ γὰρ χρὴ λέγειν : where see Lobeck’s note)  is not idle (i. e. is working itself out, is living and in action),  and their destruction slumbereth not (i. e. is awake, and ready to seize them: ἀπώλεια being personified: for the verb, see reff.).
