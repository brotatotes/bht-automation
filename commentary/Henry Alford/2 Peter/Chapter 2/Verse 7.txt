This contrast is wanting in Jude, where only the punitive dealings of God are treated) <strong> righteous Lot</strong> ( <strong> δίκαιον</strong> , as repeating the δικαιοσύνη of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span> ; see also again, 2Pe 2:8 ) <strong> distressed</strong> ( <strong> καταπονέω</strong> , properly to <em> wear down</em> or tire out by toil, as τῇ ἐνδείᾳ τῆς τροφῆς τὴν ἀλκὴν τοῦ θηρίου καταπονεῖν , Diod. iii. 37: Ἡρακλῆς ὁ καταπονούμενος τῷ τῆς Δηϊανείρας χιτῶνι , Pol. xl. 7. 3: hence to <em> oppress</em> , as in ref. Acts, or <em> harass beyond bearing</em> as here) <strong> by the behaviour of the lawless</strong> ( <strong> ἄθεσμοι</strong> , “homines nefarii, qui nec jus nec fas curant”) <strong> in licentiousness</strong> ( ἐν ἀσελγ . ἀναστροφή is to be taken together, as ἐν ἀσελγ . ἀναστρέφεσθαι ; ἐν ἀσελγ . denoting the character of the behaviour or manner of life):

The same way of speaking is common among us, when we say that a man “distresses himself” at any occurrence: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+58:5">Isaiah 58:5</span> , “a day for a man to afflict his soul,” ἡμέραν ταπεινοῦν ἄνθρωπον τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ .
