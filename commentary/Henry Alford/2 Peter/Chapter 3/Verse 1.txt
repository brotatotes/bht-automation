<b> 1.] This Epistle now, beloved, a second</b> (so literally)<b> write I unto you: in which Epistles</b> (the A.V. well, “<i>in both which:”</i> viz. this and the first)<b> I stir up your pure mind</b> (the original word signifies that aspect of the spiritual being of man, in which it is turned towards the outer world; his mind for business and other interests, guiding him in action, And this may be said to be<b> pure</b>, when, the will and affection being turned to God, it is not obscured by fleshly and selfish regards: the opposite being “<i>darkened in their mind,</i>” Eph. iv. 18.

It is quite impossible that the common reading can stand,—having absolutely no authority: and difficult, even if it did, to render as the A.V. “<i>of us the Apostles</i>”):<b>—knowing this first</b> (Jude introduces the same prophetic fact with “<i>how that they told you</i>,” ver. 18),<b> that there shall come in the last of the days</b> (see note on Heb. i. 1. It slightly differs from “<i>at the end of the days</i>,” as extending by the plural, the expression, though perhaps not the meaning, over a wider space: see Jude 18)<b> scoffers in [their] scoffing</b> (scoffers making use of scoffing: see Rev. xiv. 2, “<i>harpers harping with their harps:”</i> 2 Sam. xx. 22, “<i>the wise woman in her wisdom went unto all the people.</i>”
