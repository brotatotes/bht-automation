<b> 1.] This Epistle now, beloved, a second</b> (so literally)<b> write I unto you: in which Epistles</b> (the A.V. well, “<i>in both which:”</i> viz. this and the first)<b> I stir up your pure mind</b> (the original word signifies that aspect of the spiritual being of man, in which it is turned towards the outer world; his mind for business and other interests, guiding him in action, And this may be said to be<b> pure</b>, when, the will and affection being turned to God, it is not obscured by fleshly and selfish regards: the opposite being “<i>darkened in their mind,</i>” Eph. iv. 18. It seems impossible to reproduce in English these distinctions; we can only give them a general rendering, and leave all besides for explanatory notes)<b> in reminding</b> (see the same expression, ch i. 13);<b> that ye should remember the words spoken before by the holy prophets</b> (i. e. the Old Test. prophets, as referred to above, ch. i. 19 ff.),<b> and the commandment of the Lord and Saviour given by your apostles</b> ( “<i>your</i> Apostles” as we call St. Paul<i> the Apostle of the Gentiles</i>. It is quite impossible that the common reading can stand,—having absolutely no authority: and difficult, even if it did, to render as the A.V. “<i>of us the Apostles</i>”):<b>—knowing this first</b> (Jude introduces the same prophetic fact with “<i>how that they told you</i>,” ver. 18),<b> that there shall come in the last of the days</b> (see note on Heb. i. 1. It slightly differs from “<i>at the end of the days</i>,” as extending by the plural, the expression, though perhaps not the meaning, over a wider space: see Jude 18)<b> scoffers in [their] scoffing</b> (scoffers making use of scoffing: see Rev. xiv. 2, “<i>harpers harping with their harps:”</i> 2 Sam. xx. 22, “<i>the wise woman in her wisdom went unto all the people.</i>”<br><br> On the sense, see Jude 18),<b> walking according to their own lusts</b> (so Jude 11 and 16, here combined),<b> and saying, Where is the promise of his coming</b> (implying that it is nowhere, has passed and disappeared:<b> His</b>, viz. of Christ: whose name would be understood as of course)<b>?</b><b> for from the day when the fathers fell asleep, all things continue thus from the beginning of creation</b> (we cannot after<b> thus</b> supply “as they were,” as A.V.:<b> thus</b> simply referring to the present; as they are, as we now see them: and the words “<i>from the beginning of the creation</i>,” belonging only to the verb continue. This being so, we still have two predicatory clauses belonging to the verb: “<i>since the fathers fell asleep</i>,” and “<i>from the beginning of the creation</i>.” The way of explaining this must be, that the time of waiting for the promise necessarily dates from the death of the fathers, and the duration of things continuing as they are now extends back beyond the death of the fathers: so that the meaning will be, ever since the death of those to whom the promise was made, things have continued as we now see them [and as they have ever continued even before those fathers] from the beginning of creation. So that “<i>all things continue from the beginning of creation</i>,” is a general proposition applicable to all time: “<i>since the fathers fell asleep</i>,” the terminus, from which this general proposition is taken up and applied to the case in hand. And now we have cleared the way to enquiring, who are meant by<b> the fathers</b>. And the answer is plain: largely and generally, those to whom the promise was made: the same as are indicated Rom. ix. 5, “<i>of whom are</i><b> the fathers:</b>” yet not exclusively these, but simultaneously with them any others who may be in the same category,—e. g. those who bear to the New Test. church the same relation as they to that of the Old Test. The assertion, as coming from the<i> scoffers</i>, must not he pressed to any particular date, but given that wide reference which would naturally be in the mind of one making such a general charge).
