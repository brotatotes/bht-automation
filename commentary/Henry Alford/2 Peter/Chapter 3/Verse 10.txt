It is more than merely “shall come,” though no one word will give the exact force in English: “shall be here,” “shall be upon you”)<b> as a thief</b> (1 Thess. v. 2: from which place probably the expression is taken, as reference is made below to the Epistles of St. Paul);<b> in which the heavens shall pass away</b> (Matt. v. 18, xxiv. 34, 35; and Rev. xxi. 1)<b> with a rushing noise</b> (the word imports the rush of a bird, or of an arrow, or of any thing rapidly moving.
