<b> 11.]</b><b> These things being thus to be dissolved</b> (i. e., this heaven and earth which surround us. According to the reading in the text, there is no particle of inference: but the inference is all the more vivid<br><br><b> thus:</b> viz. in the manner just described. The original<i> may</i> mean,<i> being in course of dissolution:</i> but the other rendering is more probable),<b> what manner of men</b> (not interrogative, but exclamatory)<b> ought ye to be</b> (when the event comes: the verb here rendered<b> be</b> seems to imply some fact supervening upon the previously existing state,<b> in holy behaviours and pieties</b> (so literally; the plurals marking the holy behaviour and piety in all its different forms and examples)<b> looking for and hastening</b> (the older Commentators mostly supplied “<i>unto</i>” after<b> hastening</b>. So the A.V.; but there seems no reason for this. The meaning is most probably transitive, to: “<i>hasten</i>,” “<i>urge on:</i>” which T agree with De Wette in adopting, and in understanding as he does, “They hasten it by perfecting, in repentance and holiness, the work of the Gospel, and thus diminishing the need of the ‘<i>long-suffering</i>’ ver. 9,” to which the delay of that day is owing. Huther’s objection to this is not difficult to answer. It is true, that the delay or hastening of that day is not man’s matter but God's: but it is not uncommon Scripture to attribute to<i> us</i> those divine acts, or abstinences from acting, which are really and in their depth, God’s own. Thus we read, that “He could not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief,” Matt. xiii, 58, compared with Mark vi. 5, 6: thus repeatedly of man’s striving with, hindering, quenching, God's Holy Spirit)<b> the advent</b> (elsewhere commonly used of person, and most usually of the presence or advent of the Lord Himself)<b> of the day of God</b> (the same as “<i>the day of the Lord</i>” above),<b> by reason of which</b> (viz. which<i> day</i>; or, but not so well, which<i> coming</i>, on account of, for the sake of, which)<b> the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the heavenly bodies being scorched up are to be melted</b> (in the original, present, importing destiny: see above on ver. 11. De Wette thinks the meaning is not to be literally pressed, as if the<i> heavenly bodies</i> were a solid mass which would actually liquefy: but why not? The same liquefaction has actually taken place in the crust of the earth wherever the central fires have acted on it. All our igneous rocks have been in a liquid state: why should not that day, in its purifying process, produce a similar effect on the earth again, and on her cognate planets, if they are to be included?<br><br> In this recapitulation, the Apostle mentions that part only of the destruction of that day which concerns the<i> heavens:</i> arguing from the greater to the less. The similarity to Isa. xxxiv. 4 can hardly escape notice, “<i>All the host of heaven shall be dissolved</i>.” See also Micah i. 4).
