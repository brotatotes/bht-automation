<p><strong> 14</strong> .] <em> Exhortation founded on this expectation</em> . <strong> Wherefore, beloved, expecting</strong> (as ye do) <strong> these things</strong> (the pres. part. gives the reason of the verb following: and does not, as Huther and Dietlein, belong to the exhortation, προσδοκῶντες σπουδάσατε : for the Apostle has just assumed προσδοκῶμεν as a patent fact), <strong> be earnest</strong> ( <strong> σπουδάσατε</strong> , aor.: not the daily habit so much, as the one great life-effort which shall accomplish the end, is in the Apostle’s mind) <strong> to be found</strong> (at His coming. This word shews plainly enough that a personal coming of the Lord, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:4">2 Peter 3:4</span> , is in the view of the Apostle throughout, as connected with the proceedings of the great Day.
