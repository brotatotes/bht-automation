This word shews plainly enough that a personal coming of the Lord, as in ver. 4, is in the view of the Apostle throughout, as connected with the proceedings of the great Day. The form of expression reminds us forcibly of Matt. xxii. 11ff.)<b> spotless and blameless</b> (compare 2 Cor. vi. 3, viii. 20; also the contrast, above, ch. ii. 13. From the connexion there with a feast, it seems very probable that in both passages the parable of the wedding garment was floating before the Apostle’s mind)<b> in His sight</b> (so, and not, “<i>by Him</i>,” or “<i>of Him</i>,” as A.V., must we render)<b> in peace</b> (second predicate after the verb<b> to be found:</b> the<i> spotlessness</i> and<i> blamelessness</i> were with reference to God; this, in reference to your own state and lot: in peace<i> among</i> yourselves, in peace<i> with</i> yourselves, in peace<i> for</i> yourselves, with God. But perhaps an expression so familiar to the Eastern tongue as “<i>in peace,</i>” may have an onward as well as a present meaning, as in “<i>go in peace:</i>” and be taken of that eternal peace, of which all earthly peace is but a feeble foretaste):<b> and account the long-suffering of our Lord</b> (<b>our Lord,</b> thus expressed, is hardly to be dissevered from Him who is expressly thus named below, ver. 18. And if so, then, throughout this weighty passage, the Lord Jesus is invested with the full attributes of Deity. It is He who waits and is long-suffering: He, in His union and coequality with the Father, who ruleth all things after the counsel of His own will)<b> salvation</b> (contrast to those who count His delay to be<i> slackness</i>, ver. 9):<b> even as also</b> (besides myself)<b> our beloved brother</b> (this term is probably used in a closer sense than as merely signifying fellow-Christian: our beloved fellow-Apostle)<b> Paul according to the wisdom given to him</b> (see 1 Cor. iii. 10. Also Gal. ii. 9; Eph. iii. 2, 7, 8; Col. i. 25)<b> wrote to you</b> (What? Where? to whom? By some the reply to the first has been found in the preceding clause, “<i>that the long-suffering</i><i> of our Lord is salvation:</i>” which, in sense, is almost identical with Rom. ii. 4, “<i>the goodness of God leadeth thee fo repentance.</i>” But surely the reference is too narrow to satisfy what follows here,<i> speaking in them concerning</i><b> these things,</b> where the reference must be to<i> the things</i>, which we Christians<i> look for</i>, viz., to the coming of the day of the Lord. Thus then we should interpret the particular reference to be to some particular passage im which St. Paul had exhorted to readiness in expectation of that day, and the more general reference, ver. 16, of the frequent mention of that day in his other Epistles. In searching then 2) for some passage which may fulfil the above condition, it seems to me that we need not go beyond the earliest Epistle of St. Paul, viz. 1 Thessalonians. There, in ch. iv. 13—v. 11, we have a passage on this very point, and the more satisfactory, because St. Peter seems, in our ver. 10, to have had 1 Thess. v. 2 before his mind, And as to 3) the expression<b> to you</b>, there seems no need to press it as identifying any particular church, seeing that this our Epistle is addressed to all Christians alike: see ch. i. 1. AH that follows from this<b> to you</b> is what may also be gathered from ver. 16, that our Epistle belongs to a date when the Pauline Epistles were no longer the property only of the churches to which they were written, but were dispersed through, and considered to belong to, the whole Christian Church. What date that is, I have discussed in the Introduction. There have been very various opinions as to the passage and Epistle meant: some think it to be the Epistle to the Hebrews, on account of ch. ix. 26 ff., x. 25, 37 (see on these in the Introd. to the Hebrews,§i. par. 6): others, the Epistles to the Corinthians, especially 1 Cor. i. 7–9, finding an allusion to 1 Cor. ii. 1 ff. in the words “<i>according to the wisdom given to him:</i>” others, the Epistles to the Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, being addressed to Asia Minor churches, as they hold this to be: others, referring the words “<i>in peace</i>” to the difference between Paul and Peter, the Epistle to the Galatians: others, some Epistle which has not come down to us);<b> as also in all</b> (<i>his</i>, but not expressed: in<i> all Epistles which he writes</i>, leaving room for the possibility that the number of those Epistles was not complete, but still being added to)<b> Epistles, speaking in them</b> (as he does)<b> of these things</b> (viz. the coming of our Lord, and the end of the world),<b> in which</b> (Epistles, if the feminine relative be read: if the masculine [or neuter], “<i>in which sayings of his:</i>” not, “in which things,” “in which subjects,” as some have rendered by of escape from the supposed difficulty: for the pronoun is correlative with<i> the other scriptures</i>, and must therefore designate some writings previously mentioned: or else the sentence is stultified)<b> are some things difficult to understand</b> (De Wette especially refers to 2 Thess. ii. 1 ff.: and it is not improbable that this may have been particularly in the Apostles mind. See note on 2 Tim. ii. 18),<b> which the ignorant</b> (unintelligent, uninformed: this want of intelligence may arise from many causes: but the misunderstanding of difficult Scriptures is common to the unintelligent in general)<b> and unstable</b> (those who, wanting firm foundation and anchorage, waver and drift about with every wind of doctrine. Such persons are stirred from their Christian stability by every apparent difficulty are rendered anxious and perplexed by hard texts: and showing more anxiety to interpret them somehow, than to wait upon God for their solution, rush upon erroneous and dangerous ways of interpretation)<b> distort</b> (the verb means, properly, to twist with a handscrew or windlass. Hence to torment with the<i> screw</i>: and then figuratively, to distort, pervert, strain, in meaning)<b> as also the other Scriptures</b> (or, the other passages of Scripture having reference to this great subject. Whichever be understood, it is plain 1) that by these words St. Paul’s Epistles are reckoned among the Christian Scriptures: 2) that, there were at this time besides those Epistles, other writings holding a similar place, known as “<i>scriptures;</i>” probably, at least, the three Gospels [and Acts?], and some of the earlier written catholic Epistles. That by<b> the other Scriptures</b> should be meant the Old Test.
