The common rendering, “ <em> in grace and in the knowledge of</em> …” would more naturally be ἐν χάριτι καὶ ἐν γνώσει . Taken as above, the genitive stands in somewhat different relation to the two datives.

Bengel takes it to mean “dies sine nocte, merus et perpetuus:” and so Calov.: but this idea does not seem so congruous here, as that of mere duration. Grot., Beza take ἡμέρα for <em> time</em> . But considering how frequent ἡμέρα has been in this chapter, we have no right to seek for an unusual meaning, when the common one suits so well). [ <strong> Amen</strong> (cf. Jud 1:25 ).]</p>
