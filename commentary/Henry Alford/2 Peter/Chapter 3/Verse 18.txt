As regards χάριτι , it is a subjective gen., the grace of which Christ is the author and bestower; of which it is said, ἡ χάρις διὰ Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ ἐγένετο : as regards γνῶσις , it is an objective genitive, the knowledge of which Christ is the object).

Bengel takes it to mean “dies sine nocte, merus et perpetuus:” and so Calov.: but this idea does not seem so congruous here, as that of mere duration. Grot., Beza take ἡμέρα for  time . But considering how frequent ἡμέρα has been in this chapter, we have no right to seek for an unusual meaning, when the common one suits so well). [  Amen (cf. Jud 1:25 ).]
