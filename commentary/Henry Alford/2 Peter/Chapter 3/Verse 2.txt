T. prophets, as referred to above ch. 2 Peter 1:19 ff. The vulg. has curiously misrendered: “  eorum quæ prædixi verborum a sanctis prophetis ”),  and the commandment of the Lord and Saviour given by your apostles (as commonly taken, this sentence is made to contain a violent inversion, τοῦ κυρ . κ . σωτ . being taken out of its place after ἐντολῆς and attached to τῶν ἀποστόλ . ὑμῶν . Any how, the construction is harsh, the double gen. being unavoidable: but it is surely much better to take ἐντολῆς in its most obvious connexion, and make τῶν ἀποστόλων ὑμῶν the second genitive the command originating in our Lord, and given you by the Apostles who preached to you: τῶν ἀπ .  ὑμῶν meaning “  your Apostles” as we call St. Paul ἀπόστολον ἐθνῶν . It is quite impossible that  ἡ μῶν can stand: and difficult, even if it did, to render as E.

When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
