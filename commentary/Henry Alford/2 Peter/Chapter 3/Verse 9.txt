 9 .]  The Lord (i. e. God, the Father, as so often in this and in the first Epistle)  is not tardy (  βραδύνειν , not merely to  delay , but to  be late , beyond an appointed time; so Gerh.: “discrimen est inter tardare et differre: is demum tardat, qui ultra debitum tempus quod agendum est differt”)  concerning his promise (so, connecting the gen. with the verb, and not with ὁ κύριος , must the words be taken. The gen. is one of partition, as in ὑστερεῖν τινος , 2 Corinthians 11:5 ; 2 Corinthians 12:11 , παύεσθαί τινος , 1 Peter 4:1 , &c., the being late implying a falling short)  as some (viz. the scoffers in question, who are pointed at)  account (His conduct)  tardiness (better thus, making  βραδυτῆτα predicate, than to render  νομίζουσιν “think concerning,” “define,” “explain,” and make βραδυτῆτα object only):  but He is long-suffering towards you (  μακροθυμεῖν with  εἰς here only: with ἐπί , Matthew 18:26 ; Matthew 18:29 ; Luke 18:7 ; James 5:7 ; with πρός , 1 Thessalonians 5:14 :  ὑμᾶς , the readers of the Epistle; not as a separate class, but as representing all, cf. πάντας below),  not willing that any should perish, but (willing)  that all should go forward (reff.)  to repentance (Calvin is quite wrong in his rendering, “omnes ad pœnitentiam recipere:” equally wrong, in his alternatives, “aut colligi, vel aggregari.” Plutarch has the very expression, De flum. p. 19 (Wetst.), ὀλίγον δὲ σωφρονήσας , καὶ εἰς μετάνοιαν ἐπὶ τοῖς πραχθεῖσι χωρήσας ).
