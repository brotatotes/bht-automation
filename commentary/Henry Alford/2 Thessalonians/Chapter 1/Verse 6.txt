<p>Calvin says, ‘repetit in die illa … ideo autem repetit, ut fidelium vota cohibeat, ne ultra modum festinent.’ I should rather say, to give more fixity and definiteness to the foregoing). We may observe, as against Jowett’s view of the arguments here being merely “they suffer now; therefore their enemies will suffer hereafter: their enemies will suffer hereafter; therefore they will be comforted hereafter,” that the arguments are nothing of the kind, resting entirely on the word δίκαιον , bringing in as it does all the relations of the Christian covenant, of them to God, and God to them, and by contrast, of God to their enemies and persecutors.</p>
