We may observe, as against Jowett’s view of the arguments here being merely “they suffer now; therefore their enemies will suffer hereafter: their enemies will suffer hereafter; therefore they will be comforted hereafter,”—that the arguments are nothing of the kind, resting entirely on the assertion that it is a<b> righteous thing</b>: thus bringing in all the relations of the Christian covenant, of them to God, and God to them,—and by contrast, of God to their enemies and persecutors.
