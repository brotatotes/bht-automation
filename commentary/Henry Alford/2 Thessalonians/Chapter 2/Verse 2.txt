<b> 2.</b>] [<b>in order</b>]<b> that</b> (aim of the request)<b> ye should not be soon</b> (<b>lightly</b>, and with small reason)<b> shaken</b> (properly of the waves agitated by a storm)<b> from your mind</b> (your mental apprehension of the subject:—not ‘your former more correct sentiment,’ as some interpret it),<b> nor yet be troubled, neither by spirit</b> (by means of spiritual gift of prophecy or the like, assumed to substantiate such a view),<b> nor by word</b> (<i>of mouth</i>: belongs closely to “<i>nor by letter</i>” following, as is shewn by ver. 15, where they again appear together)<b> nor by letter, as by</b> (agency of)<b> us</b> (pretending to be from us. Let no pretended saying, no pretended epistle of mine, shake you in this matter. That there were such, is shewn by this parallel position of the clauses with by spirit, which last agency certainly was among them. Sayings, and an epistle, to this effect, were ascribed to the Apostle. So Chrysostom: “He seems to me here to hint, that some were going about with a forged Epistle pretending to be from Paul, and that shewing this they affirmed the day of the Lord to be already come, that they might deceive many.”—However improbable this may seem, our expression would seem hardly to bear legitimately any other meaning. Compare also ch. iii. 17, and note. It is impossible to understand the “<i>Epistle as by us</i>” of the first Epistle,<i> wrongly understood</i>, which certainly would have been more plainly expressed, and the Epistle would have been not, as here,<i> disowned</i>, but<i> explained</i>),<b> to the effect that</b> ( ‘<i>as if</i>,’ or ‘<i>as that</i>’)<b> the day of the Lord is present</b> (not, ‘<i>is at hand</i>:’ the verb here used occurs six times besides in the New Test., and always in the sense of<i> being present</i>; in two of those places, Rom. viii. 38, 1 Cor. iii. 22,<i> the things present</i> are distinguished expressly from<i> the things to come</i>. Besides which, we may without presumption say, St. Paul could not have so written, nor could the Spirit have so spoken by him. The teaching of the Apostles was, and of the Holy Spirit in all ages has been, that the day of the Lord<i> is at hand</i>. But these Thessalonians imagined it to be already come, and accordingly were deserting their pursuits in life, and falling into other irregularities, as if the day of grace were closed. So Chrysostom plainly, “The devil, when he could not persuade them that the announcements of things future were false, took another way, and having suborned certain pestilent fellows, endeavoured to deceive by persuading them that those great and glorious events had an end, At one time they said that the resurrection was already past: but in this case they said that the judgment was come, and the presence of Christ, &c., thus removing fear of retribution for the evil, and hope of reward for the good. And what was worst of all, some of them repeated sayings of Paul to this effect, some feigned Epistles as having been written by him”).
