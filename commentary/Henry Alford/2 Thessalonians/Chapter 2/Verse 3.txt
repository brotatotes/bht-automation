<b> 3.</b>]<b> Let no man deceive you in any manner</b> (not only in either of the foregoing, but in any whatever):<b> for</b> (<b>that day shall not come</b>) (so A.V. supplies, rightly. There does not seem to have been any intention on the part of the Apostle to fill up the ellipsis: it supplies itself in the reader’s mind),<b> unless there have come the apostasy</b><b> first</b> (of which he had told them when present, see ver. 5: and probably with a further reference still to our Lord’s prophecy in Matt. xxiv. 10–12),<b> and there have been revealed</b> (ch. i. 7. As Christ in His time, so Antichrist in his time, is<i> ‘revealed’</i>—brought out into light: he too is a<i> mystery</i> to be unfolded and displayed: see vv. 8, 9)<b> the Man of Sin</b> (in whom sin ig as it were personified, as righteousness in Christ. The genitive,<b> of sin</b>, is called by Ellicott that of the<i> predominating quality</i>. Notice the variety,—<b>of lawlessness</b>, which is the term used below, vv. 7, 8),<b> the son of perdition</b> (see John xvii. 12, where our Lord uses the expression of Judas. It seems merely to refer to Antichrist himself, whose essence and inheritance is<i> perdition</i>,—not to his influence over others);<b> he that withstandeth</b> (the expression is absolute, ‘<i>he that withstands</i> CHRIST,’ the<b> anti</b>-christ, 1 John ii. 18),<b> and exalteth himself above</b> (in a hostile sense)<b> every one that is called God</b> (compare a similar expression, 1 Cor. viii. 5. “The expression includes the<i> true</i> God, as well as the false ones of the heathen—but<b> that is called</b> is a natural addition from Christian caution, as ‘<i>every God</i>’ would have been a senseless and indeed blasphemous expression for a Christian.” Lünemann),<b> or an object of adoration</b> (compare the close parallel in Dan. xi. 36, 37. Notice, that the meaning of these words cannot by any probability be fulfilled by any one who, as the Pope, creates objects of worship, and thus (by inference merely) makes himself greater than the objects which he creates: but it is required that this Antichrist should<i> set</i> HIMSELF<i> up as an object of worship</i>, above, and as superior to, “every one that is called God or worshipped”);<b> so that he sits in</b> (enters into, sets himself down in, and remains in)<b> the temple of God</b> (this, say some Commentators, cannot be any other than<i> the temple at Jerusalem</i>: on account of the definiteness of the expression,<b> sits in the temple of God</b>. But there is no force in this.<i> The temple of God</i> is used metaphorically by St. Paul in 1 Cor. iii. 17: and why not here? see also 1 Cor. vi. 16; Eph. ii. 21. From these passages it is plain that such figurative sense was familiar to the Apostle. And if so, the<i> sitting</i> makes no difficulty. Its figurative sense, as holding a place of power, sitting as judge or ruler, is more frequent still: see in St. Paul, 1 Cor. vi. 4: and Matt. xxiii. 2: Rev. xx. 4: to which indeed we might add the many places where our Lord is said to<i> sit</i> on the right hand of God, e.g. Heb. i. 3; viii. 1; x. 12; xii. 2; Rev. iii. 21. Respecting the<i> interpretation</i>, see Introduction,§v.),<b> shewing himself</b> (not merely attempting to shew himself, but the words import that it is his<i> habit</i> and<i> office</i> to exhibit himself as God)<b> that he is God</b> (not ‘<i>a</i> god,’ but the word designates the divine dignity which he predicates of himself. The emphasis is on IS—<i>shewing himself that he</i> IS<i> God</i>).
