 7 .]  For (explanation of last verse) the MYSTERY (as opposed to the ἀποκάλυψις of the man of sin) ALREADY (as opposed to ἐν τῷ ἑαυτοῦ καιρῷ above)  is working (not ‘  is being wrought ,’ passive, as Est., Grot., all. I retain the inversion of the words, to mark better the primary and secondary emphasis: see below)  of lawlessness (i.e. ungodliness refusal to recognize God’s law see reff.
	The genitive is one of apposition: the  ἀνομία is that wherein the μυστήριον consists: not a genitive of the working cause, as Thdrt. ( ὡς κεκρυμμένην ἔχοντας τῆς ἀνομίας τὴν πάγην ), nor must we understand by the words, Antichrist himself, as Olsh., comparing τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας μυστήριον , 1 Timothy 3:16 , not  the unexampled depths of ungodliness , as Krebs, al., from Joseph.

Cyr. v. 2. 26.
	Various erroneous arrangements and renderings of this sentence have been current: of which the principal have arisen from fancying that the participle  κατέχων requires some verb to be supplied after it. So Vulg. (‘tantum ut qui tenet nunc, teneat, donec de medio fiat:’ so Syr., Erasm., Est., all.), and E. V. (‘only he who now letteth, will let,’ so Beza, Whitby, al.), κατέχει (so Bengel, Pelt, al.): ἐστίν (so Knatchb., Burton, al.)):
